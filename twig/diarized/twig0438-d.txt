Transcript:  It's time for Twink! This week in Google, Jeff Jarvis is here visiting from his folks' house in Florida, where it's snowing, apparently.  And from Yorkshire, England, where it's not snowing, apparently.  Kevin Marks joins us as we talk about the latest from Google, and of course all around the world.  This week in Google is next.  This is Twink!  Bandwidth for This Week in Google is provided by Cashfly.  This is Twink! This Week in Google, Episode 438, recorded Wednesday, January 3rd, 2018.  Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz.  It's time for Twink! This week in Google, the show where we cover the latest news from the internet, with Mr. Jeffrey Jarvis.  He is in Florida visiting family for this brand new year. Hello, Jeff.  Hello there, how are you?  President, pre-professor.  Welcome back.  I was going to call you the president of journalism, but he's the professor of journalism, and maybe the president of journalism, buzzmachine.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm hoping to make the president's, you know, worst in journalism awards next Monday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He announced he's going to do awards for the best fake news.  He is a TV star. He's a reality TV star.  He likes giving himself awards.  Hey, look who's over here on my right. Mr. Kevin Marks, visiting us from the UK, indyweb.org.  Hi, Kevin. Last time you were on the show, we kept you up way past your bedtime. I won't do that this time.  Thanks very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I bet I'm still fairly late, to be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it snowy? You're in Yorkshire. Is it snowy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It has been, but not at the moment. We had a lot of snow just before Christmas, but it's been raining since.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ironically, there's snow in Florida, not where Jeff is, but in some of Florida, and no snow in Yorkshire.  And you say there's global warming. I kid you not. This is crazy cold.  A cyclone bomb is about to hit the New England region.  Just as I fly into it tomorrow.  Oh no, you're going home tomorrow?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I hope so.  This is the global warming thing. It's the disruption of the polar vortex.  That's why you're getting these huge waves of cold running down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, Kevin Marks, don't give us your British logic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All of this stupid science. Come on, knock it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The polar vortex normally keeps the cold at the pole.  Because it's warmed up a bit, it's sort of leaking out again because the vortex isn't as strong.  That's why the East Coast is frozen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're getting a polar vortex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The scary one for us is the Atlantic conveyor.  That's the thing that means that Europe is actually warmer than America, despite being north of it.  And when that breaks down, it gets really cold here. That happened two or three years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Would you like to see Google's smiles of 2017?  Should we start with the smiles of 2017?  Google's tribute to selfies.  A photo collage.  Where can I find this? Oh, is it not doing it?  Oh, do you do it of your own?  Oh, so I have to go to my photos and see if it's done it for me.  I see. Do I have smiles? No.  Oh, it would be in the assistant though.  Yeah, I haven't seen this.  No, no, I'm sad to say there's no smiles.  Why haven't he?  He doesn't look like he's smiling.  That's the grump of the year.  Did anybody else get one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I haven't got a smile. I'm looking at my assistant.  I just got like lots of pictures of me walking the dogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You'll get one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My son ice skating in 2010.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I like those flashbacks. Those are fun.  I want to remember all the whiteboards of the year.  Yeah, right. All the whiteboards you took pictures of. God.  What you won't be getting any of is the Pixel C.  It is no longer in the Google Store.  I didn't believe it. It's two years old. I know you love this tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do. I've been using my Pixelbook instead.  But I have right next to me a Pixel C, which was one of my three backups for getting on the show today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you're on a Mac. Sad to say you're on your son's Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I know. My son's Mac and he's out of the movie. Otherwise, I wouldn't be on it.  And I actually have a backup Pixel C. I was given one at some point and I got a spare keyboard for it.  So I'm set for another year or two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the question, I guess, you know, when you see this as well, maybe they're dropping it because they have something to replace it with.  There was always the rumor that the Pixel C was not designed to run Android or was designed to run some strange hybrid of Android or maybe Google Chrome OS.  But none of that was to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and now with Fuchsia coming to the Pixelbook, who knows what Google's OS plans are?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's hard to say what Fuchsia is. No one knows. No one knows.  Targeted devices are the Acer Switch Alpha 12 and the Intel NUC, according to the Fuchsia documentation.  Do you have a Pixelbook or no? I do. I like my Pixelbook. So you could you could install Fuchsia.  OK, I guess I will. Yeah, I guess you're going to have to now. Yeah.  I don't even know what I don't even know what Fuchsia does. I know. I don't think anybody does.  So you have to put your device into developer mode. That's not surprising.  Then you boot into Chrome OS at the welcome screen. Press Ctrl Alt refresh F3 to enter a command shell.  Enter Kronos as the user with a blank password. This is all normal.  Ah, you have to re-enable USB boot. OK, I've done all this. To install Linux in a Chromebook, you do all this.  Right. And then I guess you have you've put you've somewhere got Fuchsia and you've put it on a USB key so you can install it.  All right. I promise you by next week I will do it. All right.  We'll see what it does. I assume there's no applications for it, I would assume.  I don't even. It's it's it's got a lot of language support, it looks like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When I see me, it'll have a build of Chrome. That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Code of conduct. How do I get started individual?  Zircon is the microkernel underlying Fuchsia. Here's the Fuchsia book, but this is all for developers.  Fuchsia is not Linux, it says. OK.  OK, it's running on a not a Linux kernel, a Zircon kernel.  And this is the details of the kernel. Speaking of kernels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can write code in Dart or in Rust. That's that's. Yeah, I like Rust. Mainstream there. Yeah.  Yeah. What's Dart? Dart is the. Oh, Dart. I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Both.  Dart. Rust comes from the Mozilla Foundation. Doesn't Dart also come from Mozilla? Who does Dart come from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Dart was Google's one. It was one of the Intel projects trying to replace JavaScript. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Rust is a real systems programming language designed to replace C and C++.  Yes. That's a good. That's a good. I think those are decent choices.  Speaking of kernels, the battle royal has begun over the we don't know much about it. Intel kernel flaw.  This is this. This is the story that began it all from the register.  Kernel memory leaking Intel processors design, flaw forces, Linux, Windows redesign.  Linux has is current. I think most of the information comes from the Linux development, which is being done in public.  Although Microsoft says we have already patched Windows for this.  The scary thing is this register article says that all Intel processors will be have to be patched on all computers.  And the impact of the patch, which involves doing more memory paging, will slow these computers down from five to 30 percent.  Intel today responded saying, well, a, it's not just us.  It's it's Intel's. It says it's working with many other technology companies, including AMD, Arm Holdings.  By the way, Intel stock plummeted while Arm Stock went up this morning because of this.  Intel believes these exploits do not have the potential to corrupt, modify or delete data based on the analysis today.  This is Intel talking. This is not what the register said.  Many types of computing devices with many different vendors, processors and operating systems are susceptible to these exploits.  These are very fuzzy words.  Intel is making this statement today because of current inaccurate media reports, but they don't say exactly who or what is inaccurate.  They also say contrary to some reports, any performance impacts are workload dependent and for the average computer user should not be significant and will be mitigated over time.  All of these sound good, but are so vaguely worded as to not really be meaningful.  Yeah, they're workload dependent. Like if you have no workload, you might not notice performance hits.  That's one way of interpreting it. For the average computer user should not be significant.  OK, I don't know who that person is and will be mitigated over time.  They don't say how perhaps with the purchase of a new computer. I don't know.  So I shouldn't be harsh. I don't mean to be harsh.  AMD is responding to Intel saying, no, we don't have this problem.  Don't say we have this problem. You have this. This is your problem, not our problem.  Meanwhile, nobody knows exactly what the problem is because, well, for good reason, security researchers aren't telling anybody.  They're trying to get these patches out before the word goes out, which means it's pretty serious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, Ars Technica has an explainer that starts walking you through the details of this process of Voodoo.  But a lot of this is somebody described on Twitter as this just illustrates how much witchcraft there is in processes these days.  And the thing is that the processes used to be simple, non-memory machines where you had like memory and had a couple of registers and you moved stuff between the two.  And now there's layers and layers and layers of caches, but also layers and layers of execution units that will if there's an if statement, we'll try both parts of the if statement until they're sure which one is actually going to happen.  Branch prediction, this is called.  Branch prediction, speculative execution, things like that.  So because different bits run at different speeds, they will attempt to execute the code in more than one path and then see which one should resolve further down.  And so the suspicion is that you can do timing attacks based on these different effects of these different things on caches and potentially extract kernel addresses that way and then access them.  But it's not clear what's going on and we'll have to wait for a proper writer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When you hear that you think perhaps of Rowhammer, which was an Android specific bug that used timing attacks in a similar way.  And they have likened this to Rowhammer.  The only reason we know anything is because the Linux patches are being done kind of in public.  They're redacting comments and things, but people can look at the patch and say, oh, this seems to be addressing this.  I misspoke.  Microsoft has a patch in the Windows Insider program, the betas, and it's been in the beta since November.  So Microsoft's known about this for some time and they say patch Tuesday next week.  Everybody will get this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So like if you have your grandmother.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you have patched her operating system will get patched.  No, no, no word about what Apple is doing, although there have been a lot of patches lately.  Amazon Web Services and Microsoft's Azure are both announcing they'll be down for scheduled maintenance.  But we know that these these virtualization solutions are vulnerable as well.  So it's well, no one's saying why they're going down.  This scheduled maintenance is probably something about patching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So since everything is about me, what about Chrome OS?  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think I think the worry is probably more that you'll be able to peek into other processes on the same machine, which is less of less of an issue for individuals,  but a big issue for servers where you potentially have processes belonging to other people and stuff can leak sideways that way.  So if you're a cloud provider, that's you know, there's a presumption that all the like the the lower level page that was stuff works.  And you can build things on top of that that isolate one process from another.  And if those process actually belong to different organizations and they shouldn't be able to reach other state, but that's potentially a problem.  So for someone who's providing, who's basically sharing servers between people in the cloud, that's really more dangerous.  That's actually more dangerous than there was.  So if you remember, there was a problem.  There was a problem.  I'm trying to remember exactly who it was.  But there was there was some kind of cross leakage problem for someone who was running a CDN where people would get each other's cached pages.  Do you remember that?  That was about six months ago.  So that that that kind of problem could occur or that kind of thing could be deliberately provoked where you can peek into other people's processes.  And that's that that I suspect that's why they're particularly nervous about the cloud service stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the way, you're right.  Peter Bright's article in Ars Technica is the best so far description of this.  And he says it specifically affects Intel processors that do speculative execution of Ring 3 code that writes to Ring 0 memory.  And that's where the leak happens.  But that's all processors since the Pentium Pro, which came out in 1995.  So it's it's a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't I'm presuming of the specular issue for for almond and those that don't have such hairy processor designs.  But right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And nothing needs to be done with the firmware or anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is no it's operating.  You're up.  It'll be patched to the operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK, it'll be patched.  Well, it'll be patched at the process level if they can patch that.  That's the other pieces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, that's the long term.  I suspect that's the long term mitigation.  Really hard.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's exactly why.  But they do that.  We've seen processors patched before.  You know, it's totally doable.  But I'm sure it takes a little longer.  Peter writes the impact of this will vary depending on workload.  Every time a program makes a call into the kernel to read to the disk from the disk to send data to the network to open a file, that call be a little more expensive because of this paging that will have to occur.  Programs that don't use the kernel much might see a hit of perhaps two to three percent.  But workloads that call the kernel a lot will see much greater performance drop off.  In a benchmark, a program that does virtually nothing other than call the kernel saw its performance drop by 50, 50 percent.  Each call to the kernel took twice as long.  So that's not insignificant.  You know, when you look at that, then the 30 percent overall doesn't seem unlike, you know, some seem out of the picture.  That's a big hit.  But again, you know, it's all kind of it's a developing story, as they say.  Yeah.  So we'll keep what we talked about yesterday and security now.  Steve Gibson, you know, was very calm.  And so I didn't I didn't really twig to how serious this could be until I read the register.  And then I thought, oh, this this could be a little bit more serious than I thought.  Steve's always calm, right?  Well, no, no, he'll he'll be calm.  No, no, no, he'll he'll light his hair on fire if need be.  If need be.  As of January 1st, Google is now blocking YouTube on Amazon devices.  Boys, boys, boys. Can't you get along?  Google says we have a bigger button.  Yeah. Why should we expect the tech industry to be more more mature than the president?  Google stocks blocking on Amazon Fire TV Echo Show in a huge.  This is from Variety and an unusually frank statement of Google's spokesperson squarely blamed Amazon's unwillingness to strike a business deal with Google for this step.  We've been trying to reach agreement with Amazon to give consumers access to each other's products and services.  But Amazon doesn't carry Google products like Chromecast and Google Home doesn't make Prime video available for Google cast users.  Even last month, stop selling some of Nest's latest products.  Given this lack of reciprocity, we are no longer supporting YouTube on Echo Show and Fire TV.  We hope we can reach an agreement to resolve these issues soon.  This is you've been through this.  The cable cable wars in New Jersey, haven't you, Jeff?  Where the cable company says, well, ESPN wants too much money, so we're not going to let you watch ESPN.  And it's a kind of game of chicken of Brinkman.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it hurts customers and it hurts the brand.  And in the long run shows that they don't care about the customers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it's also I mean, it's also self destructive for them.  I mean, I've you know, I've got prime and I've got Netflix.  I've got a Chromecast.  That's what I would normally use.  I've also got a smart TV and I have to use that for the Amazon Play stuff.  But it's a smart TV, which means it's flaky.  So at some point we were watching we were watching some series on Amazon and.  Either Amazon's network flaked out, the smart TV software flaked out.  I don't know what.  So I had to go and get go and get my Chromebook of video cable, plug it into the TV, watch it on that and faff around for ages because.  Amazon refuses to support Chromecast from the from from Android at all.  So I have to do it with a physical cable.  And it's like it makes me want to watch Netflix instead of Amazon, which is pretty stupid from Amazon's point of view.  I thought next Netflix has been good at we will run everywhere.  We're very, you know, because they don't have that is their business.  Whereas Amazon has a strategy tax on on on prime video because they actually care more about selling stuff through the store.  And they did say that they sold more fire sticks than anything except the echo over Christmas.  But you know why they're selling fire sticks, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know if this is taken over in the UK, but it's all the rage in the states.  People are putting Cody, they're hacking the fire sticks, putting Cody on it and then using them using the fire sticks to watch pirated TV shows.  It's massive. You go go on eBay, go anywhere.  We were we were hearing about this on a couple of weeks ago.  Oh, and JJ Stone was talking about a friend of his who he was at great pains to emphasize was not too bright.  Who would go to the kids softball games and say fire sticks, get your get your patched fire sticks here.  He was selling Amazon fire sticks patched so they could pick up pirate programming.  And Amazon's done, by the way, absolutely nothing to stop this, as far as I can tell.  Shouldn't we should mention it's not Cody's fault.  Cody is a legit platform, but there are Cody plugins that let you do this.  And if Firestick, if Amazon's admitting fire stick sales were through the roof this Christmas, that's as much as admitting because of piracy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So patch a fire stick to run Chromecast. That might solve my problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you can run Cody on it. Kodi, right?  Which is the old Xbox Media Center. And it has plugins that let you, you know, watch pirated so forth.  When we were in the Caribbean, you know, I had a skipper because I didn't want to sail this boat myself.  His name was Jelly Bean. Good.  Skipper Jelly Bean. I got on the boat and said, oh, man, I said, hi, what's your my name's Leo. What's your name?  He said, call me Jelly Bean.  He was great. Love Jelly Bean. But he was very interested in a hacked fire stick.  And I wasn't telling him about it. But the kids I was with knew all about it.  And we're saying, oh, yeah. And they said, here's how you get it.  And before we would at the end of the trip, before we could leave Jelly Bean says, now, don't give me the right down here.  What I should get mine for the. So it's we're spreading goodwill to the rest of the world.  By the way, boy, you know, they talk about Puerto Rico and almost 50 percent.  Yeah. How bad was it down there? British Virgin Islands. Just devastating.  And Jelly, if I'll call him by his first name, Jelly had not had been a captain sailing the Caribbean since 1989.  And he had intentionally his he lost his roof. He was telling us the story of he took his wife and his eight year old daughter and they huddled in the bathroom.  And he's heard this big boom as the roof blew off and then the back door and the front door blew off, blew off, not just blew open, blew off.  And the refrigerator in the kitchen was blown through the back door and ended up two blocks down the road.  He's it's amazing. He's a lot. But he had not gone around to see the devastation.  So it was like watching it watching it through his eyes was very much getting a sense of this.  And it's it's just flattened, flattened. I mean, we went to an island.  It's not there anymore. It's just it's like it's bizarre.  Truly devastated. Yeah. It's not the truth.  No, no. And there's no power. I mean, nobody's got power.  But any restaurant or business we went to was running on a generator.  And and, you know, I mean, the amazing thing is these people are so spirited and generous.  They were giving us stuff. And it was just I was like, I was blown away.  It was very hardly was anybody there, which was, I guess, kind of a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because the other thing is a problem. I was supposed to go to a conference in Puerto Rico and, you know, they moved to Miami.  I just felt bad because there was money that's needed there. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I was I was actually glad we were there and they were very glad to see us.  But I felt a little I felt a little guilty, but they were very glad to see us, I think.  I don't know. I got sidetracked. Sorry about that.  That's what we do here. That's what we do. It's the sidetracked show.  So great article. It seems highly speculative and venture beat speculating that Apple, because of the new tax law, might actually be preparing to repatriate.  Well, I don't know. I mean, according to the Financial Times and I can't read it because it's behind a paywall.  Tim Cook says Apple to repatriate overseas cash pile next year.  Part of that is the new tax rate under the new tax law of repatriation is fifteen and a half percent.  Tim Cook said, we'll do it if you can give us ten, but I guess fifteen and a half is enough.  But that gives them a big pile of US cash.  And so this article by Jeremy Horowitz is about what might they do with that?  And city analysts pick Netflix or Disney as an acquisition target.  City says Netflix is the most likely, partly because it's a lot cheaper, but also it's a lot easier to absorb.  Disney is huge. Apple would actually have to need more money. They'd have to borrow money to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And jobs were alive. I'd buy the Disney more out of Disney would be a great acquisition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jobs and I guess his wife, Lorene, his widow, Lorene, was for a long time the largest stockholder of Disney.  I don't know if they still are because they Disney bought Pixar and Rob Eger, Disney CEO, is on Apple's board.  So there's always been kind of this relationship. Apple would need to spend two hundred sixty two billion dollars to purchase Disney at a 40 percent premium over its current enterprise value.  That's about two to three times more than Netflix.  But wouldn't you rather have Marvel and Star Wars and this theme parks?  And I mean, this that could be huge, huge for Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's also but it's also a bit of a lead weight to in some ways that why go into old media businesses?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Horowitz also points out that Disney has one hundred ninety five thousand employees.  That's more than Apple. Yeah, you got to. That's a that's a big Apple to bite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I don't know. I hear they'd ruin. I hear Apple would ruin Netflix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, Apple wants a content, but they're not willing.  I mean, they're so far they won't spend a billion dollars to make content this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But along, you know, seven billion or whatever Netflix is spending.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Netflix is doing eight, eight, right.  But boy, you just all you do is spend a couple hundred billion on Disney and you're set for life.  Yeah. Plus, it's a profitable enterprise.  You know, of the top nine box office movies of all time, three are the last three Star Wars movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jesus, you also get Hulu, by the way, if you buy this, you get Hulu because of the Murdoch, the Fox acquisition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, interesting. I I, you know, from our point of view, we're rooting for the big news story.  That would be one we could we could dine out on for for a few weeks.  So anyway, we'll keep an eye on that one.  And frankly, it's still not I'm still not sure that they're going to repatriate their money.  Meanwhile, Google moved nineteen point two billion dollars to Bermuda.  Sixteen billion euros in 2016.  This is according to regulatory filings in the Netherlands.  This is the Dutch sandwich we've heard so much about tasty.  The double Irish, just like Apple, Google uses the double Irish and the Dutch sandwich to shield the majority of its international profits from taxation.  One of the things I don't know, one of the things Apple does, I don't know if Google does this, but Apple is very active about this.  They actually transfer intellectual property rights to Ireland so that they have to pay a license fee, take American profits, send it to Ireland,  thereby avoiding the tax in America and paying the very low Irish corporate tax.  I don't know if Google's doing that.  But what happens is you shift revenue from an Irish is what Google's doing.  Shift revenue from an Irish subsidiary to a Dutch company with no employees and then onto a Bermuda mailbox owned by another Irish company.  Seven percent more in 2016 than the year before.  Be interesting again, you know, all these companies, Facebook does it, Google does it, Apple does it, lots of companies do it.  They all say, look, it's the tax law.  We're just doing what's legal to comply with the tax laws of every country and we're doing what's legal.  But we also have a responsibility to pay as little tax as we legally have to.  You wouldn't expect us to pay more, would you?  Although Facebook didn't Facebook say that we're going to stop doing that.  We're going to pay more taxes in the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, didn't the EU fine Ireland for not charging Apple enough tax?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, that's right.  And this happened to Google. That was over Apple. This has happened to Google too.  Last year, Google escaped a one point one two billion euro French tax bill after court ruled its Irish subsidiary,  which collects revenue for ads the company sells in France has no permanent base in the country.  And the EU is exploring ways to make them pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But this is all up to those governments to negotiate.  It's not up to the companies to decide in order to pay their they have a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders  to reduce taxes and increase profit.  And the companies, the countries are competing with each other and they should do something about this.  It is unfair. I agree.  But it's not up to the companies to decide this is up to the governments.  That's their job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the Irish tax corporate tax right now is twelve and a half percent.  The new tax bill says corporate tax rate in the US is now down to twenty one percent.  I don't know if that's low enough that people will consider repatriating their what they want to do with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google's going to do it for the sake of principle.  They're going to do it if they if they have something they want to buy or they want to do here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  According to Bloomberg, Google would have saved three point seven billion dollars in taxes in 2016 doing that tax transfer.  But they hold sixty billion dollars overseas.  Anyway, I think that the new tax bill might change that.  We'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Plus, I mean, this is what happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I mean, the thing is, this is you're saying that they're required to the shareholders.  I mean, this is Charlie Stross's thing about we have malevolent AIs and their corporations.  He gave he gave a speech at C4 this week.  I was to give him a chat or whatever.  But basically, he wrote a thing called Invaders from Mars a few years ago, which said we have we did this strange thing sometime in the 18th century where we said that we can have nonhuman entities that we treat as humans.  They're called corporations.  And they have this weird ability to be immortal and transfer assets between themselves and move between countries.  And now they're at the point where they're taking over the laws and rewriting the laws to suit them.  So all the people fretting about AIs taking over are sort of missing the wood for the trees, because actually we have these sort of very slow moving AIs that are actually artificial beings that are distorting everything in the world because they behave this way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Charlie Stross, who's a sci fi author, seems to be taking Neil.  Was it Neil Stephenson's mantle?  He used to go do those crazy speeches at South by this is apparently going to be now it's going to be Charlie Stross in this talk.  It was Bruce Sterling.  Bruce Sterling. That's right.  In this talk, Charles Stross will give a rambling discursive and angry tour of what went wrong with the 21st century, why we didn't see it coming, where we can expect to go next and a few suggestions for what to do about it if we don't like it.  It's his keynote at the 34th.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, it's probably easier to read it than to watch it because he's a writer rather than performer.  But it's also he can put links in the in the in the in the post.  But his this is his basic thesis is that Elon Musk is worried about AIs taking over and he's ignoring the fact that he's he runs three AIs of his own that are doing strange things to the world as well.  So he talks about the idea of the paper clip maximizer is the thing that people are scared of about AIs that they'll set an AI going whose job is to make paper clips and turn everything into paper clips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the way, it's an awesome game.  I highly recommend.  I spent several days making paper clips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But he says Tesla is a battery maximizer.  It's its whole goal is to make more batteries and turn turn into batteries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Interesting.  So it's like the paper clip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  And the point and his point is that companies have overt goals and notional controls.  But their instrumental goals is maximizing revenue.  And they'll do as Jeff was saying, they will do things to do that, whatever the consequences for everyone else.  So they will do that even if it means all their money is somehow in Bermuda rather than paying taxes where they should.  Right.  You know, where the taxes are designed to be.  And I don't think they get a pass for saying, well, we just we've we just found a way to hack the laws to do this because they're obviously skirting.  If they are actually generating, if they're not really generating the revenue for intellectual property in Bermuda, they're generating the revenue by selling advertising services in populated countries that actually have tax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now you got me making paper clips.  This is Nick Bostrom's, you know, kind of thought experiment about what happens if you create an AI that's optimized to make paper clips and nothing else.  Well, eventually, and I, by the way, I proved it turns into all the matter in the universe into paper clips.  And I got there.  I did it.  But the good news at the end of that, well, no spoilers.  But at the end of that game, you get you get an option to continue on.  Let's put it that way.  Well, what are we going to do?  I mean, this is this is late stage capitalism.  This is this is where we have brought ourselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's the point.  It's very hard to know how to fix this because they they tend to adjust legislation to suit them as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, yeah, they have so much power now.  They bought Congress.  And then so there's nothing we can do about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And what we get is them fighting over fighting over different laws that will benefit different companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And of course, part of that was the Citizens United decision by the Supreme Court that said corporations can donate unlimited funds to political campaigns.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I pretty much sealed the deal.  Yep.  Speaking of sealing the deal, Logan Paul.  God dang it.  This is the YouTube.  The I say the nihilistic YouTube star who is, you know, I mean, he and his brother have done things like burn man.  Things like burn mattresses in the swimming pool of their Beverly Hills home to generate YouTube views.  They kind of they took the cake on this one.  They he was in the famous suicide forest in Japan and posted a video of a suicide, which I won't show, of course.  In fact, he took it down after three days and six point seven million views.  But, you know, I think the point is clear here.  A, as some have pointed out, no AI is going to be able to find that video and block it.  And there is an intense race now to become the next most extreme thing.  You saw it last year with PewDiePie and his race.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me let me try to find some good news in this, which is that our norms survived this.  That that that he was roundly condemned at all quarters.  You had to take it down.  You had to apologize.  And Logan Ball were.  Yeah.  And and might have ruined his chances to make money.  That's up to to YouTube.  I think they should ruin it.  And so, you know, there are limits and that's what we're setting.  It's what we're negotiating.  It's what we're trying to figure out.  Now, can we automate those limits?  That's that's hard at scale.  The scale where we are is very hard.  But but norms won.  Civil civilization won.  Civilization didn't say, oh, OK, what's the big deal?  It's a video. No, civilization said, F you, Mr. Paul.  Right. And made it take it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But do you think you'll have long term harm or maybe it will in fact help build his brand?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's that's the same with PewDiePie.  That's up to a great measure of the platform is whether they choose to have their brands associated with the likes of this.  If I were a brand, I would say no.  You know, one strike, you're out now.  PewDiePie is still on YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All they did was they took him off of their VIP advertising program, which did cost him millions of dollars in ad revenue.  He only made 15 million last year.  Yeah, I just feel like there's such a there's such pressure.  It's like link bait.  And when it was mainstream media, I think there were, you know, societal restraints that kept them from going too crazy.  I mean, they went crazy enough with reality TV and stuff.  But I feel like on YouTube, first of all, it happened so fast that it's the issue.  Yeah, it happened so fast that it's I mean, three days he gets six point seven million views.  Those views cannot be taken back. I don't know how many kids saw.  I don't know how many kids were damaged by it or upset by it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the other question there is, is how long did it take people to report this?  That's that's to me the most disturbing part.  And then the second is how long to take YouTube to react.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Apparently it was reported. Some say it was reported and YouTube did not react.  And that's YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, if it's if it's ramping up that fast, it would probably be in the top fraction of a percent of videos on YouTube.  And so therefore should be on to review Q quickly.  You know, YouTube, yeah, YouTube has a lot of videos and you can't review them all.  We know that. But it should be to review the ones that are ramping up the trending trending.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you both have teenage teenage sons as young sons as I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Henry's twenty three still just know that they're not teenagers more but twenty one and twenty two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And same Jake is about that age. Twenty five.  So I'm on the boat with these kids and I'm watching the videos they like and they have a very extreme and they've developed a very extreme taste for videos on YouTube.  That's it. This has pushed them to a more extreme taste.  And the stuff they watch is and they were telling me about the people they like.  They watch a guy who eats hot peppers, hottest pepper possible.  You watch him in agony as he's eating this pepper. They love that. They laugh. They howl.  There's some other guy who is just completely an anarchist.  He has a beautiful set, starts his show before he gets his first guest on.  He destroys the set and then does the show.  And there's this appetite for more and more extreme stuff.  And the kids eat it up. They love it. That's what they want.  And of course when they try to watch something like this it's like well nothing happens.  You didn't blow anything up. What's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Even David Letterman back in the day threw things off the roof.  Yeah.  I have immense respect for him but yeah he was he was in essence doing a baby version of the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. I'm just saying that mainstream media because they were run.  I'm not praising mainstream media by any means.  Right.  But because they were run by big corporations like General Electric that had a reputation to maintain.  There was always a little bit of a lid on this.  I mean obviously Google and YouTube are big corporations who have a reputation to maintain.  But I don't know. I feel like there's such incentive to get more and more extreme.  I don't see it going the other way. I don't see it coming down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No and it's the issue of scale too. It's that case on YouTube of the ridiculous made up videos.  Yeah.  That they've figured out how to manipulate the system.  Right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The stuff like synthesized kids cartoon videos.  Right.  Generated by algorithms.  Yep.  That stuff is creepy.  There's a sort of and this is in Charlie's talk as well.  There's people are now starting to throw weird you know weird AI machinery at these things to try and make make stuff up that's more convincing.  Right.  But also they're attacking this attacking multiple levels.  It is this weird thing of there.  What they're actually trying to do is game other computers.  So it's sort of adversarial AI fighting AI.  They're trying to game the ranking other in YouTube.  They're trying to game the censorship algorithm YouTube as well.  Trying to produce something that looks enough like the things that should be let through.  But before the ranking algorithms and therefore generate ad revenue.  I feel like sort of it's very very strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nick Bostrom was kind of sort of right.  But it's instead of paper clips is the four Channing of the world.  The entire world is just going to turn into four Chan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But this one I'm going to go back to my good news thing.  There was also a study out this week that said that you know all the talk about fake news in my world and you know I've got money to deal with it said you know the impact is actually very small.  Oh I hope that's true.  I hope that's true.  Another study another study these are both on the rundown said that I got this one straight.  This one said that when I'm not picking on Trump in this case or Trump voters in this case but when Trump voters Trump fans were exposed to stories about the Russian connections their opinion of Trump and trust in him decreased which is to say that news has an impact on people.  You put the two together and there is an opportunity for a flight to quality here.  There is an opportunity for us to negotiate our norms for an improved society.  You know you're going to hear my spiel for the 100th time.  It's early days 1479 Gutenberg years.  We're figuring this out.  We're smart as a civilization.  We will figure it out.  Society's not in the dumper quite yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay.  But I hope you're right.  That's all I can say.  But the challenge is building you know the problem is it's the same as the corporate tax thing.  We have these twisted incentives that are being powered through by both real AIs and these sort of synthetic slow moving AIs that are corporations that maximize the wrong things that really care about it until you until we find a way to go and beat them up.  And the challenge is how do we find the way to re incentivize them to do things that would actually be useful when what levers do we have because they're the ones who are gaining our attention.  I am seeing I mean I am seeing and it's partly a sort of beginning of the year thing but I am seeing a number of people saying okay that's it.  I'm switching on Facebook and Twitter and I'm going to go and do something else.  The CEO of Twitter spent 10 days on a meditation retreat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry Kevin I was just trying to put a punch line in there.  You're reading too much of the Guardian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh come on people are switching off.  I read this is things people are saying in conversation groups.  Well I'll give you my son and his friend.  I was with two 23 year olds.  They don't use Facebook.  They barely use it.  They use Snapchat like crazy all the time.  And I said but wait a minute all these videos and stuff you're sending back the vacation they're going to be gone forever.  They said yeah we don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't I gave up Facebook is the new I only watch PBS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No no but the point is that they stop using Facebook.  They use Facebook as LinkedIn.  They don't use it as.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes they're on Facebook but they don't spend time on it.  They use it as LinkedIn.  They use it as a way to get people's addresses and stuff as a phone book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah but also as a way to perform your public persona rather than your private conversations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So last night the president got in a Twitter war with Kim Jong Un.  Trump tweeted North Korean leader King Jong Un has just stated the nuclear button is on his desk at all times.  Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him.  I too have a nuclear button but it is much bigger and more powerful one than his.  And my button works.  Immediately people went in fact somebody put up a projected up on the side of the building at Twitter headquarters hashtag Jack or at Jackie's hashtag complicit.  Immediately people said well wait a minute.  Aren't those death threats.  Doesn't that isn't that violating Twitter's rules.  It shouldn't.  The president be banned.  And then I saw another tweet that said anybody who thinks Twitter is ever going to brand the president in the United States from Twitter is not paying is not playing with a full deck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So we'll say two things on that.  I mean one is this Michael Wolf stuff that that's kind of that's come out.  I think it's just been published.  I don't know what time it is there.  Yeah.  So he's basically big.  Biker Wolf is a kind of sleazy journalist guy who's very good at schmoozing and apparently just schmoozes way to the White House and chatted to everyone and has now written down everything that they said to him and published it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's you know this is this is the ban on comments right.  No.  More than that.  Oh it's more than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's his book.  Katie tour just put up one where where she she had the book and marked it and said that his goal was to get his friends wives in bed.  Whose goal whose goal trumps trumps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now let me just ask a couple of questions because of course this is all over the news right now.  Because Trump read it and then said well ban I ban him really didn't work for me or something.  He has nothing to do with his presidency.  Apparently there were no campaign managers on the Trump campaign at all because anyway is Wolf to be trusted or is he making stuff up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wolf has a mixed reputation but he does get access making access journalists nervous.  He recreates entire conversations.  I read I read there's a New York magazine has the longest long get longest excerpt out there and a huge conversations between Bannon and Priebus this kind of stuff.  And who knows what he got where do you take him on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is the equivalent of the Trump dossier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What he says what he says in the piece is that the leaking is Trump himself because what Trump does is phone up people and complain about them to other people back and forth.  And so he just worked out who he was phoning and talk to them.  And because he Trump isn't very good at saying on the record off the record he was he was able to you know go and listen to them and be polite and pay attention and and then write down what they said and then triangulated across different people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who was he working for when he did this and the New York magazine or no he's read a book.  So he just wandered in and said I'm reading a book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He had a near a near permanent position on the couch in the West Wing.  What and then he could go hang out.  Oh my god.  This is this wolf wolf also did wolf went to the first four square conference and it was all off the record very clear.  He just violated the heck out of that uses the lead broke the twilight of the of the moguls out of that.  Then somehow he got access to Murdoch did a book on Murdoch Murdoch wasn't happy.  Then he did his gossip columns for the likes of Vanity Fair and such.  And this is Michael he does this he's a good writer.  He's a snarky and you know you there's no attribution.  He's recreating dialogue you know who knows.  But it's going to be provocative as hell it's going to be out there like crazy over the next five news cycles going to be all this and then Trump's going to react as he already has.  So he's he's now accusing banning of being insane.  We live in a reality show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is now all reality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is what the New York Times said.  That's why we're having a fit about the New York Times saying oh isn't that cute he turned the presidency to reality show as if that was a positive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's nothing cute about it but it's clear.  So this is a book that's going to come out and be a huge bestseller because I'm just reading the New Yorker magazine article and it's incredible.  It's incredible.  On election night Wolf says Trump looked as if he'd seen a ghost.  He didn't think he was going to win.  But he knew he would win by becoming the most famous man in the world because of the campaign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Which we always presumed was his strategy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He says I don't think about losing it isn't losing we've totally won.  Even before he won.  And then he won it was oh whoa.  But at this point he's got nothing to lose.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Nope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Don Jr. told a friend that Trump looked as if he had seen a ghost.  Melania was in tears and not of joy.  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is my favorite quote.  So in the Trump response about about Bannon.  Yeah.  And there was this line winning isn't as easy as I make it look.  Isn't that the ultimate Trump line?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.  OK.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow.  So he is a he's a reality TV person.  He is a big media hack.  That's what he's been doing for the last 30 years.  But leveraging media attention into money and deals and using that to shut people up.  So Lake off George Lake off the linguist and political analyst read a long sort of thread on Twitter basically saying the more time we spend talking about this stuff the more we're playing into his narrative because he thrives on attention and he likes being a reality TV star.  And he likes talking about ratings and all this stuff.  And he says you've got to you've got to reframe it so that you're talking when he says something outrageous and wrong first you rebut it and then you say oh and by the way the Trump said his usual nonsense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And so we had Joan Donovan on and that was really great a couple of weeks ago and she basically talked about the fact that the memes won the election.  And that what what we have isn't even it isn't even really the reality show presidency.  It is the it is it is the Reddit presidency is the 4chan press the mean driven presidency.  And and but you think so to get back into the conversation you started Jeff you think that there are signs that this is that this is going to go away and everything's going to be fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No I wouldn't even I wouldn't go that far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I feel like we've gone down the rabbit hole and it's going to be pretty dark.  Yeah it's gonna be pretty hard.  For one thing it's very engaging.  The rate the ratings as Mr. Trump would say are through the roof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah we've got to accept I think my problem is this we have I just read a what's the conservative magazine TRO.  New Republic New Republic TNR.  That's the conservative one I was getting confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No National Review is the conservative one New Republic is the whatever Morgan Rondrake did.  We're in National Review I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  National Review yeah.  So National Review and I wrote a piece just say it's about institutions there's no no trust no faith in institutions but he's certainly more and and that's where we are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's that's troubling because it's the it's become very clear to me and we talked we talked about this before as well that really all of this is made up.  It's like it's like currency it's like money without a faith in in you know a belief in our institutions a belief that they work a belief in the rule of law.  You really you have nothing there's no it's all made up it's all it's all a social contract right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly it is I'm rereading I'm thinking a lot about this notion of after the mass and I wrote a piece about that last week and I'm doing a lot more research and just ordered a whole pile of books about it.  And and and yeah I think that what we see is a constant desire to return to the institutions we have I think we've got to accept the reality we have and figure out how to redesign things around that.  And and the reality we have now is that it's not Walter Cronkite land and Walter Cronkite was a myth himself that the shared reality was a myth.  I don't know what inspired me last week.  It's all myth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  Yeah.  And and so.  If you don't believe in the myth then you get in this very dystopian state where anything goes that you know do what thou wilt is the whole of the law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's that's kind of where but that's the here's the question is that it does the needle go too far.  Do we have it.  This is my point about.  Can it swing back.  You know that the suicide video in the Japanese woods was OK that's enough.  OK we found a little bit.  There it is.  That's enough.  Boom.  Push back.  And we push back to society or we're going to push back on the platforms.  Are we willing to have them do this.  At the same time of course Germany has done this.  Another story on the rundown where of course they have a law they're going to charge billions of dollars if you leave any fake news or bad stuff up.  So what's happening.  Satirists are getting taken down off of Twitter.  You know what's the line.  What's the limit.  We're we're negotiating this now but I think we're clearly in a place where we're saying to the platforms open is not good enough.  No we do want you to do some effort work on this and we're going to give you the license to do that.  You could do it Germany's way which we're going to charge you a fortune to make you scared and take down all kinds of stuff including satire of bad actors or we can do it through self regulation.  But I think there's an opportunity for a flight to quality.  That's my point.  And I think it's I think it's this whole fake news thing has a desire that advertisers are being pushed to stop supporting this junk.  The platforms are being pushed to stop promoting the junk.  Does that end up do we as a society end up someplace better off.  It's hard to say that we prove when we have the likes of what we have happening in Washington.  You know it does the does it go too far or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then there's this a Twitter user with the handle swatistic SWAU TST I see threatened to SWAT that is call the tactical squad the police on another user goes by the name of talent beginning with a seven talent dared someone to SWAT him tweeted an address but it wasn't his own address.  So autistic apparently called the Kansas police said there's a domestic dispute at this address.  One person has already been murdered.  Several family members are being a hostage held hostage.  The police showed up a male came to the front door as he came to the front door one of this is from the which the Wichita Eagle report by the police as he came to the front door one of our officers discharged his weapon.  The man 28 was killed instantly.  He was not talent he was not related it was a random address.  He didn't even play video games a family member identified the man shot by the police's Andrew Finch one of Finch's cousin said Finch didn't play video games then swastika goes back swatistic goes back on Twitter.  Saying he could see on TV the police had fallen for his attack his SWAT and he said I didn't get anyone killed because I didn't pull the trigger.  By the way police in Los Angeles have arrested they believe the man responsible 25 year old in connection with that attack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The argument who's more at fault.  Well they're both at fault.  It was also it was reason magazine said exactly that they're both at fault.  They're both at fault.  The police are at fault and the gamers are at fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Throw the book at the throw the book at SWATistic if that's who if you know if that's if they've got him and absolutely the police need to be aware of the fact that swatting happens.  We've been swatted.  We had the police Petaluma police come to the.  Oh yeah a couple of years ago.  That's why we have an armed guard.  Petaluma police came to our I didn't talk about it at the time because I didn't want to encourage it.  Came to our front door but they didn't come with weapons drawn and a battering ram.  They kind of understood that there you know there's some risks here.  We immediately defuse the situation but I did hear the recording the guy said I'm going to kill everybody at twit and then I'm going to set off bombs and blow up the whole place.  And I've already killed three people inside or whatever.  I mean you know he was you know so this happens all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But here's here's the thing.  This is it goes back again to the what's his name Aaron Paul.  No.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Paul by the way who's been really good on Twitter.  Yeah.  Taken down all of these people.  The actor and Paul.  No.  Logan Paul.  Logan Paul.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the Logan Paul video is the problem we have to people people use that to say society's falling apart.  You can't if you extrapolate only from an anecdote like that from one schmuck like that that you don't arrive at an accurate view.  It's the same problem with press coverage right now of the base when the majority of the country they don't cover and talk to at all.  You know the extrapolation from the anecdote is a real problem in how we judge society.  And what we choose to do about it.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Although we know this happens and I'm quoting from Brian Krebs article.  He's been swatted to Quebs on security.  He was swatted in 2013 and there are there are more swaddings going on all the time.  I hate I don't even want to talk about it because I'm afraid of getting swatted again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  You don't want to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's find something happier.  All right.  The dystopia report continues.  Let's see.  New bill.  You know it's a bill.  And as I remember a bill is not a law.  The new bill which is the right bill could finally get rid of these paperless voting machines.  Six senators bipartisan group introduced legislation called the Secure Elections Act.  It aims to eliminate these paperless voting machines we've been talking about.  Promoting routine audits that would dramatically reduce the danger of hacking including interference from foreign governments.  Kamala Harris our senator from California.  James Langford Republican from Oklahoma.  The ours technical rights.  This is the bill reads like a computer security experts wish list.  So let's hope.  Let's hope.  See there's hope.  Let's hope that the Congress realizes how important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know I guess when everybody was going crazy in Techland about about the voting machines I could out paranoia tinfoil hats.  I was wrong.  Absolutely wrong.  We've got it.  If we secure nothing else we've got to secure that.  And by the way the census to coming up which there's a lot of efforts to go after that.  These are these are the fundamental institutions of a democracy.  And they're being threatened.  So yes we've got to go overboard to protect them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Lawrence Norton an election expert from NYU says the most important thing about the bill is who's sponsoring it.  The bill has three Republican co-sponsors three Democrats.  So this this has a shot.  I know we should point out we talked a lot about election fraud and voter machine hacking before the election last year.  And the experts we had only did a great triangulation on it.  The consensus was well yeah there are problems.  But because we have such a heterogeneous system in the United States every not every state every county even has different systems.  It's very hard to do any mass hacking that would affect the vote.  But now in hindsight what we realize is because the Electoral College and the and the closeness of the votes in general it only took 40,000 votes.  And that that wouldn't be a lot of votes to swing if not all.  So I think this is really important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think we get to a point where an election's validity is legitimately called into question.  And then what happens that's that's the answer.  What do you do then?  What do you do?  Yeah.  You know what if we don't have a we don't have a constant we are like you.  We don't have a constitution that looks like Gumby.  We change it all the time which is your flexibility.  You have Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We have this thing that's set in ink and yeah you guys are sick because if you can have elections any old time all you have to have to do is.  All you have to have is a vote of no confidence and boom you get to do it.  You get to do over.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a good argument for the parliamentary system frankly.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But also you know the voting system here is we have bits of paper that we put X's in boxes.  Oh good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want to go back to the one where you dip your thumb in ink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But no but the only the open rights group that I'm involved with here spent a long time campaigning against moving to electronic voting here.  Because there was all we can be a convert online.  It's like no they can't.  Not reliably.  There is no way to do this.  And we you know we won the argument the last time but it's coming around again and now it's like with but with block chain.  No that's that's.  Oh my god.  But with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But with block chain.  I really want my.  Decentralized network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the point is you know the point is bits of paper in boxes that you then split into the piles and measure the height of the piles is actually a fairly good system.  It's quite hard to hack.  It involves moving things around with trucks.  So OK you can hack it by stealing a bunch of ballots and replacing another bunch of ballots.  So you have to be like watch that.  Hard work.  It's hard to do from Russia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  CNBC says Amazon is in discussions with consumer brands about.  Oh no.  Ads on the Echo.  Procter and Gamble Clorox.  Well it was inevitable wasn't it.  What would they be like.  Apparently there are some tests going on.  So the report says there may be a range of promotional opportunities on the Echo.  One is reportedly a product suggestion on behalf of a brand tied to purchase history.  Echo may suggest to a shopper who previously bought Clorox's PineSol to consider buying its disinfecting wipes.  I see you've bought PineSol.  Perhaps you'd be interested in these disinfecting wipes.  Or if you say Echo how do I get red wine out of a carpet.  You might say shout it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Echo I'd like to buy some paper towels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Currently if you say Echo I'd like to buy some paper towels.  People say it will say OK I can look for a brand like Bounty.  What would you like.  So maybe there maybe this is already happening.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well it's going to happen with media too.  You know play me Frank Sinatra.  Wouldn't you prefer Tony Bennett.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh I hope they do that.  I mean that's you know.  I want to move with Katherine Hepburn and sorry we don't have any.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know many people like Katherine Hepburn also like.  I'm not sure who I would.  Aaron Paul.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I literally did that.  I searched.  I was I was trying to find the film now.  This is this time last year.  I searched Netflix for Katherine Hepburn movies and they had one.  That's it was dead sad.  It was desk set which is a good movie and it's about to see when they get that one.  But they had one Katherine Hepburn movie one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So how do you there's no ad blocker that can block ads coming from your Amazon Echo.  That's yours.  You're stuck listening to that ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well I don't have an Amazon Echo so I'm safe there I suppose.  But I'm sure my phone will wake up and start offering me things.  So apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Could ask whether this kills advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is just not feasible.  You just can't do it in any form.  It's going to work.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well I mean you know you'd have to.  Well I don't think Amazon could do it in a form that Google could because Google knows how to do this.  Google is already in the business of understanding when you're searching for something that is like to be a purchase and that's when they give you ads.  So if I search for Katherine Hepburn they won't try and sell me air freshener or something.  But if I if I search for air freshener the top row things will be ways to buy it because they understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This I'm surprised according to Amazon's financials.  Amazon made did ad sales of one billion dollars in Q3.  Wow.  So Amazon is not completely not in the ad business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well of course because they're in this weird ad business because they do retargeting.  So because they understand your purchase they can give you a buy now link.  So my son's working for a game company and a physical game company so they're selling physical objects through Amazon.  And so a lot of the stuff that works for them is ads that generate those things.  And the point is once you've created an impression there Amazon will retarget you until you buy it.  You know I searched for an instant pot yesterday and apparently you can't buy them in the UK and the price on Amazon was 650 pounds.  Wow.  Because they've got all the stocks that stocks sold out over Christmas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can't buy an instant pot in the UK.  No.  Is that why they don't sell them in the UK?  Because they're sold out.  Oh they're sold out.  Because they're sold out.  So I'm going to recommend the Breville Fast Slow Cooker which is better than an instant pot in my opinion.  But OK.  That's what I have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I searched for instant pot and it was like instant pot 650.  That's crazy.  Because that's called surge pricing.  Which is like what?  The point of these things that they were cheap as well as good pressure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can get you one for 58.98 overnight by Amazon Prime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But can it ship to the UK?  Oh.  I think that's a big waste.  A lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually the actual that's a that's a crock pot.  A knock off of the instant pot.  The actual instant pots are a little more pricey.  I thought they were cheap too.  Yeah.  They're over 100 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No no.  They became a premium brand in the last two months.  Oh that's so funny.  But the point I was making was I did that search and it was like because we wanted to buy my own one.  It's like well that's kind of crazy.  And then every time I browse the web today I see instant pot 650 pounds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh that's what you're seeing.  Oh I see what you're seeing.  It's the retargeting one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the ad revenue they're getting is for that kind of ad insertions that they put everywhere.  Right.  I get it.  That's interesting.  It's not Alexa.  But also they have the other half of the ad thing.  They have they can actually complete the sale and credits where it came from because they put the ads into the page.  And if you're a large media organization and you inject those kinds of ads then you can you can get the I'm sure you say what it is.  But you can it's like getting the Amazon referral fee but a bit lower.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Billion dollars a quarter ain't bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that's.  Yeah I'm not quite sure how that works that that may be some accounting trick as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because I'm assuming they're actually paying the sites they're injecting ads into.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Bum bum bum bum bum.  What time do you want to get out of here Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh six fifteen ish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pretty soon.  Twenty minutes from now.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's see.  Well what else what else should there's so many stories I can get out of the dystopia vein.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If we could play.  Amazing the Tesla is the most popular automaker in Norway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Because they have to go all electric by 2020 don't they.  That's phenomenal.  Yeah.  I got a nice deal.  I don't know who it was.  If you're watching thank you.  Somebody put my name down as a referral.  For a Tesla.  And they took delivery and Tesla sent me said hey thank you.  You can get.  And I said OK I'll take it.  One of those little kids Tesla's you drive around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to see you drive.  Get a mini Tesla.  Free.  You're kidding me.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like wow.  Anybody who's watching why buy a Tesla make sure you mention me.  I can have a whole fleet of mini Teslas.  Driving all around town.  Actually that's something we're going to do when we go to we're going to Japan in the spring.  The hot thing in Japan now I know it's in Tokyo and Osaka is Mario Kart.  That you put on a Mario costume.  It's a tour of Tokyo and they give you a little Mario Kart and you drive around town a little Mario Kart Mario costumes.  That's I'm going to do that.  I'm doing that.  Oh Lord.  Showing each other.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know it explains it because I was seeing all of these videos of people driving around Tokyo and Mario Kart's and I couldn't quite figure out why I was seeing all of these and now I know.  Turn off the sound on this but this is this is a big thing now people people do these tours of Tokyo.  How is that legal.  How.  Well you've seen all these weird things people drive around in San Francisco right.  The little.  I know.  Yeah.  It's all for tourism.  Mario Kart.  I can't wait.  I love I love I love Japan.  I can't wait.  It's going to be so much fun.  It's better than driving around a segue because you really look dopey in a segue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's true.  That's true.  It's amazing.  They're still out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  So I've two related stories say that that two two things artificial intelligence can look at a picture of you and tell whether you're sick or a Republican or both or both.  So this joint sense.  No, no they're not related.  They're just two different stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was a line too easy to get too easy.  I say up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I say up.  So it's an analysis of images that are you know do now we're getting some of the benefit of this for instance they can they can.  How do you vote they can look at your image and tell you based on 50 million images and location data how you're likely to vote and then I saw one this morning that said they could tell if you're sick by looking at you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm suspicious of these correlation things.  It's like OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey is there anything it can't do.  I'm just trying to find happy stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I also saw that I put up with the run down that a theory that with Facebook and phone records you could find people who are more connected to people.  And if you inoculate them against a disease before.  That's going to that's going to be a privacy stuff like crazy but it's an example of how data can do.  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think for square and Google tracking will be better than Facebook because people have lots of friends on Facebook may not get out much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh.  Facebook is ditching the false news flag.  I was curious what you would say about this one.  Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well we've been we people in this fake news world have been trying to get data from Facebook and they have not ever delivered.  But what was the impact of the flag.  And clearly they're saying that this was not doing the job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe it made people read the story more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.  And so the other truth was that all along as soon as Facebook identifies something that might be questionable and they sent it to the fact checkers they stopped promoting it.  So it already had the impact of not bringing traffic to it because Facebook wasn't promoting it.  That's the issue.  The flag was kind of meaningless.  So now instead Facebook is going to give you related content and see that study I quoted earlier in the show where being exposed to other news as long as it's not trying to say you idiot.  This is what you should see if it's just saying here's some more choices that it can have an impact and that that's what Facebook ought to be doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The red flag that they were putting up next to stories made people believe the stories not disbelieve them because they don't like the institutions face.  Oh right.  This proves it proves it because now see what they're doing they're pretending it's fake news.  You see you see it means it's true or they wouldn't be denying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  No there's the snoops is funded by by Soros to discredit the right wing meme.  There's there's layers of turtles all the way down isn't it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is indeed a visit to Facebook's recently opened center for deleting content.  This is motherboard.  What a fun place that in Essen Germany is the center for deleting content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's a separate company that's it that's contracted to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They have 400 employees deleting comments photos and videos that break Facebook's rules.  So this is this is not GDPR.  This is something else.  No no no this is this is that German thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the way we have a new word.  We have a new word that's back to us.  That's just got license.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For two tricks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I should show to try to practice that's fixed.  That's the exact exact exact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not there yet.  I got to do about 10 times.  Wow.  That's a tough word.  What does it mean.  That's back to Zetsun is gussets.  That was there.  I just speed it up.  That's that means basically network enforcement law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That would be too much just to say the network enforcement law.  You have to make it a one.  That's what it says.  I mean it's one word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Repeat after me.  That's that's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's a good thing.  You got it.  That only took five minutes to get through one word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Gussets.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Love German.  What a language.  God.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So so there was a story that Twitter has changed their reporting.  Abuse thing in Germany specifically just to ask you which bit of German law it's breaking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just give us a hint here.  Which German law are we breaking?  Oh, it's the network.  That's what it is.  The net work.  Doosh sets on.  Gussets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't forget that s between the G and the G.  Yeah.  Very important.  Oh, I just got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hang on.  I've got a screenshot for this.  I'm going to post this somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Screenshot for what German law are we breaking?  But is this only in Germany or they're saying in Europe in the US?  Germany.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's in Germany.  So what's happening is a lot of a lot of comics they're finding their stuff is not seen in  Germany where it could be understood, but you can see it here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But in Germany it violates a law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  So there's there's satirists who make reference to Hitler for the point of the satire.  Can't do that.  Let's get take it down.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Take it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a German satire magazine called Titanic and they're having a hell of a time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, well, well.  All right.  Last call for stories.  FCC is still working on its net neutrality repeal order.  More and more people are coming forward saying my dead mother, my what was it?  I think was it Catherine Hepburn, Julie Andrews?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Rachel Rachel Maddow did a great segment last night about all the names.  All the things.  Yeah.  Who's doing that?  That's what I want to know.  Why don't you address the Russians?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Those dang Russians.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Blame it everything on the Russians these days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It does feel a little easy to blame the Russians.  It does.  I agree.  They're not bad people.  Putin's not the greatest, but you know, they're a nice it's a nice nice group of people over there.  Many of my best friends are Russians.  Most of them left Russia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What else is here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Last call for news stories.  Equifax basically got Scott got away scot-free.  Nothing.  Politico has a story after Equifax breach anger, but no action in Congress.  White hot bipartisan outrage then hearings and proposals that went nowhere.  Are you surprised?  No, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I'll say what I want.  I see Nautilus the news reportedly a Samsung detachable Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well now remember the CES is coming up next week.  We're going to see a lot of stuff there.  Then there's Mobile World Congress, right?  February into March and that's where to see a lot of this stuff there.  Samsung.  We're trying to figure out if Samsung's doing an event at Mobile World Congress.  If they are, we'll cover it.  But that's where they might announce something like this.  Like this, a detachable Chromebook codenamed Nautilus with also with with what is this?  A Sony IMX camera sensor.  What is that for?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Still won't do the show.  Hold off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's a 16 megapixel.  It's about the same camera as in the LG G6.  It's a very good camera.  Wow.  That'd be very interesting.  Yeah.  Samsung makes really nice Chromebooks.  Very.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They do.  My daughter uses almost exclusively now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  As does my daughter.  Absolutely.  And my son.  Really?  Our little son, Michael, the 15 year old uses a Chromebook.  Oh, right.  Oh, you told us that.  In high school.  Yeah.  I have a Pixelbook, which I like.  Did Jason ever get his back?  I don't think he did.  He's back on his old Chromebook.  Really?  I don't know.  Maybe he just gave up and turned it in.  I like it a lot.  I think it's very nice.  I like it quite a bit.  I like it quite a bit.  Yeah.  Is Amazon going to buy Target?  No.  We did that.  We did that.  No, we didn't do Amazon.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No, this is a new one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is not the Apple buying Disney.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is a prominent analyst predicts Amazon will take over Target this year, which actually  would make a lot of sense.  Target, by the way, is one of the places you can shop on your Google Home.  That's right.  So, yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, Gene Munster, though, is known for missing the boat sometimes.  He's the analyst who predicts it.  Target is the aisle to yield offline partner for Amazon.  I was in a Whole Foods yesterday.  They have lockers, you know, that you can get your Amazon stuff delivered to.  But I asked the clerk, she said, you know, most people use it for returns.  You don't have to ship returns back.  You just put it in the locker.  Scan the thing, put it in the locker.  Which switch saves everybody.  That sounds really good.  Yeah.  Because I don't mind having deliveries come to my house.  I'd prefer it.  But returns, that's another matter.  So, Whole Foods, yep.  Maybe Target next.  That would make a lot of sense.  A lot of brick and mortar stores.  And I think Target's probably very affordable.  Amazon has been ordered to stop luring customers based on misspelled searches for Birkenstock.  Man, that's like saying, I got candy in this van.  Come here, kids.  Yeah.  German sandal maker Birkenstock filed an injunction  complaining the online retailer had been using variations like Birkenstock or Birkenstock  and buying the AdWords luring in customers to buy shoes that aren't actually Birkenstocks.  Low quality copies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  However, once you get to Amazon and you search for Birkenstocks,  you can say people who like this also like this at the same point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love my Birkenstocks.  I've worn them ever since I was a hippie.  Yeah, you would.  I have a deep connection to Birkenstock.  When we first moved to California, we bought the house of the Birkenstock,  US distributor of Birkenstocks, and in the garage was a mountain.  I mean, literally hundreds of thousands of Birkenstock catalogs.  And every one of them, you could put your, you'd get your foot wet,  and you put your foot on the back page of it, and it makes an imprint of your foot,  and then you can order the shoe.  And I just did that to a bunch of them just for fun.  I was a kid.  What did I know?  Samsung might also announce its Galaxy S9 at Mobile World Congress.  And according to Gordon Kelly, a contributor at Forbes, which means, you know, who knows?  Right.  Who knows who this guy is?  The final renders are coming out.  It looks just like the Galaxy S8.  Okay.  Will it have a headphone jack is all I care about.  There is a Bixby button.  I would think this is the differentiator now, right?  It is not.  It's a pain in the butt.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's a pain in the butt.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have to say, I took, so I brought a very expensive fancy camera to on vacation to in the Virgin Islands,  and I brought a Pixel 2 XL.  The pictures I took on this camera phone were the best.  Really?  This is the, there is no question in my mind, the Pixel 2 XL camera is absolutely second to the Galaxy S9.  Absolutely second to none.  I mean, stunning right out of the camera pictures of everything.  And very editable.  I mean, it really, they just came out fabulous.  So, highly recommend the Pixel 2 XL camera.  I mean, just the detail, the clarity.  Look at this.  By the way, there is a sunken ship in the trash.  But the clarity, I mean, if I zoom in, it's just pretty amazing.  Yeah.  Really good, really good camera.  This is, most of the shots were in bright light, so that might have something to do with it.  But there's a fish on the barbie.  There's my son taking a picture of a fish on the barbie.  It's kind of a meta commentary.  All right.  Let's wrap it up because it's time for Jeff to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got to go out to dinner with the family.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Where are you going?  A fish restaurant?  Oh, a pizza place.  Nice pizza.  I mean, it's fun to do family stuff.  Oh, it is.  It's good.  Yes.  Yeah.  Why don't you kick things off with a number of the week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  Where'd it go?  Where'd it go?  There it is.  Let's do, I don't get this.  I don't get this.  So there's a new search engine.  You know, those poor schmucks who come along all the time trying to think, I'll be the  Google.  Supposedly it's the search engine to tell you what is missing, found it in 2012.  I had never heard of this.  Had you?  Million short?  No.  It cuts off the first million most popular sites and then...  Oh, what a great idea.  Well, yes and no.  There's a reason that the things are on top are on top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So let me just see.  So it's the bottom million.  Remove the top...  The bottom million.  Then remove top hundred, top thousand, top ten thousand.  Let me remove the top...  I'm going to search for myself and remove the top million results.  Kitchen counter stools on sale.  My net worth foundation.  Why did Leo Laporte get divorced with his wife?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, don't you regret this now?  No, it's just strange.  Strange.  It's really odd.  So I thought that million short just abused me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I like it though.  I like it.  Mr. Kevin Marks, you got a pick for us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll go with my usual pick of IndieWeb events.  There's an IndieWeb camp in Baltimore coming up on January 20 to 21.  So that's the weekend.  Going to Baltimore.  I think it's the first one we've had in Baltimore.  And probably the first one we've had in that general region, I think.  That far off the coast.  It's the usual thing of two days where you spend sharing how to build websites with each other.  So the day one is like a conversation day.  Day two is a implementation day.  It's the usual IndieWeb model.  So if you're in that neighborhood, give that a look.  Also, we've got Homebrew website clubs next week on Wednesday and Thursday in various places in Europe and America.  So if you go to IndieWeb.org and look at events, it'll be there at the top.  One of the things I've seen in the last few weeks is a lot of people saying,  OK, I really am fed up with Twitter.  What else is out there?  And starting to look at the IndieWeb toolkits that we've been gradually building up over the last few years.  And one that's doing fairly well with this is Micro.blog, which is Mattan Reese's site.  He opened up signups recently.  So it's built on the IndieWeb standards.  You can just use it as a place to read and write, but also you can wire it up to your existing sites and feed them through as well.  So it's an interesting one to look at.  He's like reinventing the integrated reader blogging model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's funny because when you talked about it maybe a year ago, it was Indiegogo who crowdfunded it.  Yes.  And I did it.  And I've been on there ever since.  And then I went back the other day because I was, I don't know, I can't remember why.  And I've been posting all along because I was wise enough and forgot to wire it into all my other stuff.  So there's lots of content on there.  It's really kind of cute. Micro.blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it was only open to the people who funded it up until recently, but now there's a signup link as well.  So give it a look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's cool.  I'd like to get more people on it.  And I'd like to get the president on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The rest room.  I think that would be fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have something that came out of the UK that I thought was really cool.  And it came to my notice today because Mercedes-Benz announced they were going to adopt it in their car navigation systems going forward.  It's a British company called What Three Words.  Turns out you can divide the entire globe into 10 meter by 10 meter segments.  There's trillions of them.  And then assign three words to each of those.  And so, for instance, if you wanted to visit the Twit Brick House, the R3 words are glow, walnut and nasal.  Glow, walnut, nasal.  And then you can feed that into your Mercedes or send it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Does the order matter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, because it's triangulating.  It's a grid.  So give me an address.  Let's do the White House.  The White House, Pennsylvania Avenue Northwest, Washington, D.C. is Kicks Mirror Tops.  Kicks Mirror Tops.  And then if you have the app and you can get it on Android and iOS, you can put in any three words and it will then send that to Google Maps or Waze or Apple Maps and navigate you to that place because it turns it into coordinates, latitude and longitude coordinates.  I just love it.  It's very fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I brought this to the show about three or four years ago.  You did?  Yes.  Yes.  Somewhere in the archives.  It's there.  Somebody I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Bobby Llewellyn tweeted this morning about it.  He said, Elon, you should adopt it now that Mercedes is.  I just think it's the coolest thing.  So you knew all about it.  Yeah.  Well, we've got to give this traction.  It's a really good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's more fragile than actual addresses because if you misremember a word or you change the order, you end up somewhere entirely different.  Yes.  So it's a bit odd.  Whereas the things that there were other things that gave you short ones that basically each letter is reducing the space by a factor of 26 or whatever.  And so those you can get it wrong, but still get close.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's see what I probably need to.  OK.  You're sort of wired into their dictionary, which is a bit weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They changed it, but it was it was hard to actually work out what was going on without without them keeping it up.  I think Big Ben is a fool's finishing nobody.  Just saying what three words Jeff Jarvis is going to take off for pizza.  Thank you for joining us.
