He also joins All About Android fairly frequently.  You've been on all of our shows actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think so. Except for Mac Break Weekly.  I kind of avoid the whole Mac, Apple.  You're more of a Linux guy.  So yeah, I prefer to go on All About Android.  What are you running? You're running Windows it looks like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Windows, I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm shocked.  This is a company laptop so I don't get a choice.  You can't put Linux Mint on there.  I'm dual booting Linux Mint.  But don't tell anybody that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Aaron works at NetApp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  NetApp, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Storage.  Good enough.  Big storage systems for data centers.  Lots of storage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ladies and gentlemen, we can talk today about many things.  As always.  As always.  Jeff, where do you want to start?  Where do you want to start?  Oh God, I don't know.  Should we talk about the Twitter thing that's going back and forth?  I have not yet seen it.  Remember we talked last week Twitter.  Talked a little ad nauseam probably.  That Twitter was going to put a...  I don't know if we actually talked on Twig about this.  I think it broke after Twig.  It was after Twig, yes.  They were going to do as Facebook does.  Not a chronological feed.  But an algorithmic feed that would  surface the best tweets you might have missed.  And then show the rest.  Jack at first said, it's not exactly...  A former Twitter engineer said,  well, it would be great.  And then they've done something.  But they haven't done that yet.  It's kind of...  Whatever it is, I don't have it yet.  It's rolling out.  But the idea is that  it's kind of while you're away.  The while you're away stuff will surface.  But it's algorithmically chosen the best tweets you might have missed.  And then you can go on and see whatever else is going on.  Kind of like while...  I like while you were away.  Jeff, are you getting the new thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I'm not.  I don't think I am.  Nope.  I use TweetDeck anyway, so I'll never get it there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So here it's Jack's tweet.  Tweets you missed from people you follow.  Recapped in reverse cron.  Refresh back to live.  Flip it on to try it out.  Interestingly, this is a seven hour old tweet  that was at the top of my timeline.  Above a one minute old tweet from somebody named Kim.  So, I guess I do have it.  Yeah.  Starting today, you can choose to try our new feature.  So you'll never miss important tweets from people you follow.  Well, I mean, this is the Twitter blog.  You flip on the feature in your settings.  Then when you open Twitter after being away for a while,  the tweets you're most likely to care about will appear at the top of your timeline.  Still recent and in reverse chronological order.  The rest of the tweets will be displayed right underneath.  It's also in reverse chronological order as always.  At any point, just pull to refresh to see all the new tweets at the top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What setting is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, this of course requires that you use either the dedicated Twitter client  or Twitter on the web.  I'm not sure.  I don't know. Shall I look at my settings and see?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can't find. Yeah, I'm looking at the settings right now.  I don't see anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Twitter's settings have gotten like Facebook, large and arcane.  It's just Twitter. It shouldn't be this complicated.  Should it?  No, that's orders.  Mark media, video, do not inform me.  Actually, do inform me before I see media that may be sensitive.  I should turn that one on for sure.  Re-enter your Twitter password to save changes to your account.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I've blocked lots of people.  Woo!  That's a long list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So my question is, what happens when you have a...  Let's say, Leo, you tweet something, right?  And then I reply right away.  And then someone else replies, someone else replies,  and there's this whole kind of conversation flowing in chronological order.  But then it only promotes your part of the conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's one complaint people have had is that conversations will get broken up.  Yeah.  But that's not... the blue line will show you on the web anyway.  If it's a conversation, we'll let you see the conversation, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay. See, I'm not a huge Twitter user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. See, that's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm trying to compare this to Google Cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm a huge Twitter user, and I don't know how that works.  So that's kind of the thing about Twitter is you didn't really have to know anything to use it.  Right.  I don't see a setting either, Jeff, and they weren't clear about where that setting is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Twitter at this moment is releasing its report, financial report.  All right.  And I just saw this from Christina Warren.  And this says that the monthly average users for Q4-15 were actually down on a sequential basis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oy. That's going to kill them in the stock market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The revenue was up 48% from the same period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but this market has never cared about that.  No.  Right? The market only cares about growth.  Growth has been slowing, so Twitter's stock has been diving.  And now with a negative growth, I would imagine it'll dive more.  I want to confirm that, folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't see the story.  I just saw a tweet.  Matthew Ingram retweeted it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why we like the Twitter.  It's all, see?  Was it algorithmically promoted?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is that how you found that?  Breaking business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  Twitter shares plunge after fourth quarter earnings now down 12%, according to MarketWatch.  Except that I'm looking, and now it's up 4%.  Nope.  Now it's down 5%.  It's up.  It's down.  It's down.  It's up.  You see that?  And then it came, and it rebounded a little bit.  But currently, the key is that market cap is now 9.83 billion.  That's what it would cost to do a hostile takeover just to buy it by Twitter, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What was the market cap at its highest?  Everybody have any idea?  A lot more than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  I could probably get a market cap graph.  But I don't, if I cared.  Twitter reported a net loss of $90 million.  That's better, though, than the year to year.  It was $125 million this time last year.  Adjusted earnings per share, $0.16.  That's above the consensus.  So usually the market likes that.  That's probably why it's going up and then down, or down and then up.  Sales of $710 million.  That's almost double what they did a year ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Anthony DeRosa says, if you exclude SMS fast followers, Twitter lost 2 million users since last quarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  However, it reported flat.  $320 million monthly active users.  So it rounded down.  Yeah, and it rounded up.  Well, it didn't do the exclusion that you just described.  What is it, the fast SMS users?  Why would you exclude those?  I don't even know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then Bill Lee says, if you take out 2 billion, 4.2 billion current assets, less 2 billion in liabilities, Twitter is effectively is valued at only 8 billion.  8 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Again, getting more and more affordable.  We learned that last week, Mark Andreessen had, along with Silver Lake, considered buying Twitter outright.  That would be an interesting play.  One of the things, we had Jason Kelley on Twitter a week and a half ago.  And he, I asked him, well, who would buy Twitter?  And he said, well, there's two categories.  There's one, companies like, say, Google or Apple that would integrate it into their existing business.  Twitter would be a value to integrate it into your existing business.  The other would be investment companies intending either to spin off or turn around Twitter.  Mark Andreessen is probably one of the few people in the world who thinks he could turn around Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We'll get to a story later.  Today, he probably doesn't feel too good about being on Twitter.  He stepped in it.  We'll get to that later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's tough.  I mean, it's like Marissa Mayer trying to turn around Yahoo, right?  So I got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Verizon will just buy both Yahoo and Twitter and AOL.  And we'll sit there and we'll never see them again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was the rumor, wasn't it?  That Verizon was looking at Yahoo's properties.  That would make sense.  Verizon bought AOL.  Yeah, you have to feel like if Verizon buys you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it used to be if AOL or Yahoo bought you.  You disappear into the basement.  Yeah, you died.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a conundrum.  I mean, Yahoo's got all of these great assets.  And yet they're not at least from my perspective, people will disagree with me, but they're not compelling anymore.  Right.  And so what do you do?  You're just sitting on these flicker and a couple of other things.  But it's not really compelling.  So the same thing with Twitter for me anyway, it doesn't seem to be as compelling.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like Twitter has the real conundrum on Twitter is that it is kind of inherently valuable as what was it the guy in the New Republic said as kind of the newsfeed of the world.  If you want to know what's happening right now, you go to Twitter.  Right.  Yeah.  And there's a real value there.  Now, with only what is it?  Three hundred twenty million active monthly active users.  It's a I mean, that's a lot of people.  Yeah.  But it's not I guess it's I guess part of the problem is the scale is now dwarfed because of Facebook's one point six billion people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, Twitter could say this is an authentic all the ways to look and value operates, but say we don't want the whole world.  We want the elite people who are actually going to share stuff worth sharing who care about sharing.  And that's where the news is.  You know, it's it's a bit of a spin.  But but maybe there is a way to Twitter is just used by elites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just used by pockets by different social groups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. But there are those who argue actually that it is an elite within Twitter.  And that's where the action is.  Tech showbiz celebrity.  There's a pretty thin layer of Twitter that is most of Twitter.  Yeah.  Anything else from the results?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I'm just kind of scanning them to see if you know, Henry Blodgett tweets now that Twitter's valuation is attractive, by which he means they're attractive for take right for takeover.  I think we will get some news in the next few weeks about a takeover.  Good article by Matthew speaking to Matthew Ingram.  I love Matthew Ingram.  Good article, I think, and I'd love to get your opinion about the Authors Guild and the Google Book scanning.  This is, you know, Google started scanning kind of unilaterally ages ago.  The Authors Guild said you're stealing our stuff.  They lost many times in court because, you know, here's what the here's here's the opinion piece and Wall Street Journal on Monday how Google stole the works of millions of authors.  Authors Guild President Roxanna Robinson writes in 2004 Google sent its moving vans to the libraries and carted off some 20 million books.  What a sinister image.  It copied them all including books in copyright and books not covered by copyright and asked no authors or publishers for permission, and it offered no compensation for their use so they sued and lost and sued again.  They started in 2005 as they started this process and sued again.  And the thing is in in in court in 2013, the judge Jenny Chen ruled that Google's book scanning project met quote all the legal requirements for fair use.  Not only did the scanning and indexing of books provide what the judge called significant public benefits both to authors and book lovers, but Chin said all society benefits.  He said it is a transformational use reminder here Google never makes the full contents of the book available for reading its snippets.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And they do a bit Google is doing what a library patron does Google borrows the book, you can do whatever it wants with that book and it gives the book back.  Well, okay, so it records the book it copies the book right that's the issue.  We went through that exact same argument when it came to VCRs right that the act that is somehow copying for an internal use was a copyright violation copyright law I'm coming to see more and more and more Larry Lessig was right is is an out loaded concept.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, so, in fact, the author's guild is now appealed to the Supreme Court, and is hoping the Supreme Court will hear it.  But the author's guild is somewhat according to Matthew Ingram changed its argument saying lower courts have in fact distorted copyright law beyond its original meaning by over emphasizing this transformative use transformative use is one of four measures for fair use if it if it's a  transformative use of the original, it's considered a fair use.  The court has to consider the purpose of the infringing use the nature of the original work the amount of the original work used and the impact the infringement might have in the market for the original.  So, in the new argument, the new brief before the Supreme Court hoping they'll take the case they haven't yet. The author's guild says the Second Circuit's refusal to give real weight to any factor other than the perceived transformative purpose also contracts the approach  mandated in other circuits more fundamentally. It threatens to undermine protection of copyrighted works in a digital age to an extraordinary extent such a radical rewrite of copyright law should not be allowed to stand without this court's consideration Matthew point says this is, this is, in a sense, the lawyers for the author's guild dangling a carrot in front of the justice is saying now you really want to take this case because we're talking about, you know, massive, right, subtle transformation of the copyright law raises the state of  the stakes. Yeah, it's not just about us.  I, you know, on the one hand, if the Supreme Court took this case, they could settle it once and for all and it would help a little bit in an understanding in kind of understanding of what copyright means in the digital or you can argue that it's already been settled once and for all.  Yes, yeah, by certain reason. Yeah, two separate court opinions.  Why is he Jeff, you're an author.  Why does Margaret Atwood hate Google so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I know it's it's, you know, it's this notion of content.  I was talking with somebody a very smart guy last week who was looking into government data.  And, and he was trying to look for the economic benefit of government data being being opened. And I said, you know, to me, the way to attack this question is that in the case of government data and know this is going to sound like it's irrelevant but I'll get there in a second.  There should never ever be a question of copyright. Number one because information cannot be owned. And in the case of data it's a clear case of that only the treatment of information can be owned that's copyright.  So there should never be a question that government has copyright on data especially as our data second issue of course is that it's all we've already paid for it is ours. There's economic benefit to it, and government should never own copyright in my view.  Now you transfer that to this to what Google has done it's not just about, you know, Google didn't in a sense I would argue, copy the pros to have the pros Google copy the data to have the data.  You know what does mankind say and all of its books, with humankind pardon me say that all of its books.  That's information that's data that's knowledge that's that's worth having there is a societal benefit as the judge said, they didn't copy it to go read the books for free or to sell the books to others would say it is in fact indeed a different transformative use that I think does fit fair use but authors just can't get their heads around that because they  and just like newspapers just like magazines just like TV stations. We sell content and as long as you stay in the business of selling content.  You're gonna be commodified.  And I think that's an outmoded business model.  Well and also, oh good.  I was just saying I was saying to kill books I'm not saying to kill copyright, but is that the basis of business models going forward I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I don't even think you have to be that kind of transformative about the whole thing. This is a very straightforward. In my opinion, use is what Google's was created to index all information to make it available to your fingertips.  It are not selling the book. They're not right. They're not giving you the full text of the book. They're letting you search.  What would otherwise be a dark area which is the context of books so you can discover it, find it and even in some cases buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's exactly my point. And that's what I was going to bring up is that if you're an author, don't you want your work to be discovered?  I mean, do you want to be regulated to doing book signings at bookstores? Not the bookstores are bad. Love bookstores. But you're missing out on a whole broader universe of exposure to your work.  And I know that I don't know about you guys, but I have found books on Google, books through Google searches that I do where I was looking for something very specific.  And oh, by the way, there's a book and I can tell by scanning, you know, how they let you they let you look at a snippet of the book.  I looked at that. I'm like, oh, yeah, this is exactly what I'm looking for. I'm going to go buy this right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly. And a clear lesson that I've learned in the business, whether this is news stories or books or music or whatever it is, your content is your best ad.  The content itself is what draws people. You know, Ruben Murdoch arguing that a three line snippet is theft.  Of course, we know is patently absurd that that three line snippet actually might be too short to effectively send audience to what you've made.  So I don't think there's that much new in this case.  I you know, if the street I hope the Supreme Court doesn't take it because I think it's settled law now.  If they do, I shudder to think what they might do.  But, you know, there's Lawrence Lessig tried to take the extensions of copyright to the Supreme Court and he failed there.  Supreme Court in the past has not been terribly interested in I think in revisiting copyright.  So we'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Ngram viewer is a really good example, somebody says in the chat room of how this is transform transformative.  Give me let's do a search. You can you could search across books from 1800 to the year 2000.  You can use multiple search so you can see how let's say the the tragedy of the commons.  And Judy, I don't know why I know why I'm searching for that of the commons.  Let's see how that search term being much more mentioned ever since 1964.  I mean, that's a silly. What would be a good example?  Television. Oh, yeah, good radio newspaper television.  And see how these trends have changed. Radio peaked in 1945 when it got more, you know, more than twice the number of mentions of newspapers.  TV started going up then radio went down. But TV crossed radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The television didn't peak the way radio did. Yeah. Well, not yet.  It was kind of a well, not yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  1978 it crossed radio. And of course, it continues to be number one now.  Newspapers, though, their peak was also in kind of in the 30s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it's but it's held fairly steady ever since, which would argue the radio was more was a more transformative societal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, that's how an academic uses this kind of stuff. Yeah.  It's really I'm grams are really great. OK, how about video games?  Here's a good one. Video games, television, radio.  No video. But remember, it stops at 2000.  And besides, that's probably not, you know, best term to use.  Anyway, you get the idea. Run your own experiment.  Raw data is also available for download, which is kind of cool.  All right. I'm still I still don't see the but apparently today we will see the new algorithmic feed on Twitter.  I'm still waiting for that to kick in. But maybe because I live on Twitter, I always have it open.  I'm not seeing what I have to take a day off. Yeah, that's what I'll do.  That's what I'll do. I won't use Twitter now for a while.  Oh, party's over for Twitter VIPs, ads back in our feed.  I have not seen ads on Twitter in some time.  I don't even see promoted trends right now on my Twitter feed.  But apparently that's going to be over. Mark Andreessen started seeing promoter tweets just a couple of just yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Enough Twitter knows enough enough Google Books News.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's see. How about Bandito? Let's take a break.  We'll talk about Bandito, OK, because I'm curious.  I can read that story. I hadn't read that.  Oh, I think about it. So what I hadn't read yet.  So I got to read that. Yeah. Super Bowl also breaks the record for streaming video.  3.96 million unique viewers.  Can we do that on our feeds?  We get to four million simultaneous viewers.  Let's try that. You broke the Internet. You broke the Internet.  Harry's. Let's talk shaving.  I'm here with two bearded men.

Transcript:  When I went off to college, I stopped shaving and the first time I shaved since then was at the Twin Studio.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  Yeah.  Why do you why do you shave with why do you shave with the grain?  I've always shaved up and down and everybody tells me no, you're not supposed to do that.  Oh, well, otherwise I can't get it off.  Yeah.  The first time down just gets kind of the top layer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you know, my Harry's I use Harry's probably too long.  But I know that moment when it doesn't just come right off against the grain.  Yeah.  Time to change the change of the blade.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  3.96 million viewers of Super Bowl 50 on CBS and none of them saw those commercials.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I watched all commercials beforehand anyway.  Right. That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you're an Internet viewer, you saw the commercials on YouTube.  So what do you need to which weren't very impressive this year?  I know the game wasn't great either, but the game often is not great because it's such a letdown after all the hype for you.  After all the hype for two weeks, they they average viewers per minute was 800,000.  And the total number of minutes, 213 million, which is interesting that a lot of people watched for more, you know, on average for a long time, 101 minutes, which is an awful lot.  Yeah, it is, you know.  The prior record was 1.1 million viewers Super Bowl 2014.  And then, yeah, I think that was the prior record.  I don't know what happened the year after that.  We're getting closer to a world where we don't have to have a cable to watch the stuff we want to watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know. I've heard some contrary opinions.  Really?  Just yesterday, I think on NPR or the day before, I guess they were talking about this.  I'm trying to look it up to see see who it was.  But yeah, basically the guy that they had on said, you know what?  There's no way for live sports.  There's no way you're ever going to be able to in the foreseeable future replace television for live viewers of a live event.  Well, it's true with four million is nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Compared to the exactly what is it?  Two hundred million that watched.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And at first I was like, no, no, the Internet's great.  What are you talking about?  And then I was like, oh, yeah, that is a lot of that's a lot of simultaneous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You do that 110 TV viewers, 100 million TV viewers.  So you need some sort of M bone solution.  It's funny because we had this solution in the early days of the Internet.  The M bone was created by University walks to do better streaming and worked quite well, but has since been decommissioned.  Remember the M bone?  That ring a bell.  I remember the multi cast backbone.  The idea was one server can't serve 100 million people.  But what you do is one server serves 10 servers, serves a thousand servers.  And and by multi casting, you're able to serve everybody who needs to be served.  It's I guess it's essentially kind of a mesh topology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yep. This was Dan Rayburn, by the way, in case people are interested on NPR.  Dan is the executive vice president at Streaming Media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And he does a Steve streaming blog and he makes he raises a good point.  But Dan is also a little bit of a he's a more conservative general about this stuff, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did any of you I didn't try to use it, but the but it's not live.  But the BitTorrent streaming client. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How to work. Are you used it or do you not want to admit to it?  No, no, I was saying, yes, I know what that is.  Yeah, no, they've started doing streaming using which would, I guess, kind of be like a M bone idea because it's a peer to peer network.  Yeah, yeah. It's not live. Yeah, but that might work.  Actually distributed distribution. That's how Skype worked.  That's how Kazaa worked before Skype. That's how Google's going to work pretty soon, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  With the hangouts, hangouts. That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're going to start using a peer to peer network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wonder whether it'll be good enough for us then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, we for all the years we use Skype when they weren't owned by Microsoft, Microsoft killed Skype's supernode feature.  But in the years before they were acquired, they had something called a supernode.  But it would only work if you were not behind a router.  Then you could be part of a peer to peer network because the creators of Skype were the creators of Kazaa before that.  So Skype was initially conceived of as a peer to peer network because that seemed to work better.  But I would imagine that increases latency. We always used a dedicated port.  That was one of the secret things, not secret, but one of the special things that we would do to improve our Skype is to make sure that nobody was getting supernoted.  That was as close to a direct point to point connection.  So supernoting relieves the network maybe, but it doesn't it doesn't help.  I think it doesn't help improve latency.  The 1994 Rolling Stones concert from Dallas was the first major cyberspace multicast concert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mick Jagger opened the concert by saying, I want to say a special welcome to everyone that's climbed into the Internet tonight and has got into the M bone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I hope it doesn't all collapse. Mick Jagger is not the person I want to hear saying that. Climb into the Internet and get on my M bone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know what the total number it says. 50,000 fans were able to watch over the M bone. That's pretty good for 94.  If you think back to 94, I mean, that's pretty darn good. It did require some specialized hardware to do.  So you told me, speaking of cake, cord cutting to and I think Dan's right that live events will be tough.  Live. Yeah. Yeah. But a lot of what we consume is not in real time.  And it was last week, Jeff, that you told me to download Horace and Pete.  Yeah, I did. Louis CK's five dollar an episode.  Strange. It was more like theater than a television show.  Yeah, but the cast was what blew me away, including that only Louis CK, but Alan Alda,  Shep Sibu Shemi, she was just Jessica Lang sit at the bar, Stephen, right at the end of the bar.  So Falco, I didn't get I'll be honest. I didn't get far enough in to see Edie Falco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you didn't you didn't. I tried. Oh, I think it's brilliant. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I missed the last track. Ah, episode two. It's very dry.  It sounds very dry. There's a lot of it since Louis CK with his but it's like a theater with no audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's just very it is. But it really gets amazing. And the second episode, though, it's not a comedy.  I had four belly laughs. So there's another episode. Oh, yeah.  No, this is an ongoing series every week. So the first episode was five dollars.  And then he sent out a funny email. I quoted it in that link there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So why did the dirty F balls? Why the dirty F balls? Did I charge you five dollars for Horace and Pete?  Well, the dirty, unmovable fact is this show is effing expensive.  Louis CK never known for his cleanliness of speech. He has two sets, four cameras.  Of course, a great cast, an original theme song by Paul Simon.  He says every every every second the cameras are rolling.  Money is shooting out of my butt like your mother's worst diarrhea.  Basically, this is a handmade one guy paid for a version of a thing that's usually made by a giant corporation.  It's very much like a play. I mean, it's written like a play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a little mammoth like maybe that was the other great, great line from I think it was Variety or Daily Hollywood.  Hollywood Reporter said and I'll read this.  It starts as a Eugene O'Neill play about his brothers being a struggling joint transitions into a David Mamet drama about political correctness and generational definitions of masculinity becomes a Norman Lear sitcom about contemporary political attitudes pivots into a Chekhov saga.  Right. About an underestimated woman reclaiming the birth rate and settles into a Mike Lee kitchen sink dramedy about painful blue collar family revelations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's all of that at once. And that's where I was a little unsettled by it.  It's it's amazing. It felt like it couldn't figure out what it wanted to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it's it's all those things. And the second episode is just beautiful skewering of irony and hipsters.  It's a dive bar in Brooklyn, a fight over closing it.  Alan Alda is the grumpiest bartender ever on earth.  Alan Alda is wonderful. He is eating the scenery, man. He is having a wonderful and he loves the opportunity to say very nasty words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, long strings, chains of very nasty words.  It's Alan Alda as you've never seen him before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I'll ruin one thing. So so a hipster comes in, the hipsters come in and say, Whoa, wow, how cool is the big old.  And so one of them goes up to buy a Budweiser, no mixed drinks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He doesn't buy a Budweiser. He wants like a margarita or some gin and tonic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, no, no, the second episode. So he buys a beer.  Oh, OK. And he's charged 450. Yeah.  And he says, Stalin, all that you charge the guy over there, three dollars.  And Alan Alda says, you know, pour beer out of your head. I don't care.  It's 450 and back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.  So Louie comes along and says, I'll take care of this. I'll take care of this.  And Louie doesn't back down and charge. He says 450 for you.  And he's the other guy's three dollars. Yeah, he's been here a long time.  And and and but why is it for me?  He said, listen, you got to come in here and you got beer and irony.  That guy's been here for years. All he does is get the.  The patron says, so you're saying this is a douche tax.  Louie says, yes, exactly. He pays 450.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but he did get the irony for free. Yeah.  Oh, my God, that's hysterical. It's wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Great moments like that. It's not for I tell you, it's not for everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's not. I'll be honest, not even for Louie, necessarily for Louis C.  Keefe, Suki K fans, because it's not like the show Louie, for instance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it's not. But it's but the observational wry.  Oh, my God. This world makes no sense to me.  Worldview belt on channel is in there. Yeah, I like it.  It's his he's written, directed, produced by him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's some stuff.  For one thing, Louie always feels like he forgot his line and he's looking for it and then says it.  He's I can't quite figure out what it is about his demeanor.  He's not a natural actor.  In chat room, any of you watch it?  Yes, I'm did. Guy Smiley says it has very strong language.  Just by the way, had it been a comedy, P.S.  Chop says he should have said, well, in that case, I'll take a beer.  Hold the irony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do we know how many of these I'm just looking at the prices as five dollars for the first one and two dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then he's going to do three hours from then on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The people have like the beer thing.  He's just charging whatever the hell he feels like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's tough for me to swallow.  Not that that's an incredible amount of money.  And I guess if the show was fair amount of money.  I was thinking if I were going to the movies, I'd pay three times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, if you were buying a play, the first episode is one hundred seven minutes.  Yes, and it is a play.  It could be shorter, actually.  Well, I don't know.  I'm disappointed you didn't like it.  I'm sorry. I didn't hate it.  I didn't finish it.  At least I watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's definitely not her cup of tea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's not a big fan of irony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Salespeople, money people generally aren't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, she's not.  I think there's a certain personality that enjoys this kind of stuff.  Yeah.  And it is very much like a play.  I mean, if you think of it as not a TV show and at first you look at it and say, oh, there's going to be cheers.  It's not cheers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, no, there's no norms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a play.  But what I do like and I really enjoyed was that you feel like you're looking at a creative process, that you have these very talented actors.  And Louie just said, hey, let's get together and do something.  And you feel like you're kind of in on something that they're creating on the spot, which is nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The key here is that that that kind of Mickey and Judy, let's oh, hey, kids, let's put on a show in the barn.  He could do it on his own.  Right now, he could only do that because he has the fame that big old media brought him by being a star.  That's true.  That's the Howard Stern's argument about his podcast is that you can't be big unless you were already big.  And nonetheless, he says this isn't made by a big corporation.  Right.  He can make whatever the eff he wants and he can charge you for it and you can curse at him or not.  He doesn't care.  There it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Well, I hope he does well with it.  We could have probably saved him some money if he wanted to shoot it here.  I think that he's probably paying Hollywood prices.  Right.  It's not that expensive to have a four camera shoot.  And our lighting would have been better, frankly, his lighting was not very good.  But other than that.  The set wasn't expensive.  No, it's a cheap set.  That was the point.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But it doesn't look like a cheap set, but it looks like a set.  It looks like a play.  It really looked like a play.  It is.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And as I said last week, there are very current two day old references in it.  He shot it right.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was kind of wild.  He's talking about the...  They say, yeah, the Iowa caucuses are tomorrow.  I mean, it was very, you know, like, oh, this was just...  They just must have done this yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think they did that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They must have done that in advance.  No, no, no.  Because he mentioned stuff that happened.  Yeah.  Did you see the debates and...  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Which is really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's pretty fast.  I think he's doing basically live to tape.  Yeah.  It looks like it's done live to tape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Huh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although there are obviously some rehearsal involved and stuff.  And I'm sure those actors aren't cheap.  Although I would expect he could go to them and say, I want to do something interesting.  You want to do it for scale?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I adore that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Bandito is an interesting idea.  It's basically with the Washington Post.  Remember, the Washington Post was purchased by Jeff Bezos.  And as you would expect, Bezos is bringing in some digital content stuff.  This is very much like the A-B testing that websites do.  Exactly.  Bandito promotes the story, the version of the story with the most popular headline and images.  So when editors enter in an article into the digital part, obviously the newspaper doesn't do this,  but then digital part of their website, in their website, the editor can use different versions of the articles,  different headlines, different images, different teaser text.  The technology offers it up in a variety of ways to viewers and then decides which one is the most successful  and optimizes, starts serving that version more frequently on the homepage.  Isn't that interesting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So what's new here is the fact that they're doing this automatically without...  They have a tool.  Without intervention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah.  And it's also, I think, I mean, people do A-B testing, but you don't do it like all the time.  But this is kind of institutionalized it into their workflow.  So they just do it all the time.  I wonder if BuzzFeed or ViceDoos has something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sure. Yes, absolutely.  I mean, I get the difference here that says in the story is that it kind of does it automatically.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  The first iteration of the tool optimizes content based purely on the number of clicks,  but the company hopes soon to factor in other metrics, including how much time readers spend after they click reading.  This isn't just about clicks, says Sam Hahn, engineering director of data science.  How many newspapers have an engineering director of data science?  I know. I know.  Clickbait works for a while, but not long term.  I like hearing that.  Engagement is a better metric to focus on, but we're not going to optimize just to that.  We'll find a good balance.  Wow.  You got to figure.  Issue to me.  Go ahead.  You got to figure that Jeff put him on a plane and flew him over to the Post and said, hey, help these guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, I'm delighted that Bezos is investing in the Post.  I wish they were more public and more generous in sharing what they're learning with other newspapers.  I understand kind of why they're not.  But the only real competition they have is the New York Times.  Everybody else is another world.  And it's really neat that they are competing heavily with the New York Times.  They a couple of months ago gained more U.S. audience than the Times.  As the Times goes more international.  Look at what happened with the Times.  The Times was a huge paper in New York.  It's not that big a paper in New York now.  It's a national paper.  As the Times becomes international, the Post becomes the national paper.  That's very, very interesting.  The problem I have here is there's still this is true of every damn media company out there.  They're still shooting for page views and page views inevitably leads you down the road to cats and Kardashians.  And we've got to move up to higher level relationships.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, this is to me, this is a little bit of a red light here.  This quote.  Yes, we have to be more careful in that area because they're talking about measuring.  Bandito may even begin to factor in other more detailed information about post readers into its decision making,  such as whether or not a user is an existing subscriber and types of content they've engaged in within the past,  kind of like the algorithmic feed that give you more of the stuff you like.  We will be more careful in that area, says Han, because of privacy.  And then this is the thing that worries me.  And because we need to be sure we're providing right leaning and left leaning content equally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I can argue that both ways, because I can also say that that's the false balance of one column A, one from column B, Chinese menu journalism.  If the right has not or if the left has nothing smart to say today and nothing major to say today,  why do you have to equal out the number of left column inches to the number of right column inches?  I understand the argument.  It's a filter bubble argument that says that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What if the Boston Globe only showed those articles about the priests molestations to non-Catholics just to avoid controversy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you shouldn't do that. That would be a bad.  That would be wrong.  Yeah, that'd be wrong.  Here's the way I, a smart editor I know, I work with in New Jersey, stood at a white board a couple years ago.  We had this discussion and he said, listen, right now we serve everybody 100% the same thing.  And he said, what if we could just get 20% of that that's more relevant to you?  The other 80% is what editors choose to buy.  Oh, that might be all right.  But just 20% is more relevant to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or even 50-50 or even in the other way, 80% relevant and 20% outside the filter bubble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you're still going to have things that editors say to you.  You need to know this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You may not want to know about it, but you need to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You may not read it, but we're going to present it to you.  That's always going to be the case in these products.  And I don't mean to take away that editorial prerogative, but there is tons of noise that is irrelevant to me.  Number one. Number two, there's also too much content.  The Guardian, which I work with in full disclosure and dearly love, produces four to six hundred pieces of content a day.  In no rational world can you imagine that a reader is going to come in and I saw it all.  I'm sated now.  No, you've got to do a better job of giving people greater relevance within that structure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I think it's not a direct parallel here.  But what you're saying, I mean, when I use Google's news app, they show you, they say, are you interested in this?  We've noticed that you've been searching for this. They don't say that.  That something pops up that I was searching on over the past week a lot.  Something will pop up and says, are you interested in this?  And a lot of times it's stuff from my kids that I'm not interested in.  Then I can click yes or no.  And it's not the whole, that actually is about 20 percent of the headlines feed.  Is that here's suggestions for you based on your interest.  And the rest is world headlines, US headlines, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  But I like the way they do it. I actually like that.  Because then I can say, yes, I'm interested in Raspberry Pi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, this is another example of there are a lot of examples in technology of things the end user loves, but may not be good for him.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So the real issue is it is in everybody's interest, except for societies, that you only see stuff you agree with.  You'll be happier. You'll click more. You'll buy more products.  Everybody will be happier if we just eliminate all that irritation.  Right.  But that's not what we want.  But you may end up ignorant.  Yeah, but you will be. Yeah.  You won't have any idea what's really going on because you're only seeing stuff you agree with.  Yeah.  I do worry a little bit about that.  I'm not like you.  I kind of dismissed Eli Pariser's article, arguments in the filter bubble, because I felt like you, Jeff, that the real value and promise of the Internet is that we are exposed to far more than we ever got exposed to before.  But if algorithmically, this is like ad tech.  This is why we can't have nice things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We haven't done it with content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is why we can't have nice things, because then algorithmically they figure out, oh, you know, it's just irritating to show these guys stuff that they don't like.  Making them angry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think you're being typically dystopian.  I think that our business has done a terrible, terrible job of giving us relevance.  It treats us as a mass.  It gives us a one size fits all product.  It has to move this way.  Now, the question is, what signals does it use and how does it use them?  You know, I'm not a sports fan.  Stop wasting your time trying to promote sports to me.  I'm not going to want it unless I go searching for it.  I actually like media stories.  I like stories about Google.  How nice to me if there's a story buried in the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times about Google.  I would like it to raise that to my attention.  That's a perfectly fine thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just worry when the marketing department gets a seat at the editorial table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's actually the opposite.  The marketing department's been doing this for years.  Now, finally, the editorial is going to use these skills and tools for the benefit of the user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good.  From your mouth to marketing's ear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And so, my wish for the Washington Post and Bezos' involvement has long been from the day it was announced he was buying it.  I argue that we've got to shift to a relationship-based strategy in news and Bezos and relevance and value.  And Bezos understands relevance built on relationship data better than anybody there is.  And so, those are the skills I want to see him bring to the Post.  Now, you can do this badly, right?  Programmatic and retargeting advertising.  You look at Amazon, you look at those boots, those boots follow you around for six weeks.  Long after you bought the frigging boots.  That's a bad implementation of what otherwise could be a useful technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think most of the time when people don't like ad customization is because it's done, it's because the algorithms suck.  If it did it well, they wouldn't even know what's happening.  They just go, God, I love it because I only see ads for stuff I'm about to buy.  But computers aren't that smart yet.  Yep.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree.  We're all in agreement here.  We're all in agreement here.  Sundar Pichai got a nice little bonus.  Little.  The new CEO of Google.  I love the article in The Verge by Michael Singleton.  Sundar Pichai is having a better February than you are.  270,000 shares of restricted stock currently worth $199 million.  I wonder what the vesting period is.  Yeah.  The largest equity stake given to an executive officer whose grants have been publicly fired in the company's history.  So what you're saying is they're often with this kind of stock award, there are often restrictions on how quickly he can capitalize on it.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You have one of two things.  You either have options or you have restricted.  Restricted is a gift to him at a date in the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, these are restricted stock.  That's interesting.  They're not options.  Restrictions is an option to buy this at a price.  Usually a strike price is lower than the current price.  That's the theory anyway.  But a restricted stock gift means you here have some stock.  And of course it'll go up and down.  And typically you'd say you get 20% in the first year, another 20% every year thereafter till the fifth year when you've finally vested 100%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or in some cases they do.  It's just five years out and it's a lump sum.  You don't get any of it.  We kept you here for five years.  And the problem is, the only problem is that you were getting it from, because it's not an option, you paid nothing for it.  So you have to pay taxes on the full value of what you require, which means you usually, that's when you see executives sell stock in their own company.  It's often to pay the taxes on a reward like that because it's a lump sum.  That's a very nice thing to get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you get 200 million, but you got to give the government half.  Yeah.  The company also gave the CFO Ruth Porat $38.3 million in stock.  She's been earning her keep.  Yeah, you bet.  And Diane Greene, the head of the cloud business, $42.8 million.  So they're all doing nicely.  Those are based on current Google's current price.  Of course, if Google's stock value goes up, so will there.  It says Pachai and Porat Stock Awards will vest in quarterly increments through 2019.  So it's only three years.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  2019, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So not only is Google the most valuable company in the world, it's got the richest executives.  The richest executives.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Arguably.  Nice work if you can get it.  We're going to take a break, come back with more.  Aaron Newcomb is here from NetApp, regular on many of our shows, including, he's brought a little maker thing.  Yes, I always bring a project.  Including Floss Weekly and the new screensavers.  We'll see that as your pick of the week.  That is.  Okay, good.  That's my project.  I have a makery pick myself.  I don't.  And Jeff, you can just do a number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm clumsy.  I can't build any things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you still have your 3D doodler pen?  Oh, yeah, somewhere.  You ever use that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You ever break it out?  I think I'm going to bring...  About as often as I use my Google Glass, yeah.  I shouldn't say that.  It's not nice, but it's a very nice device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I also have a cabinet of lost toys.  Oh, do you ever?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, do you ever?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I bought the...  Remember the book light that you got on the Kickstarter and I got the cheap Chinese clone?  It's pretty nice.  Bamboo.  It looks like a book.  In fact, Lisa was...  Yeah, that.  I love that.  Mine has a bamboo cover.  Lisa saw it on my bedside table and she said, what's this?  She thought, oh, it's his journal.  Let me read it.  And he opened it up and it was a big light.  It's a big light.  I was just going to turn it on.  Earlier we did a triangulation with the founder of Sphero, the guy who invented the Sphero and the BB-8 and stuff.  And he gave me his business card.  This is the coolest thing ever.  It's a circuit board, pre-punched breadboard that you could then add the components to.  And he showed me a picture.  He made a car out of it.  You turn on the light on your smartphone and it follows the light.  Nice.  Yeah, I don't know what it can do.  I don't know where the specs are, but what a good idea for a business card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I was going to do that and I did the paper one.  Remember that?  Yeah.  I've still got it in there somewhere.  Paper was a lot cheaper for me.  I'm seeing more and more.  These are expensive too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would imagine this is five bucks a business card.  You don't get those at Vista Print.  Makes me jealous though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they're cool.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who gave us a... was it Kevin Mitnick?  I think Kevin Mitnick's business card is a lockpick set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, yes, yes, it is.  Yep, yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Legal in some states.  Wouldn't that be weird if your business card were illegal in the state of California?  Our show today brought to you by Nature Box.  Oh, is it snack time?  Yay!

No, not yet.  And we had somebody I know on Sunday who works at AWS.  And he said, have you written any Echo commands?  And I said, you can write them yourself?  He said, oh, yeah, you just go on Lambda, AWS Lambda.  And there's a whole API.  You can write them in any language you want.  He was using Node.js.  You can use Python, Ruby, anything you want.  You write them.  And so you can have your own private commands.  Or if it works well, you can publish them.  And obviously, Amazon's doing that because the Echo commands are going crazy.  They just added Domino's Pizza and Ubers.  So you can say, Echo, get me a car.  It'll use your Uber account.  And the car will pull up.  Yep.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Love this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A friend of mine does this whole shopping list that way.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Me too.  Because we have an Echo in the kitchen and the bedroom.  So Lambda.  Do you know about AWS Lambda?  Because I had never heard of this before.  It's kind of a neat idea.  It lets you run code.  But you don't have to provision a server.  So normally, like on AWS, you would spin up a Linux instance.  And it'd be yours.  But Lambda, you pay only for the compute time you consume.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Which is awesome.  Especially for developers.  If you're starting a company, starting a new app, anything like that, you don't want to have to even bother setting up your own instance and have it running without using it most of the time.  You just want to run your code, have it work.  I think this is great.  And I think it's great that Google is jumping on board here, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's the story.  But let me just finish this.  So the reason they use it, that's great for the Echo.  And if somebody wants to just do something, it doesn't cost you anything unless there's a fixed cost of whatever, one tenth of one cent per command.  But it's going to be minuscule.  It's minuscule.  And you don't, so you don't have to pay to spin up a server all month long to issue a few commands.  So Google, seeing the success of this, says we're going to do our own.  It's called the Google Cloud Platform.  Google, it's called Google Cloud Functions.  You can set up functions that get triggered in response to certain events, much like Lambda.  Now, they say this is in alpha and you have to get access by filling out a form and they will grant you access.  No blog post, no tweet.  But thanks to VentureBeat, we know that they're doing this.  This comes up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Remember we talked about a Werner Vogels column that he wrote about two months ago?  Remind me.  It was, I'm just trying to find it.  It's, he was arguing, it's kind of how the web separated content from presentations.  This separates code from server.  Yeah.  And it goes to kind of a radically distributed view.  And in a content perspective, you could have content that sits out there as a blob of content that doesn't really have an address or doesn't have anything.  It starts to get you to read.  There is a brilliant unsung guy and it gets you to rethink a lot of how this operates.  We live in an amazing world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Java man in our chat room actually reminds me that the first million requests on Lambda are free.  So unless you write a very elaborate, you must have to write the most popular echo command ever.  Somebody's written a fart machine, different farts every time you ask.  That might be exceeding the million requests.  But after.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is there a directory of?  Oh, yeah.  You can just put on your.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you go to your Amazon account.  What do you have at Echo?  No, I don't.  Well, let me go to my Amazon account.  I can show you it's it is exploding.  Partly because it's so easy and inexpensive to do this.  There's no reason not to.  I mean, if you have an idea.  So let me look at my Echo.  Or maybe I have to go to devices.  I was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can go to the Echo website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, there's an echo not on Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's got its own.  It's got its own site.  It's where you can access.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because I also use the.  I'm trying to find the site.  I also use.  The app. There's an app.  That's the easiest way to do it.  Oh, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was just going to say I'm going to have it on.  Alexa.Amazon.  They'd have to be in the same room with the device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. So the app.  So what I keep a Kindle fire next to my Alexa.  Because it shows the apps and then actually you can then vote.  It says, did I do a good job?  You say yes or no.  Here you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the skills here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here it is. I got it.  Fart for me.  Oh, oh, this is because I asked for.  So here you go.  I said fart for me and it didn't.  So I can say, did Alexa do what you wanted?  No.  But that's probably because I didn't turn on the skill.  So let's go here and look.  Alexa is such a long thing now.  There are 24 pages of skills.  Daily affirmation, rock paper.  You could play rock paper scissors.  I play Jeopardy.  I'll give you six Jeopardy questions.  That's official.  That's from the Bart status.  You could say, what's the Bart status?  There's a Super Bowl trivia quiz.  Alexa, open the magic door.  I'm sorry.  Didn't need to say that out loud.  I'm going to make it a deep trouble.  There's a magic eight ball.  Let me let me search for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You should have an Alexa on the desk as part of the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm thinking I'm going to buy one for.  Yeah.  So here it is.  Alexa, ask for a fart.  What's enabled?  I just didn't ask for a fart the right way.  So next time I will say Alexa, ask for a fart.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I said it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See, if we bring one into studio, though, the Amazon will know when we accidentally trigger.  Yeah, because it'll start talking and looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, I'm going to order one right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you did notice there was an update to the terms and agreements on the AWS.  Oh, yeah, it's in the rundown.  They had a big change in the terms.  Oh, no.  One of the things they included is where to go.  So it talks about the you know, you can't use it for nuclear facilities, manned spacecraft, military use in connection with live combat.  However, fair enough.  However, this restriction will not.  Let me put it up here.  Apparently you can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a zombie apocalypse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, this restriction will not apply in the event of the occurrence certified by the United States Center of Disease Control or successor body.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of a widespread viral infection transmitted via bites or contact with bodily fluid that causes human corpses to reanimate and seek to consume living flesh, blood, brain or nerve tissue and is likely to result in the fall of organized civilization.  In that case, have had it.  I love it.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was thinking about that today.  I wonder whether you have a joke like that in there with the lawyers.  Did that have to go up to Jeff Bezos?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would be mad if I were Jeff Bezos and I didn't get to approve that.  Didn't know about that.  Yeah.  Amazon also announced something new called Lumberyard that I am very intrigued by.  This is a this is a game platform.  So it's a free cross-platform free cross-platform 3D game engine tightly integrated with Twitch.  Remember Amazon acquired Twitch.  Everybody was that.  What are they going to do with that?  It has, you know, plugins galore.  Here's a game ready wilderness assets case.  You need to build a forest scene.  Beach City asset package, including 1950s jukeboxes and others.  This is fascinating to me.  So if you've been if you're a game dev or a kid, see, this is what I find interesting.  If you're a kid who wants to develop games, Amazon is just going to basically enable this for you.  Wow.  Wow.  I'm impressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ready to use art assets.  You don't even have to be a designer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can, you know, you don't.  I wouldn't know how to design it.  A woodland forest.  You don't have to just download the textures in your set.  They even support multiplayer games.  Yeah.  We live in like I said, this is an amazing time to be a kid because you can, you know, and I think it's probably a fairly logical step from doing Minecraft.  Then you get about 18 or 19 and you say, I want to do something that's not just a game.  Yeah.  And because it works with Twitch, you're kind of already socially and it's socially enabled.  I'm going to have to play around with this.  I love doing map development for for games and things like that.  I always found that really interesting.  So and my kids now are picking that up with Minecraft and with other games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're like, hey, could I make my own game?  I'm like, yeah, I can do that.  I can do that.  I can do that.  I can do that.  I can do that.  I can do that.  I can do that.  I can do that.  And with other games, they're like, hey, could I make my own map for this game or, you know, could I make a multiplayer map that people that my friends can get on?  And so they're getting into it too.  And this sounds really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And again, like all AWS services in case of zombie attack, you could continue to use the game engine and run nuclear generators or.  This lumber yard is kind of mind boggling.  They have the Krytek engine and that's for crisis, right?  That's the best.  That's what it is.  That's one of the best ones.  I mean, you're getting access to the like top of the line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, for sure.  I mean, Unreal Engine is probably the most part.  They recently announced that they were not not for they would give a giveaway for free up to a certain point.  And then when you start taking revenue, you you owe some money, but you can get started for free on Unreal Engine for now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This says free to download, no seat fees, no subscription fees, no requirement to share.  No requirement.  It's free free.  Huh?  And then it has Twitch chat play.  You can use drag and drop visual scripting to create gameplay features that let Twitch viewers use chat to impact the game they're watching.  So this is probably similar to the technology that they use on Twitch when you're Twitch plays Pokemon.  Yeah.  So that the chat actually talks to the cry engine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. So it's so it's saying that Amazon will make money off Amazon Web Services that are the developers use to build or support their games.  That's how they're going to make money.  They give this away for free and they say, oh, well, you're going to need a place to run it.  So run it on AWS.  Wow.  Game lift has a dollar fifty per one thousand daily active user fee in addition to standard fees for any other Amazon Web Services used, I guess, three or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What language do I write things as a C++ or is there a scripting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know. Is it all gooey? Is it all?  The images make it look like it's all gooey, but it can't be right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They do have a managed service for deploy that you pay for for deploying, operating and scaling server based online games using AWS Game Lift.  And that's going to cost you but affordable.  A buck fifty per thousand daily active users.  Amazing. You know, I wish I had the skills to use this kind of stuff, but I'm sure there are kids if you're watching.  Learn to write code.  Yeah, absolutely.  You know, when I left, design games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or maybe not because everything's going to be modular and you don't even need the right code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You may not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's going to be something you need, some logic you need to add to your game.  But this looks really good. I'm going to have to give this a try.  I was I told you I like to do maps and things for games.  I did a Half Life map when I left one of my jobs.  It was a copacetic.  I was leaving the job, go someplace else, and they said, what do you want to do for your last day?  And I said, I said, I'm going to make a map of the office and we're all going to get on.  I'm going to come around and load Half Life on all the computers and we're all just going to have a big gaming day.  What fun.  It was awesome. You know, someone's like, I'm in the conference room.  It's like, are you really in the conference room? No, no, I'm on the game in the conference room.  And it was a blast. I still have that map around someplace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But so you use the use the tool within Half Life to make a mapping tool.  Yeah. Is that fairly easy to use?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, this has been ages, right?  This was 19, 2000, I guess, when I did this.  So it was ages ago and it was not easy to use.  It took hours and hours and hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think it's gotten. I think it's probably gotten a lot easier.  Yeah. Yep.  It's the end of Flash as we know it.  Thank God. Finally.  Finally, Google's display ads will be all HTML5 by January 2017.  This means, yeah, I mean, that doesn't mean Flash won't appear elsewhere.  But Google does drive a lot of the advertising on the net.  No more punch the monkey kids unless you could do it in HTML5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's goodness right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although AdWords does have automatic converters.  So many people just take their Flash ads and convert them to HTML5.  It is really the beginning. Even Adobe is acknowledging that Flash is gone.  Speaking of ad blocking, were we? Always.  Google had initially, as you may remember, pulled apps like AdBlockFast,  stalling updates for others in the Google Play Store.  The folks who developed AdBlockFast appealed,  and now Google has reapproved and republished its app to Google Play,  perhaps reversing their decision to block ad blocking in the Play Store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wish they'd block the blocking, but too much to ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the problem is it looks like a conflict of interest.  It just reaffirms what everybody says. Google's an ad company.  Well, they are! They are!  Well, Samsung is pulling an Apple, they are doing a content blocker API  for the Samsung browser on their phones.  I think the message is clear. People want to be able to block ads.  Google has got to figure out a better way. Maybe AMP is the solution.  Putin's Internet czar.  Isn't that a job?  Do you call the head of the Internet in Russia a czar?  Oh, what the heck.  What the heck.  German Klymenko.  He was named Putin's Internet advisor six weeks ago,  and he's been in an interview peppered with expletives.  He's been slashing out at American tech companies.  Klymenko said forcing Google and Apple to pay more taxes  and banning Microsoft Windows for government computers are necessary measures,  according to Bloomberg Business, which apparently,  unwilling or unable to repeat the language Klymenko used,  but he explained it in terms of barnyard economics and marital infidelity.  Use your imagination.  We are breathing the cow, says Klymenko.  We are breathing the cow and they are milking it.  What? Are you breathing a cow and then we're milking it?  Of course, they want to raise taxes on US companies  so that Russian competitors like Yandex and Mail.ru can succeed  by offering a less expensive service.  When you buy an app from Google Play or the App Store anywhere in Europe,  that is charged value added tax at the place of payment,  but not here in our banana republic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't even... It's amazing. It's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, if you can't compete, tax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We were talking about the Forbes list of richest men in the world,  or richest people in the world, and Kalakannis on Twitter said,  yeah, but the number one richest person in the world is not on that list,  is Vladimir Putin, because he basically owns Russia.  And I guess you could say that, in a way.  A lawsuit, a class action lawsuit, accusing Google of CAPTCHA fraud has been...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How about a stupid suit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  ...has been dismissed out of hand.  The lawsuit alleges fraud because Google sometimes requires people  wanting a free Gmail account to fill out a two-word CAPTCHA.  CAPTCHA is that thing where you can hardly read the words,  but in theory, a robot, a computer program, couldn't read it at all,  so it's a way of detecting whether you're a human or some automated process  generating lots of Gmail accounts.  The class action said Google is committing fraud by forcing people  opening a Gmail account to decipher the two words,  because... This is actually kind of interesting.  The second word is actually a word that they can't OCR,  and they want you to actually do this.  This came out of Carnegie Mellon.  It's a really clever idea to do two-word CAPTCHAs.  One word is really generated by the computer. They know what it is.  But the other one comes from an attempt to OCR, perhaps with Google Books or whatever,  or Maps trying to decipher a street sign.  They can't figure it out, so it puts it in the CAPTCHA,  and some human will actually say, oh, yeah, that looks like Main Street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How many times have you seen those ones that look like house numbers?  You know that's coming from Google Maps, where they can't figure out what this house is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've been getting those more and more often lately, photos.  And that feels a little creepy.  To me, interpreting what the word is felt like, oh, I'm doing my civic duty.  I'm helping to interpret what this word is.  And then when they started doing the photos of people's addresses,  I'm like, this is just creepy. I feel like a stalker.  I don't want to tell you what that guy's house number is.  Someone's going to abduct him or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  U.S. District Judge Jaclyn Scott Corley dismissed the suit, saying,  Plaintiff has not alleged any facts that plausibly suggest the few seconds  it takes to type a second word is something for which a reasonable consumer  would expect to receive compensation.  Google's behavior is not immoral and oppressive because the harm...  The fact that the judge had to go that far to point that out.  Excuse me, this is not immoral and oppressive because the harm, if any,  of typing a single word without knowledge of how Google profits from such conduct  does not outweigh the benefit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This also plays to that ridiculous meme of if you don't pay, you're the product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. If it's free, you're the product.  Yeah, we can just stop that. Can we just stop saying that?  I'm seeing it more now.  Yeah, I am too.  Google's profit is not, the judge writes, is not the only benefit the court  considers in this balancing test.  Completing the prompt also entitles users to a free Gmail account.  Hello?  Moreover, users' transcriptions increase the utility of other free Google services  such as Google Maps or Google Books.  Plaintiff has failed to allege how these numerous benefits outweigh the few seconds  it takes to transcribe one word.  My God, this judge actually sounds intelligent.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Silly plaintiff.  Silly plaintiff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Eric Goldman, a professor at Santa Clara University School of Law, says the decision  ranks as one of the most interesting Internet law rulings so far in 2016.  Well, it's only February.  Give it time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Where was this tried?  In San Francisco.  Okay, that's why.  They obviously bring this suit to Texas. No offense, Texans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It has come to our attention that Google is using our citizens on behalf of their own  evil plans to take over the world.  The final quote from Judge Corley, as Google suggests, it strains credulity that  plaintiff or class members would forgo access to a free Gmail account and higher  quality Google Books or Google Maps because their brief transcription of a single  word might indirectly or directly facilitate Google's profit earning.  Who brought this suit? I didn't look for that part.  It's good she's not a judge in the United States of Germany, a blirmony.  It says, Noah Schubert is San Francisco lawyer or Boston attorney Patrick Vallelli.  And I don't know who was in the class.  You know what?  Lawyers are always looking for something to do when there's spare time.  Got a couple of hours. Maybe I should file.  Gabriela Rojas Lozano individually on behalf of all other persons similarly  situated plaintiff versus Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Plaintiff. The amount of money that's wasted on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Alleges the following facts upon personal knowledge as to herself and her own acts.  Google, she says, it's just too much tumble and they're making money on this.  I love it that the judge just said, yeah, forget it.  A resident of Williamstown, Massachusetts.  In August 24 while living in Massachusetts, Ms. Rojas Lozano signed up for a new Gmail account  and had to type two words. My God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So is everybody who has a Gmail account and a member of the class?  In the class, hell yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's when you get that little thing in the mail and it says, you may be a party to this lawsuit.  You could get 25 cents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was actually in Massachusetts this was pursued.  So Google had to fly a lawyer all the way out there.  Now we want some money back.  Oh, I love this one. Speaking of the government, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration.  Google asked them, the NHSTA, for NH and US NHTSA asked them for a ruling on autonomous vehicles.  Who's the driver? Who's driving the car?  It's actually the letter. If you read the letter is great.  Let me load it up.  I have it here in the show notes because I really enjoyed the letter.  Google wants clarification from the, an interpretation from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  regarding a number of provisions in the federal motor vehicle safety standards as they apply to Google.  Google describes its vehicles.  A level four vehicle, autonomous full self-driving vehicle, is designed to perform all safety critical driving functions and monitor road wear conditions for an entire trip.  Such a design anticipates that the driver will provide destination or navigation input,  but is not expected to be available for control at any time during the trip,  Both occupied and unoccupied vehicles by design safe operation rests solely on the automated vehicle system.  Google told the board that we found that humans didn't improve things.  For vehicles with an AI driver, we preclude any occupant from assuming the driving a task.  So who's the driver?  And they came back with the interpretation. Google said there's three ways you could interpret this  or two potential interpretations of driver and one potential interpretation for driver position.  One, the NHTSA could interpret the term driver as meaningless for the purposes of Google's self-driving vehicles since there's no human driver  and consider FMVSS provisions that refer to a driver simply as inapplicable to Google's vehicle design.  There's no steering wheel or brake or gas. They can't drive.  Or they can interpret driver and operator as referring to the software of the self-driving vehicle.  Or three, they can interpret the driver's position or some designated seating position as referring to the left front onboard seating position,  regardless of whether the occupant of that position is able to control the vehicle.  In other words, you'd be the driver even though you couldn't drive just because you're sitting there.  So this is a great, it's a fascinating thing to read.  And actually, again, this is another case of government getting it right.  They went on and on. They talked about the pros and cons and basically decided, you know, who's the driver?  The software is the driver.  And for purposes of the law, the actual self-driving system is the driver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We could have just sent him the definition for autonomous.  It's called an autonomous vehicle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You understand why Google wanted this clarification.  It has to do with insurance. It has to do with liability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that means Google's liable.  The driver caused an accident.  Who's the driver? The algorithm's driver? Who did the algorithm?  Hello Google.  So will Google self-insure?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, this is the senior analyst for Kelly Blue Book, Karl Brauer, asked exactly these questions.  If the NHTSA is prepared to name artificial intelligence as a viable alternative to human-controlled vehicles,  it could streamline the process of putting autonomous vehicles on the road.  It's a Turing test Turing never thought of.  The next question is whether and how Google could certify that the self-driving system meets a standard developed and designed to apply to a vehicle with a human driver.  Actually, this is the NHTSA talking.  Google is still evaluating the response.  It took me a while to read it.  They've said they'll likely partner with established automakers to build self-driving cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it's not going to be Google that gets in trouble. It's going to be Toyota or...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've been reading the manual for the car that I will someday get called a Tesla.  And the self-driving stuff.  It says there is a sensor in the steering wheel that will sense whether your hands are on the steering wheel.  And you need to keep your hands on the steering wheel or the self-driving capability will disengage.  That's how Tesla solves this is saying you're the driver.  Are you steering at that moment?  No, but you must be touching the wheel.  And they have a summon feature where you're not in the car.  You summon the car, it pulls out of the garage and picks you up.  Is that working already?  Oh, yeah.  But they say do not use this anywhere but your driveway because it's illegal.  Outside of your driveway.  But you can use...  Yeah, oh yeah, there's videos on YouTube of this happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a little scary since the car is so silent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and what's interesting it moves really slowly.  It will also park.  Not only parallel but it will do perpendicular parking.  So if you look at a space and say, well, if I park there I'm not going to be able to get out.  You just get out of the car and you say park in there.  And I've seen videos and it moves very slowly but it just...  Now who's the driver, Captain Phillips?  Geez.  I like how it plugs itself in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think that's actually working yet but I think that would be very cool.  But that's the idea of the summoning car across the country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, yeah.  It would have to because it has to charge up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo, no, you're not there yet but the Good Wife covered self-driving cars,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  who's responsible for an accident.  Did they resolve it for us all?  They had a segment on it and when you get there you'll love it.  I'm so sad that the Good Wife is ending.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Seven, what, seven seasons?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I loved her.  Yeah, she's great.  Better bet.  India says internet.org violates net neutrality and is illegal.  And they're shutting down Free Basics, which is the nicely renamed internet.org.  It's Free Basics.  Mark Zuckerberg says you're not kidding.  Now, you just were talking about this with somebody, right, Jeff?  Yeah, so the guy who started this, Nikhil Pawar, is the founder, amazing, amazing young guy

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  who used to work for paidcontent.org for Rafale and then started his own media site  called Media Nama in India.  I met him when I was in Delhi and he's a really, really wonderful guy, very smart, very connected.  And when he started, he was a very, very talented guy.  He was a very smart, very connected.  And when internet.org came along, he had a fit about it saying this violates net neutrality.  It's zero rating.  It's another form of zero rating.  Zero rating, exactly.  And he said that's just the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So zero rating, which is a terrible name because it's not clear what it is, is what T-Mobile's  doing with Bin John and others do this.  Where, hey, you won't count against your bandwidth.  We won't charge you when you consume data from these particular services.  But it's not discriminatory.  It's zero rating.  India decided that's not okay and they prohibited zero rating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Nickel started the campaign and is credited with killing internet.org.  And he even ended up in a discussion a few weeks ago with Mark Zuckerberg online.  He did op-eds against.  He created an incredible campaign using all kinds of software to organize people,  to be able to send emails to their MPs and all kinds of things.  And now has a platform for movements and protests.  And basically took off the last, I think, three months to essentially start an NGO out of this,  create political movements.  And he said there's two things politicians care about.  There's money or votes.  We can't control the money.  That's what the big companies have.  But we can make them see the pressure of the votes.  And they did.  And he changed the discussion entirely.  And interestingly, what I found interesting was that Nickel said he wasn't really fighting Facebook.  He was fighting the telcos.  Yeah, because that's the one I'm worried about.  Yeah.  You can't find the position that the telcos are doing this.  But Facebook, in his view, was tone deaf in how it approached this.  And I said, Nickel, is there any – my first question to him, is there any structure you could imagine –  I still like the idea of getting poor people on the internet.  Well, that's the debate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I had this debate with Om Malik, who of course has some standing in this.  He's Indian, understands the issues.  And he really hates internet.org.  He says, no, that's not the internet.  But my position was if you're getting information, we get Wikipedia –  admittedly, Facebook's there, but Wikipedia's also there.  Women's health clinics are put online by this.  Isn't that a good – isn't that a net benefit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's been my wish, is to find a way to make that work without ruining net neutrality,  which I believe in fiercely.  And Nickel's answer was the only way to do it, in his view,  is give people bandwidth and let them do with it what they want, give them a credit,  and say, here's a whole bunch of sites that are wonderful and they're really cheap.  And you can stretch your rupee a long way by using these sites.  But no, you can go to a porn site, too, if you want to.  And that's the only way to do it, which you're not being discriminatory.  And so it is a real challenge because I do – I think –  and I said this to him – I think that Zuckerberg's motive was generally good  and at face value here, that he really wants to bring people on the net.  Both Google and Facebook are working on drones and satellites and kites  to bring Internet to remote areas.  Now, what Nickel said is, yeah, he didn't necessarily argue with that,  but he said there's also a clear business benefit to Facebook, and that's also very true.  And part of the problem, though, in this case, it's interesting to me,  is he said that the MPs are concerned about how Facebook could use –  I don't think I said use, but could use its power as a gateway to news and content  to lobby public and thus political opinion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Oh, you can imagine all sorts of harms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. And not just in the case of Internet.org, but also in the case of this battle.  And so this is the discussion we in journalism have with Facebook that they've got to deal with,  and I think there are answers, but they've got to understand what the questions are, what the issues are,  that when Facebook becomes the primary distributor of news and information to people,  then it has to decide what the principles are around protecting open and free information  and knowledge in society and democracy and mom and apple pie,  or whatever it may be that we want to protect as a society.  And so it's true of Google, and Google has principles around this.  And Facebook, I think, has to do some more thinking about this.  They need perspective of people like journalists and public society people in this discussion.  They need to have an open discussion about this. And I've said this to them.  And I think that the Internet.org case shows that vulnerability,  that unless you're dealing with us in a way with principles, that you can answer that and say,  here's how we're operating, and here's why, and here's the responsibility we have.  It wasn't just a case of the net neutrality that came up.  Facebook put itself in a position where its role as gatekeeper to information also now becomes a factor.  And they've got to deal with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it's interesting.  O'Malek, who, as I mentioned, is a dead-set against this,  wrote an interesting piece on his blog in which he said,  maybe I'm suspicious because my family has told me their personal story of the British Raj  and the story of how a commercial spearhead, the East India Company,  came bearing gifts and then became the symbol of British imperialism.  It's interesting. So the historical precedent for this is, you know,  hey, we've got good stuff for you for free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's what Mark Andreessen tried to step in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Mark tweeted some tweets.  Yeah. So this is, you were mentioning this earlier.  This is the latest kerfuffle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mark, a master of Twitter, genius at Twitter, steps in and gives what he thinks is a simple opinion.  And oh, there was a virus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And this was my opinion.  I mean, I'm going to say it.  You know, there is something to be said for at least a little internet better than no internet.  Mark tweeted, denying the world's poorest free partial internet connectivity  when today they have none for ideological reasons strikes me as morally wrong.  And then he went on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the next one that got him in trouble.  And...  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, down, down, down.  That's the one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there's response.  Benedict Evans responds, it's a terrible thing to offer people with no money the choice of something free.  And then Vikram Chakra says, that sounds like justification for internet colonialism.  Then Andreessen responds, anti-colonialism has been economically catastrophic for the Indian people for decades.  Why stop now?  Oops.  Then what happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So then there was a huge furor on Twitter in India.  And Andreessen had to back way up.  He apologized.  Facebook adamantly said we...  And don't forget, Andreessen is on the board of Facebook.  So he wasn't just speaking as an individual.  He was seen in some measure as speaking for Facebook.  And so Facebook says, we have nothing to do with this.  We completely disagree with it.  It's not good for us.  And then Andreessen had a great quote this morning.  He said, I am henceforth going to leave discussion about complex Indian matters to those who know much better than I do.  And was out of it.  Yeah, as I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's one of the reasons I got turned around on this is Ohm convinced me.  Not because of the merit of his arguments, because I really wasn't sure I agreed with those, but just because he has stature and standing in this.  And I don't.  Last night on Twitter, says Andreessen, I made an ill-informed and ill-advised comment about Indian politics and economics.  To be clear, I'm 100% opposed to colonialism and 100% in favor of independence and freedom in any country, including India.  I'm a huge admirer of the nation in India.  And the Indian people have been nothing but kind and generous to me for many years.  I apologize for any offense my comment caused and withdraw in full and without reservation.  That's a good, good, good apology.  I will leave all future commentary on all of these topics to people with more knowledge and experience than me.  I don't even know what his tweet meant.  I mean, how can you assert that the fight against colonialism has been harmful, economically catastrophic to the Indian people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, when India for some time wouldn't allow foreign companies to invest, things like that.  Well, this would be another example of being sensitive to this, right?  Yes, exactly.  You couldn't get foreign brands in.  I mean, Coca-Cola wasn't in India for years.  There were fake Coca-Colas in there.  And so finally, when it was opened up to international markets and investment and such, I think this is what Mark's saying.  Look how much better things were when you tried to fight against too far against the colonialism that in fact did depress them.  Didn't do you much good.  So now you're trying to, you know, worry about and fight against Facebook.  You know, is that the best thing to do?  But I get folks. I'm not saying this.  I'm just trying to interpret just to be clear.  I'm not saying anything.  Yeah.  But I think that's why I interpreted what he was saying.  But yes, it's a classic, classic case of you can't make a complex argument in one tweet.  Right.  I guess the first time I've seen Andreessen do a major skinback.  Good.  I think that he's been brilliant on Twitter and generally, you know, if you've gone that long and said that much and you've only screwed up once, that's not bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'm sure there's others who will find other scripts.  Oh, well, he's not running for president.  Maybe this could well be a new form of imperialism, right?  Intellectual or Internet imperialism doesn't have to be geographic.  Yeah, no.  That's the fear.  Yeah. And it is.  It is our burden as white men.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's the further fear of what, you know, Putin's Internet czar is going to do and China is going to Iran is going to do and split up Internet.  And France is doing right now, giving face, you know, new rules on Facebook around and Google.  This is a story on the rundown.  Google is now going to scrub results more because of the right to be forgotten decision, which makes a separate and different Internet in Europe, a less complete Internet there, which is just appalling.  Yeah, I was announced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We knew they would do layoffs.  We heard about it on their earnings call last week.  They've announced their first round of layoffs, 15 percent of the workforce, 1500 jobs Wednesday.  Today's announced to lay off the first hundred and seven effective April 11th employees getting 60 days advance notice.  They filed with the California Employment Development Department.  The layoffs spread across a range of departments and job titles.  Polishing up Yahoo for sale.  Getting the baby stanching the bleeding.  And it's in German, so I don't know what it means, but there's breaking Gutenberg News.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just said in there, isn't that a an oxymoron?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Has there really any been any breaking news about Gutenberg?  Yes, this is a big deal.  This is the I recognize this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a is this a what is this?  This is the it's the Mainzer Stad history, the history of the state of Mainz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes. So what what have I just saw this on Facebook and I just I was just putting this in here.  The state archive of Würzburg found a document from February 26th, 1468 that refers directly to what was the quote I put in here?  Certain forms, letters, instruments and stuff that had come from the printing work that belonged to Johann Gutenberg and then after his death, he gave on.  So this is a this is very little documentary evidence.  And this comes out of the fight that Gutenberg had, which I've talked about the show before with Johann Foust.  And I'm sure you're all up to speed on this.  Who who had had funded Gutenberg and he lost much of the business, but he kept some materials and left that to others.  So this is actually in Gutenberg geek world, which is about three of us.  This is big news. This is a nice, nice historical find.  Thank you for for allowing me that little moment of Gutenberg moments.  We can move on now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, the reference to White Man's Burden had nothing.  It was an ironic reference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, you know, you get bit by people who don't know any history.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so they go, oh, he just said White Man's Burden.  It's lucky I didn't say the rest of that, which was, you know, those wogs really need us to help them get their lives in order.  I am sad to hear this.  The Bits blog is shattering on the New York Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The New York Times has killed blog after blog after blog after blog, and eventually they'll just be not.  I don't even know if this is the last one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They'll still do the content, though, right?  Yeah. Yeah.  So it's just not going to be separated out into a blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the idea to go to that brand that was Bits and the Bits has a voice and Bits is something you can have a relationship with.  I think it's kind of heading the exact wrong way.  I think that the big one size fits all products must split up into a bunch of more relevant and targeted products.  And they're doing the opposite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So did stuff in the Bits blog get in the printed paper?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know how much Bits blog did.  But yes, I mean, certainly one form or another.  Absolutely.  The blog since the beginning.  That was that was a pretty revolutionary thing because I had a great discussion with the then editor of the New York Times about blogs that went on forever and somewhere online.  Bill Keller and the New York Times was sniffy about blogs.  And then they started doing it.  The tech writer Saul Hansel is one of the very first.  And it was a huge note that some of the stuff that Saul wrote on the blog did actually appear in print.  So it took the blog voice and put it in the great old lady voice and started to change the entire voice of the Times.  Blogs had a huge impact on on the Times and its relationship to its public.  So that's why I'm just sad.  I'm mournful to see them basically go there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the content will remain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's just the reporting in some form or another will be there.  But will it have the same voice?  Can I can I subscribe to the Bits blog and know the authors and all that?  No, that's that's gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it'll just the content will will just be called tech.  Yeah, exactly.  I have to say the word blog seems antiquated.  Yeah, it does.  Oh, now, now, now, as a blogger, Jeff goes, wait a minute.  I don't like the word podcast either.  I blogged. I think naming content, giving content a description based on how it's distributed is antiquated.  Right. Content's content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But content as a concept is antiquated, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, no. What's replacing content?  Flow. Flow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or as Dave Weiner would say, a river. Flow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Be careful with your USB cables.  We've been watching the posts of the Amazon.  Haven't you? It's so fun.  Benson Long, Leon from Google's been buying every USB cable he could find.  And then if it doesn't live up to the spec, which means it could be actively dangerous for your USB powered device, he writes a review on Amazon.  I refuse to buy USB cables now, unless I unless I see Benson's seal of approval.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Does he say it's OK?  Unless he fried his laptop.  Yeah, no, seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's great. In fact, I just bought a USB C cable and somebody sent me a link saying because I was looking for the USB 3, those weird that weird dimple cable.  They call it a mic. I can't remember the name of it.  There's a name for it.  Anyway, somebody sent me a link to one and I looked and I said, I can't buy that one.  Benson Long says that's a terrible one.  But then I searched some more and Belkin makes one that Benson approves.  So this is the new thing. Do not buy a USB C cable unless Benson approves it.  So cool. He's tested so many of them.  Apparently, a bad USB C destroyed his Chromebook Pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I presume Google gave him another one because it's worth it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Peter Bone, who's writing about this in The Verge, said it happened to me, too.  Really?  Yeah. On his 6P.  I found an Amazon to charge my Nexus 6P. It drew too much power from my MacBook Air's USB ports.  They shut down temporarily to protect themselves.  But when they came back online, they only worked intermittently.  Wow.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm sitting here with my Chromebook Pixel and my Pixel C and my Nexus 6P phone all on USB C.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I do not buy anything unless I see Benson in the reviews of that cable say, OK.  Wow.  And then some Redditors have created a website or a Google spreadsheet, your choice, aggregating his reviews, compliant or not compliant.  You definitely need that.  But the good news is whenever he does put a review on Amazon, it's immediately voted up to the top.  So you usually don't have to scroll down to find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You would think this would be something that would have been simply taken care of in the standard itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is. They're not up to the standard. That's the point. They leave out a critical resistor in some cases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So here's the question, though. But all USB 2 cables couldn't do that damage?  And is it something inherent in the design of USB C that's more dangerous?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No. You could do this with USB 2. If you had something that drew the differences, you're not drawing enough amperage with the USB 2.  Usually those devices don't draw enough amperage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But now you're powering laptops with it.  Right. Exactly.  Like a Pixel or a MacBook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. You're drawing a lot more amps over that cable. And when you do that, that cable is going to heat up if it's not thick enough.  So we've done that in our makerspace.  Have you?  Oh, yeah. Not with USB C, just with sending too much power over a too thin of a cable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's not price specific. You really just have to look and see if it was made properly.  I would imagine that this will at some point resolve itself because people will not buy the bad cables.  This is a good, good tip. Everybody should look for this.  Now, let's solve this hoverboard problem.  I've taken to putting our hoverboard out in the backyard and charging it outside.  Our CPA firm, one of the partners in our CPA firm, had her hoverboard explode here in Petaluma a couple of weeks ago.  Throwing chunks of hot lithium ion throughout the room. Her husband and daughter were in the house.  Thank God they weren't standing next to it. They would have been damaged.  Thirty thousand dollars of fire damage. The FBI were actually out investigating it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Leo, Leo, babe.  You really want to use an auditor who uses a hoverboard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's for a daughter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, OK. Just made me a little too loosey goosey California.  Hey, man, I got you. I got you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, you should see these kids on the hoverboards, man. They just go whizzing around. Michael's so good. He just goes.  So be careful on the hoverboards. Yeah.  Actually, you will you will labs have started certifying hoverboards now so that they do USB cables to.  I wish they would. Yeah. Yeah. Charge it with a USB.  So if you're going to if you're going to buy a hoverboard, don't wait because they haven't yet started certifying them.  But they're going to start. I love. Yeah, we give some credit, some props to you.  Well, the under the radios labs who certify all the electronics we use and you know, we they're much safer because of that.  Yeah. Yeah. Love you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the lithium ion battery contained in most hoverboards could be the source.  Fortunately, there are many things you can do to protect yourself from such an incident.  He looks like he's been spending a lot of time testing don't overcharge the hoverboard.  Electronica manufacturers recommended charging times found in the product manual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somebody said it wouldn't be a problem except for the cheap Chinese knockoff hoverboard.  They're all Chinese. There's nobody makes a hoverboard in the US.  It's all it's every hoverboard is made in China by probably 50 different countries all knocking off each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's no official. But aren't the ones with the Samsung batteries better or safer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do we know? We don't even know. Aaron? No, I mean, they could be right.  But how do you know the charging circuit where that came from?  So you get a good battery. But if it's over any battery overcharged is going to well, not anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And there are American companies selling these, but they're just rebranding Chinese hoverboards or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Where do the parts come from? Yeah. How were they designed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm scared to death of our hoverboard. Now, I'm way too clumsy.  Period. You know what? They're easy. Oh, not for me. I thought, oh, I'm not getting on this.  This is trivial. The only problem is I've been spoiled by my segue. Right.  Because you use your body weight to steer the segue. This you use your toes. You lean your foot back and forward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Rick Spallin. You know Rick Spallin, one of the photographers who did this Day in Life American, all that.  He got on one in about 30 seconds, fell off and basically broke his wrist. Yeah. What? Oh, I know Rick. I love Rick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Eric's wonderful. You should graduate to the segue hoverboard. The little guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're coming in. We're going to have them on the new screensavers.  It's you. You don't steer it with your feet. You steer it with your calves, your thighs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a little rod that sticks out. But the rod also can be converted to a following robot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It can convert into a robot with additional accessories, especially success accessories sold separately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Can I ask you guys a question? Yeah. Well, the US back to the USBC for a second on the list.  There's no USBC to USBC. But they make them.  I know because I need them. I use them. There's nothing on here. Can you imagine why that's not on there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's A to C. There's A, micro B, AC charging. That's just this. This list was just made by somebody.  So what I would do is go to Amazon and look for one and see if you know what he's he's USBC to USBC.  I have plenty of them and I know they're all right. I wouldn't have bought them.  Let's find one. Here's an anchor like anchor. In fact, I love anchor. Usually a good brand.  USBC. Let's go down. Look at the reviews, though. Don't buy it without looking down here and see if Benson says it's OK.  There's no review. So he's either not tested them or for some reason the review is not not there.  Huh. Huh. But anchor is usually pretty good. Usually. Yep. I can't imagine anchor would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I usually buy anchor anchor USB to cables for all my stuff. Yeah.

Transcript:  And anchor batteries. Heavy duty. Yeah. If anchor made a hoverboard, I'd buy their hoverboards.  Hmm. You know what? I don't see. I do. Well, you know, Amazon reviews are useful, but.  I don't see that maybe Benson doesn't maybe he doesn't check these. I don't know.  I get the braided cables. I really like those. And for USBC, I get different colors, so I will know.  Yeah, I don't see any Benson reviews on here. Mr. Benson, Mr. Benson.  All right, let's take a break and we will get your tips and numbers and we will get a demo of something very cool.  That Mr. Newcomb has has brought us texture is so cool. I'm a texture subscriber.  Actually, I subscribe back when they were called Next Issue. They're now Next Issue by texture by Next Issue or something like that.  Same idea. It's Netflix for magazines, basically for your iPad or your phone or your tablet.  You you download the app, you subscribe, and it's all you can read of the best magazines.  And I love this because a may I like magazines. I think magazine writing is still some of the best writing out there.  But I don't want to buy the magazine that'll really add up.  And I don't want to subscribe because that's going to add to the clutter. So I like reading them online or but not everything's online.  So this is a really great solution in every category. So it's almost always every month I want to read an article that's in Wired.  I like the pictures in National Geographic. I might want to read an article in Rolling Stone or Vanity Fair, rarely more than one.  I don't want to you know, this is the way to do it. They've got literally dozens.  In fact, if you look, if you go to texture t e x t u r e dot com slash twig, you can try it for free and you can see the two plans.  There's a fifteen dollar a month and a ten dollar a month plan. Different magazines available.  You can download you'll be downloading not only the current issue but back issues.  You you can download it and go go offline, which is nice.  The magazines are exactly like the magazines on the newsstand. Every page, every article.  But it's easier to navigate. For instance, if you've got the cover page, you can just click an article you want to read from the cover and go right into it.  They also have an editorial team recommending daily stories and a collections list.  They call it their curated collections that let you pick a topic and then read articles across a variety of magazines about that topic.  Styling tips from GQ and Esquire workouts from Men's Health or Men's Fitness, Forbes or Fortune.  Stay in the know. It's all there. I love it.  And I want you to try it free at texture dot com slash twig.  If you're if you travel a lot, if you're looking for a way to keep up on the magazines without the clutter, without killing the trees, texture dot com slash twig.  It's the magazine business in the same kind of straights as the newspaper business or I think I get the sense some magazines do fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, well, a lot of print magazines, you know, cutting-edge magazines where I used to work Vogue and such are still making money, but they recognize certainly they've got to be online and be digital.  I've long contended that magazines should be better off on the Internet because they start with a relationship.  They start with relevance. You know, I like this magazine.  Now that I don't think anybody's really done a good enough job yet of of doing that, but they still think too much about content rather than relationships.  But I think that if they get their act together, they can be well poised.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, there's some magazines like the New Yorker that are just, you know, and that's a weekly impossibly New Yorker, the Economist, the Economist, Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There are things that are in its day. There are things that are so good that you can break all the rules.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. I love magazines. That's why they said like National Geographic National Geographic.  I used to have stacks of them in the basement. Now we don't have to do that because you can just you get it in your it's actually that's basic or.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think somewhere still I have a whole bunch of them on DVD or CD-ROM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pardon me, CD-ROM. Oh, I remember that. Yeah. That's when we all thought that was the future of publishing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're still pitching that on public radio. What? Get a CD-ROM? Yeah. Yeah, I was surprised. That's a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They had all the Mad magazines on CD-ROM, but there is there can be an issue because it depends how they digitize them.  Like the Mad magazine digitization was not a very well done effort. Unfortunately.  Why am I not surprised? Well, doesn't Conde own them now? I think so.  All right. Let's let's see. Let's how should we do this? Well, I wanted to mention a couple of things.  So remember we were talking about Google Fi. I don't know if I have my five phone here and we were saying, how do you know which network you're on when you're on Google Fi?  Because Google Fi doesn't expose that. And a number of people tweeted me and wrote to me saying, oh, you need an app.  There's a special app, probably a number of them.  But there was one that almost everybody universally recommended that you can run on your five phone that will tell I'm just looking for it because I can't remember the name of it now.  That will tell you which there it is. Signal Spy that will tell actually tells you all sorts of interesting things.  So here's the bands and the carrier. So right now I'm on T-Mobile and I'm making a Wi-Fi call, but you can view the network history.  So I can see that actually here in Petaluma, I don't I never get connected to Sprint, but this would be really useful to see even to the point of the promiscuous connection.  So this is promiscuously connecting to a Wi-Fi at a restaurant next door to a store I go to.  And I don't want to be connected to them promiscuously. But in fact, that's one of the things that Google Fi will do if it's an open access point.  So this is a really nice little little programs called Signal Spy.  If you're a Google Fi user and you're trying to keep up on on what's going on now, I don't keep it running in boot because, you know, I'm trying to get my battery.  Life up on this phone. But a very useful thing you can even say you can one of the things you can do is you can say which dialers you should use in preference over what others instead of laying it pick automatically.  Nice little nice little do hickey. Thank you for people sent me a note on that.  And then I just got this book from a no starch press. I love no starch press. They do great stuff.  And I'm really excited about this. Learn to program with Minecraft.  Now, as some of you know, I kind of fell in love with Minecraft and started a Minecraft server of my very own.  But what I didn't know was that that on the Raspberry Pi, the Minecraft there has an interface to fourth.  You can use fourth commands to interface with Minecraft. And that's what this is all about.  It's a good way to learn fourth, especially for kids who are Minecraft obsessed.  Because when you say to them, well, you know what? You could build a rocket ship programmatically, you know, just a few lines of code.  You could build a, you know, 100 foot high wall to separate your land from other lands.  But you just need to know a little code that gets them very interested.  And this is done by Craig Richardson, who is an educator, uses Python to teach.  He's taught high school computing classes, led workshops on programming Minecraft with Python.  And the nice thing is you don't have to have a Raspberry Pi to do this. This will work on Windows, Mac or Linux.  He actually gives you the files to download and offers you a very simplified way to set up a Minecraft server on your own computer so you can write software and use the idle ID for Python to write code.  It's pretty cool. It's, you know, dance parties. This is the, you know, teleportation.  You show a kid this that you can create a disco floor that lights up when you dance around on it.  They suddenly say, I'd like to do that. So I really I've really been enjoying this. Very cool.  Learn to program with Minecraft. Craig Richardson is the author and it's from No Starch Press.  They do a lot of great stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A lot of coding cookbooks I looked at when I was a kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I just feel like this is a great way to ease a kid into programming, maybe even better than robots.  Some kids like that physicality of a robot or the turtle, the logo, turtle graphics and all that.  But because kids are already doing stuff in Minecraft, you've shown me some really cool stuff, Aaron, that you do in your maker space and with your daughter in Minecraft.  For instance, she used to me before the show. She can design a house and then send it to a printer, a 3D printer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's right. Yeah, that's called print craft. That is pretty awesome. Yep. Yep. That's really cool.  Yeah, it's really cool because it connects the physical thing.  A lot of a lot of what we talk about in the maker space is in terms of education is it's great to learn the theory. Right. Right.  But then what's the practical application? Right. You always hear kids say, I'm never going to use this calculus once I get out of school.  Well, you know, show them how they use it, you know, and turn them on to education, turn them on to learning something new.  Yeah. And they'll go a long way. So I really like this.  And it's nice that if you do have a Raspberry Pi, it comes by default, I believe, with the Raspberry Pi operating system.  So you just load up your your five dollar Raspberry Pi zero and plug in a few extra things. And it's right there. Kids can just jump on it and use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Be better to get a Raspberry Pi, too, if you can afford the 35 bucks.  It'd be better. A little more horsepower, a little more memory.  But yeah, I mean, what a great thing that you have this little thing in an Altoids box. Right.  That is not only a Minecraft server that is persistent game, but you can program it. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yep. Learn to program with something you love. Yeah, I love this. Jeff, some numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, right. Let me try that.  Um, you surprised me. Oh, I'm sorry.  No, no, I'm there. I'm there. I'm there. I'm there. I'm there. Where was it?  Um, right. Facebook is telling advertisers to add captions to their videos.  Um, people are watching 100 million hours of video on Facebook every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow. Watching, not uploading. 100 million watching. Watching. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And so the advertisers, they haven't been as smart as AJ Plus, for example,  and they're not, they're presuming people are going to listen to their wonderful ad,  so they're not getting their message across.  So Facebook's director of ad products marketing, Graham Mudd, told Business Insider,  the company estimates that as many as 40% of video ads don't communicate their message effectively  unless they have the sound on. So they're taking their just plain old commercials and putting them on Facebook.  But captions in. Not being aware, of course. Captions, headlines, other things.  Facebook also said that internal tests showed that captions can increase video view time by an average of 12%,  which stands to reason, I'm surprised, not even more in a sense.  Um, Mudd said that 55% of people who watch the first three seconds of an ad will watch the next 10 seconds.  45% will make it to the end. That three second number is significant.  It's the length of time Facebook considers accounts as a view.  So Facebook's going to charge you, I would presume, for that.  So it's interesting to me just simply that these guys are not updating for the way that, I mean, Facebook set the structure.  We talked about this in the show before. I've argued for a few years that mobile video needed to be silent movies  because you weren't going to put headsets in or listen publicly or all that.  I never anticipated what Facebook did in making autoplay silent. Thank God they did that.  Well, they had to.  And I find it actually a very good feature because I look at the video and I will often, AJ+, I'll often sit and watch the whole thing.  I get informed. There's eye candy, things moving. It's great.  You'd think advertisers would have been ahead on this, and they're not.  So now Facebook is trying to school them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I find it telling that I've actually used this as a shorthand way of judging which presidential candidates are socially media aware and which are not.  Because, for instance, Hillary is, in fact, your son is on the right team.  Hillary does captions, you see, on all of her stuff so that you know immediately what's going on.  And obviously that's going to raise her engagement.  Let's see if Donald Trump, by the way, I follow them all because you don't need to know what he says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's see if he's using video to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you using video?  He apparently has no video.  Forget the captions.  Now, that's certainly not an indicator of whether somebody's going to be a good president.  But I think it is interesting to see their command of the medium, whether they're in this century.  Feel the burn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I also follow the burn.  Let's see if the burn has it.  The burn has it.  He's what, 70?  What was the really good crack that was it John Kasich said?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somebody maybe, oh yeah, he's using...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Applause.  Applause. Yeah, he's using captions.  The burn's got it.  Because he's got all the young people.  He's hip.  Was it Donald Trump said, I thought Bernie was going to turn 77 right there on the stage?  Very effective shot.  All right, so the burn's doing it.  Let's see maybe, is Marco Rubio still running?  No, apparently not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It says the same thing over and over and over again.  That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a lot easier to do the captions on his page.  Yeah.  He has pretty good captions.  Did you see the Ted Cruz video by the way?  But see, he's got the video.  He's got the ad, which is a great ad.  Captions, Ted.  Just a tip.  I didn't see that one.  Oh my God, he's finally taken aim at the Donald.  Oh.  I don't want to go political on this, but I'll let you.  But I think you're absolutely right.  That's how you get the views up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Now Facebook, this thing also says that Facebook conducted a study with Nielsen, commissioned  by Facebook, that found that 40%, up to 47% of the value in a video campaign was delivered  in the first three seconds.  Well, of course Facebook would say that given that that's what they count as view.  And 74% of the value was delivered in the first 10 seconds.  Wow.  I understand that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's hard to do a video that has 10 seconds and you've got to get the content in there  in 10 seconds.  Well, we could learn a thing or two from that.  The question is, what's the value?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How do you say what the value of a video is?  Right.  Yeah, so that's right.  Let's reduce all Twitch shows to 10 seconds.  10 seconds.  Snapchat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good bird.  Snap twit.  I take great pride in the fact that we are pretty old fashioned here at Twitch.  We do long, thoughtful, wordy shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So is Facebook going to offer a, you know, they should offer this as a service, right?  Yeah, captioning.  Yeah.  Hey, we'll go back and redo all your videos for a fee and add the captions and then just,  you know, they must have some predictive or analytical.  Jeb push.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No captions.  No captions on Jeb.  You know, he's giving his thank you to New Hampshire speech, but am I going to turn on  the camera?  No, because I'm at work, right?  I can't.  And if you want to fall asleep on the job.  No, come on now.  Come on now.  Let's not be mean.  He's a nice fella.  Let's see.  What did Trump call him?  Low energy.  How about Marco Rubio?  Do you think he, as you said, probably very easy to caption his?  Just have a robot do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No video.  No video.  Wow.  Very techsy.  Now, on the other hand, you might say, well, I think somebody who puts a lot of thought  in there and a lot of text, what's wrong with that?  You know, that's somebody who's not hip.  I don't want somebody hip in the presidency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You want to communicate with voters.  If I'm going to that page, use every tool that's available to communicate with me.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can read text while you're on a treadmill.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's why you want a video.  So Carly Ferreira and Chris, my dear governor, Chris Christie are out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, Chris did decide to drop out.  Yeah, he did.  To suspend, yes.  I'm sad about that because he was fun to watch.  And you know, he's the guy who got Marco Rubio in a loop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  As somebody said, I don't know where it was said, but it was a murder or suicide.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just tweeted that somebody should wake up Ben Carson and tell him he died last night.  Yeah.  But he's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you see the funny video of them coming on stage during the last debate?  Did you see the remake?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah, I saw it on your feed where you put John Travolta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I didn't put it there.  I didn't put it there.  Somebody put that John Travolta meme waiting to go on stage.  It was perfect.  Just perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's such a good meme.  It's from Pulp Fiction where Travolta comes over to the house and he's looking around.  Where is she?  She's talking to me.  I know she's talking to me.  All right, let's see what you built here, my friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right, so you know, I always try to bring a project on because I think that's people  need to do more projects.  Do you want me to show that video?  I can show that video.  Yeah, so look if you want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm connected in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All right, awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe your own simple RGB LED cube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, so I can't claim all the credit for this.  The inspiration for this project came from a guy that I like to watch on YouTube.  He does a channel called Great Scott and he's from Europe and he's got a thick accent, but  it's okay.  He does some cool stuff.  And so I've always wanted to do a 5x5 LED cube and he released a video on how to build  your own 5x5 LED cube.  I thought, you know what, I'm going to take a look at what he did and follow along.  And you did it.  You made a great one.  So what do you need?  You need LEDs.  And these are programmable LEDs.  There's a big difference.  So these aren't just regular LEDs.  They're not just multicolor LEDs.  They actually have a little chip inside and it sends what it does is it reads.  There's an in and an out on each one of these.  There's four connections, two for power and then two for the data path.  So what it does is it looks for a data stream and it says, is this little bit of information  for me?  If not, pass it on.  And so it gets its instructions from a single wire.  You send the command down the wire and it says, okay, this is for me.  You just told me to make myself red.  I'm going to make myself red.  You just told me to turn on.  I'm going to turn it on.  And so they're really great because all you need is one wire out of an Arduino or a Raspberry  Pi to make this whole thing function.  You don't need to do shift registers.  You don't need to do complicated electronic setups.  And that makes it really, really interesting.  So you address them by row and column kind of?  You can do that.  Absolutely.  You can.  Right now there's zero through 125.  So they're numbered zero through 124.  And that's how you do it.  But actually we're looking at doing an array like that, an XYZ array.  And that way you can do some really cool stuff very easily.  So should I turn it on?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we can take a look at it.  You've actually put in a pot so you can dim them, which is nice.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So this is on dim mode so the cameras can pick them up.  So this is one I made.  I made this pattern just as a test to see if I could do it.  It's always fun.  And then the next one I did is more interesting, which is it was raining at the time here in  California, which is odd.  But I wanted to do a thunder and lightning, a lightning and rain kind of thing.  So you'll see in a minute the lightning will go, right?  And then it'll start raining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And this is written in C?  C++.  This is done with Arduino.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it's C++.  Oh, it's in Arduino.  It's not in the Raspberry Pi.  Yep.  It's an Arduino Nano.  If I open it up you'd be surprised.  The thing measures about an inch by about half an inch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And a lot of loops.  A lot of loops.  A lot of four loops here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly.  A lot of math goes into this basically.  So now it's pouring outside, right?  That's so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is so cool.  It's a lot of fun.  It's a lot of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Tell you what, if you want to learn how to solder, practice first, do a simple project  and then come back to this.  This took me about 20 hours of soldering to put together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because the LEDs have a short little leads that you're putting on copper wire there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's right.  That's right.  Yep.  Yep.  And you have to, there's a lot of soldering.  There's four solder joints for every LED.  Wow.  And you look at these people that do the 10 by 10 cubes or even larger and it's like that  must have taken you a year, right?  Because it's exponentially larger when you take a look at that.  So anyway, it's a lot of fun.  It's electronically and programmatically it's a fairly simple project to do.  But it's a great little project and it's a nice showy project.  If you want something to impress your friends, an LED cube is the way to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Coral says, that's nice, but what is it good for?  It's not good for anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just for fun.  It's for fun.  It's just for fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although you could tie it to music, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Absolutely.  That's the next step.  There's a couple of things I want to do with this.  One is to add a speaker so that when you see that flash of lightning, you get the thunder  with it, right?  The other one is I've got a little chip that does wavelength analysis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you need a microphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can need a microphone and this little chip and it'll take the audio in and then  turn it into a wave pattern.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to build this in Minecraft.  There you go.  Not any, no soldering required.  That's right.  That's right.  That'd be cool actually.  You could totally do it.  Yeah, totally.  In the back of this book, it has a table of all the different materials.  So I could alternate gold blocks with, I don't know, redstone or flowing lava.  Oh, that'd be kind of interesting.  Yeah, use the beacon feature.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do beacons.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Some people are software, some people are hardware.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You could be both.  I think you should be both.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I think people should be both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a submarine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we're going to dive now.  You could make this, if you had a lot of time, you could make a Burning Man 1000 by 1000  that you ride around in, in a bicycle.  That would be crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That would be crazy.  The other thing that someone actually I thought of is to do the snake game.  Yeah.  You know, where you chase the red pixel around and it gets bigger and bigger and bigger until  the whole thing is lit.  That'd be fun.  I haven't had time to work that out.  Once I get the matrix written, right, for the XYZ matrix, then it becomes easier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wish there were more time in life.  Me too.  If I didn't have to sleep, I could do things like this.  Damn that sleep.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Aaron, so glad you came.  You always bring a project that's fun.  Yeah, I tried to.  It's really, really cool.  I can't believe you do.  Yeah.  And you do a lot of these things with your kids.  I mean, are they kind of part of this?  Yeah, especially my daughter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In fact, you know, Jeff was talking about the three doodler.  She's been wanting a three doodler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So if you're not going to use it.  It is a lot of fun.  My little pony.  Actually, the problem is I have the first version.  The new version is way better.  They did a lot of really nice improvements to it and it's really good.  They're a great bunch of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We've got the beta version in the makerspace actually, and she doesn't want to use that  one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She wants the new one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So maybe a good birthday gift or maybe we'll get one for the makerspace to share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where's the makerspace?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's in Benicia.  So if you're in the anywhere in really in the northern California, just north of San  Francisco, if you're in Oakland or Concord, Walnut Creek, Petaluma even.  We've got people that come from Napa and American Canyon down to Benicia and you get shared  tools.  You get free training on a lot of stuff.  It's really, really inexpensive.  And we're doing benishamakerspace.org and then we're doing a maker fair in Benicia.  It's our second maker fair.  Congratulations.  Yeah, last year's was really successful.  So that's going to be in April.  April 16th is a Benicia maker fair.  So if you're in the area and you want to come down and check out what people are doing,  that's the best time to do it.  We're looking for some speakers.  We'd like to have a featured speaker.  So maybe you guys can help me crowdsource that.  Who should I get for a speaker?  Who would be a good public speaker who would come up and talk about the value of making  things and inventing things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I shall keep my eyes out.  Yeah, let me know.  Yeah, I bet I could find you somebody.  That'd be great.  Yeah.  Thank you so much for joining us, Jeff Jarvis.  Always a pleasure.  Jeff is a journalism professor at CUNY, but you can find his blog at buzzmachine.com.  Follow him on the Twitter at Jeff Jarvis.  Do you still use Google Plus?  Really?  Not really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it's sad.  I don't use it as much anymore either.  I still use it, just not as much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When I go in there now, it feels like it's like a lot of spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Here's the big news.  Mike Elgin, the greatest offender of Google Plus, the man who said no spams there complained  the other day, spam on Google Plus.  It's just spam, spam.  So sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think Google's not doing it at its service with their hot topics because I'm seeing a  lot of stuff that should not be up and coming.  So it's disappointing.  Hey, look at this.  Jason Howell, how I use Android.  Oh, from Computer World.  I'll have to see that.  Thank you, Jeff.  Thank you, Aaron.  Thanks to all of you for joining us.  We do this week in Google every Wednesday afternoon, about 1 30 p.m.  Pacific, 4 30 Eastern, 21 30 UTC.  You can watch live on twit.tv or get on demand audio and video after the fact.  Twitter.tv slash twig.  We're also on YouTube.  We're also everywhere, frankly, and every podcast client.  Make sure you get a copy each and every week.  And we'll see you next time on Twig.  Bye bye.
