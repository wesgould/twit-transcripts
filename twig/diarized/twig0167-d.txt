Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sleep deprived co-host.  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In the reverse order.  I buried the lead.  New mommy, Gina Tripani.  So latest baby news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's great.  My mom is cuddling her right now.  She's awesome.  She's finding her voice.  She lets us know when she's hungry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She was, what, five weeks premature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But five weeks early, and she's three weeks old now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's just under six pounds.  She's gaining weight.  She's eating like a champ.  Which is awesome.  Oh, that's good.  Yes, she's really tiny and really fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Excellent.  DrMom says the best bibs are made of washcloths with neck  holes cut in them.  Oh.  That's straight out of the shtetl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Using cloth diapers as burp pads.  But I know this is something all of our listeners  wanted to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We got tired of cloth diapers really quickly,  because they don't really, they kind of leak.  But I was trying to be ecological,  and then Consumer Reports said, well, it's kind of moot,  because you've got a truck driving around, blah, blah,  blah.  So we used them for a month and kept them for burp rags,  and then went to paper.  Just a thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This week in poop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's Jeff Jarvis.  He is also a proud papa, like me, and the City University  of New York.  Do you have a chair?  Can I say the August Professor of Journalism?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, no.  I've got to give somebody.  You have to endow the Leo Laporte chair in journalism.  Oh.  How much would that be?  How many hundreds of dollars would I need to put in?  It's a million and a half.  Ah, shoot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what, Jeff?  If I ever have a spare million and a half,  I'm going to endow that.  Then I could say, and with us now,  the Leo Laporte Professor of Journalism.  That would be funny.  I'd like that.  Jeff Jarvis.  Good to have you.  His book, Public Parts, is out now.  And he's also the author of What Would Google Do?  and blogs at buzzmachine.com.  So Gina and Jeff conspired during the week.  Gina had a very good idea.  She said, of course, we cover more than Google here.  But Google is announcing new products every single week  in great numbers.  And we aren't able really to cover in depth  every single one of them.  So wouldn't it be a good idea to launch into the show each week  with just kind of a rundown of new features  that Google is offering?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, actually, this is Leon, one of our listeners,  Leon, his idea.  He wrote in and said, hey, there are changes to Google Apps  all the time.  You guys don't always get to them.  What's up with that?  I was like, oh, that's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We can't, because there's literally  half a dozen every week.  And most of them aren't that big a deal.  But it's probably worth mentioning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  So we thought we'd put together a little segment where  we run down what the new stuff is out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, we need, ladies and gentlemen,  we need to crowdsource a bumper.  See, TNT does this.  NSFW does it.  Many of our other shows, most of them non-Leo shows,  get bumpers.  People don't give me bumpers.  So if anybody wants to give us a great This Week in Google  stuff, we could do that.  With Timpanys, please.  That'd be nice.  Just send them along.  Send them to Chad at twit.tv.  So Twill has bumpers too?  It has to have recorder music.  It has to have recorder music.  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.  And Timpanys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mxx in our chat room says, what?  I'm confused.  I don't.  I am too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bumpers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What?  Lacking a da, da, da, da, da, and now new to Google.  What should we call this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, what should we call it?  What's new?  Change log?  Release notes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Change?  Ooh, I like that.  Ooh, that's good.  That's a programmer's point of view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What do you call it?  A lightning round.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Lightning round.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll say the lightning round, because I use that sometimes  when we have so much news that we have to quickly go  through stories.  That's true.  I like change log.  Change log is good.  Yeah, that's good.  I like that.  That's a winner.  And now the Google change log featuring Gina Trapani.  And just go ahead and list them, and we'll  interject if we feel the need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, interrupt me if you got questions.  Couple of changes to Gmail in the past couple of weeks.  First one is Gmail now indexes attachments.  So you can search inside attachments.  If you've got messages with a PDF, PowerPoint file, word  document, other kind of common file formats, when you search  for a keyword, it'll turn up messages with attachments that  have those words.  And if you're not using this already, this is one of my  favorite Gmail shortcuts, has colon attachment will narrow  your search to messages, the only messages that have  attachments.  So if you do has a colon attachment, and then you say  Leo, it'll show you all the messages with Leo and all the  messages that have Leo inside the attachment attached to  the message.  Very cool.  Another Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, just to, I will interject.  I thought when I saw this, there'd be a hue and cry about  privacy.  Like, oh, Google's searching our attachments.  Not a word.  No, I think we're all just used to it.  We're just, it's like, OK, so what else is new?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're all used to it.  Google's been looking at our email for years and targeting  advertising.  Yeah, but the text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now they're looking into PDFs, doc files, PowerPoint  presentations.  That's kind of like.  And what do we say?  Thank you, Google.  Yeah, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Gmail's a postcard.  You got to just consider that everyone can see into it on  its way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's not like on demand.  They're actually indexing all of it as it comes in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep.  And this just rolled out, I think, a week and a half ago.  So it might need some time to catch up.  But yeah, we'll see what you want.  Gmail also added 100 virtual keyboards to its input tool.  So if you write emails in lots of different languages, you go  into Settings, Language.  You can click on, I think it's Enable Input Tools.  And you'll get a button that lets you switch between  different keyboards for different languages.  Virtual keyboards, transliteration, and IMEs.  Be careful.  Multilingual, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you change everything to Russian, you may regret it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, exactly.  But once that's enabled, it's a one-click toggle.  If you toggle between different widgets, it requires  different keyboards.  Google Contacts got a cool new feature.  It now syncs via CardDAV.  CardDAV was new to me, but CardDAV is similar to CalDAV.  It's an open protocol for syncing contacts.  And this is pretty cool, because iOS syncs contacts  through CardDAV.  So the way that the iOS syncs to iCloud and to Yahoo  contacts, interestingly, Google now supports that.  So you can sync your Google contacts inside your iOS device  easily.  YouTube just got added to Google Takeout.  Google Takeout from our friend Brian Fitzpatrick in the data  liberation front.  You go into Google Takeout, you can now download all the  YouTube videos you've ever posted to YouTube.  It's just a giant zip file.  They're MP4 files, uncompressed.  So if you want to download your archive of YouTube files, if  you had a hard drive crash, or you just want to make sure you  have backup of your data, you can do that now in Google  Takeout.  Google TV getting an update in the coming weeks.  Google Play, movies, TV shows, and music coming to Google TV.  So TV shows, movies, music that you rent or purchase on any  device, you can now play on Google TV.  And it'll also be hooked into their movies and TV app, where  they make recommendations.  If you're watching something, you can purchase it on Google  Play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've been playing with Google Play a lot, because I'm trying  to make the entire switch over to my Android devices and my  tablet.  And I've got to say, the movies are just 15% tackier in  Google Play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It doesn't have a great selection yet.  They've got to work on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're trying to get it to as many devices as possible.  And the other Google Play news is that Google Play will let  you sample in-app purchases before you buy.  So if you're a developer and you make an app that has in-app  purchases, you can set a free trial.  You can say, let users sample this for seven days.  I believe it's up to seven days in order to let your users try  stuff out.  So a developer has to set that.  And that's new now.  So we probably won't see it roll out to apps maybe in the  next few weeks.  That's all I got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That was great, Gina.  That's a lot.  Like real value, real information, real news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you'd use CardDAV on iOS instead of using Exchange, but  it only does contacts.  So you still need to use Exchange for mail and  calendar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I'm not sure if there's advantages to using CalDAV.  Oh, wait a minute.  You can use CardDAV.  There's a CalDAV too.  Does it have a CalDAV server?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's separate.  So I think you set it up separately.  I mean, what's cool about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, actually, Google Calendar does have CalDAV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Google Calendar does have CalDAV, right?  So you can do it that way.  Right now in iOS, when you set up a CardDAV contact sync,  it lists iCloud and Yahoo as options.  So right now, you have to tap on Other to set up your  Google account.  But I'm sure it won't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have to dig through it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That Apple will say Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wonder if there's an advantage to using that instead  of Exchange, because right now you can use Exchange and do  all three with one account entry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  That's a good question.  Because right, I have that set up right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's how we're doing it now.  You just use m.google.com as the Exchange server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, that's one disadvantage of application  specific passwords.  I'd have to generate two new application  specific passwords.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Using Exchange and then CardDAV as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Good.  It just occurs to me, as Gina does that, that it goes to  Google's strength of services.  I can't imagine us having a similar rundown of what's new  at Twitter or Facebook.  We'll just complain about those things.  These are little gifts from Google.  From the Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, every week when I pick out my tip, I always go  through these little product updates, and I just pick out  and push them aside.  Or the other ones.  I'm glad we'll have a chance to go through them.  So I don't know.  Maybe we won't have as many every week.  But this week there was a lot of little feature updates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll get to the Google News, and we have also picks and  tips, and Jeff has a number of the week that's all coming up  on this week in Google.  Jeff and Gina and me.  But first, a word from Ting.  The folks at Two Cows have an interesting philosophy.  They are looking at industries that don't work, and they want  to reinvent them and make them work.  Now, they already did that with domain name registration.  That's hover.com.  We talked about that before.  Now they're doing it to the cell phone companies.  Boy, if ever there were a business that could be  reinvented and fixed, it's the cell phone.  I want you to visit twig.ting.com.  I love this.  You love your netcast.  How about your phone company?  Nobody loves their phone company.  Well, with Ting, it's a no BS mobile service.  That's my phrase, not theirs.  They're an MVNO for Sprint.  That means if Sprint is a good provider in your area, you get  good signal, then you should absolutely look at Ting.  For one thing, there's no contract.  It's month to month.  There's no early termination fee.  So none of that upsell stuff.  They don't bundle or ride along.  Basically, if you go to Ting, look at the plans.  These are like serving suggestions.  Pick the plans you want just to get an idea of what it  might cost you.  So you pay for $6 per device per month.  So you can have 10 phones, five phones, one phone, $6 per.  So let's say I've got a family of four, four phones.  Together, the four of us will use 1,000 minutes, 1,000 text  messages, and let's say two gigabytes.  Total of that would be $89 for all four of us a month.  That's already a third of what I'm paying Verizon or  Sprint or AT&T.  But now, here's the beauty part.  You don't use all of that.  They rebate it to you.  You use more.  They charge you at the same scale.  There's no penalty.  There's no overcharge penalty.  You get credits on service you don't use.  You never pay for more than you use.  And they throw in voicemail, picture and video messaging,  three-way calling, caller ID, tethering, and hotspot free.  So there's no additional charge for hotspotting, no  additional charge for tethering.  You're using the data plan that you choose.  And again, if you use more, they'll charge you more, but  at the same rate.  So there's no mysterious line items in your bill.  There are no hidden charges, recovery fees, no BS.  That's what they say.  Unlimited devices on one plan, too.  And each device costs a flat $6.  You share pooled minutes, messages, and gigabytes.  You've got a great online control panel so you can see  exactly what you're using.  No hold customer support, 8 AM to 8 PM Eastern.  A real person will pick up the phone and will work through  your problem at 855 TING FTW.  TING for the win.  They also have a lot of great support at help.ting.com,  including very active customer forums.  In fact, all you have to do is search Twitter for the  hashtag TING, and you'll see a bunch of very happy TING  customers.  So you do this all online.  You'll purchase your device from TING.  You'll get it in two to five business days.  You'll activate the device.  You have the option.  And by the way, they have a great selection of  Android phones.  Let's go look at the device section.  You select the plan you want.  TING will bill you at the beginning of your payment  period, but you'll be charged or credited in the following  pay period based on what actually happened.  They've got the Galaxy S3.  That's my phone of choice.  Soon getting newer phones.  They do have simple feature phones, too.  This is actually a good idea for somebody like a kid or a  grandparent who just needs a simple phone for emergency  purposes.  And I'm going to show you I could save $50 on that device.  They also have data devices, which is nice.  And even Femto sells.  So go to twig.ting.com right now, and you're going to save  $50 on your first device when you sign up.  Check out the savings calculator if you just want to  see how much you will save with TING.  twig.ting.com.  Let's reinvent the mobile phone business.  Boy, if there were ever a business that could be  improved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Next, Leo, can I fly TING Air, please?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Two cows air.  Let's talk to Elliot Noss.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Absolutely.  If two cows could fly, it would be an airline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It would be two cows air.  You know, that actually would be a good name for an airline.  It would be.  The flying cow.  I'm taking the flying cow to Seattle tonight.  TING.  There's a lot of business that I'd like to get  Elliot Noss into.  So here's the big story.  Broke earlier today.  Microsoft's denying it.  But it happened in the Czech Republic.  Now, Microsoft says that this is a Czech  subsidiary of Microsoft.  But Peter Baubeck, who is a product manager at Microsoft  Czech Republic, says that native apps for Microsoft  Office will be available for Android and iOS in March.  Now, the Microsoft response to this was, the information  shared by our Czech subsidiary is not accurate.  We do not have anything further to share at this time.  So that could be April.  Could be February.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I give a conditional cheer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Everything I know about Microsoft and everything  we've talked about Windows Weekly is that absolutely,  Microsoft's even said that we will have Office on Mac  and Tosh, Android, and Windows phones.  It's too big a market for them to ignore.  And the rumors for Office for the iPad  have been flying for months.  And it's pretty much accepted.  I'll ask on Windows Weekly tomorrow.  I'll ask Mary Jo Foley.  She's got very good sources.  But I would guess this was an accidental leak of a true story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can't wait, because I've tried most of the alternatives.  What do you guys use for Office docs on Android or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The good news is on iOS, there's some good choices.  The Apple stuff.  And I use those.  But on Android, I haven't found anything good.  There's Google Docs.  That's it.  And even that's not very good.  What do you use, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I honestly, now that I'm not writing a book anymore,  my editor's not requiring that I use Word,  I just don't use Office docs as much anymore.  I stick to text files as much as possible,  which I know is not a choice that most people have.  Yeah, I mean, I use Google Docs for most of my Office stuff  right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't find myself creating documents much on a phone  or even a tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, me neither.  I'm using the tablet and the keyboard now.  I'm traveling without a laptop now.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think that's the reason.  I think there's more and more people doing that.  And that's the reason they need to do this.  And even if it's just to look at a spreadsheet  or to deliver PowerPoint, you don't  have to be creating stuff.  You could be consuming it too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The problem is I guess it's called Smart Office 2, I think.  Yeah.  Which is OK.  It's fine.  But it has irritating things.  Maybe it's just my stupidity.  But I was reading a manuscript to a wonderful book coming out.  And I'd get through to page 80.  And then if it closed, I got to open it up.  I got to scroll through to page 80 again.  It's that kind of stuff.  It's just not ready for prime time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yuck.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's funny.  I don't use full on Office tools anymore  unless I have to make a really beautiful formatted document.  I'm doing that so little.  I mean, otherwise, Google Docs just kind of works.  And it's easy.  And it's in every browser.  I mean, not to be a commercial for Google Docs.  But I saw this.  And I was like, yeah, this makes a lot of sense for Microsoft.  This is a huge market for them.  I have to suppress a very cliched, snarky joke  about fitting the ribbon toolbar on the iPad.  Am I really going to be doing heavy document work on the iPad?  I don't know.  Maybe with a keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I wonder what the business is, since we're  in rife speculation mode, which is what we do.  I wonder what the business model would be,  if it's a purchase of the app or if it's trying to drive you  to their cloud as a service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, SkyDrive, right?  Get you hooked in a SkyDrive.  Or is that the Office?  I think that's the Office thinking.  I think that's the one, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, SkyDrive, yeah.  Well, and Microsoft's really moving to the cloud.  Their Office 365 is actually a pretty good version  of Microsoft Office.  It's going to be built into Office 2013.  And they're doing tablets.  They're doing Surface.  So if they were competitive, I guess,  they could ignore iOS and Android and say,  look, if you want a really good Office solution,  just use our stuff.  But I think they're going to do it.  They've always worked across various platforms.  Yeah, it's a big market.  They make a ton of money on the Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I never understood why they killed IE for Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because it was horrendous.  Yeah, well, that's true.  Maybe that's why.  It was never a good app, truthfully.  No, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wonder what the pricing is going to be like for it.  Will it be you have to have a license to the desktop  in order to have the mobile app?  Or is it just going to be a $15 mobile app?  Is it going to be a $30 mobile app?  Is it $5?  Curious.  It forces all that, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because you're just not buying the package anymore.  It gives you access to your docs,  so God knows what it will be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mary Jo Foley, our host of Windows Weekly,  tweeted earlier, according to Gardner in our chat room,  I still think Office is coming to iOS, Android,  and other non-Microsoft platforms.  But maybe not as a local client, or maybe not in March.  So if it's not a local client, it could be a web-based  solution, but then it would be a lot like Google Docs,  with the same kind of problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then you've got problems in terms of whether or not  you can work offline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, what happens when you get in an airplane?  Yeah, which is different.  I think you can't charge too much on tablets for apps,  right?  No.  I don't know.  You can't charge more than $50.  You probably shouldn't charge more than $10.  That's what Apple charges for its Office apps.  But you could also use it as an entry drug, a gateway drug,  to the big office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not only an entry and gateway, you're right,  but also a defense against the people who just say,  what the heck?  Let's just use Google Docs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And everything Microsoft's done right now  is in response to Google Docs.  It's pretty clear that they're threatened by it.  So yeah, I think that's why everybody agrees.  Google is pushing for tablet-optimized apps,  which is nice.  At last.  Finally.  I think their Nexus 7.  They haven't released numbers, have they?  But it's got to be a success.  It's got to be big.  It's certainly a big success.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've been looking.  I've been repeating again and again.  It's supposed to come out with a new version today.  It will finally give you a landscape,  including the home screen.  New version of Jelly Bean?  Oh, I like that.  Yes.  They're going to push it out for the Nexus 7 today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's a hard thing to do.  Honeycomb did that, right, Gina?  And it was ugly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It did.  It did.  Was it ugly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because it took a while.  It was almost like the icons were loose inside,  and they had to slide over and re-  It just took a long-  It was kind of ugly.  And I can see why they said,  let's get this right before we do that again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  The Nexus 7 is small enough that you're holding it in portrait.  You naturally hold it portrait mode.  Right?  Honeycomb came out on the bigger tablets.  This story about Google encouraging developers  to tabletize their apps,  kind of, I think, goes hand in hand with the next one,  which is that they are to co-brand a 10-inch Nexus  with Samsung.  Right?  So this is the thing.  Like, I have a lot of developer guilt.  I have guilt because, well, I'm Catholic, right?  So I have that guilt.  But I'm easily guilted.  But I have a lot of guilt about,  I haven't tablet optimized to-do text,  which is my app yet.  Mostly because, you know, there just wasn't a lot of,  there weren't a lot of people,  weren't a lot of users on a tablet.  And then when the Nexus 7 came out,  you know, the screen is small enough.  You know, my app is a to-do list app.  So it's just a list view.  It looks okay enough.  You know, it doesn't look absolutely horrendous.  There isn't so much white space.  To-do text on the iPad looks obviously not optimized.  You know, so I felt like I've kind of squeaked by.  I mean, I'm also, you know, not running a business.  It's just a weekend project.  So I kind of have been taking my time.  But once a 10-inch comes out, you know, that gets,  if a 10-inch Nexus comes out that's as popular  as the Nexus 7, I'm going to feel much more compelled  to optimize my app for the tablet.  Because the bigger screen just calls for it.  And you just don't want to have your app  having these big, you know, gaping wide white spaces  and, you know, crying out for the sidebar and the split view.  So Google's guilting me.  I'm going to have to get down to it  and make a tablet optimized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can you tell as a developer how many of your customers  are using Nexus 7s?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, I believe so.  I think in the developer console you can.  Yeah, you can see a version of Android and device as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, let's hear it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Looking up right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm really curious about all of that.  I mean, how many people are using Gingerbread?  How many people are using Honeycomb, Jelly Bean?  How many people are using tablets versus phones?  I would guess the vast majority are probably on ice cream sandwich  on phones, I would guess.  And your users are advanced,  are going to be more sophisticated Android users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I have mine.  I definitely got the power user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I bet the Nexus is the number one phone in the galaxy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is just active installs on October 9th.  So that was yesterday.  That's interesting.  9%, that seems really high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  9% Nexus 7?  Nexus 7, yeah.  You better get going, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess I have work to do.  Yeah, I have a really kind of savvy, smart, geeky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How many are Amazon platforms, does it say?  No, Nexus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, so I'm looking at the Google developer console.  It's Play Store.  Yeah.  Play Store, so the Play Store doesn't tell me  who's on Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right, right, right, da, da, da, yes, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you on the Amazon Store?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am in the Amazon Store, and judging from sales,  not very many, not very many on Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, we've got an inside source here, Jeff.  Oh, trigger, right?  Yeah, sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, my app, like I said, is super,  it's super nerdy.  It's super power user nerdy.  I've got a lot of people using the Galaxy Nexus here.  I mean, these are users with the most recent Android phones,  and these are nerds and developers like me,  so I'm a little skewed.  I don't think I'm very representative  of regular Android users.  But yeah, I guess I got some work to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So when you do, so Android automatically kind of,  you know, you could say fill the screen,  but it doesn't, you're saying it doesn't look as good  as if you kind of are intelligent about using this space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  So Android, everything is a relative layout.  It's like much like being a web page, right?  So you make a page, if you expand the width  and the height of the screen, it just kind of fills it.  And, but yeah, to tablet optimize, you would say,  beyond a certain point, you know,  you can add more buttons on the top, you know,  say that the action bar, you can show a split view layout  or it's like, here's my list and maybe here are my,  you know, categories on the other side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you query a device or screen resolution  and then change your output based on that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You actually define, you define your layouts using XML,  which is sort of a markup language,  but you, but, but, but Android kind of handles it all for you.  So it's not like the old JavaScript or you're like,  if I'm using IE, you're not hard coding,  like particular device names or anything like that.  Android kind of handles that all for you.  There's different resolutions.  There's the maximum resolution, medium, small,  and then there's screen sizes.  You define your layouts and then Android kind of just  fluidly figures out what layout should I use  given the orientation that the device is in  and the screen size.  But you do have to define the layouts given,  given, you know, the different options.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, well-  Do you have to change things, Gina,  for the iPhone 5 with the extra row now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, for the iPhone 5, you know, you have to,  I had to provide high resolution art for the retina display.  And when you launch an iPhone app,  the first image that you see is actually an image, like-  Oh, it's a picture. It's a bitmap.  Right, it's a bitmap.  A JPEG.  Exactly, so because the iPhone 5 is taller,  every app developer in order to optimize for iPhone 5  had to provide a new launch image that-  Jeez.  Yeah, you know, and if you're a game that has lots of assets  and lots of backgrounds and things like that,  you had to provide all that as well, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you have to bundle both in the app, right?  The app doesn't download different versions  for the different phones.  You got to, it's all got to be in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's, it all got to be in there, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So games with a lot of graphics and textures,  it's going to double the size of the game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly, exactly.  Yeah, you have to provide art for the iPhone 5,  iPhone 4, Retina, non-Retina, iPad, iPad 2, Retina.  I mean, there's several options.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I guess we won't hear Apple use the word  fragmentation again for a while.  Ha ha ha.  It came around to bite him in the butt.  So now, just as this is the rumor  about this 10-inch tablet,  this comes from NPD's analyst, Richard Shim.  He says, get ready,  because it'll be a 2560 by 1600 display,  according to him, that's a pixels per inch of 299.  That's better than the Retina iPad by about 10%.  He says it'll be more expensive.  Interesting that they're doing it with Samsung,  not Asus, who did the Nexus 7 for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think they're trying to spread the wealth.  We have another story here,  is that LG is going to have a Nexus phone.  I also think we hear a lot of reports  about how they're going to make,  I think we talked about this before,  Nexus a certified Google use  that will get advantages versus just plain Android now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that makes sense,  because they can control Nexus  in a way they can absolutely can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It'd be great if they did,  and you know you're going to get updates  and that kind of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So are we surprised that Motorola doesn't,  I mean, they own Motorola.  I guess that's what they're trying to do,  is make sure that people understand  we're not going to give Motorola any advantage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's worse because Motorola screwed up,  and I don't fully understand the story,  so I'm hoping one of you will explain it to me.  That Motorola backed off on doing updates  on some of its phones,  and really pissed off a lot of users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's so confusing, because Motorola,  if you didn't know that Google owned Motorola,  you would think, oh man,  that's got to be the worst Android company.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's down under Android, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Android users outraged over Motorola's broken promise.  Yeah, I see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, I never thought the Droid  was really a good example of Android,  and I would have thought that the Nexus,  the next Nexus phone at least,  would be in Motorola.  The Photon 4G,  which was a very high-end Android phone,  because it had dual-core,  one of the first to have dual-core a year ago,  is not going to get updated.  Last Friday, the company said,  we are never going to update the Photon.  Wow.  The Atrix, which was announced to CES,  which, you know, very high-end, no update.  I don't know, are they gingerbread?  I guess they are.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, they're gingerbread.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know, I don't know.  Are they gingerbread?  I guess they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they're stuck on gingerbread.  That's horrible.  And this is after Motorola joined the Open Handset Alliance.  They promised Android.  That promised, yeah.  And so, there's three phones.  There's the...  Photon.  Photon, the Atrix, let me find...  And the Electrify, which no one has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No one has any of these, but that's beside the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And they're offering what, a coupon or something, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think what they should do is offer free routing,  so you could put Clockwork Mod and CM10 on it.  That's what I think they should offer.  Free route.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wanna see that sign on the Verizon store.  Bring it in, we'll route it for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, isn't that what, I mean,  if you're a sophisticated user, you go,  well, whatever, I'll put CM.  But I did have CM10 running on my Galaxy S3,  but Wi-Fi is still kind of funky.  That's the problem when you put these mods on.  That's the problem.  Often one thing doesn't work as well  because it's a driver issue.  It's like when Linux first came out.  You know, you say,  oh, well, your webcam's not gonna work,  but everything else will work fine.  So I guess, you know, maybe there won't be drivers either.  I don't know.  Did they, I think they're still, in some cases,  Motorola's still locking the bootloader.  Is that right, Jason?  Jason is, how is the, one of our hosts on All About Android.  Does Motorola lock any of their bootloaders, Jason?  Do you know, off the top of your head?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, that's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He says he doesn't know the answer.  He doesn't know, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know if those are officially locked.  I would guess that they probably are, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because you'd think with Google owning them,  they would just say, well, you know,  please, these are more rootable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, especially considering Motorola, you know,  any of their unlocked bootloader devices  that they've been doing lately  have been like special developer additions.  So they haven't necessarily been the most kind of open  to unlocking the bootloader in the past anyways.  I'd really be surprised if these were unlocked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Motorola posts, this is in August,  Motorola posts Android bootloader unlock page,  but only for the photon.  So all the rest of them are locked.  That means you can't root them and you can't,  well, you can, but it's harder.  I would never say can't do anything.  But they did give you four steps to unlock your device.  If you had a photon queue.  I think it's, that's Verizon.  You gotta blame Verizon for that.  Google, and but what, so what you're really seeing  is Google, unlike Microsoft being very careful  not to piss off its OEMs.  They're not exactly OEMs,  cause it doesn't own Android,  but not for want of a better word.  And you know, to keep the partners all happy,  we're gonna spread it out with the wealth  and we're not gonna make Motorola be any less rapacious  than they were before we bought them.  We're actually gonna make Motorola worse.  We're gonna make it worse.  Just so you feel better.  See, we, Motorola still sucks.  Just in case you were worried.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's to prove we're not favored.  There's no favoritism here.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  LG is gonna unveil, it's according to CNET,  it's a Nexus, the new Nexus at the end of the month.  It'll be the Optimus G.  I haven't had an LG phone in a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, wow, me neither.  But I get excited about new Nexus releases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I like that.  We're kind of do, aren't we?  I mean, the Nexus was good,  but it's not, it's no longer the top of the line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I'm a little jealous of your Galaxy 3,  but the Nexus is still a good phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'm getting the note.  I bought the note.  I bought it unlocked from ExpanseSys, the European version.  Don't please, whatever you do,  don't ever tell me how much 545 pounds is in real money.  Ooh.  Ooh, I don't wanna know.  Yikes.  Ooh.  I did it for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm Googling the conversion rate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's only 16 gigs,  but I just, I couldn't bring myself to spend more than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just spoke with a whole bunch of Korean editors yesterday,  editors and publishers yesterday here at CUNY.  I told them my one disappointment  in visiting their country  was I couldn't get a good price on the note.  Yeah, the note too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It looks pretty nice.  It looks like a Galaxy S3, but it's a little,  it's actually a little thinner than the old note  and a little narrower, but a little taller, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you were me and you carried a Nexus phone  and a Nexus 7 tablet, would you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't need it.  No, no, because you got a, you got the one of each.  Well, would the note replace both?  Oh, would it replace both?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Would you just carry a note instead of carrying a tablet?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I don't carry, you know why I don't carry the Nexus 7  because it's Wi-Fi only.  It's kind of inconvenient.  So it's $872.33.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't wanna say it.  Ah!

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ah!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, Lord.  Oh, Lord.  Well, but the good news is I'll have it by the next week.  By next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what the iPhone 5 costs unlock.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, good point.  I just feel like it's my duty.  And in order to get it quicker, I'm sorry,  it's only 529 pounds.  In order to get it quicker,  but then I bought a lot of other stuff.  I had to get the white one  because the titanium's not in stock yet.  So I wanted a different one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But, you know, this is where you and I say,  oh yes, boss, you have to do this  and we're grateful you did so we can feel better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no, that's my job.  Seriously.  I think this was definitely your duty as a...  Yes, it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You should feel fine.  Yes.  And I'll show you next week.  Cool.  We're eager to see it.  Yeah.  Well, people, you know, it's out in people's hands.  There's the Android authorities review.  And one of the things they're saying is that the battery life  is really kind of remarkable.  Really?  Will it do 4G?  That was what I was gonna wait for  is the 4G LTE version from Verizon.  And then I got mad at Verizon.  Turns out I shouldn't have because AT&T's worse.  But it was too late.  I've already pushed the button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The thing I didn't know with my Galaxy Nexus  is it's the worldwide version.  You cannot buy accessories or anything for it.  The battery of it versus the CDMA Verizon  is a different shape.  Right.  Thus, rechargers plus everything else.  Yes.  I could have told you that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, wow.  That's annoying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're all different.  It's all like as if they were just trying to screw with you.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait, the charger connector is different?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  No, the battery size is different.  The battery size is different  so you have to get a different external charger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  Oh, I see.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do that for every phone I buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You just buy an external charger?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I buy two extra batteries and an external charger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I couldn't even buy an extra OEM battery  for the Nexus phone.  I had to buy an off-brand and an off-brand charger.  Right.  They're a lot cheaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that was good.  But you lose NFC because the NFC chips.  Exactly.  Samsung's getting smart.  The NFC chips in the battery.  So the Optimus G,  but they say that other handset manufacturers  may also do Nexus.  Ooh, look at that back.  It looks like a matrix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We really got a...  So there's three levels of Android then, right?  Four levels.  Okay.  The highest is Nexus.  Nexus.  So we got updated and stuff like that.  The next is, I guess, open handset, right?  OHA.  The next is Amazon.  We screwed with you.  But we didn't pretend to be OHA.  Right, and then the next is...  Chinese company.  $20 tablets from Chinese companies, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Chinese company.  Takes advantage of it.  We've put some special software in here just for you.  That's tied to the story about Huawei and XTE,  which are both Chinese companies with,  apparently rumored, ties to the Chinese military.  The Congress committee on Monday said,  we're not gonna let government employees buy these.  Canada just announced,  we're not gonna let government employees buy these phones.  Because the real concern is that  they might have some special spy stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not just by the phones, but also Huawei.  Any of the products.  It's a lot of backend stuff.  Yeah.  The fear is that it was gonna be open doors  into our phone system.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, not just, and it was funny  because it didn't sound like they were worried  about cyber warfare or terrorism.  They're worried about them stealing intellectual property  from US companies, listening in on the big meeting.  That's like, oh, Apple's gonna do a mini iPad, quick!  To the drawing board!  Chinese company Oppo.  I have an Oppo Blu-ray player, it's quite good.  You would.  They, no, you know what?  It's a video file Blu-ray.  It's considered to be one of the best Blu-rays out there.  I didn't know they were a Chinese company.  I thought they were Finnish with a name like Oppo.  They are making the world's first 1080p smartphone  with a five inch screen.  Get ready for this, 441 pixels per inch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Battery life, 37 seconds.  Yeah, no kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oppo, I like Oppo.  6.65 millimeters thick.  Oh, that was their phone earlier.  That was the world's thinnest smartphone.  How thick is the Apple iPhone 5?  The Oppo Find, they call it the Find.  The Find 5, five inch 1080p screen.  Beating Apple's iPhone quite handily,  which the iPhone's written as 326 PPI.  This'll be 441.  The Lumia, 331.  Lumia 920, this'll be 441.  But HTC's rumored to be doing a 1080p as well.  Good Lord!  These things are amazing.  They are.  Now it's just numbers.  Now it's just people trying to,  hey, we got more pixels.  I don't know if we need them.  In fact, that's one of the raps on the Galaxy Note 2.  It actually has a lower pixel density.  It's 1280 by 720 instead of 1280 by 800.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you get your-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's gonna be a good holiday season.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's gonna be a good holiday season.  Yeah.  Gadget wise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Gadget wise.  There's also a four inch Galaxy S3 coming out.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We talked about this on MacBreak Weekly yesterday.  Samsung's, Apple's philosophy is to make one perfect thing.  One size fits all.  You could do this.  You'll love it.  Or nothing.  Any size you want as long as it's this.  Samsung is doing kind of the opposite,  which is to try to find,  to make one for every possible user.  So if you want a four inch, they got a four inch.  If you want a five and a half inch,  they got a five and a half inch.  And everything in between.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It seems to be working.  My wife looks at my phone and says it's too big.  Which one do you, oh the Galaxy, you have a Nexus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Galaxy Nexus, yeah.  And that's 4.3 I think.  So it's not even that big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What is an iPhone now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Four.  If you're trying to speak.  Is it four?  It's four, but it's a 16 by nine four.  So it's 1136 by 640.  It's a unique in size that no one else does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Special snowflake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a very unique, special, special snowflake.  I wanna put a little headband with a bow on it.  I just can't decide if it's a boy or a girl.  You know what?  My daughter said the best thing to me  in the world yesterday.  She said, you ever hear of this comic strip called XKCD?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, see I wanna hear that from my kid really soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She went through Garfield, Bloom County.  I was happy about Bloom County.  But when she said, she said, yeah I found it.  I've read every strip they ever published last night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's good.  That's good taste.  Isn't that good?  Isn't that good taste?  Oh yeah, high five to Abby.  Yeah, XKCD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I've heard of them.  I should've told her about the oatmeal.  Yeah, I should've told her about the oatmeal.  By the way, that oatmeal campaign  to get the Tesla houses working pretty well, huh?  He apparently has bought it.  He raised a significant amount more.  1.4 I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Holy cow.  And the real estate agent for one side or the other  says that, yeah, they have an agreement in terms.  And so the Tesla museum will come.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well. It's pretty cool.  They own the land.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I think it has more money than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do they raise so much money  that they're able to actually build a museum?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's not a question of build.  I think it's a question of get the rats out of what is there.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Pfft.  Pfft.  Pfft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The land, laboratory, and foundation  underneath the tower are still there.  And so he's bought the property.  The property cost 1.6 million,  but there was a matching grant.  So he only needed to raise 850,000.  And I think didn't he raise 1.4?  Yeah.  So there's a nice hefty little chunk for the museum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is no Tesla museum in the United States,  but now there is.  And that was an Indiegogo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because he did that amazing Tesla comic,  he had done like an homage to Tesla a few weeks ago,  and then this campaign.  And I love that comic.  And I mean, it kind of, you know,  Edison didn't look too good at the end of the comic.  No, he shouldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, he shouldn't.  He should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He should've killed an elephant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like, hey, hey, hey, hey.  But yeah, it's incredible.  It's just like, it's not just about,  you know, it wasn't just nerd love for Tesla.  I mean, it was like he sort of brought out  the nerd love for Tesla,  and then said, here's something that you can do.  It was incredibly successful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They raised $1,370,511 on Indiegogo.  Let's build a goddamn Tesla museum.  Good for the oatmeal.  All right, we're gonna take a break.  Come back with more.  Gina Trapani is here.  Mama Gina.  Mama Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mama G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think you have to teach Edda how to eat meatballs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah, oh, Nona's working on it.  Sunday gravy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah, this is the thing.  You gotta decide what to,  but I guess because they were previous grandchildren,  you don't have to decide what to call her.  That's already given, right?  Right, yeah.  What is she, Nona?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nona, yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My grandma, I don't know why, was Nani.  Oh, okay.  Maybe because I couldn't say Nona, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe, yeah, that's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was the first grandchild, so I got to choose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Aw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I choose Nani.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So cute, so cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I have this vision,  you have a little baby Leo with the same Leo head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, oh yeah, the head was always this big.  It was like a little stalk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I sort of imagine that your bottle  is shaped like the microphone, though.  Like I can't picture a microphone.  Always broadcasting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what, there's a picture,  and I don't have it, and I wish I did,  of me probably at the age of three  with a turntable and talking into a pot.  Oh, geez.  Oh, that's great.  So I think that this,  I think when you get into the nature nurture debate,  and you will see this, Gina,  there's definitely some nurture,  but they come out ready to do something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ready to do something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they come out a certain way, right?  Jeff, I'm not wrong on this.  That's right.  You don't have a whole hell of a lot to do with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hopefully my girl will really like Legos and coding.  I don't know, we'll see.  God, I hope so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You gotta go with the flow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You gotta go with the flow.  She might wanna be a princess,  and I'd be okay with that, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She will be whatever annoys you the most.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  She will be whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I think we know what she's gonna be,  ladies and gentlemen.  Oh, yes, oh yeah, oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Barbie, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm like, let's go to the Maker Faire,  drop the Barbies, let's go to the Maker Faire.  Let's go there.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Let's go there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't wanna go to the Maker Faire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait.  Here's my best vision.  Little Etta wants to join in those pageants  where you have to get first of all.  Oh no.  Right.  No, no.  And then it's street.  It's, and Bobby, you can't keep me from my life's dream.  This is my dream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They do that to you.  I gotta tell you, I gotta warn you.  It's mean to torture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm gonna give her the time that I can dress her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it is so much fun, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a lot of fun.  It's really a lot of fun.  I can't wait.  Whatever she wants to do, I will support her.  I will certainly encourage her  with the things that I'm interested in.  But if pageants is what she wants,  then we'll have a discussion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, okay, this is on tape, Etta.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's not allowed to watch the show until she's 13.  That's what you say.  Whatever makes you happy, dear.  I just want you to be happy.  Isn't that what your mom told you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Let me note that today  is my daughter, Joya's 16th birthday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, there's a good birthday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Happy birthday.  That's a huge birthday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Happy birthday.  And of course, sweet 16 and never been kissed.  We hope not.  Okay, one more thing.  This is not gonna turn into the baby show.  I just wanna say.  But one more thing.  Abby's first kiss, Joe Montana's son,  Nicholas.  Oh, that's good.  I had dreams.  We were gonna have a football dynasty.  I was ready and then they broke up like a month later.  I was so pissed off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a good first kiss though.  That's a good story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a good first kiss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Good for her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think she was 16.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Our show brought to you today,  Father's Heart Broken.  The show brought to you today by,  so I buried my tears in my Mustang.  Like every good father.  Yeah, that 2010 Mustang GT 5.0.  That helped a lot.  And if you're a Mustang or a Ford lover,  you're a Ford family, a Ford owner,  you gotta visit social.ford.com  if you're an aspiring Ford owner too.  You can read about Ford articles on all sorts of subjects.  Here's an homage to Carl Shelby,  who built those amazing Shelby GTs and Ford  and Shelby Mustangs.  Here's an interesting conversation  on how to get better fuel economy with your hybrid.  Great, great articles.  Social.ford.com.  I wrote one on,  I interviewed one of Ford's top technologists.  I'm probably gonna do the same at CES this year.  And I wrote an article about their API  and what their plans are for autonomous vehicles.  Like that's what stuff I'm always interested in.  Here's what you can do.  You visit social.ford.com, read those articles.  You could share your story.  There's lots of stories about Ford owners.  It's just so cute.  I mean, people will really love their cars.  Ideas too, in any,  this is kind of a 21st century suggestion box.  Listen to this one.  William B says,  replace the windshield with a 4K LED backlit  flat panel HD display.  Night vision capability.  And then the vehicle exterior,  just kind of a sheet metal covering  where the windshield would be.  You like that idea?  Go there and vote.  And whatever you do,  make sure you grab your badge to show your Ford love,  including the tech geek badge.  You're not just ahead of the curve.  You're the one leading at social.ford.com  and find out about the new 2013 Fusions  just coming out right now,  including the Fusion Energy Plug-in Hybrid.  That's the one I'm getting.  I might actually trade my Ford Mustang in for it.  Don't tell.  Which one?  Which one?  The plug-in, now that I have a house,  I could plug it in.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yay!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I see.  I couldn't get it because I was in an apartment  and there aren't charging stations yet in Petaluma.  But you go to the Oakland Airport front row,  there's like 10 charging stations  and there's never a-  Oh, it would be.  Oh yeah.  And so this is a Fusion,  it's a hybrid, plug-in hybrid.  So it's an electric,  you can use an electric or as a gas vehicle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what I want.  My problem is what I have to have  is a plug-in hybrid four-wheel drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sure that's gonna happen.  In fact, one of the things,  oh yeah, and I'll ask when I,  I'll talk to Alan Mulally in January,  but one of the things he told me last year was  that they delayed the electric vehicles  because they want to make it so that their assembly lines  all over the world can put in any drive train  into any vehicle.  So any vehicle on the same line can be made diesel, petrol,  he calls it petrol,  electric or plug-in or hybrid electric.  And the reason being that they want to be able  to elastically respond to demand,  which makes perfect sense.  So, and it's not just gonna be like this special one car,  it's gonna be the whole line.  So they'll have a four-wheel drive.  I guarantee you they'll have a four-wheel drive.  Social.Ford.com to find out more.  I don't know, who am I to guarantee you?  I don't work for Ford.  By senses.  Google bomb.  Google image search for completely wrong brings up  Mitt Romney photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mr. Romney.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now is this done on purpose or is this,  because that's what people are searching, why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm sure it's a Google bomb, I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't think it's created that way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I think Google made a statement saying  that this was part of the way their algorithm works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was organic search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He said that his statement  and what he said was completely wrong.  He used the phrase completely wrong  and there were all these news articles  with completely wrong in the headline.  So he did it, he bombed himself?  He bombed himself, yes.  He bombed himself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, a Google spokesman confirms  this is not an intentional Google bomb.  The search results for completely wrong  are the natural result of a flurry of recent news articles  associating Romney with the phrase completely wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So now we have, probably if you look up a bad debater,  you'll see Obama.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you gotta be careful what you say now  because the zeitgeist is reflected in Google search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's interesting, isn't it?  That is fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We are talking on security now about NFC and Google Wallet  and we did a whole episode last week on security now  which if you're interested in NFC,  you probably should listen to it  about security implications of near field communication.  It is now in every new Android phone has it.  The iPhone is the glaring example of a phone that doesn't.  It's kind of the last holdout on NFC.  And Google with Google,  Apple hasn't put credit cards into passbook,  but Google has put credit cards into Google Wallet.  I think Google's getting very close now  to having a very credible tap to pay ecosystem, right?  And now they're doing it for web content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, this is interesting.  I'm not sure how I feel about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How does it work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you hook it up to your web page.  You say, this is pay for content.  So when the user comes to your web page,  they see like the first paragraph,  they start to scroll down  and then a little Google Wallet pop-up comes up and says,  hey, the rest of this page is hidden until you buy it.  Like pay 99 cents, continue reading for 49 cents or 99 cents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is there a low, oh, the range is 25 to 99 cents.  So the lowest, this was always the thought was  if we could only get micro payments working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let me be cynical for a rare moment.  I'm never that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is your Pollyanna, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is simply sucking butt to publishers.  This is sucking up to them and saying,  no, no, no, we're not ruining your business models.  Look, we're enabling the long fabled rescue  of your beautiful content micro payments.  It's never gonna work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's the one thing I do like.  There is a 30 minute refund window.  So if you read the content.  You read fast.  Well, 30 minutes is enough for almost any article  unless it's like a really long, you know,  John Seabrook article.  And you know, and if you didn't like it  and you thought that wasn't worth 49 cents,  you could get a refund.  And once you pay for it, it's yours forever.  I think this is a good, I don't think this is a bad idea.  Yeah, it's, go ahead, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just mixed feelings about it.  I had some mixed feelings about it.  I mean, I feel like if I started to read  a really long feature article  about something I was interested in  and it was well written and I was super intrigued,  you know, I would say, okay, you know, I'll pay.  Something like narratively, right?  That's Jeff, that was that project, the Kickstarter,  like something sort of long form journalism.  Be like, okay, yeah, I'll pay a buck  to read the rest of this, sure.  You know, that's happened to me.  I've hit paywalls before on different sites  and thought, you know, whatever.  But at the same time, you know,  and this is great for something like ThinkUp, you know,  I'd love to do sort of in-app purchases kind of in a web app.  There's possibility there for us.  At the same time, it feels a little bit like  if I saw this, I'd be like,  I would just close the tab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They actually have a link to Peach Pit Press,  which publishes books.  This is a part of their book on Photoshop Elements,  Chapter 11, Filters and Effects.  So you go through it and there's quite a bit  of free content, I'm scrolling, scrolling, scrolling,  and to change the panel view, oh, wait a minute.  Continue reading for 99 cents  and then look what they do, it's redacted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's redacted, like the rest of the content,  you can see sort of pixelated images and blacked out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like here's what you would be getting  if you weren't such a cheapskate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or I'm gonna do what I do next, which is go too far.  But the problem here is that people in the content business  think all of their value is in the content.  And I argue that they're not even in the content business.  That content's a tool to build relationships,  there's other value to be had there.  But that's heresy in my world.  In my world, no, we make good content  and people should pay for that content.  So my fear about the Google Wallet thing  is that it's gonna lead them astray,  just as tablets lead them astray to think,  oh good, now we can make a magazine again.  And they have to read in the order that we say  and one of these damn links.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, let them be led astray,  the quicker they're led astray  and the quicker they realize the failure of that,  the quicker they'll move on to something else.  Well, we do have-  This way they don't have the fantasy that,  gosh, if there were only some way  we could conveniently easily charge for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think we've mentioned this on the show,  but two weeks ago Murdoch,  who he and his minions had called Google parasites  and all kinds of awful things  and he pulled Times of London content off of Google News  and I believe Google search as well  and they came back on hands and knees  and asked for it to go back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We did mention that last week and that's victory.  You declared victory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, okay, sorry, I can't remember.  That's age, Gina, you'll find this out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's why it's good for them to try this.  We're gonna look at it,  we're in the interim,  in a regnum between these new media  and people need to figure it out and let them figure it.  If Google gives them a way to do it and it doesn't work,  then they can say, hey, we tried it.  I don't want them to fantasize that we could do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and for in this example,  this Peach Pit, an ebook kind of example  is actually a pretty good example.  When I did the wave book,  we did the site where the whole book  was basically available for free.  This was something that maybe I would have done,  I would have said, hey, support the project,  give 99 cents.  Yeah, I get it more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not all content should be ad supported.  Is that what you're advocating, Jeff?  Free ad, free media?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, not should be, just saying that  what people forget when it comes to charging people  is that it also brings a marketing cost,  it brings a customer service cost.  It's not this Valhalla that says that,  oh, if only they'd still spent this money,  because the fundamental economics have changed.  We're in an abundance economy,  not a scarcity economy anymore,  and media people don't have pricing power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't wanna see an ad for Taco Hut  in my movies, in the middle of a movie.  I hope you've enjoyed the first half of-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, the equivalent is you watch 10 minutes of Twig,  and then it says, oh, would you like to see the rest  just as they start singing the lead songs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A little bit, that makes me not happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, but I've been on an airplane  where you see the first five minutes of a movie,  and then the sign comes up and says,  hey, if you wanna see the rest of this, swipe your card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's something, there is something bad about that.  It feels like they tricked you a little bit,  like teasing you.  Plus it's like a girl who wears a low-cut shirt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I mean, is that an apt?  Not bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I hear ya.  I see, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like when the crack dealer  gives you your first pipe free.  How about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  First pipe free, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know, I shouldn't have said it, I'm sorry.  But that's by the way, the only reason I said that  is because I feel the same way in both circumstances.  I'm pulling out my shirt.  No, I mean, it's like a tease.  It's like, look what we got.  Oh, but you can't have it unless you have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, what would really happen is then you'll start  to change the way you create the content.  So let's say that you had that 10-minute wall in Twig.  At nine minutes 30, we'd start doing the really good stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As opposed to now, we'll be doing it.  We just do a lot of crap up front.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, we talk about our kids and then we be like,  okay, big Google news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here, you know what it is?  It's this, it's the hand app.  Give me a, I don't like that.  For those of you watching, listening, not watching,  I'm holding out my hand saying give me money.  I don't like that.  On a watch, you gotta pay.  Yeah, I don't like that.  It should be up front or nothing.  Either it's ad-supported free media  or we tell you up front, hey, this is 99 cents  or you have to subscribe and then we'll give it to you.  But that's just me.  That's just my...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm fine with it existing.  I think that's fine.  I think there are uses for it.  There'll be very good uses for it.  My only fear is the delusion that it will bring  to some old media companies.  But as an alternative and a model, holy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, Leo, do you feel the same way  about in-app purchases?  You know, like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  So I'm playing this Simpsons game.  Gosh darn it.  I should never have gotten started.  So I got rid of We Rule, right?  But the Simpsons game, it's got the Simpsons in it.  And so I'm playing this game and it's free.  Right?  It's from Electronic Arts.  And so Homer has destroyed Springfield  and you're rebuilding it.  It's another...  It's Farmville, but it's just with Simpsons.  So it's kind of funny.  They get all the characters and they all talk.  But to do anything really interesting,  I went to visit one of my friend's cities  and he's got all this stuff.  He's got a burning tire yard.  He's got a nuclear power plant about to explode.  I'm so jealous because he bought donuts.  There's a donut store, right?  Now I try to play...  By the way, donuts are not cheap.  A boatload, 2,400 donuts, 100 bucks.  No.  Well, you could spend that much.  You don't have to.  I mean, the lowest amount is you could spend $2,  but you only get a dozen donuts.  So, and everything...  So the problem is this is a kind of an addictive,  compelling game.  It's pretty fun.  But really to get anywhere at any decent speed,  you have to spend cash.  This is the fall of Western civilization.  I agree.  Which part?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a really effective marketing technique.  Didn't you want to buy those donuts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is spending $100 on fake donuts.  That's what Zynga, that's what built Zynga.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know, exactly.  And I don't know why it's crashing  because it's such a good model.  It's got me suckered in.  And they add the social guilt component  because your friends are playing with you.  You can't withdraw.  I don't know how I got suckered in again.  I was able to get out of We Rule,  which was a very similar game on the iPad,  because it was right about when the Rapture was coming.  So I just raptured everybody out of my farm  and I wrote a big raptured.  And that actually got me out of the game.  So we'll have to engineer another end of...  Oh, December 21st.  I'm saved, the Mayan calendar.  There you go.  So I'll be out of this game in December.  All right, let me buy some donuts.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Now...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Regardless of how you feel about it, Leo,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it totally works.  It works.  It works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just saying.  Google Chrome exploit fetches Pinkie Pie  a $60,000 payday.  I always wanted to say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Pinkie Pie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pinkie Pie.  During the Ponyium competition in March,  it was... It's awesome.  He pwned or she pwned this computer  and displayed the Pinkie Pie image  and using a Chrome exploit.  And a fix was released within 12 hours of the exploit.  And this is why Google gives Pinkie Pie $60,000.  He's a she, she's a he.  It's a he, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, this is the second time he's pwned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the second time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  So I think Jeff asked at one point,  could you make a living just...  Oh yeah.  Ask Stan Kaminski.  He's like, I'm here, 60 grand.  That's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's a salary.  So it was a Tuesday,  the Hack in the Box 2012 Security Conference  in Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia  was the second installment of Ponyium and Pinkie Pie,  again, exploiting two vulnerabilities in Chrome.  The first against the scalable vector graphics functions  in the WebKit browser engine,  so it's not Google's fault.  And then the second...  Oh, interesting.  Pinkie Pie encountered a predicament.  It's so tempting to alliterate  the whole article at this point.  I'm impressed that Dan Godin writing  in Ars Technica did not,  although I would have tried.  All P's.  Pinkie Pie's predicament is growing increasingly common  among software exploiters.  A security sandbox  quarantined the HTML and other kinds of browser content.  And Chrome had one,  so all he could do was crash the machine,  but that was enough.  So this is...  So they fixed it.  So to work around this limitation  and actually gain control of the system,  because you got opponent,  if you want to own it.  Pinkie Pie targeted a second bug  in Chrome's inter-process communication layer.  And because this is Chrome code,  it wasn't sandboxed.  And he got the $60,000 top prize.  Google says, we'd like to thank Pinkie Pie  for his hard work  in assembling another great  ponium submission.  That's so great.  What's your...  You must have a hacker handle, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I tell you, but then I have to kill you.  Oh, okay.  I could be Pinkie Pie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nobody, you could be Pinkie Pie.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I could be.  Or you're...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've already discussed my distaste for Pink.  Etta is Pinkie Pie, exactly.  Etta is Pinkie Pie.  Yeah, she came out with a GitHub account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We mentioned a few months ago,  the Google artificial intelligence neural network  that was able to recognize a cat face.  Remember that?  That was this past summer.  Yep.  They're actually gonna use it.  It's not just kind of some weird trick.  They're gonna use these neural networks  to improve speech recognition.  So that's kind of cool.  Technology, you have both an Android.  I guess it's only an Android, right?  Google doesn't...  Oh no, they do that on the desktop  and the browser too, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I feel like...  So I guess they're using YouTube videos  to increase the network's ability to recognize faces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  10 million images from YouTube videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's incredible.  I mean, given with Google Voice, with YouTube,  with all the inputs that Google has.  Exactly.  There's so much potential for this to turn into,  for this network to learn things.  And I feel like this is all connected to Google Now  and to Google Glass, right?  I guess all kind of has to happen on the fly.  I feel like this technology is all sort of connected.  They're trying to get this into the little computer  on your eyes so that it'll recognize people,  it'll behave the right way,  it'll give you the information that you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are we gonna look back 50 years from now and say,  wow, we didn't see this coming,  but when we throw all this data, this is big data.  Because we're uploading 24 hours of videos  every minute to YouTube.  Google can take 16,000 processors, 1,000 computers,  and have them chew on all these images on YouTube  and get smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is the essence of Yuri Milner's investment strategy  is that he believes that you take artificial intelligence  atop this kind of huge amount of data,  and God knows what comes, but he wants to be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I gotta go to the Stratta Conference.  That's the big data conference that Riley does.  They just have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But the other thing I've been saying  that the newspaper companies we're working with right now  is we get so enamored talking about big data,  and I have lots of people in the media business  who need to start with small data.  Like, where does this person live?  What do they care about?  No, well.  Don't be some big database  that'll tell us everything we didn't know.  No, no, no, no, no, no, you got to start  and you didn't build a little bit at a time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just because there's big data  doesn't mean there can't be little data.  Yeah, I know.  Big data start from little data.  That's what I'm telling them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  And you have to figure out what to do with the data.  You can collect the data, you can have access to the data,  but it's figuring out what to do with it.  And so you should start with the small stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And just having data is expensive.  Well, look, we're talking to Ms. Big Data.  I mean, isn't that what ThinkUp really is all about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, ThinkUp definitely is about capturing data  and figuring out what useful insights you can get from it.  And we're still really kind of figuring that out.  But yes, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's what business intelligence, BI, is all about,  is you got all the data, how do you make sense of it?  And then deliver in a pre-chewed Charlie way  to the executive, who's a moron,  something that they actually can use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pre-chewed data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pre-chewed.  That's kind of gross.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Masticated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, no, don't we say we digested it  and we came up with this?  The problem is, chewing's better,  because if you digest it,  the end result is not kind of really what you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Too much poop in my life already.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll tell you, put me off pumpkin pie for years.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh man, this is bad.  I'm sorry, that was bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was bad.  Facebook and Twitter may be asked by a Great Britain  to moderate their networks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're just doing this to get me angry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I am, I was just gonna say, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I put it in there for that purpose, so it's masochism.  Yeah, there are a couple cases that just occurred  in the UK where people were jailed,  fined for saying things that were offensive.  And here we are right back into the discussion  about speech again, because if you start there  with the idea that we're led by offense,  and it becomes at first government's job  to then wash our mouths out with soap  and to make us fearful of what we say.  And then at the next step is that they say,  well, this is too hard for us to do.  We're gonna make it your responsibility,  Google and Facebook and Twitter,  to monitor what the entire world says,  then we're in a heck of a pickle.  And this is why we have in the US,  not only a First Amendment,  but our version of an online section 230,  which is what exempts a site from liability  for things that others create on it.  But now this would turn around and it would make,  if Twitter is told that it could be sued  for anything offensive said on it,  then that's the end of its business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, okay, well, that's two different things though.  I mean, one thing is prosecuting people  for things they say on Twitter.  The other is prosecuting Twitter for things people say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's where, yeah, this is a one, two step, right.  Where we are right now is prosecuting people  for what they say on Twitter,  which I think is bad enough and is a huge problem.  And it's a precedent that they're just not aware  of what's happening.  And judges aren't getting social media  and aren't getting the idea that this is not publication,  this is conversation.  This is the same as walking into your home and saying,  ah, we just heard you say something offensive  and we're gonna drag you off for it.  Hello, Orwell, where'd you come from?  So that's where it is now.  But then the next step that's being discussed is,  well, government can't do that,  so we're gonna make Twitter do it.  Both are heinous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I gotta point out though,  I mean, as this happened in the UK,  this guy, Azar Ahmed, made a comment on Facebook  after the death of British soldiers in Afghanistan.  He said all soldiers should die and go to hell.  If a guy named Azar Ahmed had said this in the United States,  he'd be disappeared.  In Britain, he got 240 hours of community service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But in this country, to be serious about it,  we are supposed to, I would,  stand up for his right to say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and I do.  But I think the NDAA allows him to disappear  and I suspect that would be,  I think we don't hear about these stories.  I think it's happening in the US.  We just don't hear about it because they disappear.  And I'm not being frivolous.  I really don't think.  Yeah, no, I know.  I think it's treated more seriously here.  And I think that we know the NSA plans  to monitor all electronic communications.  They built that whopping great facility to do just that.  So it's not just the UK, I guess is my point.  And we certainly need to be paying attention to this.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is depressing.  And the other thing is it said Facebook.  Now Twitter's one thing, because that's public.  You're saying it out loud.  But Facebook, isn't he just saying it to his friends?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's some version of a public, right?  It's some set of people.  Same with Google+, right?  I might say it to a group, but that is public.  So how are they seeing it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, he could have subscribers.  It could be public.  And Twitter also.  I'd like to know more about that, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'd like to know, for instance,  if this was a public account and a public posting or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  And what's the difference between that and the end  and Yahoo! diming a user in China  for saying something the Chinese government didn't like.  Right.  Right?  To make offensive the rule.  Well, it could be offensive to Chinese orthodoxy.  It could be offensive to some group in the UK.  It could be offensive to the US government.  I don't give a damn.  It's just words.  Yeah.  And then this goes straight into the damn video  and into that idea that we have to recognize  that we're going to get more and more speech.  And if we can't figure out how to live with that,  then we've got a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You remember the couple who came to the United States,  the British couple who came to the United States  and they posted,  what was it?  They were gonna dig up Marilyn Monroe  or something like that.  And then this kid, actually,  this is pretty offensive, what he said,  but he posted offensive comments on Facebook  about a missing child and he got 12 weeks of jail in the UK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, which was terribly offensive.  I will not question that, but is that worth jail?  How is society harmed by that?  Don't we all know he's a dork?  Don't we all know he's ridiculous?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He was originally arrested for his own safety.  About 50 people actually went to his house.  They were so upset.  But wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll admit that I didn't see the story  and I'm trying to figure out what exactly he said.  These are sexual comments about a field.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They actually charged him with child abduction  because he was talking about a child abduction  in an offensive way.  That's going a little far.  He said he did it in a bid to make people think  his account had been hacked.  He'd been drinking at a friend's house.  Aye, aye, aye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He said he was an idiot.  He's an idiot.  Obviously he's an idiot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We all know that.  So we don't need the society to protect us  from every idiot.  Right.  We're idiots because we can't tell who the idiots are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's take a break.  I think, is there any other just,  there's so much more and I don't want to slight any story.  Facebook is testing a want button.  Oh boy.  I want a do not like button.  That would have solved that problem.  Just everybody goes, do not like, do not like you.  You're wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am completely ambivalent about this piece of content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I couldn't care less.  Don't bother me anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The couldn't care less button.  Have you played the Facebook chairs commercial?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's play it.  The things that connect us, chairs, doorbells,  bridges and airplanes according to Facebook.  So we're all sitting on our,  on our collective United States porches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're all sitting on chairs.  Chairs are made so that people can sit down  and take a break.  All over the world.  Anyone can sit on a chair.  And if the chair is large enough,  they can sit down together  and tell jokes or make up stories or just listen.  What the hell?  No, it works.  Chairs are for people.  And that is why chairs are like Facebook.  What?  Doorbells, airplanes, bridges.  These are things people use to get together  so they can open up and connect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they're like Facebook too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And music and other things that people share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, this is weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Facebook is love.  Games books, basketball.  A great nation.  Are they gonna show this on TV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is so confusing.  A great nation is something people build  so they can have a place where they belong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's like Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The universe.  It's like Facebook.  It is vast and dark.  Like Facebook.  And makes us wonder if we are alone.  Like Facebook.  The hell?  Like Facebook.  Like Facebook.  Is to remind ourselves that we are not.  Oh, genius.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know if you wanna play it, Leo.  There's a parody if you look it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Like the toilet.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, I don't know if I...  There's actually quite a few parodies.  This kind of begged to be parodized.  In fact, it might be a parody of itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly.  The parody is now redundant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  That is just wild.  All right, I have to skip this Chicago Fire ad.  See, the Facebook ad didn't have an ad on it.  Now we're probably gonna get pulled from Google  because this is good. Toilets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Toilets are made so that people can sit down  and take a shit.  Sorry.  Anyone can sit on a toilet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're sitting on a toilet together.  She's on it with him.  And they're laughing.  Toilets are like Facebook.  Okay, dokey.  Febreze.  Febreze is like Facebook.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We'll bleep the S word.  Sorry about that.  Yeah, I forgot that was in the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, come on.  So great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So great.  I think we've gone...  This episode has just really gone from...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Poop.  We've run the gamut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and we keep going back for some reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  From poop to low-cut shirts.  Yeah.  Toilets are like Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry about that low-cut.  Everybody seems to think that was a very offensive thing  to say.  I'm sorry.  I guess I'm a sexist pig, but I just...  To me, I didn't say a woman in a low-cut shirt.  It could be a guy with a little corn-oo chain

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  around his neck.  Somebody take the shovel away from the poor man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Seriously, it's okay.  It's okay, Leo.  You're okay.  You're okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You passed.  You put up with an awful lot for me, Gina,  and I'm so sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just want you to know,  it's because I'm like Facebook.  It's because you're like Facebook.  Ha!  Leo is like Facebook.  Oh, okay.  Chat room, make a better...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think there's a video there somewhere.  We're gonna take a break.  When we come back, we will get our tip.  If we haven't given away all our tips.  No, we got one more left.  We're gonna have our tip tool,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tip of the week, this is kind of a cool little thing  in Google Docs.  You can select text that's formatted  like the text you have highlighted.  So just bear with me for a second.  So you've written a document and you've bolded  a bunch of headers or you've italicized some block quotes  and throughout the entire thing,  and then you decided, you know what,  I want to change the way my headers look.  I want to change the font.  I want to make it bold instead of italic or vice versa.  You can select text and then from the context menu,  say select matching text.  So you can reformat all the text whose formatting matches.  You know, it's kind of deep and crazy,  but it sounds, I mean, it's really, really neat little trick  when you've got long documents that are formatted  That's really interesting.  Yeah, it's kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's Microsoft Office quality stuff.  It is.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's Microsoft Office level feature right there.  I always think about Google Docs  as sort of the light version.  That's pretty, pretty cool.  So you can switch up your formatting  throughout your document really quickly  by just applying changes across selected text  that all has the same format.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very nice.  Very nice feature.  Your number of the week, my friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, we, a couple of them,  we did have 10 million tweets during the debate last week,  most of which was the rules like me saying,  oh no, but we'll go past that real quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Most of the tweets were aimed at Obama saying,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  wake up, wake up.  Look at us.  Wake up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, somebody was telling me though  that their tweet stream, and I didn't see,  I didn't watch the debate,  but that they were watching the tweets  and they were getting sponsored Romney posts saying,  here's an extra link, here's some more information  throughout the debate,  which I thought was a very interesting way  to use sponsored tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I believe I heard that PBS bought  Big Bird sponsored tweets, but I'm not sure.  That would be a good idea.  I'm pixelated, God knows why.  Well, it's probably us.  I'm downloading a lot of mail right now.  So Gizmodo has a whole bunch of crazy Facebook stats  in addition to their huge number of members now.  There are 1.13 trillion likes.  100, this one is by like,  all numbers.  140.3 billion friend connections.  Therein lies the essence of Facebook.  219 billion photos.  I found it interesting that the median age,  I thought Facebook had grown up and gotten all old.  The median age is still 22.  And finally, of the 1 billion members,  there are 600 million mobile users,  which is very impressive.  I am shocked at the median age number.  I was too.  I don't know that I, I don't know how, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought Facebook was like the iPhone.  It was for mom and dad now.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm surprised by that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But you know, who knows who's joining in India, you know?  It could be 14 year olds.  I don't know.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it must be because I think in the,  don't you get the sense in the,  I mean, everybody uses Facebook, kids and grownups,  but that means the median age would be older,  I would think.  Right.  Especially since you can't join until you're 13.  Right.  But boy, it just feels like something that mostly,  it's mostly used by adults to keep track  of their high school sweetheart.  Hey.  There should be a phrase.  Is there a phrase for nostalgic longing  for your high school sweetheart?  Like, no, just me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That might be it.  That might be the phrase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Germans have a word for it, I'm sure, but we just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sure, sure.  There's something to do with the prom night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dr. Mom says it's called senility, Leo.  I'm like, that's a good one.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm like, that's a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm like, that's a good one.  But I do, I really do think that that's a lot  of what Facebook is used for, say where are they now?  Oh, I really miss, you know, I really liked her.  What would, I wonder what would have happened if, you know,  we, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I must be the mean one.  Cause I'm like, oh look, that one got fat.  Yeah.  I was just going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there was somebody's web 4675 is pointing out.  There's a great Louis CK episode about that.  He actually finds his old Facebook flame  and she did get, she did get fat.  It's actually a, it's actually really,  that is such a good show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is, it is.  I'm sad it's on hiatus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's so honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I don't know, have I said this in the show before?  I found two old flames and they're both lesbians.  So I'm, my, see?  No, you've never said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff, I knew I liked you.  That's good.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He likes lesbians.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can take that one way or you can take that  the Howard Stern way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Whichever way you prefer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there's a third way you could take it  that you scared them off men forever.  That's the third one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, the way that I take it, I find that a lot of the friends  like male friends that I have, have had this experience  where like at all girlfriend or something to,  and it's, I take it as that you're,  you're caring feminist.  That's how I take it.  That my people are attracted to.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We've got a name for the show, by the way,  Jeff Don Cornelia suggests we call this show  Jeff Jarvis, Lesbian Whisperer.  Lesbian Whisperer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I prefer honorary lesbian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Honorary lesbian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you guys are giving me a hard time  because I said low cut shirt.  That's nothing.  Nothing.  So I was talking about rooting and hacking my Galaxy S3.  And I've mentioned this before,  this is a bit of a pick before,  but I just gotta mention it again  because people always say,  well, how do you do it?  How do you do it?  You should, rooting your phone is almost,  unless you're kind of Motorola phone,  it's almost really trivially easy.  But you should, you gotta look up the instructions  for your phone specifically.  But that's the hardest part about putting a firmware,  a different firmware on your phone.  Because once it's rooted, sky's the limit.  And there's a couple of programs you absolutely have to get.  So I'm not gonna tell you how to root it  because unfortunately it is kind of specific to your phone.  So just XDA developers or somewhere, look it up.  But once you've got it rooted,  there are two programs you're absolutely gonna want.  In fact, by themselves,  there are the reasons to root your phone.  One is titanium backup,  which backs up not only every application on your phone,  but all the settings.  So if you need to blow the phone out  or you lose your phone or whatever,  titanium backup will actually upload it  to Dropbox for you automatically.  And once it does that, you never have to worry  because you can restore your phone and its apps  and its settings, all those settings,  all the Google secondary password BS is all restored,  which is very nice.  So this by itself is a reason to root titanium backup.  I think it's free and then if you want the pro version,  it's a couple of bucks.  And then the other program that if you wanna go  to the next level and start putting some  of the other custom firmwares on there  is ROM Manager from Clockwork Mod.  And it gets better and better all the time.  Premium version worth it and I pay for it is 599.  And it lets you basically,  well, I'll show you real quickly.  Once you've rooted your phone, by the way, it stays rooted.  So I just blasted this phone back  to the original Galaxy S3 software.  But if I want to, I can go right to, here it is,  right to Clockwork Mod and it makes it so easy.  Have you used this, Gina, to root your phone or to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I haven't, I haven't.  I've been trying to stay on this non-rooting  just to kind of have the regular experience,  but this is tempting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, I don't wanna do touchwoods.  If you've got a Nexus, you're fine,  but I have the Galaxy S3.  So you can go to all the ROMs,  including the Cyanogen Mod nightlies,  if you really wanna live on the bleeding edge.  These are literally updated almost every single day.  So the most recent one is October 10th.  And this is how easy it is.  By the way, always read the, oh, this looks good,  4.12, very nice.  All right, let's do it.  So I press download.  Do you want the Google Apps checkbox?  Yes, it's now gonna download the ROM.  Well, if you don't get a download error, it will.  And then you just reboot and install it,  and it couldn't be easier.  So once you have rooted your phone,  there's two things you should have.  One is titanium backup, because it's the best backup.  It has to be root because it can't backup  all those settings and stuff unless it's an administrator.  And then if you really wanna live on the edge,  play with ROM Manager, and you can get the jelly bean,  you can do anything.  A couple of tools that are handy  for anybody who wants to hack their Android phone.  Gina Trapani is the author of ThinkUp at thinkup.com.  She's a part of Expert Labs, along with Neil Dash.

Yeah, I'll keep the rooting.  I'll keep the, not the rooting, the roming going.  We're so close to getting our elemental  that will make our streaming better.  I want you to look at our new Twit, one of a kind.  This is gonna be offered for two more days,  and that'll be it.  Teespring is the company doing these,  and they make really nice ones out of American Apparel  and Fruit of the Loom.  TEESpring.com slash Twit for all the shows.  The 2012 season of Twit is on here.  And so they're all memorials.  That's on the back and on the front.  Just a very subtle Twit.tv.  We've got all kinds of sizes,  men's, women's, programmers, the whole thing.  And we've already sold 2,200 t-shirts, which is great.  I didn't think we'd break a thousand.  So that's two more days, though.  And as soon as we hit that deadline,  that's when they print them.  They're silkscreened, they're beautiful,  really nice t-shirts.  And so we haven't seen them yet.  We'll all see them at the same time.  They'll start shipping about three days from now.  I'm getting my credit card out as we speak.  Yeah, it's 20 bucks, it's worth it.  It's a good cause.  It helps us.  I think we're gonna do special one-of-a-kind items  every month.  Won't be a t-shirt next time.  And I'll let you know what the money's gonna go to.  In this case, we've raised enough money, I believe,  for the Elemental, so I'm very excited about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Very cool.  Checking out with PayPal.  Aw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think a Twit fleece would be nice.  We are talking with Scott Evest.  Absolutely, a Twit fleece would be great.  We're also talking about hats, mugs.  Anything you want, you let us know.  I think we need the-  A low-cut top, a special Twit low-cut top.  I'm gonna do that.
