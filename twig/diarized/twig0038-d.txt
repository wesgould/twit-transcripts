Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's a miracle.  I'll tell you about it in a second.  It's a bloody miracle that I got home.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The last man out of Europe.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Just about.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Also here with us, the great Gina Trapani from smarterware.org.  Greetings, humans.  The author of The Complete Guide to Google Wave at completewaveguide.com.  I forgot to mention, Jeff is the author of What Would Google Do?  We are talking today about, there's a lot of talk about, including the CHIRP conference  and so forth.  What were you doing in Germany though, Jeff?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I was at the Repubblica conference in Berlin, which is a gathering of 2,500 bloggers or  thereabouts, which is probably every blogger in Germany.  It's kind of nice because we really don't have blogger get-togethers in the US anymore.  It was nice.  The first time I gave a talk on, it was called The German Paradox, Privacy, Publicness and  Penises.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I like the alliteration.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  A lot of discussion of saunas.  In fact, I invited the crowd after my talk to continue the discussion in the sauna next  door and four guys showed up.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I love that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's great.  That's great.  Did they concur with your thesis that there's something about privacy that's a little different

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  in Germany?  I acknowledge that they're different about that and I push it and some see the point  and some don't like it and argue and that's what's fun about it.  The German view of privacy is a bit more extreme than even ours in the US, except for genitals  in the sauna.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Actually, I would say in Europe in general, right?  It's the EU as much as ... Is it just Germany?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It is the EU as well.  Germany has its own particular nuttiness about privacy.  They go after Street View.  They sabotage the Street View car.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We talked last week about the Street View signs in Germany, the no robots dot text,  which I think is a Photoshop.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They tend to go a bit extreme on it, but that makes it an interesting laboratory to talk  about what is private is private and what is public is public and how that operates.  It was a lot of fun.  It was a big crowd, 2,000, 2,500 people.  They also do this great thing I got to take part in.  They do a Twitter reading where they do as if dramatically ...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  A dramatic Twitter reading.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Of funny tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I had a ham sandwich this morning.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's really great.  We ought to do it here too.  Then I tried to get out of there, but the ash cloud was coming over Europe and I was  to leave Friday morning and Berlin was closed, Frankfurt was closed.  I managed to grab a ride down to Munich with somebody who'd rented the last car at Munich  Airport.  The fixer for, I swear to you, a Bollywood film crew in Berlin doing scouting locations  fixed me up with his friend who was in this car.  We dashed down to Audi's headquarters north of Munich.  By the way, I vowed during the ride not to calculate the kilometer per hour versus mile  per hour conversion.  After I got out of the car, I realized that she was driving at 135 miles an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's 180 kilometers per hour.  That is not fast.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Then I got a cab to Munich and then I got to Munich and was on standby.  I got on the plane and in the Munich Airport, a guy turns next to me and says, are you Jeff  Jarvis?  I said, yeah.  He said, I listen to Twig.  Oh, that's nice.  So we have one listener.  He listens to every Leo.  I wish I had remembered his name and I hope you heard the chat remind me because I'm terrible  with names.  But his wife, his long suffering wife was there as well.  She's in pharmacology and is forced to listen to every Leo Leporte production in the car.  He's trying to convince her to come to the cottage.  So it was great to run across the fame of Leo's life everywhere.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  She's going to pour a cup of coffee in my lab, I think, if she comes in the cottage.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It wasn't the first time it happened, I think, two or three times in Berlin that people recognize  me because of Twig.  Really?  Isn't that wild?  Right.  So hello, hello, Berlin.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Hello.  I only get recognized because of Twig.  It's fantastic.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But you both are famous in your own right.  That's what gets me.  I mean, here's by the way, thanks to our chat room, here's the picture of the Stadt-Appelheim-Rhein-Neckar-Kreis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Robots.txt for Apple-Hain user agent Google Street View disallow.  It's not allowed here.  You may not use it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The Germans are nutty about this.  And a lot of talk about Google has a big problem in Germany because they know it.  It's a PR problem, but it's worse than I knew.  Because I go on and to them I'm being counterintuitive about things like Street View, it gets onto  the front page of newspapers there.  What does it say?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What does that say?  Einst Bloggers.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's the view of bloggers, the Repubblica.  This is now embarrassing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis Show.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But because if you talk about Google and you defend Google, it becomes news there.  Wow.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's really pretty strange.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Interesting.  But I'm back.  I have friends from the conference who are stuck over there.  Our friend Heather Gold.  We had dinner with her, Mika Sefri from PDF and I Thursday night.  And she's to go on to Finland, but who knows whether she's going to get the heck out of  Berlin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I wish Heather, who's also a show host here at Twitter, all the best.  I hope she gets out.  I guess, you know, why not?  You get a little extra time there.  But still, maybe not the way you'd like to go.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, I was thinking that if I ended up stuck in Munich, I could go to some saunas.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is there any news out of Repubblica?  Is there anything newsworthy out of there?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Interesting in a lot of discussion of net neutrality and a lot of discussion that between  – and I'm forgetting the people who said it – but the digital bill in the UK with  things going on in the US, with things going on elsewhere, they're really – and Cory  Doctorow wrote a brilliant piece in The Guardian about the – I forget what it was called  – the digital economy bill.  Oh, terrible, yeah.  And saying it's war now.  And it really is war now.  And that's the talk.  That was the drumbeat we were hearing in Berlin was a lot of that, that it's corporate interests  that are now trying to use government to take over the internet and to restrict what we  can do and to kick us off the internet.  And it ain't China, but it's our own versions thereof.  And a lot of drumbeat on that.  And I think a lot of we need to worry about a movement.  And I go back to the – I keep on thinking of what Gina said, that geeks tend to find  the way around.  And now I think we've got to face this head on.  So anyway, that was Repubblica.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, I wonder if we should – maybe we need to do a show, take back the internet show  or something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Very scary.  I have a KML file for the Google Earth of the Iceland ash cloud, if you want to see  it as it's moving across.  I don't know where – I guess the images are from NASA.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's from NASA.  Also, Leo, I tweeted it this morning.  I didn't put it up on the feed.  There's a wonderful animation of the cloud going across Europe.  And it's spreading and spreading and spreading.  The New York Times has a great map showing every airport.  It's really phenomenal.  Europe's shut.  And people cannot get out.  When this last went off, I think in 1811, it lasted a year.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wow.  A year?  Yeah.  We're going to have to – is this going to bring back transatlantic ocean liners?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's – I've seen tweets about that and jokes about that.  Robert Patterson, a friend of mine, did a tweet earlier and a post earlier about whether  this is a black swan event.  And what would this do to change economies?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Currently, you can go to Spain.  That's about it.  You can go to Sicily.  You can go to Turkey and Greece.  But if you want to go anywhere from Iceland to that border, those borders, which means  all of them – You can still go to Iceland.  Iceland is fine.  Iceland is fine.  The volcano is going south.  But you can't go to Scandinavia.  You can't go to the UK.  You can't go to Europe.  You can't go to Moscow.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  People all over the UK are saying – creating pictures of the gorgeous orange sunsets they're  having there because of this.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because – so it doesn't – it's not like you're in darkness underneath it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Not at all.  No, no, no.  And the problem – I read a story – I can't remember where, but I read a story about – it  was a blogger who explained why this is bad.  The ash has silica in it and in the high heat of a jet turbine.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It turns into glass.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And then as it cools going through the turbine, it reforms and sticks to the turbine and messes  it up.  It's glass.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, we don't want jet engines seizing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No.  No, we don't want that.  Hi, everybody.  I'm Ray Publica.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And Gina, you were at CHIRP.  Yes, I was.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The first official Twitter conference.  Yeah, it was a really good event.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Except for the terrible Wi-Fi.  It was a really good event.  I was like, no.  You're kidding.  It was really frustrating.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I love those guys.  They put on a fantastic event.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Food was great.  The schedule was great.  Everything was fantastic.  The Wi-Fi really wasn't that good.  This is the revenge of Loic.  Yeah, it must have been.  She's like, no, I'm not going to do that.  I'm going to do it.  I'm going to do it.  So they announced a number of things, including an advertising model that's so far pretty

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  mild.  In fact, it reminds me a lot of Google.  They're going to put ads in search.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It sure does.  They are.  They're calling it promoted tweets.  They're not ads, Leo.  They're just regular tweets.  Well, you know, I looked...  As they explained.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, they're regular tweets, but they're selected by the advertiser.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Of course.  Yeah.  They're tweets that the person pays for.  They have promoted to show up first in search results.  They get a different background.  It says promoted by a particular user.  And what was really cool is that they described that they're calling a resonance score.  They're going to assign a resonance score to each tweet.  And it's like the way...  And tweets with a low resonance score, promoted tweets with a low resonance score, fall off.  They don't show those as much.  That's interesting.  That's what...  It's much like...  Or dig.  It's very much like PageRank, right.  Or dig, exactly.  So, and the resonance score is interesting.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Or AdWords, for that sense.  You can't buy the top position.  Right.  Oh, interesting.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right.  The number of clicks, right?  Oh, interesting.  But they have pretty deep metrics for a given tweet.  You know, I mean, how many people favored it, how many people retweet it, how many people  reply to it, how many people click the link in the tweet.  I mean, they can go, I think, a little deeper and figure out, you know, different kinds  of interaction.  And they can do a similar thing.  So that was exciting.  So promoted tweets and at Anywhere, they kind of explained a little bit.  They launched a great new developer site, which is fantastic for Twitter.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They're adding also an interesting feature for developers called annotations.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That was very exciting.  That was definitely a thing that most developers are most excited about, but it's not launched  yet.  So annotations...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Explain it to me, Lucy.  Yes, explain it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  This is how I understand it.  So annotations is a way for any Twitter app to store arbitrary metadata in the Twitter  database on a per tweet basis, right?  So I'm developing a Twitter app called Think Tank, and I want to store extra metadata for  a given tweet, like number of replies or number of users on my site, you know, that gave it  a certain number of stars or any data point that I want, a key value pair.  So then as a developer, I can store in the Twitter database, you know, in my namespace,  my app's namespace, so Think Tank, a key value pairs, whatever data I want to store there.  So it's fantastic for Twitter because they get more metadata for a given tweet.  And it's good for developers because, you know, I mean, you're not storing metadata  on your side that's connected to data stored elsewhere.  It's all in one place.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You could presumably display it, though, in a third party client.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And you could certainly use it to search.  Here's the issue, and Robert Scoble raises this, there's no standard set of pairs, right?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right.  There is no standard set of pairs, although I imagine that pairs are going to become standardized.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's kind of the Twitter way, isn't it?  Let the users work it out.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Let the users determine it.  And from what I understand, different namespaces will be available, like everything will be  public.  So if a great service is storing metadata that my app is interested in, I can access  that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, so this is, you don't have control over it yourself, Twitter or anyone can use it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right.  Any app can store the data and any app can request the data from other apps, which is

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  pretty neat.  So the more clever everyone is, the better off we all are, and no one can necessarily  benefit alone.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes, exactly.  Except Twitter.  It would be really, really interesting.  Except Twitter, exactly.  Well, Twitter benefits the most, of course.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No one benefits but us.  We benefit.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It was a really good conference.  I was struck by how the narrative that the execs kind of put out there was like, look  at us.  We're this tiny little company and things got really crazy really fast.  Isn't it crazy?  All these crazy things happen so quickly.  It's awesome and crazy.  And after a little while, I was kind of like, okay, guys, I know you got robbed.  You're a startup childhood and you're only 75 people and you're like a couple of dudes  in jeans and t-shirts, but start acting like the company that's pushing billions of tweets  around daily, terabytes of data around.  By the end of the conference, I was like, okay, I'm tired of the like, wow, this is  crazy, dude.  Look at how crazy this is.  Crazy.  And I wanted to hear a little more confidence and a little more like, not confidence, but  a little more, we have it together and this is our plan and going forward.  It's like maturity you want.  Maturity for good.  I want to see more maturity.  I understand that their growth trajectory was insanely steep.  I get it.  Yeah, I did want to see maybe a little more maturity.  I mean, it's not like it's not like, you know, isn't used to having a small company get,  you know, get really big or at least get bought by a big company before.  So it was a good event.  I'm glad I went.  We launched the White House query to the public.  Tell me about that.  Yeah, it went pretty well.  It was a, it was quite a scramble.  It was a crazy week.  I think tank worked, which was very exciting for me.  That was a big few moment.  We got about to, we're still cleaning the data and we're still, you know, kind of cleaning  up the replies, but it looks like we got about 2000 responses on Twitter and Facebook.  There were two tweets and one Facebook status update.  It was interesting that the responses came in on Facebook a lot faster than on Twitter.  So we learned actually a lot of interesting lessons.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So one of the questions was what grand challenge should be on our nation's to do list?  Reply with your idea now and any reply.  Did it automatically get collated by your system or do you have it based on the WHGC

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  tag?  Based on the, in reply to status ID.  So people had to reply to that particular status ID, but we were also capturing any  mention of at White House or WHGC.  So that's what the data cleaning is about.  We're kind of assigning those stray replies to those status, you know, to those updates.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What was the other question?  I don't see the other one on here.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It was the same question, different wording on a different day at a different time.  We kind of wanted to hit, you know, hit the network a couple of times with different wording  at sea.  So I think there was one other.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Are you doing semantic analysis to cluster them?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  We are hoping to do that.  We're going to make the data public and hope that we get some really good semantic analysis.  And there was a lot of noise as you would expect, but there are also a lot of really  good.  Marijuana, do marijuana live?  There were a few, fewer mentions of marijuana, legalizing marijuana than I thought.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You're talking about the fact that the last time there was a poll by the White House,  marijuana legalization topped it because apparently potheads have a lot of time on their hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who would have thunk it?  This is cool, man.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Before 420, they do.  But this did specifically say science and tech, right?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It did.  It did.  And hey, we got lots of replies which were, you know, insert crazy political agenda, completely  off topic, noisy response here.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Now, I retweeted it.  So as a, since I retweeted it, that would count if people respond to my retweet?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes.  Okay.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So you're smart enough to kind of get it that way too.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I would bet, I know you don't have the finals, but I bet that the NASA announcements that  President Obama made were kind of dominated.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Lots of responses about space, about space travel, about colonizing Mars, a space elevator,  human on Mars by 2025.  You know, and the way that the first question was framed was, you know, Apollo land, the  next Apollo landing or human genome, you know, what should our next grand challenge be?  And I think that really led people a certain way, which is why we kind of did another tweet  later that didn't, that didn't put any ideas in people's head and just kind of wanted to  get what people said.  But, you know, we got a lot of cure cancer.  Mine was very early, you know, early earthquake to tsunami detection, like 24 hours early.  One of Neil's was a teleport visible matter by 2025.  That was one of my favorites.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't think, you know, Obama's going to say that in the State of the Union.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm just thinking.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Kind of fun that you could put it out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And by the time this decade is out, we will be able to teleport visible matter.  It could be, could be good.  Could be huge.  Could be huge.  Could be huge.  Like you could be my new Secretary of State, Scotty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cotton, I can transport visible matter.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We've got Mark Linford is in the studio.  He's worked a little bit on Think Tank.  He did the Windows install instructions, he says.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  He did.  He did.  Hey, Mark, thank you so much for writing up the Windows install instructions because  we didn't have them.  That's fantastic.  Mark's one of my favorite Wiki writers.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, there you go.  Wow.  He just passed out.  Mark, are you OK?  I think he had a heart attack.  Wow.  He's excited.  So, you know, there is an interesting the response to this is kind of interesting.  For instance, Bill Gross, who has Tweet Up, which was an idea lab company, is also launching  kind of a Twitter AdSense mashup kind of thing.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Full disclosure here is I'm an investor.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, you are?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, he came after me on that.  And I figured, you know, what the hell, the man who invented the Google ad model, what  the F?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He was at Overture.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, at Overture.  He created Overture.  And of course, Yahoo bought that and Yahoo blew it because they could have been Google.  And I'm not the best one to explain it.  Bill, but basically it's more of a his editorial view is that he liked Twitter.  He'll try to expose better tweets.  But then this is basically a search engine play.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But how do you do it?  I mean, you have to use Tweet Up, right?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, he's done deals so far with a lot of the third party clients.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  So now the Twitter now the Twitter strategy gets a little clearer.  You see why Twitter did, you know, bought Tweety to do a Mac or iPhone client, why  they're doing their own BlackBerry.  They have announced that they're doing an Android client that's delayed.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They're also replacing.  Well, they've already replaced Bitly, but they're doing their own shortener.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And they're going to do their own shortener.  So you see that this is in a way of closing in the ecosystem to make sure that you don't  see Bill Gross's ads, you see Twitter's ads in their clients.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But who knows?  I mean, they'll meet with them and see what the deal is.  It's it's you know, what's interesting to me, I'll be I'll be eager to hear you.  Report, Gina, on on the mood of the developers at the conference, given all this.  But are you a platform?  And if you're a platform, then you have to be careful about your competition with your  with your channel conflict that you have those who are spreading you and using you.  If you start to compete with them, what does that do to your growth?  And I still have my head around this about where the Twitter ecosystem looks like versus  the Google ecosystem.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, we're developers.  How were they perturbed by the Tweety acquisition?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think so.  There was a developer meetup, which I heard about secondhand.  I wasn't at.  And I think that some folks were kind of perturbed or upset or not sure what to do next.  And, you know, there were some clips about it at the showcase.  There was a Twitter app showcase after the hack day.  And someone presented a Twitter client and Paul Graham said, well, I don't know about  the viability of a Twitter client on the iPhone.  But I think the general mood was like, well, hey, we have to we have to get a little more  creative and make stuff that's not that wouldn't be a Twitter core offering.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I still come back, you know, some time ago, a few months ago, when I complained about  things that didn't exist on Twitter, Fred Wilson tweeted back and said, that's for the  independent developers to do.  And that's the model.  And now they've done this this 180 on that.  And I'm trying to think of what the analogy is.  It would be as it is.  It's the Google Books analogy.  When Google went anywhere near the content business, it found itself in a huge channel  conflict with its partners.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Twitter made a really good case for the Twitter iPhone app.  And the way that they did it is on stage, they showed a video of a 24 year old Stanford  graduate just start just starting to use Twitter, trying to find a Twitter client on her iPhone  and install it.  And it was painful, full, like five to seven minutes of this woman just like, what?  Was she a moron?  She searched for Twitter.  It was kind of slow.  She was like, now, come on, that's this.  Which one?  It was convincing.  It was.  It was.  Well, you know, I mean, there are a lot of choices out there and there's not one.  There's not the one obvious choice.  Right.  Which is Twitter's take is like, if we if we offer obvious choices of clients for people  to use, we will get more users more quickly.  Like their whole thing is that the Twitter user experience involves too many hurdles  and is too they want to create a more friction free, I think was the phrase they use, experience.  And the easier they make it for people to start using Twitter, the more users you'll  have and that will benefit the developers in the end.  And I buy it.  Leo clearly does not buy it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But you're the one who says the iPad sucks because it's a closed environment.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, this is this is isn't this and without the finesse of Steve Jobs, the same exact  thing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, we're going to improve the user experience by reducing your choice to one.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  No, but they're not reducing choice.  I mean, there's going to be the one, you know, the one official Twitter iPhone app.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  With those who give you choice.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And there are going to be developers who make other clients that the power users.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So confusing to intelligent college graduates that we are going to eliminate all choice.  Make it easy.  Everybody will have spaghetti and meatballs for dinner.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But Leo, listen, on this show, we we recommend a Dolphin browser, right, which is an alternative  browser for Android.  And there's opera on the iPhone.  I mean, there are the developers can continue to make clients that do advanced things like  users and the power users will take those up because they want their client to do maybe  a little more than than Tweety.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So was there sense from developers that they're going to keep doing third party third party  at Twitter clients?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  No.  OK, just curious.  They're going to move on and do other things.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So Bill Gross, I think Bill Gross is motivated to do one.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But I think Bill, we got to ask a question.  I mean, good luck, Bill.  Right.  I mean, I know you're on the board here.  And by the way, you should mention in the tweet up is kind of commonly used in the parlance  already.  And it's very confusing.  I thought this was the same as a tweet up and it's not.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's not.  He just got the URL and used to be.  I agree.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And the other thing the other thing about promoted tweets is that it's a 50 50 rev share  with the developers who show the promoted tweets and their search results in their clients.  OK, and there's a there's a reason.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Now, OK, so they're not requiring that a third party unless when I wait a minute, what if  it's an in-stream tweet?  And this is the next step.  Now you've got promoted tweets in search.  Is there anything that a developer could do to say I'm not going to do it because they're  going to do it?  Proto tweets in the stream, right?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I believe that promoted will show up in streams as they would.  Yeah, as they would as just a regular tweet when they're posted.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So if I'm a third party developer, I don't know.  There's no way I can turn that off.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right.  But, you know, I mean, it's a tweet.  A tweet is a tweet is a tweet.  And if someone subscribed to a user, they're going to show up in your stream.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You know, that's me there, Gina, as a user, as a user perspective.  So what happens to my Twitter tomorrow?  Am I something going to be getting promoted tweets in my streams, whether I ask for them  or not?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Only search results.  No, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's my understanding they're going to put them in the stream.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's tweet up is search only, I think.  I thought Twitter was in the stream too.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm not sure.  My understanding was that it's just search.  Promoted tweets aren't going to get pushed to users unless you're following the user  who posted the tweet.  So if I'm following JetBlue and they tweet something and then but they also make it a  tweet, I'll see it on my stream because I follow them already.  But it will show up in search results as well.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But I don't know.  AdRant says in stream ads to come to Twitter.  Let me see.  Search results and relevant streams.  Well, search ads and search results and relevant streams.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But what's relevant?  That's the question.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Amen, brother.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Relevant is streams of people who are following them already, no?  That's how I read it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Based on purchase keywords and contextual relevancy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  OK, so if I say, God, I need a cup of coffee, I might see a Starbucks tweet next time.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They'll stay on the top of a given search result or stream rather than scrolling off  the page as does a normal tweet, thereby giving the advertiser life here.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But only in the Twitter client because a third party client is just going to think it's a  tweet.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, the API will indicate what tweets are promoted.  So I can ignore it.  So I can present it.  I can ignore it.  Well, sure.  You mean as a developer, you could?  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  In fact, you know what I'm going to do is I just figured out how to sell a third party  client.  I'm going to delete all promoted tweets from your stream.  They won't show up.  Bingo.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I tweeted.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But then you don't make any money as the developer.  So you can sell a client and decide not to show any promoted tweet.  Here's an ad free client.  You pay me three bucks for an iPhone app.  Sure.  That would be an approach.  I mean, it's totally opt in and there are guidelines.  Twitter is going to publish guidelines about how you should display promoted tweets.  And you should indicate somehow that it isn't promoted tweet.  I don't know how to enforce that.  But yeah, no, that would be a market.  Here's an ad free Twitter.  That's actually...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I tweeted the other day that I wanted to have a client that would erase any mention of mayor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Marissa Mayor?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No.  No, no.  God, no.  Mayor or badge.  I want anything with mayor or badge just taken out.  And I wanted...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, you don't want any four square tweets.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Exactly.  I don't want any here I am tweets.  And I don't want any...  And I want to also take retweets.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I think that's what annotation could be really useful for.  If we came up with a canonical set of things like this is a location tweet, this is a four  square tweet, you could really filter your tweets very effectively.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So Bill Gross emailed me and he said those are great ideas and want to do those.  So I think that the more we put in control, it's going to be hard to figure out how...  As long as there is a real API and as long as you don't have to sign your life away as  to how to do it, as long as you don't have to get approved, which is Apple-like, then  yeah, I don't know why I couldn't just get a...  If I can get a browser that takes out the ads, surely I can get a Twitter client that  takes out the ads.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'd like a Twitter client that filters out John Mayer tweets actually.  By the way, here's Gina with Marissa Meyer.  Isn't that a cute picture?  You make such a lovely couple.  What was this?  Was that at Sherp?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That was at Sherp.  That was after the showcase.  So during the showcase, there was a couple of developers presented their iPhone client.  This is the one that Paul Graham said, I don't know about the viability of an iPhone client,  but the client had advanced filtering, right?  So you could filter out hashtags, you could mute users, you could say, block all the four  square ads.  That is a power user Twitter client.  And I think that there may be room for that in the ecosystem.  So I forgot what it was called.  Agora?  I'll look it up.  But yes, that photo of Marissa and Meyer and I, it was literally a 30-second interaction  and I think I managed to not make a fool of myself, although it was a big risk.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And she knew who you were, I'm sure.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  She did not know who I was.  I said that I co-host this week in Google with you and Jeff Jarvis and she said, oh,  she was blank when I shook her hand.  But then I said, Jeff Jarvis and she said, oh yes, we work with him on what will Google  do?  So I was like, yeah, I know Jeff.  I was going to get a t-shirt.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  She should say, turn on Google goggles, Marissa, you'll know everything there is about me.  Just make that the special in-house.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think it's already built into the brain there.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think it's built into her.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You are.  Yes, I know you.  You are Jeff Jarvis.  Yes, yes.  I know who you are.  You should have said lifehacker.  She would have jumped for joy.  Come on.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, I doubt it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The fact that you wrote a book about it, does she know that you wrote the book on Google  Wave?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I wasn't going to pitch my book to her.  I already felt like too much of a fan girl.  I didn't want to be too.  I was like, we would love to have you on the show someday.  And she sort of looked at me kind of blankly.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I was listening to all the media this morning and Clay Shirky was reprising the rant post  that got him into some adulation and trouble saying that women need to be better at being  self-aggrandizing jerks and promote their own stuff.  Yes.  So I'm not necessarily taking a stand there, but yeah, you should have promoted it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You should have been a self-aggrandizing jerk, Gina.  I don't understand why.  There's my book and here's my podcast.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You're very bad at being a jerk.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Believe me, I know plenty of self-aggrandizing jerks who happen to be female and it's not  appealing.  It's not attractive either way.  It's not attractive on guys or gals.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It isn't.  It isn't.  But you know, yeah, I was glad she would have hugged you because somebody actually likes

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Wave.  You.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, I'm not the photo not taken, but it kind of led a lot of people to comment  on like, you know, levels of attractiveness, who was more attractive.  Yeah, there you go.  Isn't that nice?  So is the risk when it's like.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Isn't that nice?  Well, I did it.  I said you're a cute couple.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So I.  That's okay.  It was fine.  Totally fine.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  By the way, the chat room has no idea who Marissa Meyer is, but they certainly know  who Gina and Jeff are.  Marissa, who?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I should also say get her on the show, which I did propose earlier on.  We would love to.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'd love to get her on the show.  I tried to pitch her on getting on the show, but she didn't seem very eager to give me  her assistance.  You know, email or whatever.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, my suspicion is we're not going to get high Google executives on the show.  I don't think.  I think that's a challenge, Leo.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All right.  I want to take that challenge.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We'll all try it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, I remember the days when Google was young and brash.  I told you this story before.  I was invited to dinner with Larry and Sergey and stuff.  It was by a PR firm.  It was like we need to promote Twitter.  Those days are long gone.  Nobody, nobody, nobody to ask us to.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  She was the only woman on the panel in the showcase kind of offering her opinions on  the apps that were presented.  And she was really good.  All of her comments were really.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, she's the UI.  She's the UI expert at Google.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  She's the one who designs the whole page.  Yeah, she's the VP of product, right?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Does she have anything to do with Wave and Buzz?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I mean, as far as I know, every single product that gets released goes through Marissa.  So I imagine that she's...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Those don't seem to have that Marissa, you know, that Google touch, that radical simplicity.  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, you know, the Buzz grew up.  I would love to know what Marissa's friends list looks like.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wouldn't that be interesting?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Indeed.  Indeed.  Indeed.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let's take a break.  We're going to come back.  Gina, Jeff.  Gina Trapani from SmarterWear.org and Jeff Jarvis from BuzzMachine.com.  We're talking about Google in the cloud on this week in Google.  I don't know why I say that since everybody probably knows.  It's my old days in radio.  It's called the re-intro.  Before we go on though, let me re-intro the folks at Citrix who do those great remote  access products.  They're so well known in enterprise.  You just say the word Citrix, everybody knows.  They know what you're talking about.  And they make great consumer products.  And they have a couple of new products we're going to be talking about more on the show.  One of them is not exactly new, but it's updated.  Go to Assist Express.  I've used for years and I love it.  We used to use it on the screensavers.  Now it's faster, easier and boy, there's no better way to support family, friends.  If you're an IT guy or support person, this is a great tool for you.  You can try it free by going to go to assist.com slash twig, g-o-t-o assist.com slash twig  and checking it out for 30 days absolutely free.  It's remote access, but there's some features designed for the support pro.  For instance, and I use this myself when I was on the line with my mom and she was complaining  I was on Skype.  I said, well here, click this link.  She didn't have anything installed.  She clicked the link 30 seconds later.  I am inside her computer and fixing the problem.  You could do unattended support.  You could do eight sessions at once, which is great if you're doing a scan or install.  You could just move to the next session and the next and the next.  It has a built-in feature that will tell you what operating system, exactly what version's  running, what software and running in the background including security software.  You could drag and drop fixes from your computer to theirs and on and on and on.  It is just fantastic and of course completely secure 128 bit SSL point to point PC and Mac.  So you can run it on Macs to fix PCs and vice versa and integrated live chat so you can  talk with their supportee online as you're doing it.  I can go on and on.  I want you to try it.  That's the best way.  Go to go to assist.com slash twig and give it a try.  I use it now all the time.  They do have day passes for those of us who are amateur support professionals.  You could just get a day pass and fix all the family's computers at once or get the  month to month.  Go to assist.com slash twig.  Try it for a month free.  I think you're going to like it.  Google has gotten into the Twitter story, by the way.  They now women.  Google had real time search for a while.  And now they're doing it.  What's new?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Is it is they've added a new means of I mean, it's the thing that the day life and where  my partner in Google News and such have done of having a timeline of the tweets.  But now Google has added a timeline to current tweet search so you can go back.  You can see the activity.  So I think one of the things I put up on the on the feed was the the ash search or the  ash use of the word ash and tweets.  The weird thing about it is hashtags don't work.  I couldn't get a hashtag to work.  Really?  No.  But words work.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I guess then just leave off the pound and you got the hashtag.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Exactly.  It was it was it was odd because you think you well unless you want to search specifically  for things on that topic.  Oh, yeah.  Well, the great the hashtag for the ash story is ash tag.  And it's taken off the work.  I mean, Lufthansa is putting out tweets about being closed with the ash.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, man.  This is why I love the geek community.  Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's just stuff like that.  I made my first German joke in Twitter in the midst of driving down at killer speeds  to Munich.  And the word for a hole in German is Arschloch.  And so I said just Arschloch.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, I like it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Germans were all correcting my spelling.  Oh, I thought I was rather rude.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, no.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So you got to explain a joke to a German.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The guys.  Well, of course you do.  You this is a surprise.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, it's weird that I clicked on this link to look at the timeline, which is super  cool and interactive and all that.  But if you search for another every time every other term I search for, like like Sean White,  for example, I want to see him.  I want to see what people said when he I get no results.  Am I being crazy?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'll put quotes around it because I'm getting all sorts of weird crap that has Sean and  White but not Sean White together.  OK, now I've got quotes.  Doesn't work for you.  Sean White's in the Today Show.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, I must have like configured my Google search to be.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's only like five of them.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's strange.  What?  That's weird.  Do do chirp.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They're not.  Are they not searching the firehose?  They have must have the firehose, right?  There's a lot for chirp.  And this is just two days worth.  There's a lot more.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You can go below that.  It has older at the bottom of that.  You were trying to click my my video screen to click on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where where where?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  If you go back up to the timeline, right below the timeline, you'll see the two little double  arrows to the left.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Ah, now I can go back in the timeline.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, something about my setup is scary because I'm not getting I'm not getting results.  I have to figure that out.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Huh.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Do you have to be logged in?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I am logged in.  Interesting.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But for a while, tweets have been searching up in my showing up in my search results.  That's this is just in addition to that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Just another way to deal just with that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  This is sort of replay.  I feel like this was in response to the Library of Congress thing where it's like, OK, can

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I bring connect?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is this a stupid press release or what?  The Library of Congress is going to.  What store the tweets?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, all public tweets, billions of public.  OK, so I did a little math.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's 50 million tweets a day right now.  And if let's say that there have been 50 million tweets for the last day for the last four  years and each of those tweets is the maximum 140 bytes, that's about nine terabytes.  It's two, three, maybe four hard drives in the closet in the back in the Library of Congress.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They should have been saving the web and things of value.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  My point exactly, because for instance, now you've got a tweet.  I just I was looking at your tweet that links back via bit.ly to this Google search.  Click it and the Library of Congress and you're going to get nothing because they didn't store  the things most tweets are referencing a web page.  So there's nothing there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So all you're really getting is ham sandwich.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But you could do some really cool sentiment analysis, I think you could.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, we've seen lots of nice mashups.  But your point exactly, Jeff, it's really you've got to store the whole web.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  The Library of Congress thinks this is valuable, which which OK, fine.  They've done nothing.  They've looked as far as I know, lifted no fingers to store the web.  And that's had to be a private effort of Brewster Cale in San Francisco.  Thank you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I told KGO Radio asked me for an interview on it and I said, I'll do an interview.  And I said, but next time call Brewster Cale and see what he thinks about it.  Because of course, he's doing the Internet Archive.  Now, we just said, OK, maybe it's nine terabytes for four years of Twitter.  It's that much a day.  He's storing huge, vast quantities.  And he's working with the Library of Alexandria all over the world.  And he's really doing this amazing Internet Archive effort.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, no doubt.  The Internet Archive effort is amazing and definitely admiral.  And the Library of Congress has our tweets.  But, you know, there's something I mean, tweets are, you know, this is such a simple  data structure and very discreet.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And you know better than anybody, they should at least have a copy of Think Tank in there.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah. I mean, you can really do a lot with like a certain phrase.  I mean, you can do certainly a lot with an archive of the entire Internet.  But there's there are certain characteristics, I think, of tweets and that they're quotes,  they're things that people said who have a social graph that, you know, they're  contained, you know, when a certain there's just a very strict and simple  data structure that lends itself, I think, to analysis that maybe you wouldn't be able  to do as easily or wouldn't be as straightforward as analysis on the entire web.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Currently, what we want is if the Library of Congress is there,  to to to store our culture.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Get the whole thing for crying out loud.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And yeah, then fine, spend the money, take Brewster out of his economic misery.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sure he's spending a lot.  And there's also rights issues.  He's storing stuff, even though he knows perfectly well that he doesn't have the  rights to do so. He couldn't possibly have the rights to do so.  I mean, I mean, anyway, the bear tells me in our chat room, the Library of Congress  is storing all government sites and that's exciting.  And and political sites as well.  I don't know.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You know, I'm surprised we haven't heard.  I joked also there was a New York Times story about coupon barcodes carrying data  with them. Yeah.  And there's the way I think every reporter now has a save get key to put in there.  Privacy advocates are concerned.  Yes.  But surprised me, I haven't heard that with the Library of Congress.  I thought that would be that we have the government story in our tweets.  Oh, no.  Who owns our tweets?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let me ask a question.  And this actually came up Merlin Mann.  I love this. You probably saw it.  There's a Twitter book, Twitter aphorisms or something on Amazon.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And Merlin Mann posts a review saying, you know, they didn't ask me that my tweets  are in here. I'm pissed off.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You shouldn't buy this book.  And there's like 80 other people.  It's got a one star rating.  It's like panned because and then after the fact, the company writes to Merlin  saying, oh, we're going to use your tweets in the book.  He said, that's like the burglar coming back afterwards and saying,  do you mind if I steal your stuff?  He says, until they return, return my stereo system, repair the broken window  and say, I'll never do it again.  I'm not satisfied.  Who owns our tweets?  I mean, it's nice of Twitter to give them the Library of Congress.  Do they own them?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's a good question.  They're they're only giving public tweets.  Oh, that's good to know.  It's only public tweets.  It's not tweets on protected accounts.  So that's that's first.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  By the way, there was a Harper Collins book of tweets before that,  that, as I understand, did get permissions.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. What's his name?  What's his name from Gawker?  Nick Denton. Nick Denton did a book.  He asked me.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, it was another guy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The other Nick Douglas.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Nick Douglas. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  After he left Gawker, he and he emailed me and said, is it all right?  He asked for permission of everybody he used.  He sent us all a copy of the book.  He did it the right way.  And I think that's right now.  I think I remember Twitter saying we do not own your tweets.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes, they did say that.  You know, the New York Times quoted one of my tweets.  You retain the rights to any content you.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Sorry.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  No, I was going to say, I mean, I think people handle it differently.  The Times quoted one of my tweets and didn't didn't ask for my permission.  And to me, that's fine.  My tweets are public.  It's public information.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You're speaking in a public place.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm in a public place.  All my tweets are public.  I feel like they're absolutely, you know, it's very used to quote.  Now, is it very used to take a bunch of tweets and make a book out of them?  Just by virtue of the fact that there are tweets.  I mean, I understand why Merlin was upset.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Here's the here's the thing from the TOS at Twitter.  You retain your rights to any content you submit, post or display  on or through the services by submitting, posting or displaying content  on or through the services you grant us a worldwide,  non-exclusive royalty free license with the right to sub license to use,  copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display,  distribute or burn at dawn.  I made that up. Such content in any or all media distribution methods  known now or later developed in this way.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You got it.  So Twitter acted within accordance of its agreement.  And presumably the authors of that book asked Twitter and Twitter sublicensed.  So and it's true if you were I mean, OK, let's say they quoted your blogs.  As long as they attribute, they don't have to ask permission, right?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I guess the difference.  I agree with that. Absolutely.  And I agree with Gina.  I think the distinction is public. But.  There's no sense of fair use in Twitter versus a blog in a blog.  If you quote the entire post and cause no reason to go to that post,  right, then a blogger will complain the same way the New York Times  or the Associated Press will with some right, I think.  Yes. What are you doing in a tweet?  Quote 70 characters. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it is what it is.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, if someone took one of my blog posts, the entire thing wholesale  and did a book called Great Blog Posts and didn't ask me, that would be upsetting.  That would be upsetting, even though it's a public web page, you know.  But yeah, because because tweets are so brief, the line is, you know,  I do you think, Leo, that that publishing company went to Twitter  and that Twitter sublicense those tweets to them?  I got the impression that they just didn't ask anyone.  They said, oh, well, all this stuff is public.  So we're just going to make a book out of it. I don't know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't know either. I know Merlin was pissed.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  He was. I agree with I understand why Merlin was upset.  I think that he spent he spent maybe a little too much energy writing,  explaining why he was upset.  I was like, really, Merlin, aren't you writing a book?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, that's exactly, you know, as well as I do.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The all three of us have written books.  That's exactly what was going on. He was procrastinating.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  He was procrastinating.  And so he wrote a book on why his tweet shouldn't have been a book  rather than work on his book. Precisely.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes. Why is it?  It's always easier to write the thing you're not supposed to write. Exactly.  You did write a good article for CNN about this Library of Congress thing.  Mm hmm. Who said tweets are trivial, says Gina Trapani.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. And all the CNN commenters were like, this is a complete waste of space.  This article and the tweets.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There is still there is still that notion that anything that happens on Twitter  is of it's very nature trivial.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Absolutely. There absolutely is that.  But I think in aggregate,  did you just doing sentiment analysis of like the world population is using  Twitter to to communicate, right?  And Twitter has, and Neil says this all time, Twitter has bridged the digital  divide as much as any other service because of its mobile.  Because it's it's it's well, maybe Facebook and Twitter.  Maybe Facebook. But, you know, Twitter was built to work with SMS.  Everybody in the world is SMS.  You don't have to have a fancy five hundred dollar phone to use Twitter. Right.  So its content is representative of the population,  maybe better than any other service.  And you can do sentiment analysis.  I mean, yes, there's lots of tweets about Justin Bieber's new album.  You know, there's some cultural  that's important information about why he's Justin Bieber.  What is the frigging appeal?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We can see the analogy, you know, I think is Google doing  finding out about about the spread of flu by doing searches  and discussions of flu in blogs and such.  Same thing on Twitter.  You can find out these are valuable.  Or there's something I put up on on the feed today about Slate  doing analysis of meetups with the tea party events.  I know they use Meetup as a platform and you see the geographic spread  and where it's concentrated and it's really quite fascinating.  And that's kind of the Leo goes to another question, I think,  which is part of what I tried to address in Berlin.  Who owns the wisdom of the crowd?  And part of the part of the argument in more socialist  Germany and Europe is, well, Street View shouldn't take a picture  of our public buildings and then make commercial use of it.  Well, no, that's public. Right.  And if you look at Google itself, it's it's taking.  Yes, it is taking the crowds links and clicks.  It is adding value in the form of analysis.  And it's being it back to us, by the way, for free  and give an adding value to that.  Well, who owns what piece of that?  You know, it becomes a really interesting issue when you when you create control,  you create these kinds of questions.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. So if one ham sandwich tweet in and of itself is invaluable,  but if you have lots of people eating ham in one area,  no, but you get pork, you know, consumption numbers.  Not important.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We're always talking about how history is only, you know,  is written by the victors and it only records what the you know,  what the kings and queens did.  And this is the people's history.  I think it's perfectly legitimate.  That's well said.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think Ding Ding Ding Ding.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And that's what think tank does.  And let's not forget that in Iran, in Haiti and in Buenos Aires  or no, I'm sorry, in Santiago, that that Twitter was really carried  a lot of news.  And I think at the very least, what happened there is going to be of interest  to future historians.  I don't think it's the only copy of the record.  That's why I say, why doesn't the and along with you, Jeff,  why doesn't the Library of Congress record more?  It's not let's not keep Twitter.  It's let's get Twitter and everything else.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What I talked about a lot of this speech is that is that is that  the public owns what's public.  And as soon as you try to make part of that private,  you've stolen from us the public.  And what happens on a street corner is clearly public.  What happens on the Internet in general, to me, is public,  unless you specifically put it behind a wall so you can't get to it.  And there are plenty of means to do that.  But otherwise, it's public.  I don't mean that you can take the whole thing and steal it and recreate it  and all that.  But can you analyze it and scrape it and learn from it?  Yeah, I hope so.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is kind of the argument with Rupert Murdoch that we're having to, isn't it?  Yes. It's that same.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No one wants to steal this stuff, which is what he thinks is happening.  But but but to be able to know it's there and link to it becomes a right.  The right to link to is that a legitimate point of view?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Or is it just Luddites or people who don't get it?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Is there any? I'll tell you, it's spread in Europe.  I hear that all over Germany. I find that interesting.  Yeah. Is that stealing content argument?  Yeah, yeah, they curse Google arguing that it's stealing when they just  part of this is just not understanding the new economics of this world.  They are you and your frigging link economy crap drivers.  But yeah, it's the link economy versus the ink economy.  It's where we are.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's very it's just fascinating.  It kind of ties in with that.  And it's not not merely the link economy,  but the public nature of the Web and and who owns this.  I think I just fascinating conversation.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Web is a public place.  This is where Doc Searles really taught me. Yes.  That's what you know, what I call the Web of Media, among many others.  He said, no, no, no, don't do that.  Brings all the fingers. It's a place. It's the commons.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We're take a break. Come back with more.  There is a lot more news and update for Google Docs and acquisition from Google  itself.  Talk about this new VP codec we mentioned a couple of weeks ago  and what really is happening to it.  And a stunning revelation  by Eric Schmidt at a party.  All that coming up in just a bit.  It has nothing to do with Marissa Meyer.  But first, I want I want it.  Although, if I really wanted you to stay tuned, I would say  it has to do with Marissa Meyer.  Actually, maybe not.  It has to do with the iPad.  Now, that's going to get people to stick around.  I do want to talk about backup.  You know, when you are putting all your data on a portable device  and I learned this when my laptop was stolen, it is really important  that you have good backups.  And it's important that the backups are not sitting next to the laptop  because when they steal that and the backup, you're really screwed.  You've got to have off site backup.  There are ways to do it.  I know people email themselves stuff.  They email it to Gmail.  They they Steve Gibson mails DVDs of his hard drive images to his mother.  But really, there's a better way, a more modern way.  It's called carbonite.  It's off site backup.  Done right. Go there right now for free.  No credit card needed.  Go to carbonite, C-A-R-B-O-N-I-T-E dot com.  Use the offer code twit.  And you're going to get 15 days for you can immediately see what happens.  You install it, Windows or Mac,  and it immediately starts backing up your personal data.  Not the operating system, not the apps, the stuff you create,  the stuff you can't afford to lose your pictures, your emails, your financial records.  That stuff that you cannot afford to lose is instantly securely backed up,  by the way, using 128 bit SSL as an option.  AES 256 bit encryption even better.  So it's really locked down.  It's up on the carbonite servers where you can access it not only from the original computer,  but from your iPhone and the other computer that can get online.  You can go. You could say, oh, I need that file.  Restores simple.  It's a great way to move to a new computer.  You just move the account, download everything again.  You got it all. Carbonite is the way of the future.  And less than five bucks a month for everything inside your hard drive.  You know, all that personal stuff, less than five bucks a month.  Go to carbonite dot com. Try it free.  Use the offer code twit.  If you decide to buy two free months, by the way, after you do the trial,  C-A-R-B-O-N-I-T-E carbonite dot com.  It's backup done right.  And I learned my lesson.  Let me tell you, thank goodness I was using carbonite.  Let's see, what should I start with?  Google Docs, there's there's drawing now in Google Docs.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  New drawing editor. It's pretty sweet.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is it? Did you play with it? I like it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's collaborative. It is collaborative.  So if you're drawing, Leo, and I have that same document open,  I can see the the the document change as you change it, which is super, which is sweet.  Very wave like. And that that kind of live typing also goes into regular Docs.  So as you and I are sharing or working on a document together,  I will see your cursor move much like my beloved Google Wave and Etherpad.  So and I hear which was this was this was upsetting to me personally.  But I hear that the code base that does the live typing and Google Docs  had nothing to do with. Oh, you're kidding.  Or Etherpad. Oh, that's too bad.  Yeah, I'm I'm I'm I'm worried that this is kind of the beginning of the death knell for for wave.  I still have my fingers crossed for a good wave announcements next month.  But yeah, it's pretty it's pretty awesome.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Did you say the death knell?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I do you really think?  I mean, you know, wave offers some features that Docs does not like federation  and inline replies, but Docs just got comments within within the documents.  But they're kind of like little yellow post-it notes off to the side  where you can have conversations like attached to bits of text, which is pretty cool.  And, you know, obviously, wave has federation.  You can build widgets and robots, which you can't do for docs.  Wave is is you can use wave as a messaging application, which you really wouldn't do with Docs.  But, you know, the question is, like, how many more people, you know,  how many more messaging apps do you really want?  So I'm a little worried for my little wave because I think wave is like  I think wave is incredible still.  So we'll see what happens.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We got a piece from a Pulitzer Prize winner in Seattle used wave to to do his story.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes, I actually I'd written that up in my in Chapter 10 of my book, which is like wave uses.  I had written that up the Seattle Times during, you know, during a manhunt  for a suspected cop killer used wave to gather information and,  you know, live real time about sightings and, you know, yeah, yeah.  And that's that's that's great.  But, you know, but increasingly it feels like wave is like this new novel thing,  but not not something that people are actually nobody's using, you know.  So, I mean, I'm using it.  But but yeah, it's it's a little bit of a tough sell.  So I'm hoping that we're going to see buzzes next.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I hope not, because I love both buzz and wave.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, they're important.  What did Google do wrong?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I don't I don't think buzz is going to go anywhere, though.  I mean, it buzzes useful even just in just an aggregating, you know,  to aggregate people's social media content from other sources kind of way,  even if it's just that.  Although, I know there are some there's still some really good conversation.  You can keep friend feed alive.  Well, that's true.  But friend feed didn't have a giant corporation.  I mean, you know, lots of Google products.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is that enough, though?  Don't you have to have the network effect?  It's not enough to have a giant corporation.  This is actually a really good test case.  Is it enough for a giant corporation to stand by, you know, say,  we're going to do a Twitter killer and we're giant and everybody's using Gmail.  So you use it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing. They have Gmail, right?  I mean, it's in Gmail.  I think people who use Gmail, at least are still do you think most normals  are turning off buzz? Yes.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think that was the mistake.  That was the mistake was putting it in Gmail.  And they thought that was their killer app.  And it wasn't. And it's still right hand left hand.  There's a new follow finder that is out of Google Labs to help you find people  on Twitter, Twitter, not buzz.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes, there's there's like, you know, very much a let a thousand flower beta flower.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I admire that. I think that's great, because I think there's a lot of companies  that do the opposite. They say, well, no, it's not.  It's got to be work with our product.  And then and you don't see the benefit of it.  And I think the the follow finder is a great tool.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  The follow finder is neat. I think it's confusing to users.  I think it's also confusing to some of the internal groups at Google.  Right. That's the impression that I get. But.  Yeah, so the follow finder is pretty neat.  I mean, it's pretty interesting that they're indexing social graphs on Twitter. Right.  And Jeff, what did you tweet?  You said that you're on your follow finder, your recommended followers were

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  you and Leo. Well, there you go.  It's smart to you.  Wait a minute. You don't for a reason.  Wait a minute, Jeff. You don't follow us.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, no, it's already giving people that I already follow.  But it said to the people whose followers are most like my followers are you two.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Which makes sense, right, because people follow the show. Yeah.  And most overlaps, they're doing major set comparison. Right.  Just was kind of incredible. Right.  I mean, Leo alone, you've got a gazillion followers just just doing that.  That computation is fast. It's really fast. Yeah.  Yeah. Discovery seems to be the thing that came up a lot at Chirp.  People saying, you know, we need better discovery mechanisms or people to follow.  I don't know. I don't need more people to follow.  I need more people to unfollow.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, you want to follow the right people, though.  It's not numbers. It's following the right people.  So I think something like that could help you maybe discover that one person  that you weren't following that you want to follow.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But the real app then becomes the killer, the killer app that kills people.  Right. The truly killer app.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Not kills them literally.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You can follow a recommender, the unfollow recommender.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right. Because the problem is that that's what killed bookmarks to me.  And I don't use bookmarks anymore because it was a bookmark.  That's a mess. Yeah. Right.  My Facebook is a bit of a mess, even though I only friend people I know.  They're trying to keep it in order. But it's a bit of a mess. Twitter.  I just add to it. I never take away from it.  Not that I want to kill people, but it's too much work to do  to categorize things in the list, which Twitter try to do.  And Facebook try to do. No, way too much work.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  By the way, that was my tool of the week, but it's OK.  Oh, sorry.  No, I mean, inevitably we were going to talk about it.  I have to pick more obscure tools.  It's a fun tool. We'll talk about a little bit more.  What is this?  Plink, plink, plonk, plink.  What is plink? Plink. Plink.  What does it do?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It recognizes pieces of art.  I've never heard of it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I have. It's very small.  It's an Android application.  Right. Well, wait a minute.  PlinkArt.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  PlinkArt. It does basically what Goggles does, right?  Goggles already recognizes pieces of art.  And I hear, Jeff, did you say this?  That someone who wrote it up said that Goggles actually does a better job  of recognizing art than PlinkArt does.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Basically, they hired these guys to work at Goggles.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So yeah, yeah.  So they must have something cool going on in the back end that  that Google wants.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Google stock last week, they announced another killer quarter.  And nonetheless, the stock went down seven percent, forty five dollars.  Now, this is that spending money.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, it's also that stupid Wall Street thing that they didn't meet  expectations of some analysts, so they suck.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And it's just the general line is that they're fearing  they're going to be spending so much money.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So Plink, Plink, Plonk.  This is Plink.  So look at that.  That's a G1, isn't it? A white G1, it looks like.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  White G1, it does look like that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Maybe that's the no, it's still got the trackball.  No, it's not a G1.  It's an HTC phone. What is it?  Sorry, I'll just say. That's a my touch.  That's a my touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What is that phone he's using to look up the death of the Virgin in Plink?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just like Goggles, huh?  Except Goggles does more.  Yes. Yeah.  OK, well, we've solved that mystery.  Let's see. What else?  Well, actually, there's quite a bit else.  VP8 codec, we could talk about briefly.  We talked about it the other day.  That's part of what they got with ON2.  And the whole issue is which codec is going to win the HTML5  seal of approval.  H.264 is certainly the front runner, but it's encumbered by patents.  We talked last week about Og Theora,  which I don't I don't know if it has a shot at it.  And now there's this VP8 codec, which Google owns and is now going to open  source. They bought it when they bought on to about a couple of months ago.  VP3.  Is the aura, so VP8 is maybe a better theory.  I'm very confused. We need an expert on this stuff.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, we do.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yay, open source.  Yay, open source.  Yay, better video codecs.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yay, HTML5.  Yay, good OSS developers making it better.  Yep. I think we need HTML5.  We want it to succeed.  So Eric Schmidt's at a party, a house party in Los Angeles

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  and says, oh, we're going to do an iPad.  It's going to be better. And this is the shocker.  It's not going to run Chromium, Chrome OS.  It's going to run Android.  Android, baby. App Store.  App Market.  I think that's key, isn't it?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You got to have apps.  I think we've learned that web apps are not enough.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's all the Chrome OS would support.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I worry for Chrome OS.  I don't know.  I wonder what's going to happen with that.  But yeah, it makes sense.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  He was also pumping that last week as well.  About how Chrome OS will mean that you have the two second sign on

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  at any machine anywhere and you never need to do anything.  Your employees save time, blah, blah, blah.  He was pumping that last week as well.  Yeah.  Interesting.  It'll be interesting to see how that turns out.  And actually, they announced Cloud Print this week.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting too.  And that would tie in.  That's going through Chrome OS or is it an app or how does that work?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's going to be in Chrome OS and it's also going to be in Chrome,  the browser on the desktop.  So you're going to be able to use it anywhere.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And the idea is that you'd be able to print any job to the cloud,  to any printer via Google.  What do I have to do?  I have to do a lot of things.  I have to do a lot of things.  I have to do a lot of things.  The cloud to any printer via Google.  What do I have to do?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, they're going to solve the whole driver thing.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The problem is that no printer companies yet are, you know, you can't,  there's no printer that exists that will do this.  Right.  They're hoping that printer.  They're convincing printer companies to sign on.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right.  And of course, I think a lot of people,  what I think probably a good reason are saying,  hey, Google is going to see all my print jobs now too.  All my printouts.  Oh, what the heck?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Why not?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Hey, at this point, they see all your email.  They see all your searches.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, how much more, yeah, how much more do they need exactly?  So it's in the labs right now.  You can go to a code.google.com and look for cloud print.  You need a cloud aware printer or you can go through your computer to a  legacy printer, but the computer will have to handle that.  It has to be shared, I guess.  But a cloud aware printer on the net would work.  Interesting.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I can certainly see a small enterprise using this to just make every  printer available to every employee.  Right.  Today, if you do it through computers, right?  I think it's interesting.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, you know, hey, I would love to be able to say, I mean,

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  my mom hardly ever gets online.  It'd be great if I could print a picture to her printer in New York.  I would scare my father to death if I did that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Honey, what's that sound?  The printer is alive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anything that means that I don't have to fax stuff anymore is a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what this is, isn't it?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes, basically.  This is cloud faxing.  Oh, you've just done it.  You've killed the evil fax.  Thank God.  Oh, God, please.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It can't come fast enough.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's what this is.  They should have called it Google fax.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, they should have.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's true.  Cloud print scares people.  Google fax.  Ooh, I like that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  The one thing is that you've got to get things like that.  I mean, I'm not going to do that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm not going to do that.  I don't like that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The one thing is that you've got to get things like signatures on it.  Right.  You can draw in Google Docs.  Hello.  I can draw my signature.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, there you go.  I can draw my digital signature.  I do at this point.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Sign there and put it up and get it over there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's something that the iPad desperately needs.  It's like the one thing really missing from the iPad is the ability to print from it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The irony is that Google may save the iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That would be funny.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And things like this, it will make the iPad more tolerable for those occasional business  uses.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Less of a peripheral and more of a cloud device.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  And Google still benefits.  No harm to Apple.  No harm to Google.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What the hell?  So Google's net income was $1.96 billion.  That's not so bad.  Revenue was $6.77 billion.  What was it up there?  Income up 37%.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The percentages are just awe-inspiring.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wow.  Paid clicks up 15% year to year.  Cost per click up 7% year to year.  This is, you want awe-inspiring?  You know how much cash Google has just in the bank?  20, oh, is this a number?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, no, it's not.  No, no.  Dane gave me the number now, so I figured that was safe.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I will stay away from that number.  Google in the bank.  I wonder what they do with it.  Did they put them in certificates of deposit?  What do they do?  $26.5 billion.  Holy crap.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's the size of an endowment for like Harvard, right?  This is just their cash.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Just in the bank.  Getting 0.25% interest.  Dude.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's nuts.  What's the interest?  Can they buy Iceland and stop up the, you know,  hey, that has solved your problems at once.  Iceland's debt and the volcano.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wow.  If they put it in a CD and get 4% interest,  they could just close the company.  They just all go home.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They could have solved the debt crisis with just their money.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's like almost a billion dollars a year in interest.  I'd take that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeez, Louise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's wow.  Louise.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Louise.  All right.  I think that's enough.  Oh, I got to do this one more.  You know, the case where the three Google executives were convicted in Italy for violating the  Italian privacy law by allowing the posting of a controversial bullying video,  and it stayed up there for two months.  They pulled it down as soon as law enforcement asked them to.  The judge has weighed in, Judge Oscar Maggi, in a 111 page decision.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He says, there's no such a thing as the limitless prairie of the internet where everything is permitted

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  and nothing can be prohibited on pain of a global excommunication.  He sounds like the Pope.  No, actually he's German, isn't he?  On pain of a global excommunication by the people of the web.  Actually sounds like Dracula.  He switched in here.  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  He switched mid-summer.  I don't know what he is.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He's German and Italian.  He's the Pope, but he talks like this, but he's also German.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Apparently, he says, I don't buy this at all, but he says the internet is not a lawless prairie,  and therefore, because Google Italy handled the content, it bears a responsibility for what's on there.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I didn't research this, but people in Europe were telling me that the EU has basically already overruled that judge.  That judgment was illegal.  The EU makes it very complicated to figure out Europe these days.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's the commercial exploitation, essentially.  He says because Google made the money.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's the European attitude.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They're in the trouble.  Money is evil.  Yeah, money is evil.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's what makes it wrong.  When I gave my talk about the German paradox and somebody, a Swiss blogger or an Austrian blogger came up at the end,  I can't tell the difference, and raised a good point.  He said, well, the American paradox in our view is you Americans have a very good government lasting for 200 years,  yet you are the ones who distrust business.  We in Europe have had bad governments.  We're the ones who distrust, you know, I'm sorry.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The other way around.  We distrust government.  They distrust business.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  In Europe, they distrust business.  I said, wow, that's a wonderful point.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's interesting, isn't it?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You're going to figure it out?  Google's...  Can I ask my experts two questions real quick?  Certainly.  One was about...  So Google now adds services to your hosting control panel.  Did you see that, Gina?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I didn't see that one.  What do you mean they add services to it?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So now Plesk and other kinds of amateur's control panels that people like me have to use.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I use Plesk.  Oh, Plesk, indeed.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You can add web elements, custom search, site search, AdSense, all these things so that your host can now offer these Google services.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a Plesk plugin.  That's cool.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Is that a big deal?  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Cool.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's nice.  Sure.  It's always nice.  The other one to ask my friends, the experts, aren't I lucky, chat room?  I have experts at hand.  Is the Israeli ban of the iPad?  That it's different Wi-Fi?  Can you explain that one to me?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, it's interesting because Princeton also banned the iPad and a number of other universities are doing so also.  Really?  Yeah.  And I did read Princeton's reasoning, which has to do with a faulty DHCP implementation in the iPad.  Really?  Yeah.  And at first I kind of poo-pooed it because this happened before with the iPhone.  Remember, a couple of universities said, oh, you can't use the iPhone on a network.  It just takes up too many resources.  And they backed down.  It was stupid.  This actually, I read Princeton's reasoning and it actually made sense.  They don't do that.  They don't handle the DHCP lease properly.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So is it like, is it just hammering a DHCP server?  No.  What's the problem?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's just too...  No, no.  And in fact, it's kind of an interesting thing.  What they do is when the DHCP lease expires, you're supposed to get a new IP address.  Right.  It does not.  However, the DHCP server thinks that address is available.  So potentially you'll have two devices with the same IP address on the network.  The only person that bothers is the iPad user who suddenly gets a message saying, you know, there's another guy with the IP address, you know, and may lose connectivity.  So it doesn't really hurt the network.  And Princeton is just saying, well, but we don't want these iPad people to come.  You know, it's, it's an anti-Apple sentiment.  Let's be honest.  We don't want these iPad people to come to us and complain.  So we're just going to ban them.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, that wonderful, that wonderful geek, not geek, but tech support phrase.  We don't support blank.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They actually, they actually aren't banning iPads.  They're just saying, if this happens to you, we're going to knock you off.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Supposedly in Israel, they were, they were confiscating them at the border.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  The country says the device's wireless technology threatens to create interference with other products.  It's 2.4 gigahertz.  It's the, you know, Apple says, we don't know.  iPad complies with international standards.  We're not sure what's going on.  It's a puzzle.  It is a puzzle.  Sure is.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  At Chirp, when the wifi went out, John Battelle, who's the MV's MC said, you know, we're noticing a lot of connections by iPhones.  Can you guys just like shut off your iPhone wifi?  Oh yeah.  We can't do two connections per attendee.  And I was like, really?  You didn't expect that there'd be at least two wifi connections per human at the Twitter conference?  Come on.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Whoever does the wifi for South by Southwest should just hire out.  They have the same problem at Republica.  They have the problem here.  They have the problem everywhere.  For God's sakes, it's not rocket science.  It just takes routers.  Right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, and you know what Loic did at the web?  Because two years ago, the web was like everybody's bitching at Mona.  And then he brought in he because I think it was a can't remember.  It was a British telecom.  It was a local telecom that was doing maybe it was France telecom.  And they brought in somebody else.  And these guys just like they had like gigabit.  It was like everywhere.  And they had more bandwidth than God.  That's what you got to do.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You got to do.  It's the worst PR for your conference.  Terrible.  I'm saying at least 10 iPads have been confiscated at Ben Gurion as the  travelers come into Israel.  You're required to pay for storage fees and you could pick it up on your

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  way out.  Wow.  Yeah.  I don't know if they did that for the iPad.  And I don't know what Princeton is going to do, apparently.  George Washington and other universities are also banning iPads now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  But again, I kind of don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you're in Israel, you're going to be able to read it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't know who you're looking at.  I don't know.  I don't know why they ban iPads now.  It's funny how there are Luddites everywhere, even in IT departments these days.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Because the DHCP problem?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think the DHCP lease, yeah.  And by the way, that's an easy fix.  And I'm sure Apple will push a fix out.  Yeah.  You know, there's a software update coming out tomorrow.  Yesterday just software, just software.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Easy to fix.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yep.  Let us get to our tip number and tool of the week, starting with Jeana Trapani and  her tip of the week.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Cool.  I got two quick tips this week.  First one, you can drag and drop attachments into Gmail now.  And it uses HTML5, so you've got to be using Firefox 3.6 or Chrome on Windows.  And it's pure HTML5, which is awesome.  And, you know, it's not that big a deal.  But, you know, back in the day when the whole conversation about whether or not apps were  going to move to the web, you know, one of the reasons why that couldn't ever happen  is because you couldn't drag and drop files.  And now that is becoming very possible.  So take a file, just drag it onto near the place in your Gmail compose window, or it  says attach file.  It'll change and say, hey, drop your file here.  You drop it and it's in, which is awesome.  You don't have to be the explorer and find your file.  Second tip, and this was this was a big one for me, AppBrain.com.  This is for Android users.  This is an awesome service.  You go to AppBrain.com and you sign in and you download the application to your Android  phone and it generates a list of all the apps that are on your phone, how much they call  whether or not they're free ratings, user ratings.  You can browse other people's lists.  If I see an app on Jeff's list that looks interesting, I can click install and the next  time I turn on my phone, it'll install it.  So I Leo and Jeff, both of you, my list is on there.  It's AppBrain.com slash.  There's killer Gina Trapani slash apps on the phone.  You can find me there.  You can embed this really neat widget, which I put on smarterware.org.  It actually shows the phone with the applications menu.  It's really cool.  You can click on any icon and be, hey, what is this?  I posted this on my blog.  I had readers post their lists in the comments.  I found so many cool apps this week.  And it automatically synchronizes.  Like every week we recommend another Android app.  So you get new apps and it automatically syncs up to your AppBrain list, makes it public.  You can surf other people's lists.  It's really awesome.  And this is something that iTunes doesn't do.  I would love if iTunes did this too.  But really cool way to discover apps and to see what your favorite Android users are using.  So Leo, I challenge you to create an AppBrain list.  I'm doing it right now.  Because your list will be insane.  I'm doing it right now.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I would gain only benefit on my end, not contribute much, but I'll do it.  I asked for this a long time ago.  Remember I asked you.  Yes, you did.  I said I wanted your guys' lists of apps and I wanted an easy way to get it.  See, can you show up?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And it syncs in the background.  You don't ever have to update it manually again.  You just have to be running the AppBrain app on your Android phone.  It's fantastic.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I've been using, you know, there's a, what is it?  Woozoo?  Wahoo?  I can't remember.  Woofoo.  And there is an app that you can run on Windows and Mac that is the same thing.  It collects all your apps.  It records it.  And it's a very, very useful way to find apps.  And there's also iusethis.com.  And that's what we were talking about that, remember?  And Jeff exactly called for this.  Yes, social software usage.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Awesome.  Great way to see what people use and get ideas.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm going to scan in the barcode right now on the page because it put up a QR code.  And I'm going to install this right now.  This will be very easy.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Swiss code monkeys.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Swiss code monkeys.  Well, who doesn't love Swiss code monkeys?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It lists what kind of device you're using.  So it says Nexus One on mine.  It tells you, I have 27 apps.  26 are free.  That's 96%.  One paid because I'm cheap, obviously.  One?  Total size.  What?  Wacopa.  That's the name of that.  I have only one paid app.  And it tells you how much money you spent in the Android market.  $6.99 for me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's sad.  I know.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It is sad.  I actually, I looked at that and I remember you saying, Leo, that you buy apps just to  support developers.  And I was thinking, man.  You're a developer.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You got to start spending some money.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I know.  Now that it's public, I'm going to spend some more money to support my fellow developers.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, we've brought the Swiss code monkeys to their knees because the download is not  happening.  As soon as it does, I'm Leo Laporte on AppBrain.  Awesome.  Yeah.  And I'm sure Jeff, you're usually Jeff Jarvis wherever you go.  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And it sorts the list by how recently you installed it so you can see new apps that people are  trying out.  It's just, it's really, really, really cool.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, this is fantastic.  Really great.  There's the two tips of the week for you.  Now, Jeff Jarvis and his number of the week.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, actually, I have Dane to thank for it because I figured if he should give it to  me.  And it's really a simple number, but I'm grateful.  It was a nice lifehacker site, a page by give credit where credit is due, Erica Ho.  Just put up a nice little infographic of how many servers are owned by whom.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, I love this.  Yeah.  This is a great story.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  Google has an estimated one million servers and nobody knows, they won't say, but fine.  But this comparison to others that the other big box in this is Intel at a hundred thousand,  rack space is fifty six thousand, ten of which are storing Robert Scoble's social  life.  One on one, the internet hosting company, seventy thousand Akamai, which I would have  thought would have a lot more because it serves so much the web, sixty one thousand.  Facebook, thirty thousand.  And so it's just a minor little interesting.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But if the biggest is Intel with a hundred thousand, we're talking another order of  magnitude, at least for Google.  Nobody knows.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That makes sense though.  I mean, Intel does have a hosting business, but it's not huge.  Right.  I was actually surprised Intel was that big.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What are they doing with a hundred thousand servers?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They have hosting services.  They have services that they offer, but I guess they're much bigger in enterprise than  I knew.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So, Gina, I finally have installed this app.  So what do I do?  I press manage my apps, app categories.  What do I do?  Hot apps?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, there should be a sync.  Yeah, try manage my apps.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It tells me to sign into my Google account.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes.  And then what you do...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Does that mean it has to be the one associated with the phone or can it be my apps one?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That might just be a single sign on.  I don't know if that really has anything to do with the app because you're going to put  it on your phone.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think it can be either your Google account or your Google apps account.  I think either one will work.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It does say once you're in the phone to sign in with your Google account, but I don't think  it has to tie into...

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Okay.  Yeah.  So if you click on manage my apps, there's a sync my apps button.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And it's done with AppBrain.  Yeah.  And so now I have all my apps, but I will have to sign in and then I have to sync it  to AppBrain.  Okay.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I see.  Right.  And then in that same manage apps console, if you choose to install an app from the  AppBrain websites, if you see something on My List or Just List or whoever's list, you  click install.  And then if you're going to manage my apps, you click perform installs and you'll be able  to install whatever you chose from the website, which is pretty neat.  The interface is a little...  When you perform installs, it actually just searches for the app in the market.  So you have to go through the market rigmarole.  So you can't install multiple...  You have to do it kind of one at a time.  That's a little annoying, but whatever.  The Android market just has to get better at that in general.  There isn't any update all button yet.  And you should be able to say install these five apps in one shot.  Hopefully that they'll fix that in Android in general.  At some point.  But yeah, AppBrain is pretty neat.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All right.  And now it is my turn for my tip.  And I actually have two tips since we kind of talked a little bit about follow finder.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I've done that to you so many times.  I can't very well complain.  So I will show you follow finder real quickly.  So you enter in your username or any username.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Which I think is the point.  It's not so much yours, but if you say, I love that, Gina.  I want to be more like her.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let me see who Gina follows that intersects with me.  Is that it?  But it doesn't know about me.  It's just going to show who Gina follows that that's interesting.  And she follows me.  Right.  Tweeps you might like Scobalizer, Dave Weiner, the real Dvorak.  It's all the same.  It's all our friends.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's good.  Who are the ones who are most like you?  Up at the top right.  Most like me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Tweeps with similar followers.  Similar followers.  Yeah, similar followers.  But that was because I use my name.  So I mean her name.  So let me use Leo Laporte.  Obviously I wouldn't show up, but I bet you up Kevin Rose, the real Dvorak, Patrick Norton,  Alex Albrecht, all the people I used to work with.  So that's pretty smart.  I'm not sure exactly.  It is.  It's pretty smart.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  How do it know?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I mean, so it's comparing Kevin Rose's set of followers with yours, Leo.  And we're talking about both of you have.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And it did that instantly.  He's got millions.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  He's got millions.  It must cash.  He's got millions.  It's got some serious set comparison there.  This is a problem.  I'm trying to build this into Think Tank.  It's not an easy problem to solve.  So I'm impressed with how fast it is.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And is there is there like with with sort algorithms, are there like kind of clever algorithms that  simplify that?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  There must be.  I need to do a little more research into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Time to pull out the Donald Knuth.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  There must be.  But when you have a million, you know, numbers, huge numbers, compare it with another set  of huge numbers, you know, and you're looking you're comparing to a giant set.  I would love to know how it's going.  What's going on in the background there?  How else would you have a million servers?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes.  Yeah, I guess it's Google, right?  I don't think I think Donald Knuth is going to have to write a new book on social graph  searching and comparison.  It's a whole new thing.  He wasn't around for that.  So I have one more tip.  It's actually an app.  And if you followed me on the Swiss code monkey site, you'd know about it.  I found it in one of the Android app reviews.  I'm always looking at Android app reviews.  Chris, now my phone's crashed.  Oh, there it goes.  Now we go.  Sometimes it gets slow.  And somebody told me it was the and I mentioned this before the beautiful widgets.  They said that really slows it down.  This is called call track.  It's free.  I think it's free.  You're going to love it.  So what you do is you create in your Google calendar a new category.  I made one called calls.  Then you enable call track on your phone and it adds to your Google calendar.  And in my case, I log all incoming, outgoing and missed calls.  And if I now go to my calendar on Google, every call I've made, every call that's come in,  every call I've missed is logged with the phone number, the length of time.  And it's all part of my Google calendar.  Whoa.  It's really kind of an eye opener.  I spent a lot of time, a lot more time on the phone than I thought.  Now, I don't know if I could show this because I'm going to be a little bit more  I don't know if I could show this because if I do phone numbers, it's all the phone numbers in here.  So I don't know if I dare show it, but I have a I have a calendar that shows what phone calls I've made.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So question for you, could you go so say you spent you and I spent half an hour on the phone and it showed up in your calendar.  Could you go to that event and maybe take some notes in the description field about what we talk about?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Sure. It's now a calendar entry.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, that's pretty sweet.  Isn't that cool?  That would be really useful because I always forget when do we talk about that?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right. I have a log of all my calls. Really.  It's I found it incredibly handy.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Is the is there authentication to subscribe to that calendar or no, it has your it's a private calendar.  So it's my calendar. I could share it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, I absolutely could share it.  Let me I just I don't want to show anybody's phone numbers.  Otherwise, I'd show you.  But it really is. It's really fantastic.  It's I found it to be incredibly useful.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So that you'll see on my list of Android apps that I use of the hundreds of Android apps that I use.  So a couple of tips for you to follow.  Fine. And then a handy little app.  And I'm not sure how much I paid for it.  I should probably write it down.  I'm pretty sure it was free called call track.  If you search the search the Android marketplace for it, you'll find it.  And I think it was Fandroid.  It was the Fandroid website that I I found that on.  I haunt those now.  Looking for cool new apps.  Give them a plug.  Gina Tripani is the blogger at Smarterware.org, a great place to go to find great tips.  Of course, she writes for Lifehacker and other great things, including CNN and Time magazine.  Fast Company.  Fast Company. Whatever.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  One of those one of those one of those magazine things.  One of those things.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Those magazine things.  Magazine things.  Magazine things.  I can only write for the website, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's all right.  You don't have to apologize.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  No, I'm not apologizing.  I'm roasting.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's right.  She writes for the site.  She's not one of them.  Inkstain Riches.  Jeff Jarvis was an Inkstain Rich and he's found new life as a blogger at BuzzMachine.com.  Second childhood.  That's another way to look at it.  And Jeff's book is What Would Google Do?  Gina's book is The Complete Guide to Google Wave at CompleteWaveGuide.com.  You can watch this show and when we do it, 2.15 Pacific Time, 5.15.  Oh, we're moving.  We're moving.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Starting Wednesday.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Big, big change, yeah.  Very good point.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We will now be doing it at 4 p.m. Eastern, 1 p.m. Pacific on Wednesday, starting April  21st at live.twit.tv.  Now you can still listen and watch to the downloadable versions on iTunes or the Zoom  Store, anywhere you get Google Listen, anywhere you get podcast aggregators.  And we do have a YouTube video at youtube.com slash twit.  There's a whole twig channel so you can watch each and every one of our episodes as they  come out.  We are available on almost all the platforms now through the Mediafly application, the  twit application.  Just search for twit in your app store.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Thanks, guys.  The chat room is gasping.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Why are they gasping?  Wednesday, 4 p.m.  Oh, oh, oh, yeah.  Well, we decided we wanted to be on during the weekdays because I think we don't get  as much attention as we could.  And we certainly have a hard time getting people on because everybody wants Saturday  afternoon for themselves.  I don't understand that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Fools with laws.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And actually, Jeff and Gina are two of the people who wanted their lives back.  So I don't have a life, so I don't count.  But we're glad to do that.  We'll be doing the GizWiz at this time, starting next week, the Daily GizWiz with Vick DeBartola.  Thank you, everybody, for joining us.  We'll see you next time.  Next Wednesday, don't forget, 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern for this week in Google.
