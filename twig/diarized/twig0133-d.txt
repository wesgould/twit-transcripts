This week at Google soon with brand new better music  and album art that actually has people's faces on it. Hello, I'm Leo Laporte. Do you really

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  hate the music, Gina Trippani? I don't hate it. I don't think it adequately communicates

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  how dynamic and modern we all are. It was high concept. It was a big mistake. I wanted to go with  a fugue or a round or a cantata, something that would imply the three voices intertwined  It was too high concept. It was a stupid idea. I think it was a mistake. I think it might just be  we might be ready for an upgrade. It isn't a fugue, Dave. I couldn't find a fugue. I could  only get what I could get. That's the other thing is licensable classical performances are few and  far between. Ironic. Isn't that ironic? That is Gina Trippani. She is the founder of Lifehacker,  the blogger at Smarterware.org, the author of Think Up App, Think Up App, ThinkUpApp.com,  and the author of The Complete Guide to Google Wave. I'm sorry that hurt. That was a low blow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's okay. Good to be here. My favorite hour of the week begins now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It would be even more your favorite hour if we had spaghetti and meatballs, wouldn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, man. Spaghetti and meatballs here in California. I try not to think about it too much because  I'm far away from Brooklyn. Sunday gravy. Oh, Sunday gravy. Sunday gravy, baby. Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I got to book a flight home. Oh, me too. We Italians, we don't stray far from the ragu pot.  I'm leaving them astray down over the cliff.  Does the administration ever say that? Does the administration ever say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff, could you do more with printing presses? I met David Carr. I knew him before, but I was  at a dinner last week at Clay Shirky's. Oh, man. And yeah, I know. And David Carr from the New York  Times. In fact, he wrote a blog post there. That's a name drop I'd love to drop. So David wrote a  blog post today about the bread we all had at Clay's. And he mentioned no one else in the  meeting. But I was telling the story of going to the Gutenberg Museum on my pilgrimage there.  And Carr, you could see the joy come in his face. He said, so that's the print last print guy you

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  liked. What fun. That sounds like a great dinner party. Who else was there? Emily Bell from The

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Guardian. All the media matters types. And Cindy Stiver is the new editor of the Columbia  Journalism Review. Clay, Jay Rosen, who couldn't be there, Emily and I were all skewered by the  Columbia Journalism Review as the future news consortium, the cabal. And so I had the idea of  having the new editor of Cindy Stiver over somewhere for dinner to brainwash her. And so  we didn't do any of that. We just drank a delicious bread that Clay makes. So Clay makes his own.  It's really good. On top of everything else, on top of understanding the whole world and the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  universe and everything else, he makes good bread. I actually am a very good baker, but I had to stop  because when you make a nice hot fresh loaf of bread, there's only one thing to do, which is  slather it with butter and devour it whole. The entire thing. And I've already got a problem there.  So it's just not good. What kind of bread does he make? Just a simple baguette. Yeah. Yeah. My mom,  one of the reasons I do this is my mom, my entire life growing up, would make spaghetti and meatballs.  We'd have antipasto beginning the meal. And then she'd home and homemade baguettes every meal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh man. Meats and cheeses and olives. Oh, anchovies. Oh, I love that stuff. Anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that's not what we're here to discuss, ladies and gentlemen. This week in diets.  This week in PATH. Boy, there was a lot of gnashing of teeth over PATH uploading.  PATH is the app that the reason this is big is because PATH is the app that all the techno  rotty use, the diger rotty use. And so I don't know if real people use it, but we all use it.  And so it really was offensive to our sensibility. This is the Dave Moore and the guy who worked at  Facebook, left Facebook to start this company. And it's kind of like Facebook. It's the path  through your life, a journal of your life in pictures, text, music. You tell the world when  you wake up, not actually not the world, no more than 150 friends when you wake up, when you go to  sleep, all that stuff. And I love it. And I've only got like 60 friends and I know all of them.  Alex Lindsay's rule of thumb on PATH is you only add people that you would have at a dinner party.  So it really is, it's like what Facebook was supposed to be kind of. And you can cross post  on PATH to Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, Foursquare. So you're not, you know, often I'll cross post,  but I just love it. So when you sign up for PATH or at any point thereafter, you have the opportunity  to find friends on PATH to add friends. And they have three places you can add them from, contacts,  Facebook, or invite them. So it's two places. When you type, when you press contacts, what does it do?  Well, somehow it figures out which of the people in your address book are on PATH. How would it do  that? Now think a little thought experiment. Does it download the entire database of PATH  users to your phone? No. No. And check on the phone? No. Any program and every, most social  programs do this. This has been going on for years. Any program. Google's done it. It has to because if you think about it,  be the programmer for a moment. How do you solve this problem? I have two lists, a list of my address  contacts and a list of everybody who's on PATH. How do I figure out where the intersection is?  Either I have to, I don't know, one by one PATH on the phone has to go through the contact list  and compare it to the data. No, it uploads the whole thing. Boom, does a fast comparison,  downloads it. So some smart person, for some reason, I love his blog name, McLovin, M-C-L-O-V.I-N.  McLovin noticed this. Well, though, McLovin, you're significant, you're obviously sophisticated

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  technically. What did you think it was doing? But then why did anybody even tie on with it? It started

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  spreading around. Because most people aren't sophisticated enough to figure out that, of course,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they're all doing that. Well, so I think there's some interesting things here. First, there's the  permissions model of Android and iPhone. I have an installed PATH. When you install it, if you  were installing on Android, it would say this app would need access to your address book. And lots  of apps do, mostly because you want to be able to quickly or easily share. I don't have a problem  with an app having access to my address book, but the idea that PATH is uploading my entire address  book and keeping it on their servers to monitor, you know, hey, if one of my friends comes on.  Well, that's the question. Do they keep it? That's the issue is the retention.  Yes, they keep it on their servers. They maintain an up-to-date database of your contacts on their

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  servers continuously. So it can notify you when friends and family join PATH.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly. Now, that is something that's different in my book than, hey, you can have access to my

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  address book to quickly call someone. Because when you add your mistress to it, you don't know that  it's going to go there. Not that I have ever had or ever can have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, let me tell you, it's fun. So, but I have to say the issue is really more one of disclosure.  Yes.  Than it is of, oh my God, it does this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, when on Facebook, you do the same thing, right? On Facebook, it says if you want to find

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  friends and then you- Gina, you're a programmer. How would you solve this? You could, I guess. Well,  saving is another matter. But how would you go through a contact list on a phone and compare it  to the database on the PATH servers? You either one by one have to compare, which is going to take  forever, or you just upload the whole thing. You do a quick comparison on the server and flag matches.  Now, what you should do is you should say somewhere in, obviously not through the Android or iPhone  disclosure, because neither of those are complete enough, but you should say in your privacy policy,  we will do this. And if you save it, which maybe they shouldn't have done, but if we will save it  and we'll do the comparison and you're giving us permission if you use PATH, but you have to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, technically it is easier, an easier way to do it. And it is an issue of disclosure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can't do it with hashes, folks, because they are not all exact matches. You have to,  you cannot do it with hashes. You have to have a grep, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. One of the suggestions that someone made was that they could pass this information. They  could hash the email addresses when they send them across, but you know, this is...  Well, they shouldn't send it in the clear. That's a mistake as well.  It's not over an encrypted connection anyway. I think the idea is just that PATH is maintaining  your address book on their servers and you're not aware of that. Were you aware of that, Leigh Ann?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, no. Although the minute PATH says, oh, your mom just joined PATH,  a light bulb should go off if you're thinking, oh, well, how do they know that? They must be

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  saving my mom's email address somewhere. Right, right. So now I'm kind of new,  relatively new to iOS after several years of straight Android. And Android has,  I think, has a really clear permissions model. When you install an app, it tells you what the  app needs access to. I think it could be more granular and I wish that I could opt out of  certain things, you know, one by one, but whatever. iPhone does not do that.  iPhone does not do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Apple is supposed to keep track of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Apple is supposed to keep track of that. Right. So, you know, so I saw a few people make  the point that they wish that the Apple review process had caught this, that this possibly  could go against Apple's terms of service, that you're not supposed to store this contact  information. I don't know if that's actually true. And in fact, I should try and find the  I'm trying to find the link where I saw that. But and I think it's actually on the original  post by the guy who did the network monitoring to see what was going across. I don't blame PATH.  I actually think that PATH's apology was very well done. And I applaud them for saying they're  deleting all this contact information off their servers. They're saying, we're sorry,  we made a mistake. Like based on your feedback, we've realized that we shouldn't have done this  without being more communicative. We're deleting all the contact data that we've collected thus  far from our servers. That's that's pretty that's a pretty good apology. So I applaud them for that.  For me, this was just a bigger question about how do mobile apps communicate exactly what they're  doing and why to you and in a way that is usable and reasonable and clear, but not, you know,  a 40 page terms of service or privacy policy. This is a hard. This is a very difficult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, this is a UI problem to some extent. I think, Gina, you're right. It's disclosure.  But disclosure is UI in this case, where what we need is this notion of the data vault. And you  have a easy means. You say, OK, you're allowed in. Here's how you're allowed in and not. And  if we don't do that as an industry, we're going to get I'm sorry, I wasn't going to bring it up  this week, but we're going to get things like the European rules coming where they get draconian  about saying you may only gather the minimum data for the minimum amount of time. And that to me is  very chilling on innovation and chilling on knowledge and other things. But that's where  they've gone. And that's the extreme of where they can go and probably will go unless we have  a better structure where people say, I get it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's fine. Sure. Because I said,  OK. And that's to me, privacy is being privacy by design is one of the great buzzword buzz phrases  of late. But to me, that's that's a misnomer because it starts at the end of the process.  Beginning the process is I want to share. I want to find friends. OK, says Pat. Great. We'll help  you do that. Here's how. But here's what you're doing along the way. And privacy policies aren't  the way to do that. Privacy laws are the way to do that. The UI is the way to do that. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. I agree. So it's really an issue from a technical point of view. I think probably,  Faye, I'm sure I know everybody does this because it's the simplest way to do it. Somebody saying  you could hash. It's true. You could hash on the phone. You could hash all the email addresses,  upload the hash and compare them with a hash on the on the path side. I can see why they would  choose not to do that computationally intensive. And they probably just didn't think because I'm  sure Facebook and everything else does. If you're going to if you're going to search your contact  list for matches, that's what's going to happen. Right. Right. And that's really the message I want  to get out to people is, well, how did you think they were doing it? Right. I think you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Right. But I mean, the Apple's terms of service section 17 one apps cannot transmit data  about a user without obtaining the user's prior permission and providing the user with access to

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  information about how and where the data will be used. So it is a violation. There should be a big  box that says you're we are now going to upload your contact list to our servers where we will  compare it with our members list. We will store this for future reference. If you choose not to  do this press cancel. I think that would have been the way to do it. I think they understood except for the storing part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that they presumed that people would presume this is how we're going to do it.  People aren't that sensitive. I think you're right too is that in our world probably would people would

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  presume it. But obviously others don't. Right. Yeah. Yeah. A geek would know. Although I didn't think about it.  I was actually I didn't think about it till I read the art. All these all this outrage.  And I thought, well, yeah, of course they're doing that. But it's interesting. So  I wonder how Apple's going to respond. So the response from Dave is we blew it. We're sorry.  We're going to delete it, which will actually eliminate some functionality of path, which is  to let you know your friend is now on path, which is a big deal. I like so I what I'd like is the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  choice. Right. There's an update that will involve some better communication and choice about. Oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I see this in path two point. Oh, it's point six released to the app store today,  but mostly probably to be in compliance with Apple's own policy. You're prompted to opt in  or out of sharing your phone's contacts with our servers. If you accept and later decide you would  like to revoke this access, send an email to service at path dot com. Is that is that significant

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is sufficient email us and we'll delete it. First, I think it's I think it's funny that they said  sharing your phone's contacts with our servers as if themselves were an entity. Our servers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Me would like to share my server and maybe it's because I have to admit I love path and I love  Dave, although I've given Dave a hard time in the past when he was at Facebook. In fact,  he remembered that, which I felt bad about. But I think he's great. And I think I think I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  think he's nefarious. So I'm not saying I didn't put the story in the rundown because I think that  path was. Oh, it's a big story. I think that their apology was remarkable. I think this is a bigger  issue about disclosure and what our expectations are when a mobile app says it needs access to  your address book. Do you expect that that means they're uploading all your contacts to their  server? To me, I expect that that means, you know, they're going to say, oh, this person on  Twitter is also the you know, this is the phone number that you have for this person or, you know,  data sharing or kind of mash data together or give me an easy way to email someone or phone someone  from within the app. That's what that translates to me. To me, that that sounds I assume that it's  client side. If I got a notification from Path, I said, oh, hey, your your mom just joined Path.  It wouldn't ring a little bit of a bell. And I'd say, how did they? But you can't expect regular  people to do that. Right. Right. And I would think, well, maybe the you know, maybe the app  is running in the background. You know, maybe there's an asynchronous task going on in the  background that's true. That's doing the check. It's not that difficult to check, you know, to

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  send that's a really good point, because we can think of credible, maybe not preferable, but  credible ways to do this without uploading and storing data. Right. Then really, that does mean  you've got to tell us if you're going to do this. Yeah. I mean, I'm not saying that would be

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  efficient. It would use a lot of bandwidth. It would, you know, it might slow down your phone.  They're all good technical reasons why they did what they did the way they did it. And I'm not  blaming Path. I'm not saying that they did it the wrong way. But I do find I find this really  interesting about what users expectations are about Apple's review process, about what, you know,  what their phone is doing when they ask for certain permissions. I think about this a lot  when I have to set my apps to ask for permissions. Apparently, chat room just gave me a link to a

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  story from last year. rims, whose kick which is a messenger client on iOS and Android, by the way,  after they found out that it was doing the same thing. kick had breached contractual obligations  based blah, blah, blah. Apparently, what they were doing is uploading a contact list. This  doesn't actually say in great detail what it was. But in fact, now, it's in court. So I you know,  maybe this is not an uncommon thing. But maybe it's also not unreasonable to get upset about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and say, Hey, yeah, but again, I think I think we have to go to harm. Right. So what are the  possible harms here? I you know, if there were a breach of the data? Well, yeah, if they sold  my contact list to anybody, that's a pretty big not not sell. I mean, I don't think path or  resolve. I think that that that is a good part. It could. Well, are they asking the rights? But  even if there's just a breach? Well, what if they're compiling? What if they compile a mailing list  and sell it to a spammer? That's the thing. You know, that's where we get to. That's why this is  the the data void rule. regulate the behavior of other technology. So if you try to regulate  the gathering of data in full, you can't know anything, and you must forget everything, right?  That becomes very difficult. Whereas you say, Listen, if if if you if they gather this data  for the purpose of giving you a service, they allowed no access to it, there was no breach,  they did nothing else wrong, the harm of them having on the server is de minimis. If they  purposely didn't go and sell it, or if they treat the data carelessly, and there's a breach, that's  where the harm lies. So the regulation is more in what did they do wrong to you, then, my god,  everything that could go wrong. Right? So to me, it's, it's, as I say, it's de minimis that they  have my address book on their server, if I trust them to hold it well, and if they don't do anything  bad with it. There's no real harm there. There's potential harm. There's not. If they do, you're  right. If they sell it to a third party without my knowledge. Yeah, that's harm. What about  Pinterest, Pinterest, can that can that fat go away before I have to actually use it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I feel the same way. Maybe it will. I am not a Pinterest fan. I am a member, because I try  everything. And I've often wondered why people are so crazy about it. Somebody said, just, you know,  ask a woman, but I don't think that's sexist. We're not going there again.  So the idea of Pinterest, for those who have yet to been exposed to it, and it isn't, by the way,  public, and yet, I read a thing a couple of weeks ago, that was like the number eight most used site  in the internet. I mean, it's huge already, even in beta, is that you just use it as a digital  scrapbook of things you think are cool in lots of different categories. And you can browse other  people's, there it is, other people's child free and loving it. You can browse other people's  Pinterest. It's 23 months. I didn't realize I've been around so long. It's got a lot of content.  As I said, it was recently reported, this is from this article on digitaltrends.com, that Pinterest  drove more referral traffic last month, more referral traffic than Google, Reddit, YouTube,  LinkedIn, and MySpace combined. Who said that? That can't be right. That cannot. Maybe they mean  Google+. Even so. Even so. Yeah, more than Google+. Plus it seems like all the gifts from Google+,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  just put together in one place with nothing else of value. That's exactly what it is. This is from

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sharaholick. According to Sharaholick, Pinterest drove more referral traffic to sites in January  than Google+, Reddit, YouTube, LinkedIn, and MySpace combined. BS. On what source for that data?  Referral traffic is 3.6%. I'm not sure. Sharaholick is a sharing app, I believe. So it could just be

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  through Sharaholick. It could be some small subset. All right. I agree. Call BS. Everything. Call BS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's right. See, this is what's good. We have a panel that can actually say things like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that's ridiculous. I'm going to summon Clay Johnson. Yeah, really. I call BS. Information

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  diet. Check your sources. But here's an interesting thing. L.L. Social did a little digging on where  the money is and look at the referral links. If you pin something in Pinterest and it links to an  e-commerce site that has an affiliate program, Pinterest will modify the link to add their own  affiliate tracking code. Clever. Very. I mean, that makes them a billion dollar company. Bada bing.  Again, this is probably not illegal or wrong, but they probably should disclose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but I don't think there's anything wrong with that. And you've seen Gentle Mint, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm trying to join Gentle Mint because I'm a man. But even there, I get... So there's a picture...  I want to share shaving tips with other fellas. Yeah. Yeah. So pictures of guns and burgers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank you very much. Is it like a metrosexual community or? That's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They haven't let me in. Are you a member of Gentle Mint? No. No, I've asked for a... I just

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  learned how to watch the Super Bowl. I'm not allowed in. It's a mint of manly things. Mustache,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  pomade. Picture of a shaving mug. Weber Performer Charcoal. I don't know. Don't you... I want to  join this site. I'm sorry. Beer, barbecue, shoes and foosball. I don't know how to make a Moleskine

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  iPad case. All right. All right. It's very Pinterest-y.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Pinterest for men is what it is. That's all. And I think that's good. So, but back to the question.  So they're generating... using a service apparently called Skimlinks. They're generating revenue.  I think this is brilliant by adding affiliate links. Now, when I link to something on my website,  I try to remember my Amazon affiliate code, not so effectively, but that's a great way to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What if Twitter did that? Twitter absolutely could do that. There's nothing... I mean,  there's no reason why they can't. It's their domain. You're posting links to it. I mean,  Twitter already shortens your links using their Tico service and you can't opt out of that. So  I bet they just make a lot of money really quickly. I think that would be probably pretty

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  controversial. But is it wrong? Is there any loss to you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it takes away the advertising clutter. Right. I mean, what would be nice is if... And this is  what I think... This is a column that I thought was full of horse pucky arguing... I forget who  it was who did the column saying... It was New York Times, Nick Bilton. Said, well, where's our  money from Facebook? Because all this money they got, and it's our content. Would you prefer that  they just charge you for the service? Yeah, you're getting value out of you and your data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're choosing to post it on Pinterest, not your blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. So I think it's a way to... In fact, I'm going to steal that business model immediately  for all the local sites I work with. Well, there's this service... We'll do this for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This looks cool. I'm going to check them out. What's the name of the service?  Skimlinks. Skimlinks.  They go through all the links on your site and they add affiliate codes. Here's the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  unlock the cash in your content. And so what proportion do they give you?  Oh, I think it's your code. Oh, it's your code. Oh.  I don't know. See, I would like it if they already went and did deals with all these places.  And I didn't have to do all that. Well, they'll even add a pop-up that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  shows price comparison and stuff. I mean, this is actually pretty sophisticated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the question is, if you post a link to Pinterest with your own Amazon or whatever  affiliate ID, does Pinterest overwrite yours with theirs?  Yeah, I believe that's the case. Oh, see, that's not okay with me.  For me, I feel like it has to detect... If the user is adding their own affiliate code,  then I think that... If I'm going to post a link to Twitter recommending an app product on Amazon  and I use my Amazon code, I expect that that's going to be maintained. If there's no code,  then I wouldn't have a problem with Twitter adding their own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, there's an argument though, Gina, isn't there, that if you... And I do this myself. I use  affiliate links myself. But if you do that, there is an argument in kind of journalistic  wonky circles that says that that puts you in a conflict of interest, that you're selling the  products that you're writing about and thus you're a suspect. But Pinterest is not a journalistic  enterprise by any means. Well, not only that, but I'm saying that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And neither am I. Yeah. I've heard that. I do it too. I'm just presenting the argument.  That's a good point actually. Yeah. I mean, if I work for the New York Times or a paper where  I have to worry about those kinds of conflicts... I mean, I've just kind of developed my own sort  of personal code of conduct and that doesn't... I use affiliate links on my blog. I don't think

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that's an issue. Louis DK says in our chat room, they do not modify if there's an affiliate code,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  existing affiliate code. Oh, that's good. So if they're respectful of the user's content in that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  way, then I've got no problem with that. Do you actually make more than coffee money with it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gina? No, not too much more than coffee money, but enough.  We made, I think, $20,000 last year. Oh yeah, I'm not near that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't remember. I saw the amount. I don't know where it came from. It could be from also  search links and other... the tech guy has Google ads in the search results. It uses Google search  results. I don't know if the Twitter site does, but it's more than coffee money. But it's funny  because I don't see a conflict of interest because it's not... I mean, in the case of the  New York Times, the New York Times is allowed to do it, not their reporters. Right. So the conflict  of interest is the New York Times wants it to accrue to them, not to their reporters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the conflict of interest. And most of the time I'm mentioning my book, which...  Right, it's our own stuff that we're selling. Yeah, it's my own stuff anyway, or stuff from

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  friends that I want to... Apparently, skim words is used by Tech Narate, Cosmopolitan,  Ning, FatWallet.com. So at least they claim them as clients. So there. All right, we're going to take  a break. When we come back, I'm going to talk about my really fat phone. It's fat, baby. We also...  PHAT, fat. We'll also talk about Chrome, finally, on Android. And I'll give you a little demo  on our... This, I should give a review of this too, the hot ASUS Transformer Prime. It's all  coming up in just a moment. But first, a word from Citrix, the folks who do the great GoToMyPC,  G-O-T-O-M-Y-P-C.com. Go to my PC. It's amazing. It lets you access your office computer. Here's  a scenario. You're heading out to the airport. You got minutes to spare. You know you're going  to miss the flight. And suddenly you realize, I forgot my presentation. It's back on the office  computer. Now what do you do? What will you do? Well, I'll tell you what you could do is turn  around and miss the flight. Or if you've got an iPhone, an Android phone, an Android tablet,  you just log on to GoToMyPC on the free GoToMyPC app. Securely, you are transported like magic to  your computer, even on your Android or iPhone. And there it is, all your stuff, send and receive  email, access any network resource, copy the file that you need. It worked like on this ASUS. It  works great. And it's weird because you're using an iPhone or a tablet to look at a Windows machine  or a Mac. It's kind of eerie. I want you to try it free for 30 days and see what that eerie could  be for you. Visit GoToMyPC.com. Click the Try It Free button. Use our offer code TWIG, T-W-I-G,  not twig, twig, like a little branch off a tree. 30 days free. And then that's for the desktop app  because you got to install it on whatever computer you want to access first. By the way, you won't  need the IT department or anything like that. It's very easy to install. It takes literally a  minute to install. And then download the app for the various platforms, Mac, PC, iPad, iPhone,  Android tablets. It's really cool. Go to MyPC.com, use the offer code TWIT. These guys are great.  TWIG. TWIG! See, I did it. See, I have a feeling. There are people out there who will do exactly  the same thing. They will type in a twig. No, use a G. Twig. Thank you, Eileen. Let's see here.  So should I tell you about the file? Is this a good time to show you the note?  Sure. Yeah, show it to us. So this is going to be available February 19th this week.  AT&T will offer it. It supports AT&T's LTE network. This is the European unlocked version,  and there are some differences. The unlocked version has an Exynos processor. The AT&T version  will have a Qualcomm processor. I think they're roughly the same speed. This one has a physical  home button. The AT&T will have the capacitive buttons across the bottom. It does come with  Gingerbread 236, although they say that they will upgrade to ICS. Samsung says it's going to upgrade  all of its latest stuff like the Galaxy 2 and the Nexus is already ICS, and I think this will be  ICS. But what I like and what I'm interested in is this is a phablet. A phone that really kind of  approximates a tablet experience. In fact, do the over the shoulder because you can get a sense of  how legible and big it is. Now, I'm an old man, and so you don't need reading glasses for this.  In fact, stuff is really easy to see, to read. Let me put up the Kindle app and you'll see this  is actually in some ways the test for a phone. Would you want to read a book on it? Now, I can  make it different type sizes, of course. I'll make it bigger for you guys because you're a little  more distant. But it's totally, it's 5.3 inches. It's intermediate between a tablet and a phone,  but it's just it's big enough. I've read quite a few pages, very comfortable. It'll fit in a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  jacket pocket shortly, but will it fit in a shirt pocket? Watch. Now, this is a Scott Eves, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  everything fits in these. Oh, yeah. But no, it fits in your breast pocket, no problem.  What's different from this like than the Streak, which is also a big kind of phone, is it's so thin  and it's very light. Battery life is pretty typical. It is a bigger screen, so it's going  to use up more battery, but it's got a bigger battery, so it's kind of a push. I'm getting  roughly 10 hours pretty regularly, kind of iPad battery life out of it. But I don't talk on the  phone. And by the way, talking like this probably does look a little goofy, you know, holding it to  your head. But most lately, very rarely, before I bought this, I thought, do I ever actually hold  my phone up? Very rarely. Almost always I use earbuds, Bluetooth, or I'm in the car. You know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  if you think about it, when the first phones came out, it was goofy. Yeah, it's goofy anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Remember when phones were little? There's a guy named David Borman, used to be the bureau chief  at CNN in Washington, and now I think he's running Current. But he's a big guy. Don Iamus  used to call him Moose Butt Borman. And he was the NBC liaison producer for the site, the show we did  for MSNBC when it launched. And he, so this was 1996, 1995. And phones were really little by then.  He had a little Sony phone that was literally it was this big. It was so little that you folded out  the thing to talk into. And so this big fat guy was holding this little phone. That looked dumb.  Yeah, it looks dumb. You know, so this is I don't think that looks I have a big head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think that looks bad. It doesn't look too bad. Can you use it with one hand comfortably,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  though? Yeah, well, maybe and again, that would depend on hand size. And I have talked to women  who say, Oh, no, I wouldn't want to, I wouldn't want to use this. It's too hard for me to type on.  But I you know, I my thumb reaches all the way across. So that's not a problem. But you would  more typically do it like you would with it with a galaxy where you do the two thumb thing it has,  it comes with as all the size Samsung's do, which I really like comes with swipe, which I'm very fond

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  of. So let me write a tweet here. Yeah, she looks nice on that screen. That's a big old tweet box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Look how big this text is and everything. I like swipe. And I just think it's very easy  to use it. You know, it's it's Android. So you know, it's you're familiar with it. It's just a  bigger screen. Very snappy, though, one, the 1.4 gigahertz dual processor. So it's, it's very snappy.  swipes very quickly and easily. I like it. I'm very I've been very happy with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You get a lot of widgets on that screen, too. I'm a widget guy. Yeah, I like widgets a lot. I've

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  been missing them in iOS. This is a widget that shows the moon phase. Yeah, that's what you miss  from iOS is you can't customize the screen at all. I even have a customized, you know, I have a live

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  wallpaper that's the weather. You know, like that, like that weather widget right there on a lot of  phones that would take up the entire horizontal space of your home screen. But it doesn't on that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  you've got just this little that's widget. That's a widget. This is a battery widget.  So I see the battery life. I know I like widgets and I do. That's one thing I think that iOS doesn't  do very well is the is the I miss the widgets. Leo, I should know this, but I got a new Android

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  phone and it didn't carry in all my apps and all the stuff isn't supposed to just carry all this

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  stuff from any seems to be Gina, I don't know what your your experiences that seems to be kind of hit

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  or miss. It does seem to be hit or miss. My wife just got a new phone and she had a similar thing.  She said, aren't I supposed to get all my apps? And I was like, Yeah, you know what I do? I couldn't  remember if you have to opt into the sinking somewhere. It does sometimes it sometimes it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  doesn't a lot of the free apps won't transfer over but your paid apps. Well, I got a I got a

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  fix for this by the way. So you get app brain you all know about app brain which is a great little  app and one of the things app brain will do by the way that talk about crazy live wallpaper.  I got an aquarium on here. Let me add a blank screen so you can see it.  One of the things that app brain will do is it will it will

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that live wallpaper with all those widgets and that big screen battery last for a good five

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  minutes and I can feed the fish here. Come here fish. So I mean, I could just sit and watch this  all day. So nightmare. It is Oh God, you guys. This is so trashy. This is the equivalent of  having 18 fonts on a report and book. I love it. I'm trashy. And with that screen, actually,  I'm getting decent battle with battery life, although I did buy three batteries, batteries

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  replaceable. So are you loving it because you're you're an ICS snub? I hate ICS. I know that's why  is that part of the reason that you're you're chortling that you love this one because I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it's going to get ICS and I'll put ICS on there. I think now's the time if you're worried about ICS  to buy a phone with physical or capacitive buttons, so that you at least will have those buttons.  And then when ICS moves the menu all over the to hell and back, you'll still know there's a menu  button right at the bottom as it always has been at every Shelby. That's the only thing I've got  to be about ICS everything else I like, but that really drives me crazy. Sorry, Gina, you were

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  saying no, no, that's OK. I appreciate strong, well formed opinions. And I think I think it makes

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  sense because the menu button on my Nexus Galaxy Nexus sometimes is at the bottom,  sometimes at the top. You always have to look where's the dot dot dot and it's and it's an  ellipsis sideways ellipsis, which you can't see anyway. Yeah, but I love the apps. The apps are  much improved. I really missed the better browser. You know, so anyway, but I but so anyway to say,  to complete the thought this is actually I like a big screen and I think what's nice about Android  and real advantage Android has is the variety of choice choices. You know, Apple calls it  fragmentation. I call it choice. Mm hmm. Right. Mm hmm. True. And by everybody thinks I'm wrong  about ice cream sandwich. Fine. You know, I'm just just my opinion. It's called opinion.  It's not called fact for a reason. AppBrain. That's right. Let me finish the thought. So you  download AppBrain free app. You put it on there. You sync your phone. Now, what AppBrain does,  you have to log in your Google account. What AppBrain does is creates a list of all the apps  on any phone you have. This comes up a lot for me because as you know, I have about 80 Android  phones. So I have a list on AppBrain. I'll show you of all my all my different phones. And what  you can do is really makes this very simple. The AppBrain has a fast called the fast web installer.  And so what you do is you say, OK, let's let's go to my phones. Where's my where's my apps? Here  they are. So right now I only have two phones on here. I have the Galaxy S2 and the sense. So I  can look at all the apps. These are this is what's installed in the Galaxy S2. And I can check all  if I want or I can go through them one by one. And then I can copy. I can take these and I can  add them to a different phone list. So we'll move all these apps to that phone. And then or just the  apps you want. And then and it doesn't care if they're free or not or paid or not, whatever.  Then it just then you can you. As long as that takes about two years. Yeah, right. Exactly. No,  it doesn't take any time on a Wi-Fi. Maybe take an hour to have that phone be identical to the one  I start with. You could also use titanium if you've rooted your phone and back it up.  But this this is a very simple way to move your stuff over. Gina, you use AppBrain  because I follow you. I do. Yeah. So that's the other thing you can do is you can follow people,  see what they use on their phone and copy that to your phone. So here's Gina's list of stuff that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  she's been. I haven't been diligent about. Oh dear. Installing it. Oh, am I is it my empty?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, there they are. OK, so here's apps on her phone. So all you have to do is install in sync.  And so if I see something, oh, the conventionist, I don't know that. Let me add that. And I press  install and installs it on my phone. That's pretty sweet. That's another thing Apple won't do for you.  So there you go. And it seems to be at least you can do this manually if you didn't do it  automatically for you. You can at least do it manually. And I do and I'll give a thumbs up to  the note. I think Tony reviewed it. Tony liked it right on. He reviewed it on before you buy.  He loved it. Yeah, I think it's a I love it. Now, I didn't show you the thing that Samsung wants me  to show you. It has a stylus. Oh, which is so stupid. They call it they said, don't call it  the stylus. It's the S pen. It's a stylus. The spin spin. So there's a few things the spin will do  that are, I guess, fablet. The fablet spin. Yeah. Well, it's even worse because it's not only is it  a stylus, it's a stylus with a button. Oh, please. And you know, but the nice thing is if you lose it,  you don't really care. But anyway, so so I have never I've never pulled it out. But there are a  couple of things that we'll do. And some people might like this. At CES, they were really  highlighting the fact that you could draw with this. And they had little they called it the  galaxy note atelier and people were drawing with it. But if I press the button and double tap,  it opens up a note. This and you can do handwritten notes as well as text typing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you see a stylist, they blew it. Well, that's what Apple that's what Jobs said,  right? Yeah, that was Jobs is a famous quote, right about style, the possibility of a stylist

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  with the iPhone. So you could type, you can draw, you can erase. I mean, I get free, you know,  I am not that left or right brain. If I were maybe I'd be really excited about that. If you  press the button and you hold it does a screenshot, which it then opens up in an image editor.  And you can annotate it. So you can crop it. Let's get the right cropping tool. Let's get the  rectangle. I can crop it and say, yeah, let's just copy this part here. Okay, there we go.  Whoops. I pressed it. Cool. I'm done. There's that part I can annotate it. Let's pull up a  pen and say, look at that Wednesday, it's going to be cloudy. Wow. And then I can save it.  And I can also share it out, you know, to Twitter and all the other places.  I guess that's of some use. I you know, they have some apps that are designed for the S pen.  There's a crayon physics game that you can play with the S pen stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Something that Tony did that I thought was genius was at CES. He got an autograph. He  took a picture with celebrities. They autographed his photo on the note.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, this is this is cool. This is one of my favorite apps. This is a Zen brush app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's very beautiful. Oh, that's nice. I mean, I bought a stylus from my iPad for an art app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that's the thing when people say stylus, you know, you've you have to use a stylus,  you blew it. There's a huge market and third party styluses for the iPad. So maybe, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  maybe not. Right. And they don't work as well as the S pen. I can assure you. No, that's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The pressure sensitive and very nice. License check failure. This is the problem. OK,  I didn't mention this, but this is my big problem. This is the unlocked GSM version. I put a T-Mobile  SIM in it. It doesn't have all the right frequencies. It only does edge on T-Mobile.  And it and it often thinks I'm not online because a stupid piece of crap doesn't do  doesn't do 3G. So get the AT&T version. Or if Tony did this, he got an AT&T SIM. And with a  little hacking of the APN addresses, you can make this work with AT&T 3G. Not their LTE, but their  3G. If Verizon released this as an LTE phone, I would be so all over that. All over that. So I  think this is what's great is you got the choice. Leo, do you have the new Chrome on it?  I don't. I have it on. You want to look at it? I have it on. We just did a demo. Let's not do

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  another demo. No, not do a demo. You have it on your. I have it. But the problem is that it says  you can sync all of your tabs and I only I don't get my tabs synced. Oh, did you sign in? You have

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  to sign in. I'm signed in. I synced. And so it does all your tabs. Well, oh, it needs a pass phrase.  It's syncing now, I guess. So in theory, it's going to look just like my Chrome at home.  Which sounded great, but mine doesn't work that way. So everybody tell me where the menu is,  just out of curiosity. Where is that menu? Oh, there it is. See that? There it is. It's up there.  Nasty Leo. It's up there. There's the memo, the menu. So it hasn't yet downloaded. It looks like  it hasn't yet downloaded my bookmarks, but it will. So it looks just like Chrome. I love this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For a tablet, you want Chrome, right? Yeah, you do. Are they both WebKit, Gina?  Yes, they're both WebKit. I don't think that this doesn't support Chrome extensions yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, maybe that's OK. OK. Well, I have extensions. And look, it's identifying as mobile,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  which really kind of is annoying. The reason why I use Dolphin is for the LastPass extension.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Dolphin is great, and the LastPass extension is fantastic. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I'm to the point where I'm basically useless on the Web without it,  because it's just got passwords. But this is working. I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  this seems to do a decent job. It's just like Chrome, to be honest. Now, this is on the...  By the way, I love this. This is the Asus Transformer Prime, the newest Asus Transformer.  So it docks into this keyboard and blah, blah, blah, becomes a laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's an operating system on that is... Ice cream sandwich.  ICS. Oh, wow. Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. You can drag and drop and make folders like you do on the phone.  So yeah, if you... Yeah, there you go. How much does that one run?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  500 bucks. And if you get the docks 150. So for 650 bucks, you get a laptop. Now,  this one doesn't have 3G, but it does have Wi-Fi. I've been using the Logitech iPad keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Which is very nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Dolphin makes one. A lot of companies make these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, this one's... I feel like this one's better. It's 70 bucks. It's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just bought one of those.  Oh, you did? It's on its way, yes, being shipped. I finally... I gave in. I felt kind of dirty about  it, I'll be honest. Well, I gotta say, Steve Jobs is just... You bought a stylus for your iPad,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and you bought a keyboard. Why didn't you just buy a laptop for crying out loud?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly. No, it's true. I know. I resisted it for a long time.  But I like to write, and the iPad really is kind of this nice distraction for your environment.  It travels really nicely. It's lighter and just easier to carry around. And you can have the  choice of taking the keyboard. I don't know. I'm glad you like it though, Jeff. I'm going to try  it out. I held out for a long time and finally gave in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So this has an incognito tab, like a real Chrome, which is nice. That means you can browse and surf  completely anonymously. Let me see if in the settings... Because it is identifying itself as  a mobile browser. So if you put your passphrase in, which I thought I did, but I'll do it again,  it will sync apparently. Most of this looks pretty much the same.  I sure would like to change its identity though. Maybe it's in developer tools. Enable tilt  scrolling. Enable USB web debugging. That's going to be a popular feature.  Really? Why? No, I'm just kidding.  Oh, thank goodness it has that. Thank goodness it has that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Privacy.  Jeff, mine isn't syncing either to my desktop just yet. It might take some time. And I'm surely  signed in on both.  Right. School.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is this news? I just looked at Amazon because I was going to put that on my wish list and they  say they've just wrapped up another deal with MTV Nickelodeon Comedy Central with TV Land and VH1.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Big story. Amazon Prime. They're going right after Netflix now and in some ways,  they might have a little bit of a leg up on Netflix. If you're an Amazon Prime subscriber now,  the stuff you get for free from Amazon, streaming from Amazon is pretty good. And if you need a  Roku or what else does it? Boxee Box, Google TV obviously will do it. The Google TV crashes a lot  on me, the Amazon Prime streaming. It's using Flash and it crashes. And I have the updated  Google TV, the Logitech review, and it crashes all the time. But Netflix never crashes on me.  So Prime Instant Videos is going to be, yeah, they did a deal with Viacom. So lots more stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jersey Shore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, thank God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's some quality content. MTV.  That's at the top of my information diet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, come on. You want this. You know you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, this does look good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've actually never watched this show. Is it good?  I know Snooki. We just missed Snooki. She was at Live with Regis and Kelly. I'm sorry,  there's no Regis. Live with Kelly the day before we were there. We missed Snooki. I would have  missed Snooki. Instead I met somebody from Twilight. I don't even know who it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's Watner or something like that. I don't remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It wasn't. No, I heard it was.  Oh, you're bugging me. I heard it was Ashley Green.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was. It was the young ingenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was Alice, right?  Yes.  The one who?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Again, no idea who she was.  She and Eileen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we got it.  We got it. We got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Walked by me in the hall. I just noticed she was short, beautiful, and had a lot of makeup on.  Well, so did I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, Leah, you did great. I had so much fun.  I had to take out of watching that segment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Didn't you like that giant boombox?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did. I thought it was so great. I love that Kelly was working it.  And I loved all your faces when she accidentally paused the music.  You all sort of looked around like, hey, you broke it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You broke it.  That was fun. That was really fun. Rocky, just call me Rocky Laporte.  Let's see. Moving along. Google ScreenWise. New program. Pays you to surf using Chrome,  but you have to give up your privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it could not be more obvious what you're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think this is great. You could sign up at google.com slash landing  screen wise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One thing I wanted to know is, will it ignore an incognito for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's an interesting question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If it did that, obviously you could game it, but you wouldn't get over your web experience.  If you really wanted to go to something that you just did not want anyone to know about,  then you got paid five bucks otherwise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm guessing that the ScreenWise browser extension has an on off switch.  I could try it.  Okay. That's what happens. You install a Chrome extension.  They don't give you nothing for 25 bucks in gift cards. Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what's their... I don't even understand fully why they're doing this since they already know so  much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They want to know how everyday people use the internet. It says, what we learn from you and  others like you will help you improve Google products and services and make a better online  experience for everyone. It could be simply watching what you click.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They want to know the whole internet, your entire experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're using a company called Knowledge Networks to do this.  Every three months. Oh, this is even worse than I thought it was.  Five bucks for signing up and then five bucks every three months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Up to $25. Yeah, it's not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This extension must transmit information about the web surfing that they can't get from...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly. That's right.  You have to be 13 or older. So it's obviously...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It sounds like they're just expanding their focus groups.  It's research. Yeah, it's like a focus group.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you do it not for the money, I would hope. If that makes a difference in your bottom line.  What is it? $1.33 a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, what would be smart about it is if they fed you data back.  If they had a feedback loop to say, well, you go to these unusual sites or you do this or you do  that, that might be something I'd sign up for. But five bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Lou, it's a Big Mac when you sign up and a Big Mac a month for up to five months, up to four months.  Leo economics.  You gotta talk in the language of the people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I use a Rescue Time, which is an extension that you can install on your browser and also  an app that you run on your desktop that analyzes all your activity and breaks it up in terms of  productivity. And that's really interesting. So that's kind of what you're talking about,  Jeff is like giving you feedback on your behavior.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I turned that sucker off. It was depressing.  Oh, yeah, it was depressing.  Was it too hard to see your average?  Well, when I was doing it, it was like farm, you know, more farm, really more farm, more farmville.  Again, with the farmville, I was saying.  Sometimes you don't really want to know what you do with your time.  No, I don't.  I definitely don't.  Now, this is something we talked about on Security Now.  This morning, I believe, Google's Chrome browser is going to stop using something called  CRL or certificate revocation lists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wish we had Steve to explain this a little more.  I read this article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Explain this too. I didn't get it either.  We should just rerun the damn thing.  So the idea is it's just a broken service, to be honest with you.  The idea that it's been around for ages.  Most browsers use it.  I think Firefox also is abandoning this, but Chrome is.  So the idea is that, as you know, in order to validate the site you're on before you do a  transaction, a secure transaction, the browser checks the certificate and sees if it has a  legitimate certificate that matches the site.  So you go to Amazon.com.  Amazon presents you with a using public key cryptography.  So it's a secure certificate saying, yes, I am Amazon.com.  It's been verified by a trusted third party, et cetera, et cetera.  There is a service that browsers are supposed to query each and every time.  The online certificate status protocol saying, has it been revoked?  And that's relevant because remember the service in DigiNotar in Holland that was compromised  was a certificate authority and they'd been compromised.  So they had to revoke all those DigiNotar certificates.  So your browser would accept it until it was revoked.  So it's to check to make sure it's revoked so that if you got a certificate,  it's going to be legitimate.  The problem is the way the server works, if the server is down, for instance,  that you're checking with, it'll just say, hey, you know, I'm down, but I'm sure it's fine.  Just go ahead.  So Moxie Marlinspike, who is the best named hacker in the world,  wrote an example program called SSL strip, a tool that does that.  It changes the certificate, does a man in the middle, and then pretends that the  certification server is down.  And so the browser goes on happily.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So it's useless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's useless.  Essentially.  It's flawed.  In his blog post, Google researcher Adam Langley said, while the benefits of online  revocation checking are hard to find, the costs are clear.  Online revocation checks are slow and compromise privacy.  They add 300 milliseconds as a median time and as a mean of almost one second to page loads.  So it actually discourages people from using SSL.  And since it's unreliable, it doesn't do anything.  There's no point.  So that's basically, I believe I've encapsulated Steve's information from the show today.  If you really want to hear somebody who actually understands this, listen to security now.  We just finished it.  It'll be on the interwebs soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you for explaining that, Leo.  I think that makes sense.  Yeah.  I mean, the speed issue is kind of breaks the golden rule of Chrome, right?  A second page?  Yeah, that's way too long.  Way too long.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's see.  Google has said, we have, yes, we have the patents from Motorola.  And if you want them, we will license them at a fair price.  This is from Steven Musil writing at CNET.com.  Google apparently was about to send out a letter in the next 24 hours  saying that they're going to use FRAND, or fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms,  if you would like to license any of these patents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, don't they have to do that for their Android partners?  Unless they have that kind of fair view of having the patents,  then all of their Android manufacturers are going to have a fit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Not to mention the fact that the EU has yet to approve the merger.  And might not if they didn't say this.  Apple actually has sent a letter to the European Telecommunications Standard Institute asking  that the standards body create basic guidelines regarding patent licensing  so that there is a kind of standard, you know, suggestions for appropriate royalty rates and stuff like that.  So the Google acquisition, I guess it's approved in the US, right?  But not yet approved of Motorola.  It's not yet approved in the EU.  This might be something to make it go better.  Are you ready for Android powered smart glasses?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't want to buy a pair now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, I'm ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google glasses will have a built in heads up display.  I don't believe this for a minute.  This is from nine to five Google.  Can't possibly be true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what I thought about the car.  Yeah, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So we found out a couple of weeks ago that Apple, when it hires an engineer,  assigns them initially to a fake project and waits to hear if the engineer leaks  that information before they actually assign it to a real project.  And that process could take months.  You can actually work at Apple for months on a project that's bogus.  I'm convinced that's what this is.  Something Google made up to assign sketchy new recruits.  Hey, yeah, put them on the on the glasses project.  And then if they see a leak, they know.  I don't know.  I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's just so depressing.  Except I want it.  The most depressing thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I want it.  But it just it sounds like an April Fool's joke.  The glasses, which apparently resemble Oakley sunglasses.  That may be the thing that takes it over the edge.  Yes.  Yeah.  Said to have an integrated transparent display for one eye and a built in front facing camera.  The latter could be used for augmented reality.  So you'll be looking through one eye's normal and one eye you're looking at with a heads up display.  And you could see stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have a researcher I'm working with here at CUNY named Nick Diakopoulos,  and he got his PhD at Rutgers.  And I think it was there where his advisor was.  No, it was probably George attack.  I think it was.  I used to be the MIT labs and he showed a picture of him just yesterday where he had a little.  And he'd been doing it for years, like 20 years.  He has a little tiny display here attached to his glasses.  And he wears it all the time.  And he has a one handed cord keyboard.  That's so nerdy.  And he said you'll talk to him and suddenly you'll see him typing.  And you'll see the one eye kind of look over there to the right.  And he said it's so wonderfully weird.  He loved the guy.  I love it.  He said it was just so weird because you don't want to.  Is he typing what I'm saying?  Is he looking up something on Google to see what I'm saying is right?  What is he doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I am not mocking this.  I would buy this in a heartbeat.  I don't care if it's five grand.  I will buy it.  But I'm just thinking I don't think it exists.  So according to this story in nine to five Google,  the device will use speech and head tilting for text input and control.  So if you thought that was weird.  See people walking down the street.  Head gestures.  Right.  Nine to five Google suggests that Google Glasses product could soft launch with a pilot program  later this year, making the product available to selected number of testers.  They would follow the model of the Chromebook launch,  which was preceded by the CR 48 test unit.  I want a CR 48 Google Glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh man, Google I.O. baby.  Google I.O. we're going, right?  We're going to get our...  Without the prototypes.  They're here somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're under the seats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that would be it.  It's a bit of a wet dream.  But but but Google wants you online all the time everywhere.  Well, there you go.  I'll be on.  I'll do it at Davos.  Marissa Meyer, a mayor, bragged that Google has caused 12 million miles of turn by turn  direction.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That actually seems low.  Shouldn't it be higher?  I think it was billion.  Million seems low.  It's got to be billion.  If McDonald's has served a billion hamburgers,  right, a million, 12 million miles, it'd be like,  I'm sorry, this is a flop.  We're going to close the maps project.  It's not working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's right.  It was billion.  My number of the week has to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's his number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to off my glasses into just live streaming everything I see up into Google Maps.  So we'll just have a street view of everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They, Gina, they must give us glasses because you and I are the perfect.  You'd go to the White House.  I'd go to live with Kelly.  We would map everything.  I will promise to wear them at night in the everywhere I go from now on forever.  And you can give me five bucks a month.  I'll take it.  Maybe.  Wouldn't that be funny if that if that, oh, here's your $25.  And oh, by the way, here's the glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Crowdsourcing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We didn't mention this.  Yes, you get a Big Mac and Google Glasses.  I want them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, now has the internal inside things, right?  It has inside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I used it at a where was it was a CES.  Yeah, I was using him at CES.  Yeah.  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Marissa said that there's a pride on the team that within the Google campus,  they can put you not just in the room and not just on the table,  but at the seat you ran at the table.  I love that.  Because they use the Wi-Fi identifiers to triangulate you.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  See, these Google Glasses would really help.  Wait a minute.  There's no way.  The privacy issues alone.  Well, you're choosing to do it.  No, but you're choosing to look at somebody who's not choosing to do it.  There's a camera in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're just doing your phone.  Oh, here we go again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Get used to it.  I give it.  It doesn't bother me in the least, but I just think that the  there's no way this is a real story because.  There's no privacy in public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you could wear it in the bedroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You could wear it anywhere.  Oh, that's a different matter.  Yes.  You could wear it everywhere.  You go in a store.  You could wear it in the sauna.  You can't.  I mean, if I go into a Las Vegas casino with a camera, they will bodily,  they tried to last year throw me out.  If I go into many stores with a cell phone and try to take pictures of the products,  they have signs now in stores that say you may not take pictures in this store.  So if I go in with glasses that have a Google logo on them and a camera.  I think this has to be bogus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I'm envisioning right now, because I'm told the show really is watched at Google,  but there's a whole bunch of snickering engineers at Google.  We got it.  We got it.  We planted that.  We got them.  Yeah.  They're really talking about it.  Then watch out in a month.  They'll be out and we'll say, oh, hey, cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wouldn't be surprised if there's some it may, you know, it could be somebody's 20%.  Or I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if there is such a thing inside Google.  But I do think.  That there's no way because of the privacy issues alone that they really, I mean,  people are scared of Google, a cadre of 100,000 people walking around with cameras  on their heads.  They send them images back to Google.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the camera is the piece that goes too far.  What if it didn't have a camera?  What if it just then you don't have augmented reality?  No, you don't have a reality, but you can have maps and you can have all kinds of things.  Oh, I see the camera.  There's a camera.  Wait, do you need the camera to have augmented reality?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Apparently they look like the Oakley Thumps, according.  Yeah. Did you see the picture?  Oh, no, I didn't.  I've had these.  I actually had these.  I put them on Regis.  He loved them.  Those are a few years old.  OK.  The heads up display is only for one eye and on the side.  This is just like with MIT guy.  It's not transparent nor does it have dual 3D configurations.  That's fine.  If it had 3D, I'd throw up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, seriously.  Headache forever.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, by the way, all of the technologies to do this completely exist.  This is this is not like innovative.  And getting it to a reasonable price might be challenging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What does it cost to have a...  You're not buying glass.  You're buying a little projector onto something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, cameras are cheap.  This, I mean, everything's cheap.  You know, maybe it isn't that expensive.  Remember at Blue Web, there was that guy wandering around,  the Swiss guy wandering around and he was wearing the Motorola.  It had Android, I think.  Yeah.  And he had a little ocular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And he was shooting video with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He was shooting video and walking around.  What is that sound?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a car alarm outside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey, buddy, your car's being stolen.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right. That took care of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I hope this is real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And obviously the camera doesn't have to record and upstream,  you know, upload its recordings.  It doesn't even have to be there.  I mean, you can get a lot of information just from GPS.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I'm saying you can make it so that it's not an invasion of privacy,  but people are still going to freak out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right?  Yeah.  Right. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not saying it's bad.  Don't get me wrong.  I want one.  And Google, if you're listening,  Gina and I were perfect.  Hey, hey, hey.  Okay, you two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  New York City, center of the universe.  I'll report it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know what I really want?  And this was something that they took out of Google Goggles,  but Eric said they have it, is the facial recognition.  Yeah, facial recognition.  So if I walk up, because this happens to me,  I have all the time I walk up to somebody.  I know I know them.  I know I do who they are.  That's Jeff Jarvis.  It's especially bad for you because you may not know them.  I know so many people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  I developed this terrible affectation.  I have many, but this one I developed when I was a columnist in San Francisco,  and my face ended up on the news boxes and the trucks.  And so-  Everybody knew you.  If you say hi to someone, that is an ellipsis that assumes the name.  Hi, Leo.  Right.  So I couldn't say hi anymore.  I started saying, howdy.  Because nobody says howdy, Leo.  They just say howdy.  Exactly.  Howdy.  That was enough.  And so to this day, I say howdy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's not- everybody in California says howdy.  That's not an affectation.  Really?  I remember that when I first came here.  I thought that was so strange.  Maybe you started it.  Maybe it was Jeff.  I ran into Jeff one day.  Me in there.  So is that true if you say howdy, you don't have to say that person's name?  I don't think so.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Huh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or you could do like Paul Harvey say, hello, American.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I'm not doing that in the diverse city of New York.  I'm going to get in trouble big time.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.  Greenpeace says the Google is the least unecological.  This Greenpeace list always seems to me to be a little bit political.  I like Wired's headline.  Greenpeace hates big tech but wants to kill Google the least.  There's a list of- this is- oh, is it an app?  Is this an app?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a 50 page report.  Everything's an app now.  Jesus, you want to do a shopping list, they make it into an app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a leaderboard.  They call it the Coolit leaderboard of tech companies.  Blue is solutions.  Green is energy impact.  Yellow is advocacy.  Google has lots of solutions.  A little impact.  They actually do have a lot of impact.  Anybody like Facebook or Google that has server farms has a huge impact.  But they score 53 on the leaderboard.  I don't know what that even means.  Is that good or bad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is Apple not on the list?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, because Greenpeace hates Apple, right?  No, I don't see Apple on this list.  Maybe Apple made it to-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is this just an energy- is this maybe just an energy list versus-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, Apple's got a server farm in North Carolina.  They use some energy.  They got the cloud.  Facebook launched that completely Oregon data center.  It's completely solar and so forth.  The report dings Google for killing its solar energy program.  Remember that?  Larry was one of the things Larry killed in November.  And the renewable energy stuff that they were doing.  They were doing some really cool stuff.  We did a Green Tech somewhere.  If you look on the Twitch site, the Green Tech piece that we did on Google,  where we interviewed them, we took a look at all-  like they have electric cars, all that stuff.  It was really interesting.  It's kind of sad that they're not doing it anymore.  Dell and HP saw their marks drop, but the biggest loser is Apple,  which like Facebook is once again omitted from the list.  Because they've seen- Greenpeace says we've seen no effort from Apple to lead, unlike Google.  Oh, I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is a list of people-  Of companies that are doing it well.  Right.  And that's why Apple is not on it.  Apple has a lot of reach into a very loyal fan base,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  but we don't see them leading environmental advocacy efforts.  Greenpeace has always- has hated Apple for years.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is Facebook, according to CNET, there's an article.  This is an- I thought this was kind of an interesting example.  This one.  Is Facebook accurately counting its daily active users?  They claim 850 million users, active users.  Certainly this is relevant if they're going public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I cited this.  This was a-  Oh, this is-  An Andrew Ross Sorkin column.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is a New York Times column.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was based on an Andrew Ross Sorkin column.  Andrew is very, very bright.  What I said on Twitter is if you read this story from the end,  you say, why?  How smart of Facebook?  Everyone should be doing this.  Because what they're doing is they're distributing themselves around the net.  And if you do- the beginning is they count as an active user,  somebody who hits like in a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They say 485 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  So they didn't go to the site they hit like.  Okay.  I get it.  But, Betty points out, but they did interact with Facebook,  and Facebook got valuable data about that person  and about that content out of that person.  Gee, shouldn't we all be doing that in media?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess the point is they didn't see an ad on Facebook.  So you can't count that as a visitor to Facebook's site.  They don't see an ad on Facebook mobile either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No.  I think that's fair.  They say these people are using Facebook.  They're engaged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's absolutely fair.  And I think that it's an old comscore media view of the world  to say that you have to go to the site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, that's where Facebook is very innovative.  They're putting Facebook, splashing Facebook on everybody.  Peanut butter strategy.  Spreadable, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Spreadable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Totally agree.  But would you say, but if someone's asserted  that visiting a website that has Google Analytics,  JavaScript dropped into the HTML is interacting with Google  just by visiting the site.  And I wouldn't agree with that.  And I think that, I mean, I agree that clicking a like button  is interaction with Facebook.  It's an action.  You're associating with a brand.  You're signed into Facebook.  You're sending them data.  But you're also sending Google data  when you visit a site that has Google Analytics installed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  The difference is that one case you're doing it passively,  one case you're doing it actively.  Exactly.  So when they used the word active,  they did have the description in there.  I mean, Andrew didn't come up with any scandal.  And again, at the end, he came back around and said,  well, this is smart stuff.  And this is really good.  But I think it was an effort to kind of gine up scandal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The headline is bogus.  In December, Nielsen Company, which tracks usage on the internet,  counted 153 million unique users on the Facebook website for the month.  Although Facebook says it had 161 million active users.  That's a small difference that you see all the time and counting.  That's US, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The New York Times has an odd...  The Sunday New York Times particularly.  Last week, I tweeted out five links  that were kind of anti-internet, anti-progress stuff.  It's getting to be a drum beat, isn't it?  Yeah, it's getting to be a drum beat.  It really, really is.  I wrote a piece this morning on the blog,  really boring, wonky, we won't go there.  But Dick Toefel, who's general manager of ProPublica,  former assistant managing editor, assistant publisher of the Wall Street Journal,  wrote a piece arguing that the original sin of newspapers was that we didn't charge.  And I've been in that argument a million times.  But the interesting thing he said in there that I then hooked onto  was he said that there was a cultural issue in his view,  and I don't agree with this, that was East Coast versus West Coast.  Which is another way to say the sopupipa argument  of Northern California, Southern California,  which is tech versus IP, content versus platform,  disruptive versus disruptor.  And there's this kind of argument now that we, the techies,  are the siren call leading people down the wrong road,  because we lead them away from their past and where they do things.  And so yeah, I think there is almost a drum beat going on.  And that's what the privacy stuff and all this stuff is,  the nerds got their revenge, and now the  the disruptive are trying to get their revenge too.  Back on us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Moving on, we got a couple more things and we're going to get your tooltip and pick of the week.  We're running out of time, so let me jump these in here.  I figured you'd have something to say about this, Jeff Jarvis.  There's a great, there's a guy on Sky News on Twitter,  it's at field producer, right?  Who's been doing breaking news as a field producer on Sky News,  and it's not all Sky News, he's just like,  he's just like a one man breaking news,  it's like Andrew Carvin, he's like a one man breaking news engine on Twitter.  Apparently Sky News has told their reporters that you cannot retweet rival journalists  or other publications, you cannot retweet the public,  you can only retweet other Sky News reporters,  you cannot retweet about subjects that aren't on your beat,  and you may not have personal tweets in your quote professional accounts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Numb nuts.  Yeah, talk about clueless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely, it's amazing, there should be a collection of  numb nutty social policies that companies have, this one does kind of beat the arm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Especially when you have such a great case study with this guy  who's got, I don't know how many Twitter followers he has,  and in the long run it redounds to the benefit of Sky News, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but they don't get it, it's the same as Andy Carvin, Anthony DeRosa at Reuters is really  very very good as well, and if they want to give up that, it's the same argument before as don't  link out, stupidest argument made in media, media get that all the time, I have a piece coming out  in The Guardian on Monday arguing that the biggest mistake we made, the original sin,  is that we think we're in the content business, we think we make content.  What business are we in?  We're in the relationship business.  Facebook understands that content is a tool to get you to generate information by yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I should be nicer to people then.  I've been blowing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Leo, you are most definitely the relationship, everybody is here because they love you.  No, it's true.  And relationships with each other, right chat room?  Yeah, I love you guys, you guys are beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Paul McCartney doesn't like you guys, he is pulling tracks from Spotify and Mog and  all of those streaming services, RDO, Rhapsody, so has Coldplay, Tom Waits, even Adele, what?  McCartney apparently did this in 2010 from Spotify.  This is not the Beatles music, this is the guy who used to be with the Beatles whose music  isn't really that good.  I was on a Delta flight, this was really creepy, I was on a Delta flight and they were blaring  music into the cabin.  You know how you feel like they're trying to calm you as you get on the plane by blaring  music into the cabin and it was the weirdest channel I ever heard, it must have been a  cover channel because they had all these well-known songs by people not the original artist.  So they had silly love songs, Paul McCartney's silly love songs by somebody who wasn't Paul  McCartney.  I mean there are just tons.  Why bother?  Why bother?  It's not a good song.  I'm sure it had to do with rights.  I'm sure it had to do with rights.  Isn't that what music is going back?  Yeah, I guess music did that, right?  But this wasn't instrumental, this was like full production numbers of well-known songs  but by somebody else.  Is music still live?  There was a Coldplay song, maybe it's these guys.  Milo Zyloto, the latest Coldplay album will not be on, they said wouldn't be on Rhapsody,  it is now.  So I think people do this and they regret it.  McCartney is streaming his upcoming concert on iTunes.  And he, but he's controlling that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But he controls that.  By the way, I just looked at Rupert Murdoch's Twitter account.  What's the old guy up to?  And he said about this time this was happening, I have nothing to do with Sky News.  Oh, wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Doesn't he own 40% of Sky News?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh yeah.  Wrong.  It is, I have nothing to do with Sky News.  I think Brian Hogg has to do a puppet Rupert Murdoch and just say his tweets.  Great game, great for New York.  Feel a little sorry for my Boston friends though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's a great idea doing dramatic readings of Rupert's tweets.  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You have to do it.  Does he still have an Australian accent or is that because of the schedule?  Yeah, he does.  The Rupert doll.  The Rupert.  Golden Brown deserves much more credit on your, I can't do it, I won't do it.  Moving along, a plug for Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  So I'm doing an Economist debate on the value of sharing.  If you go to economist.com slash debate and my...  Do they do this a lot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is a great idea.  They do this every week.  They do this every week.  You and Andrew Keene, huh?  Oh, you're taking on Keene.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Keene is having fun going off and trying to stack the deck.  So I want to stack, I don't care about the vote, but do me a favor.  All of Twig, go there and vote.  Prove your power.  Prove Andrew Keene for the anti-social twit that he is.  He's a friend too.  But go just go vote.  I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the proposition is the House believes that society benefits  when we share personal information online.  Jeff is of course supporting that.  Andrew Keene says, now it's a terrible thing.  I like Andrew.  He's a funny guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Andrew's a nice guy.  He's a friend, but he's playing the game.  He's trying to game it.  So what I want to do is Twig, go game it, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He wrote the Cult of the Amateur and he's kind of anti...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  His new book is Digital Vertigo.  Give you a plug, Andrew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, wait a minute.  By the way, 65% on Andrew's side and only 35% for Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's why I'm saying because he's playing the game.  He's going all over telling people to vote on it on Twitter or something.  Okay, fine.  Let's play the game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  It's not fair to use social networking to win a debate saying social networking sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Bingo.  Somebody pointed that out to him on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can't use Twitter, Andrew, or Facebook.  No.  You know, you've got...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Krister Barat left a comment on my post on Google Plus and then he came back and said,  well, you can't have a balanced discussion about social networking on a social network.  And somebody else said, well, where are you going to have it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You guys like him?  You're friends with him?  You feel like he's...  He's a character.  I don't know him very well, but I feel like his work is truly destructive.  And exactly kind of what we're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's polemical for the sake of being polemical.  He goes overboard for the sake of it.  In the great British tradition.  Yeah, he does all that stuff.  He loves to have enemies.  He does all that stuff.  He's not like that other person with the accent I'm not going to talk about.  Christopher Hitchens?  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He does remind me a little bit of Andrew Sullivan or Christopher Hitchens where they're...  They're polemicists.  They're polemicists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But not as smooth.  I mean, Sullivan and Hitchens are very, very smooth.  They're brilliant.  Andrew is blunt.  Yeah.  Very blunt.  No, Andrew makes enemies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We had him...  We actually had him on a tweet.  And he was actually...  I thought he was spectacular.  And the chat room hated him so much.  He's begged to come back and I said, I just can't because it's just...  We were going to have...  I mean, people with pitchforks and torches were going to be at the door going,  We want him.  Oh my God.  It was...  Remember that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So chat room, all the more reason to show him what's what.  Economist.com debate.  I don't give a damn about the vote personally, but let's show Andrew the power of Twig.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I already told Andrew he can't come back on it.  So...  It's already up 41%.  And it's nothing personal.  He lives...  He lives literally...  He lives in Santa Rosa.  He lives like just up the block.  And at the time when I brought him in, I thought I love him.  I think he's a great...  He's fun.  He's kind of entertaining in that British way.  And I thought he'd be great.  Maybe we'll do a show with him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is great.  Before our very eyes, the vote's changing.  It's 43% yes now.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Twit Army attack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We are Twit.  God bless you all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's just bring down the economist site.  That's what we want to do.  Yeah, that's what we want to do.  Oh, don't tempt me.  Thank you for the twit.  Thank you for the plug.  Please.  You can't let Andrew Kane win this one.  Boxxy is clashing with cable companies over QAM.  Clear QAM versus encrypted QAM.  Boxxybox, which is a really, I think, a really neat device.  Boxxy stopped doing software.  They're focusing on the box.  And now they have a live TV dongle.  But Time Warner and Comcast and so forth are upset.  They encrypt basic cable programming  even though it's against FCC rules.  It's against the rules.  It always pisses me off.  And you know when they did this?  They did this when broadcast went from analog to digital  and they kind of used it as a little diversion.  Oh, well, we have to go digital too.  Existing regulation, according to this article on GigaOM,  is not, says you cannot encrypt basic cable.  So FCC is having a hearing.  Boxxy has filed multiple letters with the commission,  met with staff last week.  The cable, could they write?  This is Boxxy.  And I love Boxxy.  The cable company's real motivation to prevent you  from being able to connect the cable from the wall  directly to your TV or Boxxy box.  They want you to rent that set-top box  for an extra $5 to $15 a month.  And by the way, the Boxxy box won't work with a set-top box.  So then you have to get the cable company's DVR.  The cable companies are losing subscribers every quarter.  If they want to reverse that trend,  they should look into building better products.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No.  Reducing prices.  Oh, whoa.  Let's not be communist.  And improving customer service.  Not going to the government asking for rule changes.  I agree.  Public knowledge supports them.  Consumer electronics association supports them.  It's not a surprise.  I think this battle is going to get really pitched,  heated, and ugly in the next few years.  Because the cable companies do not want to be data providers.  And frankly, that's their future.  They want to sell you premium content.  They don't want you to be using a Roku box,  or a Boxxy box, or a Google TV.  It's not in their interest.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's take a break.  When we come back, we will get your tip, Gina, your number,  Jeff, and I have a tool you're going to love in just a bit.  But first, let's talk about a very important tool  for anybody using Mac or Windows.  It's a backup tool called Carbonite, C-A-R-B-O-N-I-T-E.com.  I'm going to be having dinner next week with Carbonite CEO  David Friend, who is a good friend.  He's actually an interesting fellow.  He was straight out of MIT.  He founded a synthesizer company you might remember called ARP.  Everybody in that day.  It was like the 70s, early 80s.  Everybody used ARP synthesizers.  It was like it.  Made a packet of money, retired, and then had a daughter in college,  as I do.  And she called him crying one day saying, I lost my term paper.  My computer crashed.  And he thought, there's got to be a better way.  I'm a geek.  I could figure out a better way.  He created Carbonite.  The whole idea, online cloud storage.  This was years ago.  This was before anybody was doing this.  And make it affordable.  Make it easy to use.  Anybody with a Mac or PC for less than $5 a month,  you put Carbonite in your system.  Whenever you're online, your data is backed up automatically,  continuously, without your thinking about it.  You can get to it any time.  It is cloud stored.  So you log onto your Carbonite account on any computer,  your smartphone or tablet, all the platforms, even BlackBerry.  And there's your stuff.  There's your data.  So you always know it's there.  If the worst happens, restore is very simple.  It's a great way to upgrade computers, for instance.  Just move your Carbonite account to the new computer, restore,  and you're good to go.  $59 a year per computer.  They also have multi-computer systems programs,  and they have a plan for people who want to do external drives.  No matter what, go to the website.  Do the free trial.  You don't need a credit card.  You just need the word TWIG as your offer code.  And if you decide to buy, use TWIG again,  because you'll get 14 months for the price of 12.  That's a good deal.  Of course, when my daughter went to college to go full circle,  she had Carbonite on that laptop.  You better believe it.  She still does.  You got to back it up to get it back.  So do it right with Carbonite.  Use the offer code TWIG.  Gina Trapani, your tip of the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tip of the week is for Android Google Voice users.  The new update to the Google Voice app supports offline texting.  I love this because I live in Google Voice,  and this happens to me all the time.  I'll be on a plane.  The plane will land.  We're on the jetway kind of going.  You can turn on your electronic devices.  I turn it on.  It doesn't establish a data connection yet.  So there I am texting my wife.  Hey, I'm here.  I've just landed.  Can't send the text.  This new update, which I actually haven't gotten yet.  They just announced this today.  So I haven't gotten the update yet.  But the new update to the app will let you send a text while you're offline.  And then once you do establish the data connection,  it'll send it out, just like email.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it's not up to the messaging app update.  It's an update to the Voice app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's an update to the Google Voice app.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So if I launch Google Voice, like voice.google.com, not this talking.  Right, right.  Google Voice.  Right, right, right.  Yeah, like voice.google.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Phone thing.  Yeah.  So yeah, that's good.  I do that all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now if they had scheduling texts, that would be cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and I really want MMS.  Google Voice engineers, MMS, please.  I want to be able to send pictures to Google Voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's cool.  So you're on the runway.  You're not got a connection, but you can send a text.  And it'll send it as soon as you do actually get online.  Exactly.  Especially when you have to go through customs and they won't let you do anything.  Right.  That'd be very handy with this note, which isn't online  because of the T-Mobile thing.  Your number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right.  Well, thank you, thank you, Gina, Gina, Gina, Gina.  You saved me.  To the rescue.  So nicely, so generously just put in a suggested number there.  That's our Gina.  That's why we love her.  41% of Super Bowl ad searches were mobile according to Google.  And as I look at this, who searches on ads?  Well, the numbers are substantial.  A lot of people searched on Madonna and Clint Eastwood and Acura and David Beckham,  you know, and underwear, I guess, and so on.  Or lack of clothes.  They said that the Super Bowl ad searches rose 200% on desktop, 970% on tablets,  and 2700% on smartphones.  Wow.  Now we don't have a number there for fablets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm going to call it a phone.  I think if it has a phone thing, it'll be a phone.  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think you've invented this.  It's a fablet.  I want to do one more number because I love you.  I love you, chat room.  I love you, Twit.  The number on the debate is now up to 59% agreeing with my side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Apparently, Andrew doesn't really have the clout he seems to have.  It's just nobody knew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is a benefit of sharing online.  Yeah.  Next chapter of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow.  Actually, he could argue, well, you did it with broadcasting.  Try it with your social networks.  Now, I guess I voted, so I don't get to vote anymore.  But it's economist.com slash debate slash day slash view slash 806.  Slash debate will give you the whole thing.  Very good.  You're going to win this one.  But keep voting.  You can vote many, many times.  They apparently don't care.  59 to 41.  Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which all says what BS these votes are.  Well, it means he only had five votes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly.  You can change it, but they do keep track of your log in.  So use the incognito window to vote.  Oh, I shouldn't have said that.  Wow.  I am a bad, bad man.  So this is something that actually we just learned about.  Another thing from Security Now earlier today.  Steve Gibson, our guru on security,  does a great show for hardcore geeks.  He is a big fan of turning off scripting.  Scripting is the number one way you will get infected  by malware from going to a website.  Websites often are infected themselves, even benign websites,  by malware kits that run as hundreds of different attacks  on your system looking for vulnerabilities.  The whole thing is mitigated by just turning off scripting  or using an extension.  Now, on Firefox, we've been talking about NoScript for a long time.  It's an amazing extension.  There is, in some ways, an even better one available for Chrome.  This is called Script No.  And if you want to know more about it, do listen to Security Now.  But this is the tool of the week.  Once you add it to Chrome, when you go to a site,  there's a little box.  You see it's red right now.  I can click on it, and it will tell me what scripts,  what things, what APIs are running.  And then I can decide if I want to allow them this once,  trust this site forever, block it, distrust the site forever,  or just temporarily allow it.  In this case, I'm going to trust chrome.google.com.  So that allows me to use all the scripts on the site.  This is really interesting because it gives you a lot of information  about what the site's up to.  There's a lot of options.  It's actually very powerful.  If you are Andrew Keene, you might like the—  There's a little social button that says,  block all widgets, all social.  No, none of that.  None of that in here.  Where is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Get off my internet, kids.  Get off my lawn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Anti-social mode.  See, there it is right there.  Always remove social widgets and buttons, even if white list.  You just don't have them.  I don't want them.  They're no good to me.  So this is actually a great security extension  that is fairly benign.  Sometimes these things can really get in your way,  but I like this one a lot.  Script no.  Just Google it because it's a very long URL.  Script no, if you're using Chrome.  And by the way, they're telling me that the economist.com  has become a very slow website.  What is happening?  We're being attacked.  We're being DDoSed from everybody all around the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's now gone reverse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, Andrew's going, what the hell happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What happened?  Wow, 6436.  What happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was winning.  Sorry, Andrew.  You are the biggest loser.  Thank you, everybody, for being here.  We do this show at 1 o'clock Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern.  That's 2100UTC at twit.tv.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Great show.  Thank you.  Thank you for having me.  Great show as usual.  And I'll be back in an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gina is going to be our guest.  Yeah, everybody.  Everybody come back and watch Gina on Triangulation.  Jeff's already done it.  So it's Gina's turn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's funny because we see you guys every week  and I forget that we have some of the most interesting people,  the kind of people we look for for Triangulation, are our hosts.  So for crying out loud, we should have had you on ages ago.  So I'll talk to you in an hour.  4 p.m. Pacific, 7 p.m. Eastern for Triangulation with Tom Merritt and Gina Trapani.  Jeff Jarvis is at buzzmachine.com and his new book, Public Parts,  is a must read for anybody who's curious about public life, including Andrew Keene.  Thank you, Jeff.  Thank you, Gina.  Thank you all for being here.  We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.  We'll get rid of that music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if you guys have suggestions, Jeff and Gina, and the kind of music too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think I'm going to ask George Woods to write.  Let's start right here.  I've got the world's largest phone in my hands and I love it except...  You have the new one.  Oh, it's the watch for the clock.  Galaxy Note.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, and I loves it.  I love me some...  Except I was stupid.  I should have asked our talented All About Android team before I bought it.  It doesn't work with T-Mobile fully.  It's Edge only.  And I'm offline, which is very frustrating.  But I love it.  And if you know what?  If Horizon came out with an LTE of this, I would buy it so fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How was it different from the...  What was the Dell one?  The Dell...  The Streak.  Streak was thick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This doesn't feel big because it's like this thin.  Is the screen the same size as the Streak?  Yeah.  Well, actually it's 5'3".  How big was the Streak?  It was 5'5".  5'5".  Yeah, so it's a little bigger.  And it's 1280 by 800.  So it's actually like a computer-sized screen.  Is it Ice Cream Sandwich?  It is not, but I don't mind that.  I know you don't.  All right.  I just said that to get you to get a wrap.  It has a physical button.  Look at this.  It's got a physical home button just like the iPhone.  Look at that.  I mean, not merely capacitance.  It's got capacitance and physical.  Although, like all the European Android phones,  for some reason it does not have a search button.  And I really like pressing and holding the search button.  You can double-click this button,  but then Vlingo launches because that's Samsung's touchwiz.  Yeah.  I almost don't.  Play Bob Dylan.  It's better than Siri, by the way.  You can open apps.  You could do a lot of stuff with it.  It's really a lot better than Siri.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but that's Samsung only or is that...

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Come gather around for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now, that's impressive.  I mean, is that not like freaking awesome?  And that's Samsung only?  No.  Vlingo you can download on any...  Oh, Vlingo.  ...Android.  I mean, that is spectacular to be able to do that  or say something like...  Oops, I got double-tap.  I forgot.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What would you like to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Open calculator.  Siri can't do this.  So to be able to open apps is great.  Siri can't do that.  No.  Will it do call home?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oddly large though, I have to tell you.  Like looking at you holding it, it looks...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've got a Hershey bar that I can talk into.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A Hershey bar.  I think it might be wider than a Hershey bar.  It's fat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a little stout.  All right, let's do the show.  We'll talk more about it in a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's nice when you're reading on it, but...  I loves it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Gina, we have old eyes, you see.  We're old.  And I have a massive head, so it's okay.
