Transcript:  Hi, it's Jeff. Leo is not here. He's on vacation. He's not kidnapped. The show still went on  without him and we didn't get into fights about moral panic or Gutenberg or anything.  And Stacey and I had a great time talking about Stacey's house and her bad memory, about  fleeting fleets and about Facebook still confusing us. All of that is coming up next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's time for This Week in Google. I know what you're saying right now. Oh no, where's Leo?  It's going to be two hours of Gutenberg and moral panic. Oh no, no, no. But fear not. I'm not alone.  I'm here with the two best people we could be here with. Ant Pruitt, the amazing, wonderful  moral panic king. Ant Pruitt is here. Hello, Mr. Ant. How are you?  Hello, Mr. Jarvis. I'm unbelievable. How about you, sir?  Good. Ant has worked like crazy. He's not only on the show, he's been producing the show. He's  been putting stuff on the rundown. He's putting coal in the burners to keep the power on. Ant's  doing everything alongside Jammer B behind the board. And of course, we have Stacey Higginbotham.  We have Stacey Higginbotham. Hello, and I am doing something.  You're being Stacey. That's all we need you to be is a brilliant Stacey. Leo is in Hawaii, damn him,  having a good time and drinking drinks with parasols in them and such. But he'll be back  in a week. It is a hard life. Somebody's got to do it. So we're here on our own and I'm the  putative host so you can blame me for everything that goes wrong. And I'll blame Jammer B or Ant  or somebody. But here we have a packed rundown. We'll have a lot of fun. And so here we go.  So the first thing I figured I wanted to talk about was I want to hear your reactions,  first Ant then Stacey, to Richard Branson in space. What did you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think I'm one of the people that really did not care. But I think that's the fault of the  media as to why I didn't care about this because I think it was Sunday when this all went down,  right? I think it was Sunday. But you go to Twitter and everything is talking about Branson  goes to space and billionaires beats this other billionaire and goes into space,  yada, yada, yada, yada. And I'm just thinking, you know what, normal folks like myself, we really  don't care that these people that have all of this extra disposable income, granted they earned it,  sure. But we don't care about them flying into space and coming back. It's just, I didn't care  for it at all. But what they failed to point out, at least a lot of the media failed to point out is  this is stuff that could be used for research, far as travel, because who knows down the road,  it may be less expensive and faster to go places over through the air and whatnot. But none of that  was even brought up. It was all about who got there first and how do they do it. And it just  seemed like a bunch of, and we got cash and we can do this and you can't, you know, and  if they want to go to Mars, I'm to the point, hey, have at it, go leave me back here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stacey, what did you think as you were watching? Did you watch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't watch. But the whole time, I'm very excited about space. I'm a huge space nerd,  I wanted to be an astronaut. I went to NASA as a kid a couple times because I lived in Houston.  So I am like, this content should be speaking to me. But I will say reducing  what should be a team effort. Like you just don't go to space on your own. You go to space with a  team of like hundreds of people working behind you. Right? So this idea of these people,  it felt super self aggrandizing. It didn't feel like, I don't know if the media just didn't report  the levels of research, but I'm kind of like, I mean, I get very excited about the shuttle  launches, the dragon, you know, the reuse of a shuttle landing back, all of that's really awesome  because it feels like we're forwarding technology. But when you put people in space, that feels a bit  like a vanity project, kind of like I wasn't super excited when Elon Musk stuck a car up in space. I'm  like, buddy, what? No, space should be pure engineering. We're already excited. It's like  poetry. It's engineering prowess. And what we're doing is turning it into this like  big swinging, I can't say the word complex. And I don't like it.  Big swinging Richard. Yes.  Yeah. Big swinging Richard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Ms. Stacey, what I dig about the stuff that SpaceX was doing was the engineering part of it.  I'm sure he sent the car up into the heavens and whatnot, but I always look forward to  those boosters coming back and them figuring out from an engineering standpoint, how to  properly land those things. That stuff amazes me because-  It changes the economics of going to space.  I mean, there's people that are smart enough to figure that stuff out, but yet you go and ask  somebody on D street in Petaluma to parallel park and they can't pull it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As somebody said, we should give credit to Elon Musk for not putting himself in space.  Right. Yeah. He did put his car in space.  He was hanging out in Richard Branson's kitchen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's got to go on.  He's going to go on with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was, and I'm the guy here who tends to say, oh, innovation and capitalism and I was offended.  I was just outright offended. I thought it was such a display of wealth for wealth's sake.  I think you raise a really good point, Ant, that there are things to be learned,  but nobody emphasized that. Nobody said this is how we're going to benefit from people.  They throw that in there, but they wouldn't really give examples of how.  It was mine's faster than yours and mine is bigger than yours and they are phallic symbols.  They just are. Sorry. They just are.  It is what it is.  It is what it is. He didn't really get to space. It's 50 miles. As somebody said, it was a drunken  pilot who just went a little too high. And Bezos is now saying he's going to go higher.  And then this ostentatious thing to me in the end was putting on the wings and calling himself an  astronaut. I'm an astronaut now. A lot of people worked really hard and studied really hard and  risked their lives and some lost their lives to be astronauts. And yeah, I was, I surprised myself  with my visceral reaction to it. I think we have to keep in mind what you said, Ant, which is that  we can learn things, which goes what Stacey says here, which is that it can serve the higher  purpose, but there was no engineering to that discussion, to the coverage. Yeah.  None.  Well, big swing and Branson.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  There we go.  Show title.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You'll decide, Mr. Producer. You'll decide.  Yeah. So that was that. Meanwhile, Sundar Pichai was interviewed by the BBC. I'm sure you didn't,  I actually listened to the whole thing. We have a little bit of video here. If John wants to go  to it where the guy has Sundar play cricket, which is kind of a nice moment. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You wanted to be a cricket player when you grew up. And that makes two of us. So I have brought  my lucky charm. This is my talisman, my special thing, which I had on my desk when I was a newspaper  editor. And if you have time, I've always wanted to bowl with the boss of Google or googly. So we  could just have a little knock somewhere around here if you've got time. Why not? Let's do it.  I'm glad I caught that ball.  I don't want to cause you any problems by taking your teeth out.  Knock a quick 10 billion off the share price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This shows more teamwork than the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google search on this.  He can bat.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is adorable.  All right.  I mean, it's basically boys playing sports.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay. So Pachai is human.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  He's a nice man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's a good guy. He's a good guy. So I listened to the interview and it struck me. It's like BBC  interviews. They try to be tough and they try to be confrontive. And all it is is he went back to  the wifi sniffing. Did you really care about privacy? If your company was wifi sniffing,  of course that was before you were in charge. So you really weren't responsible for it. So I'm  not sure why I asked. I had nothing else to throw at you. So he throws things at him that we all  know. We all see. And it was disappointing. He seems like a good interviewer. He seems like a  very smart guy and that's all fine. He has a new show on BBC. That's all fine. But I'll throw a  question to both of you. I don't have an answer myself to this question. If you had the chance  to spend an hour with Sundar Pachai, what would you want to know from him?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would like to know his vision of where he thinks technology is going. So I'm super nerdy. So I'd be  like, hey, what kind of architecture, what kind of world are we building? If you think about  the form of computing that we have today with massive data centers, with disposable consumer  devices, with amalgamations of data, if you were reinventing that, what would you want it to look  like? And then how can we get there from where we're at? So I would try to be both visionary  and practical because I mean, I feel like every CEO has to think that way anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And what would you ask?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Two things. First, what are you going to do about just the whole focus of Alphabet and Google?  Because I think I've mentioned this before, but everything seems to be so scattered from a product  standpoint, whether it's something going on with Android, whether there's something going on with  the hardware itself, Chromebooks, the phones, it never seems like there's, or even the apps,  all of the apps seem to just sort of be here for a minute and then they're gone. They're here for  a long time and never really touched, but they don't really kill them off, such as like Google  Voice and things like that. So it always seems like it's just a big scatter of leadership and  management when it comes to their products. And secondly, I would ask them,  did you really want to be CEO at Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you think the answer to that is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He seems like he was pretty ambitious and that's just, this is something he wanted to do, but  there's no way I had to say it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think you're a CEO without wanting to be a CEO. You don't just like run a, someone doesn't  like, oh, you've been doing a great job. Let's have you be the CEO. That doesn't really happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's how much of the rest of management happens.  We always say in journalism, the good reporters become editors and they don't know how to edit  or manage. But yeah, I think you're right, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nobody in journalism knows how to edit or manage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why the industry is dying. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, I want to ask him about, so the guy asked  him things like, well, you're the 11th largest economy in the world. Do you have too much power?  I'm not sure what that means. I'm not sure how I would answer.  What does that equate to?  Exactly. And as we kind of said, he said, you're basically you're mixing apples and  kumquats here. We're not a compliment. We're not a country. But I wouldn't want to hear from him  about the responsibility. I wouldn't want to hear that after the great days of the huge optimism  and now into the dystopia we have, the moral panic. Sorry, I had to do it. Try and stop me.  What is your responsibility? What have you learned? What do you need to do differently?  What does make a great company now? There's so much I'd want to ask him because he doesn't speak  that often in that kind of way to get him for a full hour. I was just kind of sad that it was  the usual, but what about, but what about? And I think that's a tough guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't know what made it on the cutting room floor. And I would say like having done like at  Fortune, we used to do sit down interviews that were videoed and some of the more thoughtful  questions were then edited or thoughtful answers were edited into these weird soundbites.  Um, so I mean, I do think Pachai is a very thoughtful individual. And so I think that  he's probably thinking about these things. Maybe he doesn't articulate them. Maybe his PR people  were like, let's not do that. You know, you don't want to get them started on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a good point too, is that he could have given a really boring answer to a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's not just boring. It's like when someone, well, I was just going to say sometimes,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  when you talk to people who are on another level, who are thinking about the big issues,  you're not ready to sit down and listen to their response and certainly not on television.  And I think that does get lost. Like, I mean, I've interviewed these people who are just  brilliant. And when you get them talking about things, to get to their answer, you have to go  through like thickets of weird information that, that explain their thought process that gets due  to the nuance. But all of that gets cut out. I don't know. I guess just because it's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  TV time constraints, that's what you're saying. Yeah. Even as a journalist,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it's sometimes boring. You're like, oh my God, why are you telling me about Shakespeare? And  what about the history of monkeys? How, what? And then you get there and you're like, okay,  that was worth it. But you know that most people are not going to sit through all of that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. Let me tell you about the history of monkeys and Gutenberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I kid you not. I talked to the guy in charge of neuromorphic computing at IBM,  Dharmendra, I can't think of his last name, brilliant fellow, such a great interview,  totally useless if I were going to put it on television. He talked about Shakespeare,  monkeys. I think the plague even came in there, but yeah, it was just never going to make it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One more story before we'll do a commercial and a treat from Stacey,  surprised her and I want to see from her. Treats.  Treat. It's a waffle for everybody. Everybody gets a waffle under their chair. Just check right  now. You've got a waffle there from Stacey. Yes. Or queso. Or queso. It's a little messy, but  I'm sorry. So Google got fined $593 million, 500 million euros, I think it is,  by the French antitrust agency because they were not negotiating in good faith with the French  publishers. I'll go ahead. Just the suspense on this. Jeff, what are your thoughts on this?  You can imagine what I'm going to say. It's really hard to be accused of negotiating in good faith  with blackmailers is my view. This is part of this. The extension of the Leistungsschutzrecht  come to all of Germany, the ancillary copyright. They're being forced with a gun aside their head  to negotiate air quotes with these publishers. And Google, I think is right to hold tough  and is right to say that, well, negotiation means that we have our chance to say what we want to  do and we actually go back and forth. But that's not what the authorities are doing.  And then my friend Ben Evans, who I quote, I think every time on the show,  had a fascinating little tweet that said that the fine is about equal to the entire  market valuation of the major French newspapers. For that fine, they could just buy the newspapers.  And so what is the money going to? What does this money really mean? It's a huge fine. It's  for the sake of emotions and saying, I stopped Google around, aren't I good? And everybody  stops Google around, then what did it get us? So I had to get that off my chest. That's why I have

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to say, what about you guys? Well, so I'm a little... No, I see it similar to you. It just

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  seems like more of a big ego stroke for the folks in France to say, hey, yeah, we can slap them  around and have them do what we say is right, regardless of what our readers here in this area

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  are looking for. Well, France seemed to be, as part of their negotiations, Google had said, hey,  we are going to pay for some content. And they said that they would pay for content. I guess  the French regulator said that they would pay the same amount it would for dictionary listings and  other data. So I saw that and I was like, as a journalist, I'm like, but journalists in news,  we actually do work. We're much more than just straight up data. But then I think about,  how do you charge for context? And that's tough to negotiate or think about, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. Right. Well, it's also the problem with the Australian negotiations too,  you have to acknowledge there's an exchange of value. And the publishers and the government  seem to presume that everything goes to Google because Google is the one who's successful.  But in fact, Google keeps sending audience to the publishers and publishers don't know what to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  with the audience. Well, they don't always send... I mean, Google can send audiences to publishers,  100%. But they can also... Basically, if you're a publisher, you need to be investing not in  data stories, right? That's going to be commodified really fast. You have to provide  context and a point of view. And I don't know that there's a huge audience for context and a  point of view beyond the quick click-baity things, right? So I think this is really tough. You're  fighting human nature. And I don't know where... I mean, we're just in a bad spot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Journalism is just screwed. Okay, Stacey. We'll get out of it. Yeah, we are. I even saw a story  this week, it was not on the rundown, that the Atlantic... It was a good piece from Dylan Byers,  NBC, saying that the Atlantic is losing a lot of money right now. And the new CEO who came from  Wired, who's very smart, says it'll be profitable next year, but they told the staff honestly where  it was. And it's almost a case where they had too much money. Lori and Powell Jobs gave them a huge  amount of money. They hired a hundred people. I subscribed to the Atlantic, but it was worse  than a pile of unread New Yorkers. They almost had too much. They were trying to do everything,  right? And it occurred to me that Bezos will be unsung at this, but he was brilliant at  giving the Washington Post the resources to be successful, but also giving them discipline.  And everybody wants there to be a white knight. It's money from Google or it's a rich person  coming after you. You've still got to make the venture work. I mean, you've had to work,  Stacey, around ventures that didn't work. And it's painful to see that happen, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it easy enough to equate this to you walk into a restaurant that is, they're quotes,  high-end restaurant and they bring you a menu that's this thick and that'll never work. But  if someone brings you a menu that's got 10 items, maybe it's just one or two pages,  that restaurant is probably just absolutely crushing it. Is it the same way to equate this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's right. If you went to a Mexican restaurant and they tried to say,  oh, here's our foie gras page, you'd scratch your head and say, where am I? Now there is,  by the way, a law in New Jersey, by the way, that every single restaurant in New Jersey must serve  pasta or at folds. It is the state of pasta. In Texas, you must have some kind of taco.  Period. There's a job, I'll have those McCormick spices has a new taco ambassador job.  They want to push their spices to taco people. I didn't put that in the rundown,  nor did I put in the rundown. Thank goodness. That's insulting.  The ice cream manufacturer, the honest to God has Kraft Macaroni and cheese ice cream. I chose to  have a higher level than today's show. While we're on news, I'll make one more thing.  Gross food stories from Jeff. Yes. Gross food stories. So Murdoch tried to compete with Google  News a year and a half ago. You remember he started Knews, his effort at having a  balanced neutral response to Google News. Well, guess what? It just happened.  It folded. It's dead. It's gone. Murdoch has failed at everything possible with the internet.  This is why he hates it so much. MySpace, I worked for him long ago with Delphi. Everything  he's done with the internet has failed miserably. Here's the latest one. So goodbye, Knews, it's gone.  All right. Why don't we take a break? When we come back, I want to have Stacy give us a tour in words  or however she chooses of her modern home. I was fascinated by this and I created a piece of the  rundown entirely for Stacy stuff. And mainly to get that in there, but anything else that might  seem to be Stacy-ish. And she said, what are you talking about? What? What? And she was like,  really? Huh? Yeah. She was like, what do you mean? What are you going to violate my privacy? What

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the hell are you doing? You called it the Stacy home tour. And I was like, yeah. She was like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  just because I took people to. You'll find out when we get back, how we're going to have a tour  of Stacy's home. But in the meantime, we're going to hear from the Leo, not on the beach. I'm not  going to lie to you. He's too smart to be doing these. He did this before for one of our beloved

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  sponsors that makes Twit and Twig possible. Hey, if you don't mind, I'd like to interrupt briefly.  Yes, I know I'm in Hawaii right now, but I was so excited to tell you about our new sponsor. I  I had to come back. No, I'm recording this ahead of time. And it's not technically a new sponsor.  I've known about wealth front for ever, practically since they've started these days.  And you've heard us talk about this on Twig investing is complicated. It's confusing. It  could be a little bit scary too. We talk, everybody talks about diamond hands and stonks, memes and  rocket ships. Don't day trading is okay for some people, but if you want to build long-term wealth,  you need something a lot more serious. You need wealth front and wealth front investment account  today. I'm going to tell you this. I say this every time I tell everybody I know this. I tell  my kids this for some reason, nobody believes me, but it's really true. Decades of data show  investors that trade individual stocks underperform the market every year. So you know, that guy says,  I'm making so much money in day trading. 1% of day traders beat the market. Only 1%.  The market beats them almost every time. In fact, there's a very famous bet Warren Buffett  had with some hedge fund manager saying, you know, I'm just going to invest in the market  and I'll beat your hedge fund. And he did. He did. The odds are not in your favor. If you're  doing it alone, you should team up with wealth front investing, complicated, confusing.  But I know you want to have some agency in this and that's what wealth front's great for. Whether  you're beginning, you're brand new, you're just getting out of college, you're starting up your  retirement funds or you've been investing for years, wealth front makes it easy.  No matter what your needs, your portfolio, your goals, they have the right tools. They can create  a portfolio for you. These are the words you want to hear. Globally diversified, low cost,  index funds personalized just for you in minutes. No manual trades, no picking stocks.  You don't need to watch the stock market every day. That's a recipe for disaster. That's a  headache in the happening. Wealth front hails all the investment. You set the preferences.  That's where your agency is. You say, this is my goals. This is what I like. This is the risk I'm  comfortable with. And you let wealth front handle the rest. They also do something that's incredibly  complicated but is very important to save you money. Something called tax loss harvesting  that lowers the taxes you pay as you invest. For a typical client, tax loss harvesting with  wealth front can more than cover their low advisory fee. Of course, the fee is very low.  It's 0.25%. But the wealth front harvesting happens automatically. That's probably why  wealth front now, when we started talking about them years ago, they were just getting started.  They now handle $20 billion of assets. In fact, they've got a great offer for you. Your first  $5,000 managed for free forever. Go to wealthfront.com slash twig. Now I'm telling you,  if you're young and you just put that $5,000 and you know what? I know you, I don't have $5,000.  Put in a few bucks a month. It's the right way to go. All you need is $500 to get started. You  don't have to have $5,000 upfront. Grow your wealth the easy way. Let wealth front do the work  for you. They're really a great company to get your first $5,000 managed free for life.  Go to wealth front.com slash twig. It's W E A L T H F R O N T wealth front.com slash twig  to start growing your savings. Do it right. Go to wealth front.com slash twig and get started today.  If I could go back in time 40 years when I was just getting out of school, just starting my career,  if I could have just, of course that didn't exist back then, but save your money Leo and put it in  wealth front the minute they start. Wealthfront.com slash twig. Hey, they're around now. There's no  better time to start than right now. Wealthfront.com slash twig. We thank them so much for their support  of this week in Google. All right, back to you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you, Leo. And thank you, wealth front. I'm glad you realized that twig and twig people are  wealthy and need help with their wealth because we're just so smart and successful.  I'm delighted with that. So Stacey, I looked at Stacey on IOT and I said,  I wonder what's on Stacey's brain. And right there was this beautiful post of exactly what I wanted.  I wanted to hear everything about Stacey's now newly connected home. And when I said,  I want to see this, she again, she just acted like I was violating her privacy because she forgot she

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  wrote it almost. Oh, you're muted Stacey. Oh, she's muted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dang it. I did forget I wrote it because I wrote it last week, but that's just life on the edge  here. So yeah, I wrote about, it's been a year, I've been in this house for a year and I hadn't  really set up my smart home and my prior home because it was a rental. And after a year here,  I kind of was like, well, you know, really, it's a setup as it's going to be for now.  And I will, the big caveat is I am waiting for matter. The used to be project chips. So I'm  waiting for a lot of devices. So I'm on the, I'm not purchasing some things that need to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stop right there for a second. Tell us what are the kinds of things you're waiting for. I'm eager

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to hear about that. Sure. So I, in my, in my Austin home, back when I was crazy, I had,  you know, all of these hubs, all of this Z wave gear, some SIGB gear, and I was creating these  crazy recipes. Like if this sensor detects motion, but this sensor hasn't detected motion,  and this sensor says it's daylight during this light on, right? They were, there was a lot.  And I would spend like an hour to two hours every week, like keeping everything up to date and  playing with stuff and futson. I don't do that anymore. I gave up on all of that because,  you know, once they, once project chip was announced, I was like, Ooh, this could be good.  This could make all of that stuff. I do obsolete, please. And it's coming. We're going to see. So,  like, so I listed all of the devices that I have, but I wanted to get that caveat out of the way,  because for a long time, that's, that's what I did. And that's why I think a lot of people followed  me and they asked me questions about things. And I can, I still have, you know, smart things  that I can test and do test, but I don't use it in my day to day. And I don't make my family use it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  which is not arrived in Valhalla yet and connected Valhalla that will come connected. Valhalla has  not arrived. I have known that. But what take us through, take us through what you have done today.  You showed us one thing last week, which we all loved. Yeah. The wall. She doesn't remember that  either. Oh, the Nantaleaf. Stacey, Stacey, I'm the old guy here. I got no memory. I got no brain  anymore. That look on her face was. I have no, I have the excuse. You have no excuse. This is your

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  own home. This is your own life. These are the things that you have said. I could actually look  to like, if I go like this, I'm like, Oh, hello, Nantaleafs. I'm so sorry. For those of you on

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  audio. What I said, you showed us last week, there was a complete blank look as an answer.  It was like, huh? What did I do last week? That's history. I don't remember. Hi. Yeah. You showed  us a wonderful, beautiful thing you created last week, Stacey. Remember now? Yes, I do. So,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  there, there. Yes, that was, that was great. So in addition to that, I have like 30 to 50  wifi devices and all of them are geared to making our lives just a little bit easier,  a little bit more voice controlled, mostly voice controlled, I'll be honest.  So I detailed in this post, everything in my smart home. I'm going to just condense a lot of this and  say, most of it is running on either an Echo, an Amazon Echo, or one of a series of Google Assistant  devices. So I don't have any home kit because Kevin does the home kit stuff. I, that's, that's  important to note. We split that up because otherwise it's just too much. And most of my  automations are around lights and a couple around locks. And I'd like to get better at that. So  I have four different sets of light kind of things. I have Wyze smart outlets, Lutron switches,  and a Lutron outlet, Phillips Hue bulbs, and the Nanoleaf stuff. I'm just thinking through. Yes.  Oh, and Wyze light bulbs. So those four ecosystems are my lights. And I have clumped them all together  using rooms or whatnot in the Amazon and the Google apps. So that's most of this stuff.  And then there's my boring stuff. Like I have a thin water monitor device that  checks my house for leaks. I have an Aquanta, which is on my water heater. And it says things  like, Hey, if you take your water heater temperature down, you can save energy.  It also does things like it has a sensor attached in case it ever leaks. It's a really handy device.  It's more for saving energy than it is for anything else. But I can use it to like turn  off my water heater in when my daughter is taking a 40 minute shower. If I wanted to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You could turn it off. You could freeze her out, but you don't.  Yes. Have you been known to do it once just to make a point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, because she's pretty good. I mean, all I have to, she's 15 or she's 14. So I'm like,  you are hurting the planet. And she's like, not the planet. It's really, it's a low blow  from my perspective. So water, water, HVAC. So I've got the Ecobee's. I did find a sensor.  After writing that post, my husband was like, we have a sensor. It's just downstairs. And I was  like, oh. And then the other thing that's come in real handy is outdoor sprinkler controls.  I don't have an irrigation system, but I do have faucets. And so I have the Orbit beehive that  actually arrived. So I set that up to set up my summer watering schedule. And that is really  handy because I feel like I'm saving water and that's really important. And yet still watering  my tomatoes. I don't know what else was in there. Was there anything else in there that you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  excited about? You have your mailbox thing hanging down over your Christmas wreath.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yes. That's because my mailbox is so far away. I have the Ring mailbox sensor, which by the way,  does not use the Amazon sidewalk network. I can't wait till it does because then it will actually  reach far enough that my Wi-Fi barely reaches my mailbox. I have to stick it in the outer edge of  the garage. So that's where that's hanging right now. It's so pretty. And then the only other thing  are my locks. And I'm really waiting on the matter protocol to get sorted out new matter enabled locks  because I want to put locks on all of my doors so I can do a good night routine that works.  Oh.  But right now I have a Z-Wave lock, but I have no Z-Wave hubs that I really want to set up for that.  So that'll go away soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So two questions.  I don't know.  Does any of this irritate your husband and daughter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not anymore. It used to tremendously because things would break and now  nothing breaks. It's a very passive system, which is what I wanted.  Oh yeah. Thank you. So it's a super passive system. And the nice thing is my family doesn't  actually know what they're missing. My husband would, if he knew that if all of our locks were  compatible, he could turn off all of our locks just by saying, good night, Madam A. He would  be really pissed, but he doesn't know that. So he doesn't know what he doesn't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you have two different systems.  And it reminds me of when 10 years ago, I guess we can go back as far as 10 years ago when we had  the AV system for watching television, your home theater in a box and whatnot,  and you had the cable box and you had the TV. So you had three different remotes right there.  With this smart home stuff, it seems like at one point in time, at least for the longest for me  anyway, it seems like anytime I started to look into it, it seems like it was just bringing back  that scenario of I needed a remote for this and I needed a remote for that. And it just,  Sid, you know what I'll pass on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't use apps. So I am almost, the only apps I use are the Ecobee because I didn't set it up  through the Amazon. And there's actually no reason for that. Just I didn't. And then the  Nanoleaf simply because I like using, there's like dozens of recipes that you can have on  your different Nanoleaf panels. And I just never remember the names of them.  So, but everything else is voice or buttons. And I have a lot more buttons than you might.  Voice buttons are automations. So I actually have probably six or seven buttons that I just have  placed to control connected lights around my house that are more convenient than the lights.  It's like Donald Trump's Coke button.  Yes. Except my husband.  Nobody knows what it does, but you do?  Yes. Well, no other, I mean, my husband knows what it does. And we have, for example, a button that  calls my daughter down, like on her kitchen, it controls her lights on and off. Cause she hated  when we would drop in on her using the Echo. She was like, I don't like that. And I was like,  that's fair. So then we just set up her lights with a little Lutron, the Lutron light switch,  and then the Pico remote. And you just toggle the lights on and off real fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It works like a charm.  Oh, I know. It's the daughter eye rolling button. Oh no, they want me.  Well, to go off Anne's question though, is that, so you don't have three remotes,  which you have two different systems, Amazon and Google.  Do you forget which system to ask for wit for what?  So the lights are Amazon, but the, but the doors Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, everything's dual set up. So everything is dual setup that can be dual setup.  And you know, there's also just, just say, I'll know there's a lot of stuff in there that isn't  connected. So like my fridge actually could be connected to the internet, but it's not.  My bed could be connected to the internet, but it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've got a sink faucet.  But why aren't they connected?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't see any value. Like it was, you know, there's no need to have that app on my phone  and the use case is so not compelling to me. And in the case of my sink, the use case is compelling,  but I don't have an outlet yet under the sink. One day that might be connected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I could see the use case for the sink with leaks and things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it's actually just to tell madam a to fill my, my pot with four cups of water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a handy thing. You don't have to get out your measuring cups. You could just be like,  so, you know, madam, I miss, I actually miss that aspect of my connected sink, believe it or not.  In my devices, most of them aren't smart. They're mostly remote control.  The smarts are the automations I build. The two devices that are the smartest, maybe I would say  the devices that are the smartest are actually the most boring ones. So like, except for the  June oven, which is totally smart and I love it. And y'all have all heard about it.  And you bought two of them.  I've bought two of them. I love them. Actually I've bought like so many because I gave them  as gifts to people I love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow. Aren't you generous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was my parents. They do a lot for me.  But let's see. What was I going to say? Oh, the fin is really smart because it's looking for leaks  all the time and it can tell where they are. So that's actually really smart.  And it's really not intrusive.  The Aquanta is really smart and non-intrusive. And, but most of the other, I mean, like,  how really can a light bulb be smart? The Apple's circadian, what do they call it? It's not,  Oh gosh. They have a circadian rhythm kind of lighting thing, adaptive lighting.  That's a good idea.  It is. It works really well, but you wouldn't like it because in your studio, for example,  you need to control those lights, right? But in your house, it's really nice. And it just  like kind of cycles through the day. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, what are you using as a primary command center, if you will, that people listening to  this week in Google, they may or may not know that we have another show called Smart Tech Today,  which airs on Thursdays, just before my show Hands on Photography.  Well done.  They talk a lot about these types of devices and Mr. Matt Cassinelli uses shortcuts with this  iPad to handle a lot of this stuff. What is your command center, if you will?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My command center is usually, it's both Google and Madame A. So I set up the routines in those  hubs. And then that's how I control most of these. They act as my hubs. So,  you know, I've used HomeBridge, I've used OpenHAB, I've used SmartThings.  HomeBridge, that's right. That's what he was saying.  That's what Micah loves. HomeBridge ties all your Apple stuff to your non-Apple stuff that's not  HomeKit supported and allows you to control all that. And that's all really great. I just got so  tired of spending so much time reconnecting things that fell off or tweaking, you know,  if I bring in a new light or I move a light bulb to someplace else, you know, you've got to go  spend all this time to rejigger it. And I'm just waiting for matter in ways for that to be easier  unless manual on me as the administrator. Was CHP or CHIP or whatever it was called, was that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  like late 2019 when this hit the news? CHIP was announced 2019. It became matter earlier  this year. So those are the same project. Okay. And I struggled back then trying to understand  it. I'm still struggling now. It's okay. Hopefully you don't have any... When matter comes out,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  is there anything you'd replace from what you have now? Yes. When matter comes out, I'm swapping out

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  my door locks for matter compliant locks. I'm hopeful that most of... So my Philips Hue lights  will be matter compliant. I'm super hopeful, y'all, that my Lutron stuff is matter compliant,  especially because it's in the walls. I think my Google hubs are... Next week is Amazon's  Madam A live event. So I'm hoping we'll hear about Madam A and Amazon equity matter.  Yeah, I know. It's awkward. I just don't want to say her name. It's so rude. So I'm hopeful we'll  see that on some things. I don't have a lot of cameras, so matter doesn't work with cameras.  So I'm not going to be dealing with a lot of that. And I'm also hopeful for things like sidewalk,  because if I had my druthers, I would be putting sidewalk compliance sensors throughout my yard  and garden and tie that into my sprinklers, for example, or my faucet timers, for example.  So there's a lot I want to do. I just can't do it yet without... I'm just not willing to spend

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that much time anymore on it. I think for me, the most automation that I want would be just  lights popping on and off when I either enter the room or leave the room and stuff like that.  I guess I'm just too much of a control freak and just don't quite trust this technology just yet  to get it right for me. Because again, all I can think about is just the battles that I had with  remote controls over the years. And then finally, Logitech and its Harmony remote really did help  and just unify everything for me. But now that's gone away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nicole Cudone They killed it. I will say, Ant, give it another year, check out some of the matter  stuff. I think things like the good night routines are really nice. I wrote my post,  I have seven doors leading to the outside of my house. So being able to build a routine that would  four of my doors are sliding patio doors. There's no way I can automate that. But  being able to lock all your doors at night instead of going around physically and checking them  is actually a really nice thing. And there's lots of things that are going to be better.  And then we're also like, there's actually a story about Amazon going for radar sensors.  Things like RF sensing are going to be really big for adding person detection and proximity  detection inside the home. And that's going to do things like when you walk in the house,  your air conditioner will know where you are and could theoretically cool those areas.  Your lights, like you said, would come on and off in a much better and they could be personalized  to you. Things like an emergency situations, your house could say, Oh shoot, ants on the ground and  it's in the middle of the living room. That's super weird. Let's call his wife. Right. Second

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  time you've had us walk over ants bodies in the show, but we'll leave it. Sorry. I'm just taking  you down this week. First time was an ant wanted something to drink. Otherwise he'd collapse.  Right.  So there's two other stories, two other Stacey's stories. I'd love to get quick hits on,  to educate me. One is Ray Ozzie's blues wireless raises 22 million, money raises the big deal,  but he wants 5G in everything. Do you buy that? So his, his five, this is a stupid headline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who wrote this headline? Is this the first? Axios. Axios. Oh, was that Ida?  Yeah. I can't see it. Okay. He wants to add NBIOT to everything and cat M one, which is technically  LTE. Eventually they might have 5G, but this is for low. This is, this is a startup. It's actually  not a bad idea. It's a good startup, but they want to add cellular to everything. And they're  talking on their product roadmap about eventually adding like wifi or Bluetooth too. So the point  is today's product offers a radio that is easy to connect to the internet. It comes pre-certified  and it also comes with half a gigabyte of data. So 500 megabytes of data over 10 years. So you  buy this and you get all of that. So remember the first Kindle and we're all like, Oh my God,  the first Kindle. And you don't have a subscription with it. You just download as many books as you  want. Cause it was all built in. This is kind of the promise that this device has. You could just  buy a device. You don't have to pay any data subscriptions, but you're going to get, you know,  NBIOT, which is really low data rates, or you're going to get cat M, which is slightly faster,  like slightly greater data rates, but you're going to get a guaranteed half a gig  for 10 years, which is cool. Cause you can anticipate how much that's going to cost when

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you're building and pricing the device. So, yeah, but by the way, so I, when I got my CPAP  torture machine, I didn't realize I, yeah. So I have that. I have my tortures me every night.  And I had it next to the clock radio because I'm so old. I actually still have a clock radio.  I have a clock radio. Wow. I do too. I love it. Oh, you do too. Oh, okay. So here's the problem.  It was making that horrible 3G noise because the CPAP is reporting in on you to HQ. You have to use  it four hours a night or else the cops come and glue it to your face or something. Okay. Your  insurance provider won't cover it. That's what it is. Yes, you're right. But I tend to be paranoid  about this. So I now had to move the clock radio somewhere else. My wife thinks it's ugly as hell.  Why am I doing this? Cause otherwise it would keep me up all night going, doing it. So there's  cellular and things you don't even know. I had no idea it was in that. The other story I did. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go ahead. Oh, I was like, I feel like they should tell you there's a cellular radio in there. That's  reporting your data back to somebody. Yeah. That feels like something that should be part of  the rules. Okay. What's your other story? The, um, Amazon basically acquired Facebook's satellite  internet team. Oh, the project story is it, how do you say it? Cooper Kuiper? Yeah. I hope. I  hope. I think right now I only, I only read it in science fiction. I know what the, the Cooper  Kuiper belt is, but I don't know how to say it out loud. Um, chat room where we say is a Kuiper or

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cooper tomato tomato help us. Yeah. But anyway, I just know. Yeah. Amazon's yeah. Amazon's been

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  doing a lot with a satellite internet in space, satellite internet, sorry, satellite internet for  IOT. Um, okay. ScooterX is telling us it's keeper. Well, that's the German pronunciation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was like, I need, I need a phonetic, phonetically like Ray Kaiser. Is that what you're saying here?  Kuiper. Kuiper belt. Thank you. Thank you. I knew y'all. I knew someone would know. Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Um, okay. Sorry. The Kuiper project, um, Facebook, I guess is not really keen on providing internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  anymore. They're just, I don't know. They were going to do, they were going to do all kinds of  things. They had, they had a huge winged planes that were going to fly forever and all kinds of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  stuff. Yeah. With their crazy laser sites. It was, yeah, it's bonkers. Um, talk about research  project. Um, anyway, Amazon's they're, they're actually keen on doing this as part of their IOT  efforts as part of their, you know, we're going to see Amazon getting into internet IOT connectivity  in a big way. We, with sidewalk, with Kuiper. Um, so this makes a lot of sense because they,  they saw their problem with not, I mean, they realized, oh, I don't have a phone. That sucks.  And they're coming up against the carriers on things. And if they can offer,  God help me for saying this and end to end solution, it'll be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it was interesting that you remind me with Facebook's, uh, this is something that  aeronautical ant might, might enjoy. Um, of course they, they had a plane that was, that was,  um, solar powered and battery powered. So it would stay up doing, uh, uh,  internet connectivity from the sky. And they stopped that. But I just saw a story before  he went on United airlines is put it in an order for 100 electric planes.  Yeah, I heard about that. I don't want to, I don't want to go circling in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you won't be, it's, it's all short range stuff. So it, it, it makes total sense. Um,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  from a cost standpoint, 250 mile range. I know, but it's, you know, I'm in Newark,  so we get delayed all the time. It makes me nervous. Oh, we're going to circle. Oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  our little battery's going down. Oh no flight control. When you, when you're,  when you're in the air and you're in danger of crashing, they're going to let you land first.  Yeah. It's a triage thing. Yeah. Protocols, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I saw it. It's one of those things of they could spend so much money making a place  and orders with the other manufacturers and have all that other built in costs with fuel and so  forth. And this is just something that's going to be more cost effective for the short range,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  short range flights. This is a really dumb question. It won't be any quieter, right?  Cause that's the propeller that makes noise or am I, or is it actually the engine that makes the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  noise on a prop plane? I can't answer that. Don't know. It's not a prop plane. Is it?  I thought the picture that one was. Oh, okay. How would you do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I'm thinking of a different thing. Right. So, yeah, I don't know if you can do

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that. Someone just got money for an electric jet. Really? Like two months ago. Really?  Really? Hold on. Are these not jets? 200 electric, Sweden's heart aerospace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought the ones from United were props, like turbo props.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Picture they have, which is an artist conception is a problem. That could just be that the newspaper  screwed it up. Because essentially the ES-19 electric plane is a four prop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay. Hold on. Let me see if I've got the name of the... Oh, it's a 19 seat turbo prop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, okay. No, no. I lied to you. This is 19 seat. This is Sweden's heart aerospace. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay. This is the same thing. Well, okay. I think this is just a United plane.  It has a thing that goes around, Stacey. It's a prop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Got it. Okay. Can't be a jet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I'm looking at the picture associated with the story and it looks like a plane. So I'm like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  ah. Right. Okay. Ignore me.  It is pretty cool. I got to admit it's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and I don't know about you, but I know in Sweden, there's a group of, like a rising number  of people who don't want to fly because of the emissions associated with it. They've got some,  it's not a German word. It's a Swedish word for it. But for people who like have decided not to  travel for business because of their emissions. So I wonder if this is a way, obviously this won't  address all of it, but to start addressing that if there's a big market for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. I think I saw Stacey that Germany was considering outlawing domestic flights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good God. Wait, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It would be rather extreme. Yes. German greens want to, and the greens, well, until not long ago,  the greens looked like they were going to win the election in Germany. Now it looks like the  conservatives will, but yeah, German greens want to ban domestic flights by 2035. You have to take

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the train. Wow. That's intense. See, but if you had these smaller flights, you could go from,  I don't know, Berlin to Saxony. I don't know how far these things are.  And it is a smaller country. They do have good train infrastructure. Here you'd have to take  a Greyhound and that would be dire. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was going to say, would it really be that bad over there for them to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  deal with trains versus? It's longer than you think. To take a train ride, let's see, a train ride.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I know it's going to be longer and slower. I get that. But again, if you think about,  I believe it was just this past Sunday on This Week in Tech, boss man was talking about just cars  and how they're pretty much destroying us. And if it's a way to save the planet, is it worth it just

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  having an extra hour or two? Well, did you ever take the Acela?  Well, I mean, so like when I was in New York, I would take the train to, like I covered New Jersey  and Philadelphia and I would take the train there or down to DC all the time rather than.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would take the Boston, which is a five hour. But Anne, so Hamburg to Munich is eight and a half hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On a train versus flying. Okay. That's a bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, what would it be flying? Oh, 50 minutes, 50, 60 minutes.  Okay. So 60 minutes plus two, let's say three hours just for. So it's half.  All the hoo-ha around it, right? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's, no, hour and a half. That's what's included. Hour, 15 minutes including hoo-ha. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. I mean, I'm sure there's somebody out there that'll do some type of analysis to help  break this stuff down and maybe even put more infrastructure in place to make it more feasible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who knows? I would love it. I like train time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Interest in flying. I've never asked you this. I obviously love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just airplanes. I've always been fascinated with just the fact that something that big  can fly. Birds fly, people can't fly. But this massive piece of equipment just goes across the  sky with ease. So I've always sort of just been fascinated with that. I wanted to be a pilot. And  quite frankly, one day I may still try to be a pilot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the great thing where you are, and you have to have a lot of wine to do this and I've done it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is to go take fighter flights. I would do that. If given an opportunity, I would do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  After you drank the wine? Oh, I don't need wine. I didn't fly it. I just sat in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I was like, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  With my girlfriend at the time, this is many, many, many years ago. I'm older and chickener now.  This was one of San Francisco's 100 most eligible bachelors. I'll have you know.  Well, I'm going to die.  You went up to the wine country. That's what you do. You want to impress? You go to the wine country.  It's the greatest thing to do. And then when you do what you're there after you have the wine,  you get in the glider.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, I thought it was the high-air balloons here. I didn't know anything about gliders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I will not do that. I will not. Why not?  Well, that's like a bridge. I'm okay if I'm enclosed, but I can look over the edge of the  no, not just even thinking about it. My palms are gripping. No, I won't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Interesting. Interesting. No, I seriously considered being a pilot and in my brain,  it would happen, you know, the years right when the youngest hard head gets ready to graduate high  school. That was in my brain is to say, okay, I want to give this a shot and try it out. And  everybody that I've spoken to about it said, just go for it.  Yeah. The family has been like, yeah, go for it, dude, because you're always staring at planes.  You're always watching YouTube with airplanes. You're always at the airplane overlook. Why not?  You know more about these planes and yada yada.  So why not? Have you ever been in a glider, Ant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have not. What's amazing about it, Stacy, have you ever been in one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've been in a glider, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't it amazing when they release it and suddenly all you hear is wind?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you're like silent up there. I mean, it's not really silent, but it feels silent.  You're like, what is happening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The closest I got to that, the closest I got to a glider was the, dang, I've just drawn a blank on  it. But it's a little passenger plane that you could buy and literally park in your garage.  It was an amphibious plane. A10, I believe is what it was called. Icon Air, Icon Airplane.  I got to fly one of those with Tech Republic to write about it. She cut everything off while  we were in the air and it was just amazing how quiet it was just to be flying around.  Only the sound of you screaming.  This is what the end sounds like.  Yeah. It was amazing just to be up there and to be in that particular seat because  you're in the cockpit of this thing and it's small. Everything is pretty daggone intimate  between you and the machine and the outdoors. But yeah, that was, oh, I love that experience.  I'd do it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I thought of you today on some different subject. I thought of you today. I was  driving around doing errands and I had on a Barrelsmen investment fund. They do these events,  they had one today about NFTs. I thought finally, maybe somebody can finally explain this to me so  I understand it. We're looking at the business of NFTs. They had a neat company there. Have you  heard of infinite objects? I have. Where you can buy the NFT, but it also you print it onto the  device that you put up that has it on it so that for dummies like me, it feels a lot more tangible.  Oh, that's what I bought. Have you heard of this one, Stacey? That's all it is.  I don't think so. Yeah.  I thought it was cool. I thought it was nice because it was for dummies like me. I guess

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm too dumb. That's all right. NFTs are still pretty daggone niche right now. Some folks are  still putting items out there to be purchased via an auction. And most of it is going towards charity.  I haven't seen a lot of people putting it out there the same way they would put prints out,  at least with the same amount of effort. But there are some that are selling things just as  if they would sell prints. But most of the NFT stuff that I see tends to lean more towards  the celebrities and putting it towards some type of fundraiser for an auction or for a charity or

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  something like that. There was a different use today and I can't remember which company it was,  but it's the company that runs a lot of the reality shows like America's Got Talent and those kinds  of things. And so they had a Neil Gaiman series of superheroes of mythology fight superheroes of  cartoons, fight superheroes of business and technology. So they had the show and they had  the actors and they made collectible NFTs. It struck me rather like the little stuffed animals  on Geeky. What did you call those things? Like Funko Pops?  Yeah. Like Meany Babies? Funko Pops.  Thank you. Yeah. I got a whole bit. Anybody want any Meany Babies? We've got them. They're  going to be really valuable someday. I think NFTs are electronic Meany Babies.  They kind of like that. Well, that's what they're doing. So they're saying, well, we create a  scarcity. They cost between 50 and a hundred dollars and we make only a hundred or 200 of them.  And your kids come begging you to say, I really want the Voltron, I'm making this up,  NFT. And then you own it and other people don't, but then they can keep on spitting them out and  spitting them out and spitting them out. It's like Meany Babies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, but at least with the NFT, they can't spit out the exact same thing over and over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they could. They're doing 50 of them. They're limiting the number.  Well, okay. Well, yeah, if they're doing a lot, that's a different story.  Okay. Yeah. It's 50 different addresses. You're right. But it can be 50 different

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  addresses of the same thing, right? Right. But I look at it the same way I look at people  collecting cars. A lot of these classic cars that people buy at these Mecham auctions and auctions  and things like that, those cars aren't being created ever again, but they continue to go  up and down in value because it's just, it's just hard to some people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't mean to make this into Jeff NFT 101, but I'm going for a second  because what the heck? I'm in charge today. We're coming up.  Flash that moral panic sign. We'll find a reason. We'll find a reason very soon. I promise.  So thank you. So you turn that into an NFT. I buy one of your beautiful photos in an NFT.  The analogy is to art. I can put a print up on the wall.  How do I display it? How do I know I have it? How do I show it off to myself or to others?  How is it?  Blockchain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now you just have it. You have like a tablet. You're going to have some sort of like,  you know, Samsung has their frame TV, which is the first like this. Okay.  CDIA is going to happen in September. This is like the AV installers, big smart home kind of group.  You're going to see TVs and or digital picture frames that are designed to show  what you've purchased. Those already exist and like things that show digital art already exist.  And so what's going to happen is you'll see more options there.  So like Mural is one of those companies that offers one of these.  I think they got bought by...  Even Objects does too in a way. Yeah.  Yeah. So then you get these wall frames. Oh, Netgear bought Mural. M-E-U-R-A-L.  And you know, you'll just get these things and it will be lovely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. Thank you very much. So speaking of giving me advice,  I want to appreciate our dear friend, Kevin Toffle. Yes. Who wrote a post about our own dear show  and wha on about Chromebooks because frankly, he's the one of the nicest guys in the world,  right? Stacey? He is. Oh yeah. He's 100% the nicest guy.  Basically the undercurrent of this is stop asking me this Jarvis. I'm set up and you ask me the best  Chromebook. But he wrote it in that incredibly nice Kevin Toffle way where he calmly took through.  And the best analogy was he said, here's why I can't tell you the best Chromebook. It's like  walking into an auto dealer that has every car and you say, what's the best car? And there isn't a  right answer. And he would push you to the Maserati or the expensive car when all you want is the  Honda. So you're right, Kevin. You're absolutely right. The thing is I don't care about you  advising everybody else about the best Chromebook. I just want you to advise  me about the best Chromebook. That's all I need. That's all I need. I don't care about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I told Kevin that he should charge people for this. I'm like, just give you. Yes, I would pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would pay. It's like therapy. It's Chromebook therapy. I'll get on the couch. I could book you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  an appointment with Kevin. I'll only take a small cut. Yes, I like this.  I'm waiting for it. Usually if he's watching, he'll pop up at some point in time on my chat  program and be like, okay, Stacey. So I'm waiting for that to happen. He may not be watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do love Kevin. I also love that he wrote a whole post about hearing his name on the show,  which was kind of great. So Kevin, thank you very much. I just wanted to say,  I'm still going to get a therapy session from you.  So Facebook, we should probably do Facebook because Leo's not here.  We should. So we can do it safely. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think we can.  Well, there's no, I think we should. Are we going to talk about Cecilia's new book?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We should. Yes, we need to. Okay. Yes. Because I'm excited about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've only read most of the CEO versus COO episode The Times ran, which really wasn't  that revealing. I don't think, but they've been on a lot of shows and talking about it.  The title again, I forget is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  An Ugly Truth Inside Facebook's Battle for Domination.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. So you've been reading about it. Why don't you talk about it, Stacey? What does it pretend?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know what it pretends because I did not have a galley copy in advance because I don't  really write about Facebook. But yes, basically this shows a lot of your worst fears about  Facebook. A hundred percent true. Mark Zuckerberg, not the nice dude you might think he is. I don't  know if anyone actually thought that. One of the things that came out, I think this was a Business  Insider story. It talks about 50 something employees had access. They fired, Facebook fired these  employees, but they access data from the company's users without permission. So they basically were  like, I work at Facebook. I can see everybody's stuff. Let's look up and find out things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One of them- But they got stopped at least. They got fired, which is a good news.  They did get stopped and fired. But Ring had a similar problem with employees,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  not illegally, just access- Well, amorally.  Amorally. Yeah. I'm like, what is the word I want to look? Amorally accessing user data.  This is a real problem that I feel like companies when you start, and you have access to this data,  kind of like Uber and their Godmode, and they used to show investors Beyonce's  driving around New York. Right. I forgot about that. Right.  Yeah. All of these things are ripe. You need to build that into your company when you're building  your company. Because right now, everybody has access to this. I'll put a little,  what is the word I'm looking at? I'm going to drop a note right here on the Facebook thing,  just for a sec. Stick a pin in this and move really fast to the Justice Department. You know  how the Trump Justice Department was seeking information on Washington Post reporters.  Well, it turns out that a story was just released in the last hour or two that they didn't just go  after like ISPs trying to get this and Google and such. They also went after a security firm  called Proofpoint trying to get access to, because Proofpoint handled the email security  for this organization. So the Justice Department was like, Oh boy. Oh, since you handle email  security for the Washington Post, can you give us data on this? So I think it's really naive if  you're building a company that's going to suck up a lot of user data to think that no one's going  to come asking for that data or that your employees are going to abuse their ability  to access that data. So both of those things. You've got to recognize the trust needed to have

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  people's data, which is the problem with Facebook from day one, right? With the changing rules,  the changing definitions of privacy, the changing circles of what is private and what is not,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  is that it affected trust. Well, I would say, I don't think it's trust. I think it's actually  building the infrastructure in place that says people are going to abuse this and be jerks.  So it's actually not trusting them, trusting them to be right. Right. Right. Right. I guess

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the public is not going to trust you unless you build those things. Yes. We agree. We agree.  So, yeah. And then there was another story just out right before we got on  that Facebook has had the service for some time that they bought. One of my former students  is one of the early employees there, which is something I'm forgetting the name of the company.  The company that gives data about what people are doing. Oh, hell.  You and I each put it on the rundown.  No, I can't get it. There's a service that Facebook bought to provide social data to journalists  so that they could manage their social world around it. And it was controversial. This is line 97.  It was controversial within Facebook, it turns out, because like Kevin Ruse from the New York  Times would do this regular thing of the top 10 most seen Facebook things. Now, the problem is,  I've always had a problem. And Facebook has said they have a problem too with the methodology here,  because it might be the most popular 10 things that the service saw, but we have no idea how  big that actually is. We have no idea what the actual impact is, which is to say that  Facebook's not being transparent about that. They're being half transparent in a way that  actually hurt Facebook. So there are people inside Facebook who said, well, this is hurting us. We  shouldn't have this out there at all. But there are other people who say, well, let's be more  transparent. Well, the more transparent lost. And this part of Facebook just got broken up and put  under security of Facebook, which is, I think, too bad because it was a service to journalists.  It was about transparency. Yeah. So it fits into the narrative of the book.  Facebook just keeps being its own worst enemy. That's because they're not trustworthy people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's because you let this... Say it, say it. No, I'm not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She already got her big swinging Branson out earlier, so she's used up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. We're revering the wrong people in the quote, tech world. And we're  rewarding the wrong behaviors from a public best interest perspective.  Like going up into space. Yes. Well, I was going to more self-aggrandizement and this idea that,  I mean, if you think about social media, a lot of it is still about self-aggrandizement, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I just... Well, I see you don't just mean the executives, you mean the users. You mean the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  total. Yeah. I mean everything. We're building ourselves into these... This is too deep for me,  but yeah. The focus isn't on, I guess, a greater good or... And I'm not saying you should always  be responsible to the greater, but it's not on building a cohesive society. It's not actually  on communication, it's on self-aggrandizement. And it's kind of the, I guess, the natural end to  rewarding capitalism for the last 50 years, but it's showing its age, it's hitting its roadblocks.  I don't know what that is. It's not just capitalism, it's also media in the sense of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  celebrity, too. It's everybody with their 15 minutes. Yeah. What makes you say it's showing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  its age? Well, we're kind of coming to the end of the line in the sense that we're going to be  thinking about... If you think about the end of privacy, that's kind of scary. What are we going  to do to stop that? If you think about global warming and the planet, can we adjust our systems  of consumption to deal with that? I had this realization about the IoT. Until we figure out  that we don't want to use this data to get people to buy more stuff or to exploit people to work  harder for less money, we can't actually solve any other problems. And unfortunately, that's  where we're still focused. And we're going to hit the... It's showing its age in the sense that  we're no longer to be able to solve the problems that this is causing. Think about things like,  you know, we talk about the high cost of security, the high cost of addressing global warming and  climate change. I don't know. This is just me being sad. Oh, Stacy's depressing herself. We have to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  get her happier here. I should put another home story in here. Quick. Let's talk about...  Let's stay on Facebook for another minute because there are two other things that came out which  fit the same narrative. So Facebook tries to have easy solutions to things. Now they're going to  all let groups anoint experts. And this is an effort to combat misinformation. Well, no, that's  not how you... Expertise is not a popularity contest. It's not the group deciding who the expert  is. There's an external structure like universities, like licensing bodies, like critics that decide...  I don't know. What about your list of scientific COVID experts? That's kind of expertise.  I use... Yes, it is. But I use the fact that they aren't the Yale School of Public Health.  They were not credentialed by me. They were separately credentialed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You might find that this works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It might be helpful in some cases. So in this Harry Potter world, here is the ultimate Harry  Potter fan who knows more about Harry Potter than anybody else. So it's kind of a Wikipedia  expertise sense. Yes, I salute that. I do. Absolutely. But I also fear that somebody  can just go and start a vaccination group and declare the craziest person in it to be the expert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What about someone like... And I don't know how to say her name. Zeynep Tufekci?  Yes. I know she's a professor or... Sociologist.  She's a sociologist and an associate professor, but she became an expert on COVID doing the actual  reading. And I would say I wouldn't necessarily expect her to be a COVID expert, but she popped  up and was able to do it. Yeah. I'm certainly saying it's possible. Journalists

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  bone up on topics. I feel like I'm an expert on broadband.  You are. The tables are turned here. No, I'm just trying to understand where you're coming from  here. What I'm saying is I can see where it goes wrong. It goes to your earlier point. I can see  where it goes wrong. Did I start a vaccination group and I declare as experts the greatest nuts  out there who say that vaccinations are bad for you? So then now because my expert against your  expert and they're both declared experts somewhere, and that is not necessarily the best  structure to get at expertise. I believe strongly that the next generation of the net needs to be an  expert-based network. So we agree. But the question is, is this the best way to get there  is to enable every group to declare their own experts in Facebook? I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is nice to be able to have the freedoms to create little groups like this and be able to  have some conversations with like-minded people. It's nice to have those freedoms,  but at the same time, it could also be detrimental if those groups become very, very big and end up  getting some interesting odd power and influence over other folks based on their views that may  not quite be accurate. So this is just the slippery slope of the tools of social media.  I know Mr. Jarvis, you advocate for social media because it's given a lot of voice to people  that didn't have amplified voices. And I'm with you on that. But at the same time, there's  a lot of people I wish would just be quiet on social media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, but the good thing about social media is you can stop.  Yes, you can always mute.  I'm so proud. I am blocked by Donald Trump Jr. and Piers Morgan. I'm very proud.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Frank Sinatra called you a bum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Frank Sinatra called me a jerk. One more. So Zuckerberg, again, right before we got on the  air quotes error, said that Facebook, I think in the next year and a half or something,  is going to pay a billion dollars to creators.  Yeah.  Ant Pruitt, creator, what do you think of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I think that's a good start. But I think it's an uphill battle because what exactly  will Facebook and Instagram offer to creators that TikTok isn't already offering and then some,  and that YouTube isn't already offering and then some. Yes, Facebook has how many billions of users,  but people search and they end up on YouTube. They end up on Google or they end up on YouTube  when it comes to things that they're looking for. And YouTubers know that. And they just stick to  their guns and they're going to continue to roll with it. And if they are actually on TikTok,  they're usually using TikTok to funnel themselves, funnel those viewers back to their  YouTube channels. I know several people that- Where they make money.  Right. So a billion dollars is a good start for Facebook, but I just don't know  if it's going to make any difference here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jaycee, would you take Facebook money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, I would not take Facebook money. But I also,  I mean, who's on Facebook to, I guess, let me think of it this way. Remember the pivot to video and  Facebook told all the journalists, hey, invest in video. I mean, a billion dollars is nothing to  these guys. So I take this about as seriously as I take the pivot to video, I guess, is what I'm  thinking. Yeah, I think you're right. Well, it's a rug that can be pulled out from underneath you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's nothing to plan on. It's a start. They can take it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a start. They can basically start in small and they're probably meeting up with some of the  big YouTubers or TikTokers as we speak to start going over the details of this. And you'll see  some sort of soft little rollout, the same way we saw it with IGTV. But again, people were using  IGTV to funnel back to their content on other platforms. Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah. I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the problem that Stacey raises with the pivot to video is right, is that you've got to be able to  plan on it. And the only way you can plan on it is if you understand the underlying economics.  And are there aligned interests? Is everybody making money on this? Oh, this is my share.  Right. The YouTube is that way. YouTube says, okay, we sold these ads and we're not going to  tell you what the share is exactly, but you're getting a share. We're making money and you're  making money at the same time. And that's how it operates. Facebook is more opaque, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, and you have to, the other thing is, all of these platforms, you have to build on the  platform. Curse the end of the open wave. Amen. Now, okay. So Mr. Jarvis, I know YouTube isn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  necessarily disclosing exactly how much they earned on the ads for someone's video, but they  do give the analytic as far as how much they're paying back to that creator each month in this  little monthly report. You have a problem with them hiding those numbers that they put in their  own pockets, considering that the platform is free to the user to upload? No. I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's no different from Apple and the Android app store saying we're going to take 30% or now we're  going to take 15% and then 30% or whatever. Google for a long time didn't say what the percentage was.  They're more transparent about it than they used to be. But it's not as simple as people make it  out. So, you know, as a journalist, I had to learn business through the back door. And I remember  when I became an executive and I learned things like corporate allocations. Oh, that chair doesn't  cost what you think it costs. You're going to look it up in the catalog and you're going to say that  chair costs this much money. No, no, no, no, no. We're advertising that chair back as a cost to  corporate. And so what's profit to you depends on how much we charge you for that chair,  Mr. Jarvis. And how much we charge you for our corporate services and the cost of marketing  and so on and so on and so on. So it's not really a simple calculation to say here's how  Google profited from this YouTube video versus how Ant Pruitt profited from that same video.  So I give them that slack. However, again, it goes back to trust. The more they tell us,  the more trust they'll be. Yeah, that's fair. One last Facebook story, which I want to mention,  because I think quite highly of it. You said this last one was the last one.  I lied. Don't you know this? I lie. I'm untrustworthy. Or you could say that I'm old  and have an excuse for forgetting. Unlike you, young Ms. Hickenbotham, I can't even remember  last week that you published. So don't make fun of the old guy. What did I show last week on the  show? The history is history. So Instacart just stole Fiji Simo as their CEO. That's a big loss  to Facebook. Fiji was a present and superstar. She's only 35 years old. The CEO of Instacart moved up  and they grabbed the chance to get Fiji. She wants to Fiji. She wants to be a CEO. And now she is.  She was in charge of Blue, as they call it, the Facebook app. She's the one who made video as big  as it was on Facebook. She's done product after product after product. She's been brilliant at  this. And so it's a big loss to Facebook. Casey Newton in his paid newsletters, which I get,  had some reports from inside that Mark had gotten mad at, angry about losing engineering talent.  They'd been losing a lot of it in executive talent and everything got bad at Fiji, said one report.  And then other people said, no, that's not the way that meeting occurred. But that he's frustrated  about this loss. And this is a sizable loss in Fiji. I don't know if you ever watched her in  Facebook presentations or not. I don't cover Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sorry. I'm like, unless they're talking about their servers, I don't talk to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Now the story that I'm more interested in is something that she said there from  the article was people are leaving. Why? Is there any illusion that anything that leads to why these  developers are leaving? Because Facebook is big and Facebook is clearly making a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, this is the problem with the book is it's not hard for any large company to find people  who left who are going to tell you, I'm so smart. I left and here's why. Right. Okay. And I know,  but I've gotten unhappy at a job. I want everybody else to be as happy as I am, prove I'm right.  And sometimes though, I'm the unhappy one. I'm the grumpy one, as if you can imagine that.  And they all have reasons to be happy. I'm out of favor or I'm not going to do what I want to do  or so on. It's really hard to judge a culture that way. I think there's obviously problems  in Facebook, but some people are saying they left. One guy left over the issue of transparency in  the story about the, we talked about a few minutes ago, I was going to leave because they're  disappointed in the ethics of Facebook. I think that's perfectly plausible, but sometimes it's  somebody got a better job or it's hard to judge that, I think. Yeah. I guess I could see people

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  leaving the company because of the morals of things like that. And they feel like Facebook  should be doing better here and there socially and whatnot. I get that. No one wants to work  for the evil empire. Well, I don't know. I don't know. I know a lot of people,  black shiny helmets, those things look pretty cool. They got a whole starship they can use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know people there who are some of the nicest, most morally driven people I know because they

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  think they can fix it. Right. Well, I would say to anybody, again, they get less, they just got a  new privacy person, Jeff something, something. But I will say when you walk into those situations,  you might buy the idea that you can fix it. And in about a year, maybe two, I bet this person

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  leave. You got to at least got to judge yourself and say, was I fooling myself or did I make some  progress here? I'm reminded of, I don't know if I told this story before, my sister is a  Presbyterian minister and she, I remember being, when she was in Princeton many years ago at a party,  Jeb Stuart McGruder went to jail for Nixon and Watergate. I know you're both too young to know  what that is, but I'm going to keep on going anyway. I know what Watergate was, my goodness.  I'm joking. So he told the story of you'd get up, you'd be at work at the White House and you'd  spend all day killing Howard Hunt's 15 incredibly dangerous, stupid schemes. You'd get home at night  and you'd pour yourself with scotch and congratulate yourself, boy, I killed 14 really crappy things  today. But of course the 15th was Watergate, right? It's the one that got through. And so you can,  it's all relative. You can say, wow, I got rid of a lot of bad stuff, but did you get rid of  enough bad stuff? Did you create enough good stuff? I think that's what the Trump people say, the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  people in the Trump, like the career politicians and the Trump administration, they're like, well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  we killed a lot of crazy stuff. The person coming after me could have been worse, don't we know?  I want to tell one quick Instacart funny on myself here. So I love Instacart. Instacart has been  a godsend to get food to my 95 year old father in Florida. So we wouldn't go out of the apartment.  And so once a week or thereabouts, I call and I say, Pa, what do you need? Grapefruit. I know  you need it every week, Pa. I like those frozen pizzas. You got me the pepperoni ones, but the  small ones, the big ones don't fit in the freezer. You got the small ones. Okay, fine. So we go  through the list. I do all this and it's routine. And I tell them, Pa, call me before you run out.  So I don't have to, because sometimes I'm ordering from Instacart and they don't have the pizzas. And  then he gets mad because they substitute something else. And I've got to make sure he's got enough  pizzas and it works. So it's a whole McGill out here. Right. But he called this week. I tried to  call him on last week on Wednesday and I'll let you know. Sure. Yeah. Thursday, call him again.  No, I'll let you know Friday. It doesn't answer the phone. Friday night. He calls at 10 o'clock  waking up my wife. I need to talk to Jeff. I need groceries. Because he's obviously out of his pizza.  So I go on Instacart and make it easy as pie. You can go to your previous orders and say,  order that again, order that again. And when they don't have the regular crust pepperoni pizza,  you can order the thin crust pepperoni pizza as an alternative and they will substitute that  automatically. It's a wonderful system. Right. Well, so what happened obviously the week before  is they had substituted the bag of grapefruit for the individual grapefruits. And so when I ordered,  I just looked on whatever came last week. So I clicked on the bag. When I meant to order  seven grapefruits, I ended up ordering seven bags of grapefruit. Oh my gosh. Boy. Which landed  on my father's doorstep and he calls in a panic. What do I do with all these grapefruit?  Yeah. So that's my little tale on myself. So grapefruit. I bombarded my poor father  with grapefruit. Seven bags of grapefruit. So anyway, so why don't we, so Leo's very smooth  about how he does this. He kind of just takes a little moment in the breath, but I'm not smooth  and I like to mess him up every time anyway. So here's where-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you just don't like to breathe. That's what I think. Jeff never pauses. You're too New

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  York for the pause. That's okay. You can take the little pause now. You got a problem with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're going to take a little pause right now. And now we're going to play the trumpets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right guys, help me out on these stories. Cause a lot of gaming in here and I,  eh, I don't do games. So the first story is- Like your stasis panicked look.  Yeah. I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't do it. I don't do it. I'm boring, I guess. But I don't do  it. So Android 12 will let you play games before they finish downloading. Speaking of people who  can't stand a little pause in life. Can't they just wait 30 seconds? They've got a huge bandwidth.  The stuff comes so fast. You can download whole movies in the time it takes to breathe. And now  you can't wait for it to download before you've got to start playing it. Really? This is a feature.  Tell me, am I crazy here? I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it just depends. If you're on a cellular network, it does take time, I guess. I don't know.  Is that anxious? You've got to play this game. Some people are. Some people are.  And think about the technical stuff happening behind the scenes. This could be good for like  buffering or low data rate kind of places. This could be an interesting technological development.  Although the first comment on the story is literally some dude who sounds just like you.  How big of a hurry are we in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like Raymond's mother right now. What? You can't wait for a game? What's the problem here?  All right. Well, that's big news to some people. You're not going to have to wait for the game.  You're going to start playing immediately.  All right. Now let's go on. So Stadia, Google tries to attract Stadia publishers with better  revenue sharing. This goes to our story before, right? So they all charge 30% to your point,  Ant. They are transparent about it. They say it's, that's where it doesn't work. It's 30%  of the take you would take in. If you were doing this on your own, we take 30% now because Stadia  is, tell me if I'm wrong here, kind of a flop. You're not wrong, sir. I'm not wrong for once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you playing Stadia games, Ant? No, sir. I had the whole free trial and all of that  for pro and whatnot. And they sent this controller to me and they sent this Chromecast Ultra.  And I did it for about three days. And that's about it. It was pretty,  but first off, I'm just not much into games like that. And secondly, the whole experience wasn't  quite what I was used to because you're doing it over the Chromecast Ultra. So you get the drop  packets and it's every now and then it's a little bit jittery and you need that to be plugged in  via ethernet. And that wasn't something I was ready to do far as running an ethernet cable to my TV  downstairs to play video games and just, no, no. But another thing though is I didn't even know  this conference was going on. This whole keynote from Google and gaming, I didn't even know this  was going on. I think this happened Monday. Did you even know? No, but I wouldn't. I would look at

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it as game and that's all I need to see. And I'm not making fun of every place games. I'm actually  jealous of you because you have a whole way to amuse yourself and enjoy something. I just get  nervous and I don't want to lose or I don't know what I'm figuring out. I used to play video games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've never been a big time gamer or anything like that, but I used to play video games quite  regularly. I used to spend at least two hours a night playing Call of Duty on PlayStation back in

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the day. Even with that wasted youth, see what Ant has become. It's an inspiring story of how you can

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  overcome a waste therapeutic. I was going to say, Jeff, you may not have games, but you have TikTok.  Yeah, that's the thing. So Stacey, I don't think I've ever actually heard. Are there gamers in

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  your house, including you? No, my daughter plays Minecraft and Star Stables and those are it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I'll play board games. Yeah, well, that's because, you know, that's, that's,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that's my husband. Oh, my husband has an Xbox. I think he plays hockey and sports console games,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but how often do you walk in on him on Andrew playing hockey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not often lately. I don't think the Xbox has been plugged in for a while. Oh, we did, we,  we did just dance on the Wii. That was fun. That was, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I remember doing all that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  stuff, but it just, it died down for me personally. I enjoyed it, but I just found other stuff to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have recently tried to start back playing Team Fortress on my computer here, but I'm, I'm still  probably going to do that maybe two or three times a month because right now when it's time for me to  just sort of get away from the world and wind down or have my own little therapy sessions, there's  other things I'd rather do. I'd rather be sitting in Lightroom trying to do some post-processing.  I'd rather be watching something on YouTube. I'd rather be, you know, it's just, that's just me.  I'd rather be researching Gutenberg. My husband plays as a way to connect with my nephews.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they'll get together and play together. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think any, any habit is legit,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but yeah, that's the, that's an option. I don't mean it's illegit to play the game. I'm just saying  that's a good one. That's what I'm like, I'm like, okay, well, thank you, Jeff. It's a good reason to waste  hours of your life. It's okay. It's okay. I'm joking people. I'm just joking. Okay. Don't at me.  So Stadia continuing this line of desperation is created a toolkit to help bring over games from Windows.  How exciting are Windows games? It just always struck me as a bit of a oxymoron. Fun Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just the, I play my video games on a Windows box. Oh, I think a lot of PC gaming is a thing, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's big. That's a real legit thing. Hey, you know how miserable Google workspace makes you and  I, Jeff, because we have bifurcated Google accounts. Now everyone in five countries can have that same

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  experience for the low price of $7.99 a month. As an introductory price, which will go up to $9.95,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think after that. Yeah, I think it's, it's yes. But I thought that was hilarious. I was like, oh,  don't do it. Y'all. Yeah. Google's making workspace. Is it work? Yeah. Workspace.  Workspace. That's this month's name. Yeah.  Yes. In Brazil, Canada, Japan, Mexico, and the US for individuals, which means you can have some  premium features that the free one doesn't have and that you'll get your own dedicated account that  will screw you forever when trying to play with Google's stuff. So I have, I have Workspace,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  mainly because I wanted my Buzz Machine domain to be my main domain. That's why. But way back when,  a good friend of mine and somebody who I worked with both at my company and when I worked in  advance and at the school. So I said, you want an email address? Sure. I'll take one. So he and his  wife have the only other two people on my workspace. So I keep on paying for the corporate things so I  can have my old friend who I haven't talked to in five years still have his email. I mean, I'm  probably gonna need to email him and see if he answers it. It'll tell me whether I still need  to keep paying for it or not. Maybe I can switch to 799 a month to be irritated for less. But on  my Gmail, when I go into my Gmail, I'm going to be able to find out who's legit easier. We talked  about this some time ago, but I think they're finally rolling it out. Is the Google going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  roll out authenticated company logos on email? I've had that for a while, but yeah, that's,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  yeah. They are also, if you use Gmail and want to schedule virtual meetings, they will  let you respond RSVP to a meeting. Yes, I'm going, I'll be there in person or I will be there  virtually, which I think is kind of neat as someone who's worked remote since 2004.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, somebody who wants to not go to the office very much. I'm going into school to teach.  That's fine. I love the students and it'll be better. But you're not dragging me into New York  for a one hour meeting. We're doing that on Zoom now. You're there. That's fine. I'm coming in on  the big screen. I'll be the big head in the room. I'm not private in for a one hour meeting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that just seems to be the new cultural shift now, right?  Yes. Yes.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I was going to say that I think if you're going to have, I do think there's truth in if you  have a virtual meeting, you should have almost all of your people be virtual, right? So, or like if  you're going to have remote workers, then you treat everyone like a remote worker. And we did  that at GigaOM and it worked out really well. Like some days people would be in the office,  but even the California people sometimes would work from home and attend whatever meetings we  were having virtually, which made sense because 80% of the reporting staff actually worked not  in California. And that kind of lessens any sort of drama over, oh, you're so far away. You must not,  being a second class citizen. And I will say working for Fortune remotely, I was 100% a  second class citizen when I was hanging out like on the Polycom during the editorial meetings every

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  day. And you move that closer to you. I can't hear you. I can't hear you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it's so frustrating. I just, it was me, like the EU, the London bureau chief, and then like  one other person. And we would be on our Slack channel because there was a Slack channel for  the editorial meeting, the editorial meeting, and it just sucked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was thinking more along the lines of just how everybody is saying, you know, man, we just spent  the last year in all of these virtual meetings trying to get stuff done that we would have done  the previous year in person. And we were able to get it done and we were able to get it done  pretty much pain free and more cost effective and a little bit more efficient. So there's no point in  bringing Mr. Jarvis into the city just for an hour, because we're going to knock it out with  his webcam and he's going to, it's not going to change his brain just because he's in the city.  He's still going to be able to talk about whatever it is that we need him to discuss over this virtual  meeting. And I think that's just the big cultural shift that we're starting to see more and more.  And I know there's a story about Google in the rundown and they're reading again on remote work  and so forth, but we'll get into that later maybe. Yeah, we will. Yeah. So Google is on the one hand,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  capping meets formerly unlimited group video calls to an hour for free accounts at the same time with  the story that Spacey mentioned either, but we'll sell you an account where we'll uncap it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why not? Well, this is only for three or more people. So if you have two people,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you can still talk for hours. Oh, okay. All right. So this is trying to say,  you can't use this for companies anymore. Yeah, why not? Right. So if you and your sister or BFF,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  like spend all day on a meet while you're working or something, I don't know if people do that.  As long as you have only you and that one person, you're fine. Oh, okay. Good. Good. Two more here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google Lens is redesigning itself to go more towards screenshot over live view,  which I guess I understand you want both. Obviously you want to be able to say,  what is that in a photo? But you also want to be able to point your phone at something and say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  what's that? I want both. I hardly ever use Lens, but the few times that I've had to use it,  I needed it and I'm glad it was available to me. And one of those times was when I was in Shanghai,  trying to figure out where to eat. I don't read that language, you know, but everything was,  nothing was in English and I needed to figure out what the heck that was. And it was really  easy to just use Google Lens to pull my phone up and look at it. And it displayed,  this is beef, this is pork and blah, blah, blah. Oh, and it was great. I use Lens for QR codes.  Does that, is that? Yeah. Yeah. I've done that too for the, here recently with things starting  to open back up here in Sonoma County, there's the menus are all on the QR code. So yeah,  I don't use Lens often and the couple of times I had to use it, it's been, I'm glad I had it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  especially in China. I went to a meeting of El Pais in Spain once and I'm sitting there as  the dumb American who's the ugly American, not speaking. I speak a little bit of German, but  badly it doesn't do a lot. And so I amused them because this is a couple of years ago,  I would go up with my phone to the screen where they're putting PowerPoint and said,  it would translate it for me. That was great. Who will translate? You mentioned this the other week,  Stacey, it's a miracle. It's not heralded enough what's happening with translation. It's just amazing.  I agree with you. All right. So Stacey and I are agreeing like crazy. It's just Leo who causes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  trouble, right? No, no, no, no, no, no. Something's going on in the atmosphere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff, I think you're being nicer because yeah, you know, I don't know what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, I should be, if I follow Leo's example, I should be the devil's advocate, but that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can't imagine you playing devil's advocate. Can you imagine that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I don't do well. I'm not good at it. So the last one, Chrome, I don't understand it  anyway because it went up after I read the rundown. So I don't even know what I'm saying  right now. Chrome will let you turn on an HTTPS first mode. Does anybody have any idea what that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  means? I don't. It means you only go to secure websites? Yeah.  A default view of HTTPS versus HTTP. And if a site pops up that's not HTTPS, it has a banner  at the top warning. That's all set there by default.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay. That's a good thing. All right. Well, on that low key note,  it's time for the end of the changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, there was kind of an interesting thing in this blog post Google wrote about the last issue,  but I will not share it. Please go ahead. Well, okay. We did end the changelog, but they said that  people, when only 11% of people knew what the little lock in the corner meant for HTTPS sites,  and instead users thought it meant the whole site was trustworthy as opposed to the server.  That's a problem. Yeah. So that's one of the reasons. So they said they were going to re-examine  that lock icon because people think of it in a totally different way. I just thought that was  kind of interesting. I'm like, oh, I could see where they got that. But also that's terrible  for people. But they don't know. You can only go on. Oh yeah. No, I get why they would be like,  oh, that's a secure thing. I must be in a secure place. But right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's like the stupidity of the early days. I actually had a librarian  tell students that if it said .edu or .org, you could trust it. Right. It's the same kind of  idiocy. Yeah. Yeah. Right. You don't want that. We should go to the story that you mentioned,  Ant, which is that the Google employees are mad about the search engines, search giants,  hypocritical remote work policies. It doesn't help if your boss has said,  well, you are all going to the office, but I'm going to call in from New Zealand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, okay. So I know Urs Hötzel and he's, I can't imagine him being great with employees anyway.  I mean, he's not a jerk. No, he's not a jerk. He's just, he doesn't, he thinks like 80 times  faster than you and he's not impatient, but it's not like he's patient either. You know, like,  he's just a very smart man who I don't think comes to everybody else's level very often.  Does that make sense? Yeah. So I don't know if I'd want to work in the office with him.  I don't know how much value he brings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead. Go ahead. No, you go ahead. I read this and all I could think about is just the fact that  people, they went through the period of, oh my gosh, I have to work from home now because it  was something new and with the whole pandemic and just all of the readjustment that took, it was  pretty tough on people. And then it got to a point of, okay, I think I got the hang of this.  And then it got to the point of, well, dang, I think I like this. I like working at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And we're better off as a company too, as you said a minute ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. So I think people are sort of pushing back on going back to work because you know what,  it seems to work for them. I was talking to Queen Pruitt just the other day about this because  for the longest, my family members in Carolina, when I actually were able to talk to them,  they all just would, they would call me up at random times in the day because they knew I was  working from home. And I'm thinking, well, I'm still working, but people just assume because  you work from home, you're not working or you're not as busy or not as focused or anything like  that. So I think companies are trying to fight a little bit of that stuff too because they just  assume, you're at home, there's no way you're as focused as you would be here in the office.  And I think that's baloney. I've been working at home for most of my adult life, professional life.  And I remember when it all started, it was because I would send emails late in the night or whatever  to my superiors because I'm a horrible sleeper. And I figured since I'm awake, I might as well  do something productive and I would work. And they were like, well, you know what, why are you  sending me these things now? And I said, because when I'm here, I can't get to all of that because  there's too many other distractions and things getting in the way that pushes some of my work  down. Not that I was just being lazy or anything, but it's just that I just had too many distractions.  And if I'm home, I can focus more and be way more effective. And they pretty much said, okay, well,  let's have you stay home. And that was it. And I stayed home and just continued to get a whole lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  more done. And it just works for me. I don't want to put you on the spot, Ant, which I'm about to do,  obviously, but I'm saying that. Is it going to be an adjustment coming back to the studio?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is a bit of an adjustment for me because when all of this went down with us and there was a lot  of trepidation, but I remember saying quite openly, I'm used to this. I've been creating  content by myself for a very, very long time. So I already had lighting and stuff like that.  It was no big deal. But at the same time, when I am in the studio with our other co-hosts, Mr.  Sargent and Mr. Howell, we have our host office, but the majority of the time we're in there with  headphones on and we're focused, we're working. I see Mr. Sargent sitting in front of me, but I  don't have anything to say to him because I'm busy. He's busy. Mr. Howell is usually sitting  right there and he's busy. So it's still a quiet environment that I'm used to that allows me to  just sit down and do what I need to do. I remember when the managing editor of the San

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Francisco Examiner yelled at me one day because I was nosy as hell and I was looking around in the  office and gossiping. He said, God damn it, Jarvis, I pay you to be the town crier, not the office  crier. I was a gossip. I like to see what was going on. Who's talking to who? All reporters

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  are super chatty. Yes. Oh yeah. I had a superior.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had a superior at one of my previous jobs that came into town to visit me and visit the team,  you know, and all the whole bureaucratic stuff or whatever. And the office, the rest of the office  had no idea my superior was in town, but he was sitting next to me at another desk. People just  assumed he was another vendor, contractor or whatever. And all day long people are walking  up to my desk, bringing me this issue, that issue and asking me how to do this or whatever.  And I did it in addition to my regular work. And at the end of the day, that superior was like,  how do you get anything done? I said, I don't when I'm here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the price you pay. All right. So let's have kind of a lightning round of some quick stuff and  then we'll go toward the close here. Super Mario 64 sells for one point unopened, $1.56 million

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  at auction. That's just people buying their childhood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep. Yep. You make fun of an NFT, you make fun of that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly. It's in the same vein. Whatever works for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the line that everybody wrote today, that fleets are fleeting.  Twitter's fleets are dead. They're gone. They're away. More soon to be, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anybody surprised by that? No, but it's disappointing considering I just did  two fleets like two days ago. But that's the first time I've done them in a very long time too. So  there's that. I never made one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. I just never, I made a couple, but I just never.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yours were entertaining though, Miss Stacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They were all my dog. Basically fleets were where you could hang out with my dog.  That's it. Yeah, they weren't good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the same with Facebook stories. I don't get Facebook stories. Facebook's like,  so and so just add it to their story. That's a photo. I don't get it. I was thinking  that in a way, it's one of the reasons I respect what Jack's doing on Twitter these days,  just because yeah, okay, fine. We can try to copy everybody and it was dumb. And so we're stopping.  And I think that trying to copy everybody else is just a really stupid strategic way to go.  Try to outdo somebody else with something new for them to copy, but that's not what happens.  Twitter also announced that they're going to let you in iOS edit after the fact,  who can reply to your tweets? Gee, that tweet didn't go the way I thought it would.  I want to change that. I think that's smart. I think that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I still wish we had edit mode in general, but at the same time, we probably won't get it. Someone

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  brought up a good point. Go ahead. Sorry. I was going to say, I think we would miss it  if we got edit mode because it would give us like, that's our number one complaint about Twitter.  So if they gave it to us, what else will we complain about? We're all unified.  They got rid of the fail whale and they had to have something else.  Yeah. Sorry, Ed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Someone brought up a point of if we had this feature, there's the potential of the narrative  being changed with the tweet. People are going to take the original tweet and it's like, oh crap,  I read this this way. And now it's another version. It totally changes it because they  removed the word and this and that. And I guess that could stir up a lot of  misinformation in some kind of way. Especially with screenshots and things like that. So who knows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, Jamerby, I think I messed up the link here, but line 125,  see if you can get the Twitter link working and scroll to the top.  Marissa Maciel, I'm guessing. I don't know. Standard tuber.  I was in love with a stock photo couple and she wants to write a screenplay. Oh no, it doesn't  work. Jamerby, if you cut and paste the actual Twitter link, it's one of those cases where  I changed to a better link and it has the old link in there. I don't know why they do that.  I should have warned you, Jamerby. I'm sorry. I thought I had, I didn't. I knew better.  This is where Leo realizes that you just skip it and keep going because it's going to drag down  the show. You know what? The problem is after waiting, it's rarely worth the wait. So maybe  we should skip anyway. It depends on the story. It's a fun story, but I can live with that.  I can live with that. Smart Garage, they're moving right along. Smart Garage struck me as  kind of a silly story in the Quick Takes. But then I thought about, then I read the story and I  thought, no, garages are stupid. If I go to parking garages. And so what if you only need  five minutes or you can change the pricing based on traffic and need or it can perform other

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  services for you? It becomes interesting. So they've been talking about this forever and  really, it has not come to fruition because the software behind it's super hard. And cities don't  want to pay an ongoing subscription for something in a parking garage. And this is where, because  there's no unifying technology that every car has. So there's a lot of things working against  this concept. It's a concept everyone loves, but it's freaking hard. And also, if you don't  pay your bills, your parking garage suddenly becomes stupid and everyone hates it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. So nevermind moving right along because that's never going to happen. That's  basically what we're saying here. Amazon is naming new warehouse robots after Muppets.  As they say, what could go wrong? Ernie killed me. They're doing some Muppet washing.  Yeah. Yes. I've often said that Google thinks and all the platforms think of themselves as  snuffleupagus, as cuddly big monsters, but everybody else just sees them as monsters.  So maybe this is their effort. It's just an attempt. All right. So I'm headed down here.  If there's anything else you guys see, under other, I was fascinated by this on lines 184,  186, which I guess we're also talking about on Twitter. If we start with 184, Gimabee,  AI voice actors, and not that we didn't know this could happen. Obviously a lot of synthetic speech  is good already, but now it starts to be so good, especially for commercials and those kinds of  efforts. You can start to imagine hiring somebody to create the fake voice. And it's been talked  about too with actors themselves. But I think if you want to just play one or two samples there,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gimabee, otherwise known as John, sorry. The beauty and scary thing on this is  it could save folks a lot of money, but the scary part is that the dangerous stuff that could be  done with it because people could be so nefarious and say, was it deepfakes? Use it like deepfakes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Deepfakes for voice? Yeah. I did have someone train an AI to write like me and I found that  super creepy. He didn't ask my permission. He just told me afterwards that he did it.  That part is creepy. Go ahead.  Oh, I was just going to say, I mean, I hate the idea that, I mean, there's the obvious ego blow,  like, oh my gosh, my writing can be mimicked by a machine. But then there's also the, well,  then how could I prove, like, I write a lot. I don't remember everything I write. So someone  could come in and be like, you- Well, that's for sure you don't. Yeah, we learned that.  I know. Exactly. See? So if you think about it that way, you're like, wow, what if someone could  write like you and then write things that you didn't write? And you would be like, well,  it does sound like me. Super gaslighting right there. Okay. That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I kind of do the same thing. Did I really write that? Does that mean? I was once in a newspaper,  a small newspaper office with the executives and we had kind of a digital advisory board meeting.  We were talking, this is some years ago, we were talking about the efforts to write news copy,  especially sports copy. And there was a company to actually talk to, to do this, right? To take  formatted news, financial stories, sports stories, and turnout stories. And two desks away was the  young whippersnapper sports reporter. And I'm thinking, I'm trying to put myself in his head  thinking, oh crap, I'm going to lose my job. They're right over there talking about losing my job.  So I finally just kind of said, Hey Joe, what do you think about that? He said, thank goodness.  I don't have to write all those boring high school sports stories. I can go off instead and get  boring jock quotes. But anyway, where were we? It's true. It's like those market stories I had

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to learn to write. God, that sucked. Yeah, exactly. All right. So line 186, John,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I found this fascinating and you guys talked about it on Twitter already before,  but AI was taught to speak other languages and then they tried to have it speak English  and it speaks English with the accent you would expect from a person speaking that language,  which just blows my mind. That's crazy, right? Isn't that great? So if you look at the,  at somebody from Denmark, how you doing there, John? So if you go to, yeah, good. So this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the Netherlands. John will now click. Hello, good sir. Can you please tell me what 20 times 10 is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That sounds like people I know from Amsterdam. And you go to, it doesn't work for every language,  but you go to a lot of other languages there. Let's see. Can you, can you find French,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Italiano down there? You see that John? Hello, good sir. Can you please tell me what 20 times 10 is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Obviously it ain't perfect. Not that there's a perfect accent, but it shows the,  the phonetical parts of a language that become part of the brain to transfer over. I just found  this utterly fascinating. I loved it. I just loved it. We're going to find out next week that  it's all wrong and it's not real story. And I just got taken, but I'm going to believe it for now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because I want to. You know, but as discussed on Sunday's show, when people are buying  the services of a voiceover actor to do an ad or whatever, they're not just trying to,  to pay for the face or, or just, you know, the pretties of it, if you will, they're wanting that  extra oomph that that voiceover that that actor brings to the table, you know, Mr. Laporte does  our ad reads and he does them unlike anybody else there in the studio. And everybody knows it,  you know, because it's just him. The copy is going to say this and that, and he's going to,  he's going to hit everything in that copy, but he's also going to put some extra stuff in there  that I'm just not going to have or Mr. Sargent's not going to have, and it's just going to work.  So I think we're still going to be safe as long as we still have some of that human

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to it that AI just doesn't have yet. But if it, if it eliminates the drudgery, if it's,  if you don't have to write that market report anymore, then I think that's a fine thing. It  puts more resource into where it's valuable. Any other stories you guys want to hit in here anywhere?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In the quick takes or just in general? Anywhere, anywhere. Oh, the world is your oyster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You hit everything that I was looking at. Oh no, LG rollable TVs. They're finally,  finally going to be here in the U.S. Who's buying one for a hundred grand? How much?  I was going to say for a hundred grand? I'm going to buy like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't think. Honey, you know how you hate having a huge TV? I'm going to get a TV that rolls away.  You like that? Can I do it? Can I just buy it? Okay. Just buy a frame TV and then you've got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can turn it into art or your NFT viewer when you're not. Oh, NFT viewer exactly. Much cheaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh man. That, I remember seeing those at CES and it looked great, but it just,  no, not for everybody. It's totally fine to have my thin OLED TV out on display. That's not really  bothering anybody, but you know, I guess there's something to your TV being able to hide in your  viewing room. How long ago did you buy your main TV? For me, it's, my TV is fairly new. It may be  three years old, four years old. KC.  That was after having a DLP TV for the longest. I had that DLP forever and I replaced the bulb  in it twice, I think, because it was just cheap to do that and it still looked good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think ours was bought in 2013 with our new house, with like when we built our house. And I think,  I think this is that same TV. I don't know. We don't really watch a lot of TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I got mine free because I did a talk for Sony and that's how I got paid  many, many years ago. I was like 15 years old and I don't know that I'm,  I get 4K now, but I don't know that I care. It's amazing. Oh, I got a quick question,  Stacey. I want maybe you know about this from security. Russia's ransomware group  goes the way of Twitter fleets and disappears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dark trace or our evil theories are evil. Was it our evil disappearing or dark trace  disappearing that you're talking about? I think it was our evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, okay. Cause dark trace also disappeared. Does this mean something actually happened or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It could, or it could just be, did they get paid? Cause if they got paid, they could have just been  like, all right, we're paid. Now we go away. I just, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Again. Yeah. All right. Anything else for you, Stacey, before we get to our,  watch for calls, watch for calls. So, um, okay. We can't, nothing. Yeah.  Okay. Thank you, Ant for a good rundown. All right. This is a moment, but I'm going to take  an uncharacteristic breath.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And now we're, how smooth was that guys? Huh? How smooth was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was just, oh, you crushed it, sir. Such a dag gum pro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now we're here with things, things and stuff. Ant, why don't you start us off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm trying to get my link in here for Mr. Jammer B, but I keep scrolling past this section here,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but it's the, I've been watching HBO Max here and there.  And there's a series on there called Generation Hustle. I just clicked on it for the heck of it.  And the first two episodes didn't really do much for me. One was about WeWork. I already knew that  story. But this one that I watched the other night was talking about scammers. And it's this hip hop  artist. I believe his name was TJX6 or something like that, X-Ray six. And it was so fascinating.  That this rapper put out an album that basically walked people through different types of  cyber scams. He told people how to get phones for next to nothing and how to do, excuse me,  how to get on tour and whatnot. And, and he ended up getting himself a $5 million record  deal because his numbers were just through the roof for Instagram and YouTube and whatnot.  And he got himself a record deal. Yeah, that's him. Got himself a record deal,  signed his contract. Of course he didn't sign it in his real name,  but a lot of it's just, it's just brilliant on his part from a marketing standpoint,  even though it's a lot of serious stuff in there that people go to jail for.  Quite often. It's just, I don't know, it's just a different take. And I watched it last night and  the youngest hardhead walked in on me watching it. And I asked him, did he know this rapper? And he  didn't know the rapper. And we started listening to some of the stuff that he was saying. And  I was telling the hard ass, did you know, haven't I told you guys about  ABCD when it comes to your social media? And he said, no, I don't know. And I said,  haven't I told you guys about ABCD when it comes to your social media? Because I used to be  really protective over their social media. I'm not as protective now, but it was just neat to see that  they could see that on the screen. And it's not just the old bald head dad yelling at them to be  careful with their online presence and things like that. Good. All right. I'm going to go first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cause I want Stacey's to be the big banger closer. Cause I care about it. I'm curious to hear what  it is. I'm going to mention a couple of things real quick. Uh, tick tock caused a rush on  ukulele sales. I just kind of like butterfly. Oh, okay. To make musical things that would  shocking. Same as bad enough as musicals, ukulele musical. Um, I think the most important story of  the week, but it's not gonna be my number, but Popeyes is planning nuggets. Um, that's, that's,  they're going to kill the spicy nuggets. I think that's a choice. I would imagine,  but get classic nuggets, but they're going to be Mondo nuggets. They're the Popeye fried chicken.  And you looking forward to that Stacey looking forward to that? Uh, no, no, no, no. Cause,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  cause they're bad for you or just cause you don't like it. No, no. But when I want fried chicken,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want fried chicken on the bone dad, gum it. Cause that's, that's okay. I'm excited. I'm excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because we can't eat it. Chick-fil-a anymore. And so Popeyes, if you combine their chicken nuggets,  especially if they're spicy with their biscuit, Oh my God, you'd have like big chicken minis.  And I would be very excited about that. That works. Honey in there with the spicy and the biscuit  and the butt. Oh, okay. And then my heart would stop. I mean, I actually went to Popeyes today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got the sandwich and I was halfway through eating it when I realized they left the mayo off.  Which was better for me, but disappointing. Yeah. Popeyes. I'm okay. The pickles. That was  what I said to myself. I was, I wasn't going to go storming back in to get the mayo. Cause it was  better for me not to have it. Cause I was eating something very fried. My, my, my, my, my stuff of  the week is dead startup toys. Oh, I'm glad someone brought this up. I love it. I love this. I love  this. This reminds me of the great old site F company, but this is hardware things that have  died. Some of which we've talked about in the show, the Juicero. It's kind of a, what do you call that  thing? When you make a big deal of the tombstone, paperware, paperware. No, it's when you, when you  make a big deal and they make it plastic and they put it up there. Right. So this is, this is a  tombstone for the Juicero, the Jibo, Jibo, Jibo. What was it? Jibo. I think used to sponsor this  show at some point. That's right. I think they did the one laptop per child, which I thought was  going to change the world. I was, yeah, I remember that. And the coolest cooler. And of course,  the Taranis mini lab. Now, sadly they're all sold out having done better as joke  tombstones than they did as businesses. But I think, yeah, like this. So we could soon have  a tombstones to the things that Google has killed, but that'll be another day.  Why not? A lot of, a lot of plastic right there. All right, Stacey. So you get the, you get to shut  up yourself and myself in the middle of the night now. Okay. So here's my app. You know, y'all, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  think I've talked about this because I've tried various snore stopping things, but I snore and I  thought I snored a lot. So I downloaded an app called Snore Lab and it's an iOS and Android app.  Here's Snore Lab and it's free. You could, there is a paid version. And basically what it does is  you plug your phone in, you set it face down next to you while you sleep, you hit start and it  records your snoring. So y'all, I'm going to take you to snoring. We got to hear, oh wow. You're

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  going to hear me snore. You saw your house. You were seeing your snoring. This is Stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  post privacy today. Oh wait, hold on. It's okay. I got it. Hold on. This is going to be fun and  complicated. So let's see if I can do this. I'm going to switch out my head buds.  I forgot what then I was trying to play something on this. It was going to break  because the Bluetooth Bluetooth. Okay. Now we're going to play Stacey snoring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it playing? There it is. That sounded cute. Oh, that's so loud. That's so low. Here's some  lovely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay. That's my story. Could y'all hear that? Stacey, that's nothing. That's not snoring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's like a, that's like a little animal chirping happily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Kylo is louder than that. That's not snoring. So that's what keeps my husband awake

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  at night. I want y'all to know this and makes me feel like I'm going to send you a Kylo and  I'm probably going to send you a queen Pruitt too. I sat here and this is what this is the user  interface. It records your snores and it gives you a snore score. It gives you the time that  you're snoring. And so it says that when people download this app, they have a snore score of  around 25. Mine is one. So I felt a sense of really frustrated anger at my husband who's made me feel  like a total terrible person. Like I've been taping my mouth shut. I bought the smart Nora.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We got to call him out on that. That's I sense a New York Times trend story coming on this.  The snores revolt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, cause I felt bad and like he would go and spend the night like sometimes he's like,  Stacey, you know, it was just too much last night. Cause like sometimes, you know, my migraine  medicines, they sometimes I'll take like a muscle relaxers cause my shoulders get all, and then,  then I'm like just gone. So anyway, so this app lets you track it. It also offers you some insights  that say things like you have the option of saying like, did you drink the night before,  you know, so you can start recognizing patterns. You can, I mean, so some of the, some of the,  like the, the factors they have include things like, did you fast four hours before dinner? Did  you drink alcohol? Were you congested? Did you take a shower? Did you eat? Yeah. So all of that's in  there. You can add them. And then what it does is it says things like, Hey, by the way, your  snoring seems to be related to this, or is your snoring, you know, this type, here's what,  here's what you should do about that. So basically,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  so I want to know, did you, did you take the app to Andrew and say, huh, huh, you think this is bad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did. I said, I will be, I will confess, you know, they did say that there is like  four quote unquote epic snores on here. So, but I mean, like last night I snored for a total of  three minutes and the night before I snored for a total of nine minutes. And that's not that terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, Mr. Andy, you're full of it, bro. I'm sorry.  I just got to call it like it is. I think he's full of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I, and I, I get it. I do snore, but, but no, you don't. I'm allergic to dust mites.  You chirp and chortle. That's not snoring. Well, when he snores, because he, I call that heavy  breathing and I think it's relaxing when I hear him breathing. I'm like, Oh, that's nice. He's  alive. He's alive. Well, it's both he's alive and he's sleeping. You know, I feel like comforted  that he's happy and asleep. Anyway, I get that. So if y'all have been told that you snore, this  might help you stop or at least help you evaluate as you're trying things to stop. Or when your  marital fight. Yes. Or it will help you tell your husband or wife or whomever that they are nuts.  And the sap proves it. Get the app. You can Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, all I want to say at the end of this is I hope this show doesn't get a high store score.  Thank you, Stacey. Thank you, Ant. Thank you, John. Thank you, Leo, for going on vacation. I  hope you and company are having a great time and thank you audience for tolerating us for a long  time, but a lot of stories, a lot of great stuff. And so that is I got one more thing. Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I meant to add this to my thing. And it's, it's a shout out to one of our listeners, Miss Gabrielle.  Last week, I, Miss Stacey was, was doing a little demonstration and I asked her to do it again,  because it just looked like it had been perfect for Jeff. Huh? Well, look what happened.  Oh no.  Sure enough, Miss Gabrielle was like, really? You had to bait me in creating a gift and sure enough,  she did. So shout out to her. Thank you so much. That is awesome. That is hilarious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's an NFT if I ever saw one. That's, that's worth buying.

Transcript:  I want y'all to know that I'm wearing a different black shirt than the black shirt.

Transcript:  It was so great when you did it. And I was like, yep, there's a moment. And today,  I think your other moment would be when he asked about this, the Nana leaf on the wall. And he was

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  like, Oh, look at your face. Gabrielle, thank you so much. My daughter will appreciate that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
