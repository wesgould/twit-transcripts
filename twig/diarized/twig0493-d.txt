Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Alright, and so what does that mean when when Stacy's out and Mike Elgin is in Stacy's place?  If we hop gallivant and sit, what are you doing Mike Elgin? I'm just confused with all the gallivanting

Transcript:  Mike is the ultimate gallivanter and roll hopper. It's true. I gallivant to another location and then once I'm there I sit

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was telling you before the show I am so like I respect you so much in in  Your ability to do what you do to just kind of travel the world and live your life  Like that. I just I love it. It's what a wonderful life choice the concept of the digital nomad was was arrived at in

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  97 I think by Hitachi executive who wrote a book called digital nomad and for a long time was just like oh that's crazy  Why would you do that?  well nowadays, it's actually lots and lots and lots of people do it and  It's a it's a technology enabled lifestyle. We talk about technology changing culture  This is a major way it can change culture and especially the thing that really kicked digital nomad living into the  Into high gear was the sharing economy Airbnb  Things like uber like you go to Mexico City  Which used to be super dangerous to take a taxi in Mexico still it still is to take a taxi in Mexico City  Everybody's like don't take a taxi  Uber is great. I mean, it's really great in Mexico City. So it's like the sharing economy has really transformed  Living abroad it sort of enables you to not have to own stuff  You just rent and borrow and you know, whatever share things everywhere you go and it feels and in many cases

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I imagine feels like home even though you're not you know  You don't have a home that you return to every single day  You're there long enough for it to feel home and you're actually living in a home if you're doing the sharing economy  You're living in someone's home that they've built up for you to you know to share with you

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We say we feel like temporary locals everywhere we go as we go there. We meet the neighbors we shop in local stores  we sort of get to know the place and we  Acclimate ourselves to the point where we just feel like locals and then we leave  Until the next time yeah, the hardest thing is you make friends everywhere and yeah  And then you've got you're always away from most of your friends  Yeah, okay, it's you know, but it's it's worth it because you do make all those friends. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so Mike I get this ad on Facebook all this time for the supposedly magic t-shirt that you'd like never have to wash

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do you own like one of those? No because no because my wife and I by which I mean my wife  And to a lesser extent just don't like synthetic fabrics  I mean she just everything we have is cotton or linen or something like that  So those things are pretty high-tech synthetic things. I'm fascinated by them, but I'd rather just have cotton stuff and wash it. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because all these places that you're staying they have washers and dryers and it's almost nobody has dryers

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a very no really ubiquitous dryers is a very American thing. Like, okay washers are everywhere and then people hang stuff  Yeah, and and so but but if you know what you're talking about Jeff the way they advertise it  They're like you don't need luggage because you only have one pair of underwear which never right and I'm like that's quite a  Sales pitch to say you don't need a pack. Yeah, because you never need to change your clothes  It's kind of gross actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For the suitcase that you can supposedly it's a briefcase it's a suitcase you can fit everything in they show you I think  Everything my whole house is in this one little thing  Think of you when I see that. Yeah, thanks

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean to me I think the ultimate business and I think there are things like this but not quite like this  But I'd love to see some entrepreneur out there if you're out there listening a service where you basically have  A checklist of stuff and if it's a winter you're gonna be winter somewhere  It's gonna be cold you just checklist all the cold winter stuff and then just like okay  And here's we're gonna where I'm gonna be and just have them ship it to you  Yeah, don't travel with luggage you can you can do the discount airlines that charge extra for checked baggage and stuff like that  But you don't have jet checked like baggage because they're gonna ship it to you and then you just ship it back  I don't know if that's feasible financially  I probably am too much of a cheapskate to actually use it  But I think a lot of people wouldn't be and I think that'd be a great service  It's your own clothes and just have them just sort of drifting around out there and they just come to you  Eventually it finds its way to you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wardrobe en route is something along those lines  There was a story. I feel like this was like three or four months ago  About a company that was all about digital nomad living  Where you would sign up with them someone who had never done it before would sign up with them and you know  I guess you'd you'd pay upfront a certain deposit or whatever and that would get you to your next destination  And something really bad happened with that company  I think it folded and a bunch of these people ended up getting stranded around the world  Because you're thinking about the fire festival  No, it's kind of sounds like the fire festival now that I'm saying it out loud  But it was a company that was built up and designed for this type of living and it ended up failing miserably  But in you know, in essence it ended up totally stranding all these people because they were able to get to their  Point a they weren't able to get back because there was no money to get back. That's terrible. It all evaporated

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's like what do I do now? Well, you you live in Thailand. I guess  But there are all kinds of really interesting and innovative innovative isn't that how they say it in England  Innovative innovative. Thank you. Yes. He goes to Europe a lot  That for housing for example  There's one fascinating one where you sign up and you I think you move every month to another member's house  somewhere else in the world everybody like  Yeah, but you you somebody staying in your house and move, you know, and they're there, you know, there's all kinds of different things the most  Common or things like Rome which is like they have locations that they've I guess purchased somewhere and you go there and you it's like  You're living in a dorm or something. And it's a bunch of people they seem to skew young  They seem to be geared toward people who are entrepreneurs or whatever because they want to work together  They have fast Wi-Fi and all that kind of stuff. So there's really I mean I there's really multiple types of people the reason it's  Used to be that you could do this because you had a laptop and Wi-Fi and all that stuff was technology right now  That's just but now everybody's got a laptop. Everybody's got it. Yeah, but the reason it's still a tech thing is that the most of the  remote jobs are like developers  Web designers things like that  They tend to be tech jobs that lend themselves to you not being right to being able to work anywhere as long as you have

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Your computer great  You can do 95% of the work that you actually need to do and a lot of the software engineering

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Training companies have gone on this bandwagon  They have like, you know cruises and like retreats where you go and you learn coding and stuff like that in Bali or some  And it's cheaper because everything's less expensive there and so on but they're really multiple kinds  There's like the people who do that where they go with a there always want to be with a group of people and they live  Together work together all kinds of co-working  Co-working co-living combined. The second one is the which are often called digital nomads are actually just kind of expats  They go to Thailand they go to Chiang Mai or someplace like that  There's great infrastructure very low cost of living lots of other entrepreneurs around and they can sort of brainstorm and stuff  They're not traveling around. They're just they want a location where they can  live inexpensively  In a foreign country and then there's the people like me who just are always going to different places  And not with groups not with services. We just we just go and I mean, I'm biased but personally  That's the way to do it you just go to buy the ticket first thing you do is you buy a ticket  Then you sell your house sure is that yeah, it's happening. Exactly. Yeah, you'll be like someday  I'd like to know totally I take the benefits for next year  I take and then the clock is ticking and you'll do it  You know, so I just really believe it and use Airbnb use these services  Yeah, and it's just the greatest thing in the world

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does that any of this news that we're hearing about Airbnb and I guess we've been hearing about it for the last couple of  Years about kind of like cameras in places or insecurity about the the place that you're staying  I use Airbnb actually pretty regularly when we go to Tahoe  Usually get an Airbnb when we travel, you know to to Oregon we'll get one  So I have no problems with it  But does that ever like going to all these different places that ever a consideration for you never I never I never worried about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  At all because it's just it's just a it's just a an artifact of scale  Yeah  They have so many hosts that if you have a million hosts you're gonna have there's gonna be some bad apples  Yeah, just because of the numbers, but I've never encountered anything like that. And besides if there's a camera somewhere, it's like  So what I mean  I don't know. I I shouldn't dismiss it if anybody's privacy has been genuinely violated  Sure, it's really not a big factor. Somebody could put a camera in your house when you're not there  I mean, it's like lots of things could happen

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We could we could walk around with a camera in our pocket every single place we  Know what a nightmare that would be. Oh, I know always on microphone listening in our kitchen. Oh never happens dystopian

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  but but no, it's Airbnb's the biggest problem with Airbnb's are  weird things like  You know, they try to gouge you on stuff. So you get there and they're like, oh you wanted sheets on the bed  That's gonna be 20 bucks or and so that happened. So they  I wrote a book called gastronomad  Where we have this whole section on how to how to do Airbnb well  And there's a whole checklist of things to talk to the host about before you go there  Do you are you charging extra for this? Are you doing this? Where's the nearest this? Where's the nearest that and it's like if you do that  You can really you know, everything works out great. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go through the list. Yeah  awesome  Well, do you think you're gonna be traveling to?  Shoreline in a couple of months. No, I will not

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Your travel is not gonna take you to Mountain View. I stopped going to Google I O and other things like that because I they  Big conferences like that. I just never  Got anything out of them. Yeah, actually other than the sort of like look at me. I'm an IO  I mean right now that's not true for most people because you're you're like I'm a writer. So I'm looking for  Information nobody else has  It's also great to learn things but you can get all that stuff online in your case  You guys have a like a like a whole you're gonna do be recording and stuff there, right? Well, yeah  That was RSA. We haven't what is doing RSA thing with like there is an RSA

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But yeah, we have have absolutely done that the last many years like we've done this week in Google from the Google campus  That was a lot of fun. We've interviewed last year. Actually, we interviewed some pretty, you know senior Android execs  Well, yeah, we did that last year and the year before I thought was your for less that's right, you know, it was fun you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jason invited me and all about Android for that. Yeah. Yeah, and the visual is great because it's all it's all fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's lots of toys and yeah amazing stuff and I don't know if it's still like that  I know the last one I went to was the last time they were at Moscone  Okay, so you haven't been to the shoreline ones yet? No, no, no, no, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have not and yeah, I mean, it's it's I've been out of the country each time and this time

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know if I'm in the country or not, but I'm not even gonna try  I mean shoreline, I owe it shoreline feels kind of like music festival sort of thing developer conference also

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's got its own vibe. Thankfully they've settled in I feel like they've kind of found their groove there  The first year was a little weird. Yeah a little hot cramped and every year they kind of improve on it  It feels like they me it feels like home now for they improve on the conference part of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But they it's they it's gotten worse in terms of the like junket part of it  So yeah, they used to give you a I remember  The  Pixel book

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Chromebook pixel right Chromebook pixel, whatever it was. I can't remember everybody one. Yes  Here's a motor 360 watch  Like and it was like wow, this is like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Awesome. Yeah, I mean and it was nice to get those things  They've really peeled that back scale that back and that doesn't really happen unless you happen to be in some random  Announcement or if it does like I think last year  What did they what did they give out? It wasn't anything it was it was a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Something no, it was yeah, they want a home with that's easy. And then they gave out that  That kit for you to make. Oh the end of the thing the Android things everything. Yes, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was there the first year they they really scaled it back and everybody was so bummed  Yeah, they handed out Google cardboard. It was like this is it you're good with this card a little figure  Well, that ended up being really big. It's you know, it's huge. Yeah. Yeah, it's huge  But then like, you know six months later the New York Times was giving them away with subscriptions and stuff like that  But yeah, it's the junket you and they're smart to do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can't they are you know, you and I think at this point people expected a whole lot less like it would be great  It's it's always nice to get you know things that seem like they are free. But  Ultimately like for us and for me  Yes, having those interviews is a really powerful thing a really awesome thing to be able to do  Networking for the for the shows that we do, you know, I've meet so many awesome developers at Google I oh like cool  Well, you're doing really cool things. Why don't you come on to the network and talk about it? Like, you know, we can rap about that  Yeah, why are we talking about Google I oh because Google has basically announced in the way that they do they posted a video a  Light will be all filled with all sorts of clues super cryptic  It was like solve this puzzle and you might win a free ticket to Google I oh  And so this was going on at the same time someone went to a test  Twitter page for one of Google's like test accounts and pulled the JSON code from the page and found embedded in the code  Shoreline amphitheater. What is it? May 7 through 9th? They should give that person  I know I feel like that kind of qualifies you for a free ticket  You you solve the code in a different way, but you that's a pretty great way to find out  It's like ready player one you found the key and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Get the whole company so we got a fate f8s the week before so that's what that's that's they've also settled into that routine now  Oh, so it's a full week as F8s in San Jose on May 30  I mean April 30 and May 1 and then the following week is is I oh so it's just a full to  Ever have developers conference for the short time that they had the API

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'd be surprised if they didn't but I think they did I think they had one in San Francisco or something like that every year

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For a while. Yeah, but then the developers stopped going because Twitter started closing down their apps  They're like well if you don't love us we don't love you fine  so yes, so anyways May 7 through 9th, that's Google I oh and  We will will certainly be you know checking that out, and I'm sure there will be some sort of a live announcement  Stuff around that I'm pretty much certain we're gonna find out more about Android Q  Have you guys kind of been following a little bit about that?  Little bits and pieces about Android Q that we know now even though there is no public  Official release of Android Q apparently XDA developers got a hold of a pre-release version of Android Q  Who knows how old it is how current it is  But I mean if you're following last year's timetable  We still wouldn't even know about the next release until I think like six weeks from now  Mm-hmm, so which isn't that far away actually, but I'm still it would be early for us to know  At this point in time all about this new version based on previous timetables

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But on all about Android you guys were talking about what is what dessert starts with Q. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, do you have an opinion? I do okay, so  Of course you do gastronomad exactly know this yes  This is yours this is your quiz quiz quiz okay is a fruit

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you they make a like a paste out of it and sometimes people have that after dinner as a kind of dessert  It's a it's be a terrible idea  Well, which is to say which is perfect for Google which is to say naming operating systems after desserts is a terrible idea  I mean, they're getting to the end of the alphabet here pretty soon  Yeah, I know right, but so it's a big yellow looks like a pear it's it's in the apple family, okay  in a stringent fruit, it'd be hard to make a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Statue of it  Yeah, especially since it would look like an apple and  You wouldn't want to do that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  considering the very first version of Android

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you see the dessert there see the the brick of orange of the orange there if you're watching the video  down below down below yeah, and  Yeah, so it's like you I've encountered it in  Italy France and Mexico  Mexico yes, Mexico recently actually okay, and  but it doesn't have a  lot of sort of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Recognition definitely doesn't have the recognition the problem is there are no real cute desserts or treats that have recognition  Most of them are very exotic sounding right right

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exotic to you know that's here in the US you used to me you guys were speculating about Nestle's quick

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, that's that's a brand that could work. Yeah, I mean I kind of consider like a quick drink to be  Dessert like yeah, and they may do that just out of  Desperation is nothing. Yes, we sit there going yeah, yeah what you got Google. That's bring it right. Let's make a deal

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They have a really big advantage  Where the only thing with sugar in it that starts with you I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The only one I'm seeing so the verge try to speculate there's absolutely nothing the closest you can get to is quiche

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a dessert. That's like I mean are there dessert quiches though like I've had plenty of  By definition a savory yeah, you know unsweetened egg or whatever

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There is a sweet vanilla quiche recipe from serious eats, okay  There's ten best dessert quiche recipes at Yum Lee. You got to open up your  Perspective here. Is there a can like we're reaching you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's also frozen ice cream tacos, but that's not like  It's not really everything's been done serious eats can't possibly be serious

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everything in the world has been done whether it's good or bad  The point is do you name your operating system after that random thing?  Yeah, and I don't know like this is this is gonna be interesting one thing  We were speculating last night is what if they just like they overshadow it entirely and they go Android X  Or and or something like that right right make the shift, you know through the Apple model. Yes, exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Another one is they may name it quick somebody invented dessert that starts with Q right the name of the operating system

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right Google comes up with its own dessert. That's right and names it something that starts with a letter Q  but apparently according to the  Kind of pre-release version that XDA got a hold of some of the features that you can look forward to  improvements around face face detection  So right now we have face detection in Android, but it's a very I would say rudimentary kind of are you using it around for years?  I don't use it. I don't use it. I didn't try to  Yep, you know and there's been time after time where it's been proven that you can take a photo and you can trick it  And I mean they will spin it and say whoa  We're doing all of these things with artificial intelligence to blow up a derpader  right well a lot of a lot of companies just

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Coming up with something that appears to work right because Apple has like one plus has their facial recognition  You can just you can just take a photo and hold it up and boom you're in yeah  And and so you know that's not you know Google wouldn't do that  I don't think they would be dumb enough to do something like that. It would have to be real

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I was actually reading on your site last night  You had a post about one plus about one plus and all the reasons why you would not buy one plus and I thought your  Notes on on the face recognition was interesting that they you know, it's fast  Yes, that makes it seem to a user to be a really great solution  But that's because they're totally bypassing the security model. That's right. It's not to do that actual security

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It feels like security right and the unaware users is gonna be like, oh look, that's just like an iPhone  No, it isn't at all. I mean iPhones is real security and it's pretty hard to fool. It can be done but  But that's just not that's not the way to go  They're gonna do the real thing and they're gonna have you know  They super radar and all that kind of stuff and I think Google is actually innovating a lot like project solely  I don't know if we've talked about they're doing a lot of innovation on on my micro radar  And I think that would be a good application already  I mean I took if you go to my Twitter account  You'll see the picture that I took in the studio before the show that was done with Google Fies  You know you smile and it takes the picture  So you go to the studio thing and you basically say okay  Don't take a picture until somebody smiles and then you smile and it takes a picture  It's so fast and I did it from pretty far away  Hmm, it's amazing what it's doing to this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a you set it up stood in front of it made sure you were frowning and I smiled and instantly took a picture

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it works it works flawlessly every time as far as I can tell that's think about how subtle that is to yeah to be  Recognizing the facial expression of somebody in a photo so they have a lot of

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What it says is there's the there's that dork moment. Yes, when you have the smile you only have for cameras, right?  I want people taking selfies right there's a they turn from sour face on board being here. Yeah  And then back there's kind of a dork moment right remember whether one of the memes we had was that you you  What was I'm gonna get confused you convinced people that you were taking a still photo and and then you actually videoed  Getting ready looking like a dork for comic effect, right? So you get in you get into you get into picture dork mode  Right and and Google this is the power of Google. They know when you're being a dork. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because that's their people and yes  But there's there's another side to it Jeff  Which is that this thing you can just leave it on and it'll keep taking pictures every time somebody smiles  So what you can do is you can prop it up and then just forget about it  And then when people smile genuinely you get photos of people smiling genuinely and that's something  I think I haven't heard a lot of people doing but that's I think a way to a way to get around the dork face  problem  So yeah, but anyway, it's amazing. They have the technology to do this and I'm glad to see it actually  I really like the dork face problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  dork face problem  It's a bit it's a start, you know, we can come up with something maybe better, but I like that as a start  It's a it's a problem that Google really needs to tackle the dork face problem  If you hadn't heard as far as Android Q is concerned a lot of focus on  Permissions so and permissions have been a thing already  What's the difference here just really kind of I think getting getting deeper into permissions and also clarifying it, too  I think there's going to be some cleanup of how permissions are served up to users  How it's shown on the permissions page to make a lot more sense than it is right now  Now you get like this wall of switches and it can be a little confusing  and as we know permissions are actually very important to personal privacy and  Understanding how your phone is, you know  Potentially harvesting data on you at all times. Yeah, so  So good moves. I mean, there's a bunch of stuff. We don't have to dive into them individually, but definitely focusing on  Improving permissions for the average user. Yeah, and the audience for this

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  for this netcast  Are the super like people who really paying attention to what Google's doing?  And so one thing to look for which I think is the most interesting thing about  New operating systems coming out a new version of Android coming out of Google over the next three years  Is they're gonna I think they're gonna be nudging us toward fuchsia and future fuchsia is really interesting  My theory about fuchsia is that years and years ago? They said, you know what? We really should unify  Chrome OS and Android we should unify them and we should make it both work sort of like  Each other and have you know eventually end up with one and I think they thought that all the way through and said you know  What if we try to actually merge them? We're gonna have a mess. We're gonna have we're gonna have Windows 10 or something  Where I mean Windows 7 it's gonna be an it's gonna be a nightmare of spaghetti code and mismatch  let's what should an out how should an operating system of the future be and  I think that's probably where fuchsia came from and they seem to be building this operating system. That's going to be  You know, it's gonna be for IOT devices all the way up through enterprise  clients or servers who knows and it's going to have  completely different  models for how it works  From today's operating system. For example, it'll have the chrome extension like feature. We talked about this on the show  I think you were on it Jeff. You weren't on it  but the  thing that's interesting about  Chrome extensions is they are  Features that are divorced from apps or applications or anything like that. There are features that are applied across different  Places fuchsia is gonna work like that. So you you're basically gonna have oh I want the spellcheck feature and it won't be spellcheck for Google  Docs, it'll be spellcheck for everything anytime you have words on your screen the spellcheck will apply to it  so the features will be all a cart and so  That's just one of a hundred different strange things that fuchsia will likely be able to do  but I think that as over the next three years both chrome and and  Android will  Get fuchsia like features  Because soften the blow soften the blow get us used to it exactly and then switch at some point in a couple years  I think they're gonna figure out how to get developers to write things that work on  Android and also fuchsia so that once they throw the switch your existing apps will just work on fuchsia  That's just a theory I have no reason there is some sort of cross-platform  Aspects of it already if I remember correctly fuchsia does run on the pixel down right and it runs on a pixel book  So Google's own hardware already runs fuchsia. Of course fuchsia doesn't do anything right now because it doesn't have any apps

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's not even complete. Yeah, it's it's really I mean it's been earlier days, but it's still early days

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  but you see where it's going and they're using their own platforms as sort of clearly as the as the  Growth platform where they're gonna start this thing and it's just gonna be fascinating the the the rumor is that they're gonna  Go live in three years, which means five six years

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Realized probably yeah, I think it was like a couple of years  They were saying there was a report that said within the next five years  And that still felt pretty right quick aggressive for aggressive considering what the the  Goal is and I don't even know if that's that's not Google stated goal, right?  Like that's kind of what we come up. They've been very cagey about it very  But we were all kind of left kind of grasping as straws going. What is fuchsia?  They're public enough about it that we know it exists and that you know, like the news this week bill Stevenson  15 year Apple senior manager  Who actually oversaw the launches of all different versions of Mac OS lion through Mojave is now joining Google  He announced on Twitter that he's gonna be  He's going to quote help bring a new operating system called fuchsia to market stay tuned  So I mean in some ways, you know, it's not it's not super secret, right?  We just have and we've actually seen it operate and seen it in you know operation. We just have no idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Excited because we're here we are three Chromebook users

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Normally normally right now I'm using an iPad I think  Yeah, it's Megan's iPad we're doing the switch I can't wait to get my pixel slate back standard the standard  comment about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're gonna make but but so  And they've gone I think as far as they can they can go  It's still I mean I've complained on the show before that if something needs any kind of content rights management  It doesn't work. So Netflix is really flaky on my Chromebook pixel  The apps are awkward, you know, it's it's better but it's  It needs a new OS. Yes, it needs something new to bring it bring it together  My fear is how much rewriting of apps is gonna have to be out there  And how long it's gonna take, you know, will Netflix say not big enough market who's on fuchsia and we have to wait forever  That's the awkward transition time. Yes. My fear is that we all think they'll do the thing that we want them to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which is create a combined thing that will be replacement but then sometimes I remember wait a minute  This is Google we're talking about they they they are a company that  They close the thing you don't want them to close and then they leave open the thing and you know, how many communications?  Platforms that they have right now and they just keep adding things  So one distinct possibility is that they will never kill chrome or Android and fuchsia will exist and now  Android and fuchsia will exist and now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We just assumed this would be really great for your refrigerator for your connected refrigerator

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's why we built few we had too many developers on Android and we wanted to give some half of them someplace else to go  Yeah, it's a 20% project

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess we will we'll find out someday  I feel like we're gonna be talking about this with lots of guessing for a long time before we actually know  But I do think that there's there's some you know, there's some trickles some nuggets there  Knowing that bill stevenson and his background is being brought onto the team that feels like that feels like progress, right?  Like he's overseen. Yep, the launch of major oses. Yes  So there's some dedication. There's some confidence there  As far as fuchsia is concerned  I don't know how many engineers I think the last time I saw in a report  It said somewhere around 100 engineers more than 100 engineers which sounds kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sounds like yeah light for a whole damn. No s. Yeah  Yeah, so who knows but you know, it's funny it's funny about that is that is that it wasn't that long ago when we got  All excited on shows like this that a new version of an os was coming out so far  We talked about queue, but it's it's a bit of a shrug  The os in a web world the os just isn't as important as it was in an app and web world. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and and as far as queue features are concerned like, you know also keep in mind like that's based  That's based on a very early leak  Of the os right in a month or two when they actually do their their official unveil of the alpha  Or whatever it is the do not for any reason install this on your phone if you plan on using your phone everyday version  Um, they'll probably have some more but I think the the what we know now the grander kind of approach the the grander kind  Of point is better permissions management as a really big core feature

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and that that sounds to me like a much more interesting rumor than  Face id type stuff to use apple's branding  Simply because the really big news would be if they came out with another version of android that didn't have it  I mean that would be amazing like that would be such a big story  Headline google fails once again to come out with a standard feature that every phone should have and um, so yeah  That's I think it's that's a solid one because it's yeah, they gotta do it. You know, yep. Yep. Gotta do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me just say one thing. I said this a little bit last week, but we've got more and more of this  Google do not force me into dark mode  Do not make me turn off dark mode and find some damn switch somewhere and because you think it's good for me  I hate dark mode. You're gonna learn about Jeff Jarvis's dark mode. I don't yes. I'm witnessing it right now. I'm scared  Dark mood with dark mode

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't dark me bro  Don't dark me  Um, well, I mean that is that is one of the features that that we're hearing about with android q  Is that there would be a system wide dark mode  But I don't know how that's going to work like they if if that's going to be like obviously all the system elements would have  A dark mode component, right?  But we also know that google's been doing a lot of rebranding or redesigning around its apps and making them super bright  And then giving you the option for dark mode because let's be real a lot of people really want a dark mode  It's better for battery. It's better on the eyes at night all these different reasons  I understand. I understand your dark mood, Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that they have so many  They must have so many customers that are star wars geeks. They should call it dark side the dark side  That'd be so much better

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's true. I mean it wouldn't be without precedent android. You don't know the power of the dark side  It's like so pleasant to use on a drone use the dark side you get more power because your battery lasts longer  That's right. Let's take a break. Thank the sponsor and then we'll talk about more  Maybe we'll who knows maybe we'll talk about the redesign of gmail or the ongoing saga  That is why do they take away inbox but first?

That's part of the change log  Oh, okay. I mean, I guess we could we could we could break it out of the change log  Have you guys seen the the new no, it's not going to be as good as inbox

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the problem getting darker

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I feel like everybody who's an inbox user is in in a couple of camps as far as like strategy moving forward  Yes, you've either decided that google's already made the the decision  It's time to cut the ties and get used to gmail now, which is what I for some reason decided to do  That too, uh, or you're hanging on until the very last day  That's what i'm doing on google plus. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're killing no matter who you are. They're killing something dear to you. No kidding

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why why do you do this to us google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because it took it took so much to get used to it. It took so much to kind of see the wisdom of it  Yeah, I wrote when I did it's like it's like you you had me join a cult and then you close the cult clubhouse

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually, yeah, we're closed at the door  It seems clear that google doesn't fully appreciate the value of super passionate users because  They create these new things the people who embrace new things and quickly master them the early adopters  Uh, these are the most passionate users. These are the these are the google fanboys  These are the you know, diehard people who make it all work  and they keep coming out with something really cool getting people invested in it  and then killing it and it's just they just  You know the really passionate users just feel like they get hammered and hammered and hammered  Every time they close something starting with google reader all the way through all the rest of it  And it's just they need to they need to stop doing that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do you miss most about inbox now that you guys have switched over to the dark mood side?  What will we miss about inbox? No what? Yeah, since you've already started making the transition back to gmail  Yeah, what do you I haven't yet? Yeah, what was the hardest part of the transition? What are you missing about inbox?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Um, probably the the what do they call them reminders that are integrated into the thing where you can have a  What do they call them? The little finger with the string on it icon? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think they were reminders man. I did not use that as much

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I used that a lot either and now i'm I you know, i'm back on gmail and now i'm just sending email to myself and right using  Using the snooze button because I you know, I want yes I use I use email I use gmail as my universal everything  tool and so instead of having a to-do list I just have  Essentially, it's a procrastination list. It's like oh I can get away with not doing this until march, you know  It's like just leave myself. I know  The future and it doesn't come back and so that's what I do  So in inbox was designed for that gmail is not designed for it. I'm just sending email to myself and it's it's it's  I feel like a savage  Whereas with inbox it was like built into it which those those items would show up in in google keep  Um, they would show up in calendar. It was integrated with everything. It was a good use case for that  Um on the other hand, they've they've integrated a lot of inbox stuff  Uh, like uh, and they continue to they continue to i'd i'd love to see them go all the way because they're they're yes  I would too. I mean the truth is that I could never fully just use inbox. I always going  I was always going back. I like to build

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Filters you had to go into gmail to do the filters to any sort of like  Like deeper degree and you had like light filtering capabilities in it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I always thought they're gonna kill gmail and keep inbox  And I worried about that because one of the things they didn't have or don't have in  Inbox is the all mail folder. So all mail and gmail just shows you everything  You're so noisy like every day the spam everything but like sometimes you like you like did somebody send me something  I don't know where it went  And you can go into all mail and say you can just go down and say well there it is  You know whereas with an inbox like there's no mail  You're just scrolling inbox is kind of like trust us. We put everything in the right place. Don't worry about it  And you're like, uh, not really yet at the same time

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is the thing that I miss most from inbox is the smart bundling. Yeah, the bundles. That's that's what i'm dreading

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's really the updates  updates and um  Low priority. Yeah, like twice a day. I could just look at that and I could scan down and boom absolutely

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean i've spent so much I waste I shouldn't say spend I waste so much time  Filtering through all of this stuff that would have ended up in that low priority folder  And if I was in inbox and it's all automatically, you know filed into this low priority folder  I look through be like nope. There's nothing in there single check mark move on with my life  In gmail it just gets interspersed in and I guess I could set up a folder for each and every one as they come through  But let's be real that takes a lot of time in gmail

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's why you want to you want the smart company with all this freaking ai and they're kicking it away from us

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And inbox is really good also about creating simple filters  like I like gmail's advanced filters if I want to set up something that's really smart, but if i'm in inbox and I  Assign this to that category and I say oh this this falls into the finance category  It'll give me a little toast message that says do you want all future messages from this from this address to go there?  Yes, boom filters set up. I don't have to think about it  It was a single button press  I want to do that in gmail on every single new email new recipient or whatever takes forever

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's so annoying the best thing they could do is is create a mode a toggle switch that  They could call it something like smart inbox and just click it on and that and then gmail becomes inbox  For those who choose to do that and that would hold us all for a few years while they fully integrate them into one super  Email thing but but to just if they kill it without integrating those features into gmail

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's what they're gonna do next month or in march, right? Well, i'm holding on to the last minute

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, i'm delusional enough to think maybe they'll maybe they'll just integrate all these things at the last minute. Yeah, probably won't i'm hoping so

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mike you're gonna you're gonna get that and you're gonna get an rss reader at the same time

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then it is your email got a new social network. That's right  The new gmail rss reader, that's right  It's all gonna be one thing  In your inbox rss in your inbox along with your email. Hey, i'll take it. I'm confusing at all. Take it  Yeah, that that might actually be a good use case  Um, yeah, i'm holding out hope that they eventually do I have to imagine that inbox  As google has said was enough of an interesting kind of like insight into its users and their priorities and they you know  They use it as an experimental foundation for email  How could you how could you then get rid of inbox and say we're going to take the best features from inbox and move them  Over to gmail and not do the smart bundle because I have to imagine that saved everybody a lot of time. Yeah, absolutely

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So do it that was the first email feature that made zero inbox a reality

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  More of a reality you are superman elgin you are so you travel the world and have an empty email box

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How do you do this? I don't know. I don't even know no no I I do have I go zero inbox every day  But I do it the hard way in gmail. I literally create a filter for everything  So every new pr company that contacts me I go and create a filter by hand  To say anything coming from this company put it in this folder. And so I have I have 750  I was gonna say how many full filters do you have?  Folders, holy cow. I have because I have I have a pr flack not flack. I'm sorry pr professional  folder, I got  alerts folder for like just  Information stuff like I got I got a bunch of them  So the stuff that comes into my inbox I've written about this like my my approach to email is like  Treat every incoming in email as a problem to be solved  So like how can I not get this anymore in the future? Yeah, and so like unsubscribe or  Route this into a filter and skip the inbox or  Do something take some action. Sometimes it's like well, I need to get these in my inbox  Okay, and I move on to the next thing but if you were always  Chipping oh, I spent so much time in email. It's really how much of your time is spent setting up filters though and stuff and responding

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because that that is not like like we've said a few times. That's not a slow. That's not a quick process

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. I spend 10 10 or 15 minutes a day probably every day  I just do it as part of my process  Yeah, um, but I do get to zero inbox every day and I use the snooze button for for lots of things  So I I just I I feel like um, i'm a master procrastinator if you will  procrastinators leaders of tomorrow  And and i'm just i'm always pushing things to the last minute  Yeah, because as a journalist deadlines the only thing to get get me moving on something  Sure, so I just push everything the last minute and so everything's coming and i'm just it's a battle  I'm just like swatting it flies or something

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, but it feels like a defeat a defeating battle if you're constantly setting up filters for every new thing  like I just think about the the like marketing or or uh,  Like pr contact lists that i'm on yes that will result will always  Every day result in new emails from people i've never heard from before the thing that confuses me is that what i'll do is

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  when I get something in my inbox, it's like a  Pr person reaching out as they do  um, and then I create a filter that  Says everybody from that company everybody with that domain  I get rid of the front part because I don't care who from the company right?  It's just everything at the last part. Yeah, and so so I i've  i've come to the conclusion that  Five or six new pr companies are formed every day  Right because i've been doing this for years and they keep coming  It's insane how many there are but they're so effective

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't that a fact that's effective right there?  It really gets your attention. You are guaranteed to reply to their their inquiry  When they hit you over the head with a baseball bat like yes, dear influencer  Did you guys read the uh the article by cashmere hill, uh on gizmodo  Well, yeah, her series is great. It's basically cutting out the big five from  From her life one week at a time every week. She chooses a new  Technology company to eradicate from her life and see how life is lived without it  This week that she wrote about uh was google. Yeah, of course, right?  And it's just an interesting read if you want to kind of get a sense of just how embedded  We already know google is super embedded into pretty much everything on the internet  But it's just a really fascinating read because she  And I think her producer  Uh created a vpn that blocked what was the number eight?  million six hundred ninety nine thousand six hundred forty eight ip addresses that are all controlled by google  Yeah  So basically at the at its base blocked those ip addresses so that any services be it cloud be it, you know maps  All of it  Just won't work. Yeah  Uh to to try and live life on the internet without any sort of you know  Uh touching of of google services. Yeah, it's basically impossible is impossible

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My favorite part was that there was something that I forget what it was  but she couldn't do it because the company presumed that she didn't have a google address she was a  A bot or a spammer  right  That's how you prove your human association is humanity  right

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what it is to be human is to have a google account  But but you know to me the the takeaway from that whole exercise was how incredibly valuable google is  I mean, that's true. You know, she's like, oh how do you know? It's so terrible that they track us so much  Um, it's so hard to to be untracked and all that kind of stuff  And then once you do it, it's like you can barely function  Why is that because we've all gotten used to the power of all these google services and so on

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there are reasons these things exist. They're not just to track you and surveillance and all that is to make the things function

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because google knows you with mass media knows you as a mass  Google knows you as an individual and human being google is more

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Respectful of your humanity than mass media that complains about google is and and that's not to say that that applies universally across all the companies she's trying to  Remove herself from amazon. Yeah, for example, if you are a patient and can wait longer than overnight for shipping  You can just buy stuff all over the place. It's harder. You're constantly entering a credit card  There are solutions for that if you have you know, use your chrome extension stuff like that  But but basically amazon is is extremely replaceable but google isn't  I think facebook is  Somewhat is somewhere in the middle. It's kind of replaceable  She said she missed facebook. Yeah, she missed facebook and you know facebook just makes it super easy to stay in touch with people  But you can still stay in touch with because i'm i'm i'm on this big project to quit facebook and i'm dragging it out  So i'm doing it in july  But until then almost every day i'm dissing facebook on facebook  And i'm trying to get everybody to sign up for my shared folder on google photos as my replacement for facebook  Okay, and uh, it's gonna take months to do that and i'll probably get like i'll probably get  I'm hoping for half to three quarters of the people on facebook to actually follow my folder

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so that they can instead of finding your photos and your updates on facebook. They'll just be subscribed to your google photos  That's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And of course anything you throw in everyone's google photos user already for the most part and and and google and and you don't have  To be a google photo user have a google account even cashmere cashmere hill can see my photos  Yeah, right  Because because because you don't have to log in just as long as you have the link you can see it  Which means that google photos has three times?  the number of people as facebook  right, so  That's that's that's not exactly accurate because you can also see I think you can see a facebook post if you don't have a facebook account  You can

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you if you're not logged in or whatever and you go to a post

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right and notification is the key  So if you if you're following a folder you can choose to get notifications pop up on your phone or not  You can choose to get email notifications or not email notifications have a link directly to the photo or to whatever you're doing  You can like things you can comment you can do a lot kind of stuff  It's not quite as good as facebook in terms of the elegance  But it's close enough and you don't have to deal with all the other crap on facebook  And so it's it's a way to do it. So there are ways to replace facebook that if people  Would think about it a little bit. They would see that it's it's not as bad as what cashmere is going through  Because she's just cold turkey and now she just there's a void where there used to be facebook. It's gone. What do you do now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  um  So I had stepped away from facebook about two years ago  Yeah, and I think over the course of that first year that I was away. I never logged in well

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You look you look younger now. Thank you  It's just let me tell you it's improved my life immensely. Yes time. The time is taking backwards now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  um  The second year, I think I logged in like maybe five times for different random things  About 40 days ago. I started the 30-day countdown and I did the delete my account  Yeah, I have not checked it since i'm afraid to like try my login credentials because i'm afraid for it to be like  Oh, actually it didn't happen and now yay. We've got you. Yes. So supposedly my account is deleted now, but I have not checked it  Yeah, and I don't know why it took me two years to do it  I stepped away and then I did nothing and now it's deleted. Right? I mean, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you can successfully step away if you can if you're an alcoholic and you successfully not drink even though you work in a bar  Great. Great. Good job  But it's probably a good idea to quit your job and get another job somewhere that isn't a bar if you're anyway  So yeah, exactly and and I think everybody's contemplating it. I'm trying to convince people  That it's just such an unethical company. They really are not helping the world by participating in it  Yeah, um, but it's just you know, people are like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they can't what else? Yeah, what is the alternative? That is always the well and you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My my moment of full disclosure is that I raised money for my school from facebook. I'm independent of facebook  I received no money personally from any platforms  um  But I you know, I generally  um  Tend to defend the internet  And and I had this argument today. So I was on a cnbc online show called fort knocks, which i'll put up the link shortly  um  today and and  With farhad manju from the new york times because he was doing the same thing about twitter  Not saying to kill it quite but all but  Yes, and and as I wrote that so I wrote a piece about that  That's why I ended up on this  I do have to say that there is a point of privilege  and even siva varianathan who's who's a  the most  Um firm critic of facebook. I know has written books against facebook  Um, even he cautions that that quitting facebook is something that's frankly fairly easy for us three white guys to do. Yeah  um  That is not necessarily  in the cards for people who a  Live in countries where it's the internet and there's other issues that come along with that or b  come from underrepresented communities whose concerns are not being covered in newsrooms on cable tv and newspapers because there's  very few people in the newsroom who look like them and experience what they experience and  facebook and twitter and reddit and  Instagram and so on and so forth have given people a voice in a platform  That they and their communities have never had those yeah, I would

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Agree with that to a certain extent like those kinds of platforms have given voice  But I think you don't need facebook specifically if you're using reddit twitter, etc  Which I would recommend people are like, oh they all do it. No, they don't. I mean, no, they don't it's it's it's night and day  the ethical  Transgressions by facebook are orders of magnitude  Greater in number than any other platform that i'm aware of and once you list them and look at the list  I mean google is guilty of tracking and a few other things  uh places like reddit is  Reddit is both super valuable and kind of annoying because they they're exclusionary unless you're part of the club and you've built up your points  And all that kind of stuff twitter has its problems. We've talked about a lot on this show  But come on facebook. I mean their latest thing where even apple  Is uh has cut off facebook from using the internal version of the app  I don't know if you saw this story kind of broke today. I think jeff  Where they're paying teenagers to let them spy on their usage so they could spy on consumers through the phones of teenagers  It's just yet another  egregious  Abuse by facebook and then they apologize and they you know say they're going to reverse course  But it's just you know just the number and scale of their ethical lapses  is just i gotta believe that for everybody who is uh,  Who cares and wants to make the world a better place find another platform

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or two but but i'm still gonna object again  There it's it's we tend to see we we miss the trees for the forest the opposite of the usual  Yeah, right. We see this as the company  there's two billion people there and  Um, so when farhad complained about about uh twitter  And you know, there's some bozos. I said well then don't follow the bozos  Uh, well, it's the same people I always see well then find new people  Uh, you're you're a journalist use it that way and so the same with facebook  There are people i've met there people have connections there with I don't have anywhere else  And and for me to say oh facebook means i'm also saying those friends those people. Yeah, that's the challenge  Absolutely, and and i'm not willing to do that and and I and the other thing is  Yeah, they've screwed up plenty and I wrote a piece a few weeks ago about about that though  I I argue that the that the complaints about them, you know surveillance capitalism  No, that's not the problem. The problem is a a silicon valley problem of their culture. Yeah, um, uh, which which I do criticize  but um  Uh, I I still think it's important to remember that that that what the what the internet does and what these things do is connect  you with human beings  Uh, so I was on this this this cnbc thing this afternoon and with with farhad manju  with others in jaron laniy came in at the end and um  When I made this point about privilege, he just he just screamed at me. Um,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So at least you guys aren't doing that. Well, I I but I I would uh push back on that in the following way  When you invest in facebook as the place where you're connected all those people  You are not connecting to all the people who have opted out of facebook or never opted in in the first place  So when I moved to my thing called a nice book and by the way, I'm mentioning this cryptically  But if you are interested in this project of mine of leaving facebook and replacing it with a folder  I google photos go to elgin.com  Facebook and I explain the whole thing  Why i'm doing it etc  But once I did that and I moved to google photos all these people who have never been on facebook started seeing my photos for the first time  um  A few older people who who never saw any of my photos on facebook all these years  I've been on facebook 10 years or something like that for whatever reason over there of course their years

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They did not want to sign up for facebook or didn't care or didn't know or whatever

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They think it's like they don't want to you know, like older people like my my my late father  Never saw facebook. He he didn't survive long enough to see my nice book  but um  but like uh other people that I know in my family and so on that  Would normally see want to see all this stuff and know what's going on that type of stuff  I post on facebook didn't see it plus all the quitters so many quitters now  And this is one of the things i'm you know, to a certain extent i'm trying to convince people to get off  Facebook too, but but part of the part of the goal is to weaken their network effect  So that people don't say well, it doesn't matter if they're the most unethical company in history  I have to be there because everybody's there. That's what people that's the that's the logic people use  To as to why they're there. Well, what if everybody wasn't there what if only  70 percent of the people who are currently on facebook were on facebook then suddenly they wouldn't have this grip on everybody  Which gives them a license to do pretty much anything they want that grip, right?  Um, it's like they're like the phone system and that's your what's up  Are you on whatsapp whatsapp is another one, you know, whatsapp. Are you on it a lot of people?  No, no, i'm i'm getting off all four of them  I've never used whatsapp. I did already get off instagram  But like there are lots and lots of people I know who are on only instagram and facebook or they're saying i'm quitting facebook  I'm just going to use instagram. It's like  well

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're still helping mark zuckerberg be on ethics. See, I mean obviously again, you know, please replay my my disclosure earlier  Um, and again, they've screwed up things i'm criticized, but i'm sorry. I don't I don't buy that they're the most evil company  uh, uh ever by a long  Shot, I think they've screwed up some things. I think they've screwed up some things. I think they still have  They still believe in a mission of connecting the world. I think they're too  Opaque and that's what gets them in trouble  Uh, they should they they need to rethink  Their culture so that anything they do  Withstands the light of sunshine  Um, but and I think it's possible that that can happen, but I I gotta disagree mike  I think you know, i'll take a lot of banks and a lot of oil companies and a lot of pharma companies  and and the the the company that that that addicted half of  half the people who died of  um overdoses for uh, purdue pharma

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Those are evil companies. Yeah, I I would I would not and if I did say it I i'll retract it  But I would not say they're the most unethical company. I was I was I was uh in the world  I mean they they definitely are not but it's a combination of their actual lack of ethics  Plus their incidental effect on people for example every time there's a story about  Teen depression being caused by social they are talking specifically primarily about facebook and instagram  Uh, they they are deliberately  Uh and willfully addictive they're trying to gobble up as much as people's days as possible and they're very good at it  They uh, they they sort of so wait wait. We're here doing a two-hour show

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What are we trying to do? We don't we don't have two hours media is the same media is exactly the same  We're in the same business and many many companies would want that succeeding. That's the point

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See what i'm saying, it's okay to tell you too good at it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Every startup would love to have people glued to their products six hours a day  Absolutely, but facebook is the only company that actually achieves it  And so it I think is a force in nature. We talk endlessly about their effect on journalism  They just basically the largest publisher in history. They're not a publisher the largest source of news in history  they throw a switch and  And and by the way, uh, one of the things i've noticed is when I write my anti facebook screeds on facebook, they get zero  And I mean the engagement just because I know they they've thrown a switch and they're not distributing it  They just decide secretly behind the scenes where nobody can see seniors crazy. Maybe maybe people just disagree

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  uh  Because because because you're because don't forget mike don't forget in all fairness, you know, I love you. Yeah, but you're basically  Criticizing everyone who's there you're saying  You're all sheeple for being here and i'm not well a lot of us disagree and I find real value there

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I I think uh, the way I look at it is um that  Nobody's a sheeple. I mean people are people and it's their it's their human  Sort of mindset that's being manipulated by facebook and instagram to get people  To where they're addicted and compelled to to to do this performance every day, especially on instagram  But i'm not saying that people are bad and i'm good what i'm saying is that  I am i'm a trained and licensed professional  I spend my whole life reading about this stuff learning about this stuff and you're an ordinary person who doesn't you know  You have a real job. You're not a you're not a journalist  You have better things to do than read the mountains of evidence that that facebook is this unethical company  So i'm here to to to inform you of things you didn't know  because when I do write about these things people like really and it's like  You know people  Our job is to inform people so they can make their own choices  And so I don't I don't tell anybody I think you should do this  I I tell people i've looked at all this evidence and i've decided to do this  You may want to look at this evidence yourself and make your own decision and people do and I understand  It's like super easy to use facebook to stay connected with people  instagram, I mean to a certain extent the  the value of this for people is  Approaches a genuine need

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. See I see see I I think  You're not giving people credit for the agency and choices they make and you're insulting them  I'm not there because i'm an addict. I'm there because I find value in it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, i'm not insulting people for not knowing, uh, not having an encyclopedic knowledge of no

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you're saying that you know more about this than they do again, I love you mike, you know that  But you're saying because and I quoted you often about what made google plus better  right  There were design decisions there were there was there was better until the end  um  But but no you're saying you're saying there's an absolute here that it's that it's bad and addictive and awful and you know better  And you're basically saying the other people shouldn't be there and and and and i'm saying that people have legitimate reasons to disagree with you  And find value there that you need to respect

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do respect them. Uh, if they have a disagreement that's informed by knowledge of what facebook does unfortunately  99 percent of the people I would guess i'm making that number up obviously  On facebook have no idea like they they're they're surveys that where a majority didn't even know that facebook like  Adjusted the algorithms for uh for what they're seeing in the news feeds like people don't know the most basic things  They certainly don't know about uh the creepy research they do they certainly they they they don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  how media companies uh  Target adds to you how media companies make decisions

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They do our job is journalism is to inform them about all of it  And so, you know, i'm basically i'm i'm just basically choosing to be to try to be an influencer on this particular thing  So walt mosberg about a week after I announced that I was going to do this whole project  He announced that he was getting off and he made it clear in twitter that saying i'm not saying anybody else should get off facebook  um, but i've decided that that  Based on what I know about their ethical lapses. I don't feel comfortable contributing to their blah bitty blah  But i'm not saying anybody else should get on  And i'm saying that I do think people should get off  And and i'm not saying it's because i'm better than other people i'm just saying because  I know a lot of stuff. Here's the stuff I know and i'm trying to inform people and it's not even just the old stuff  The the the new transgressions are coming so fast and furious

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's two or three a week almost to the point though that that it goes counter  Right, like it's it's so fast and furious that even if you wanted to kind of make sense of it and get and get  Enraged about it. Yeah, you kind of don't have the time or the bandwidth to do that  And so at some point it's kind of just easier to like the trump overlook it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're like the trump administration. There's so many scandals that any new scandal is like yeah, whatever

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Whereas you also have to look at the media perspective here. Sorry. I didn't interrupt you mike  Um, the media perspective is is is become so constantly negative you have the case which I wrote about in the new york times piece  Oh my god, netflix is reading your messages. Yeah. Well, yes logically  People wanted facebook to open up and not just be the closed garden  They enabled people to send messages from netflix that required that netflix had to have read write and delete access  And it was the only way the function could work. It was obvious  It was logical and the new york times was being dumber than a congressman  In in that so you see that kind of coverage out there now is constant  And you see people like farhad manju saying delete this stuff  And and and and and and it's become a drum beep of media and media are not admitting  their  um own  Corruptible motives here because they think that facebook is competing for the attention and time that they think they deserve  and and so  The problem is that it's become my fear is the reason I stand up for this mike reason is is because what I fear  The end result of this  Is not about facebook. It's about the internet  And i've just joined a transatlantic working group on content moderation and freedom of speech read regulation. Yeah  This can be because I see all kind and i'm debating next week whether to go to a thing in brussels while i'm in europe  About content moderation content moderation is another way to say killing people's voices  and and I fear  That we're going to see a whole raft of regulation of the net  Coming out of this fear of a company or two and it's early days. Well come mess up. I mean I I would

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Content moderation when a company does it is is killing people's voices content moderation when a user does it is the opposite of that  because

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you have the you know the perfect i'm not saying that you should be on facebook. I'm just saying  Respect me for my decision to be there the I do know I do cover this I do know a lot about this

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm super concerned as you are about the overall coverage of the the sort of the drumbeat of and and the mushing the  The mental mushing of all these things into a single thing. The worst case is something actually on the rundown the uh, the uh,  What is the publication did this about sidewalk labs is replica?  So sidewalk labs is google's or alphabets division or company for improving cities for for building smart cities  And they have a project called they have a product called replica  And what replica is is it's like a sim city for urban planners  They go to a urban planner they go to toronto and they're like  Oh if you like rejigger the city like this  This is where everybody would go and what the traffic would be like and where the parking and all that kind of stuff  But the the the movement of these, you know sim city like characters through this through this thing  Are based on real data. They're using people's real data  They're getting it from maps and who knows where they're getting it and and and this uh,  This article is up in arms about it, but they're d, uh, what do they call it?  De-identifying it in other words, they're removing the  It's that data is not associated with any specific people  It's just and it's valuable

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This fear of data so it's right now. We're my view is we're in a mode where I think the fight is to be  to have to be  Prevented from being part of data, but then they're you know, we're going to want data back  So i'll give you a quick example on facebook. So everybody cambridge analytics  Everybody went after facebook and facebook found it created an api so you could go in and see political ads  That was being misused facebook shut it down the researchers are screaming and alex stamos who really knows his stuff  We left facebook who's now at stanford  Said be careful what you wish for folks  Because when you exposed cambridge analytics and you said this is all awful and all terrible  The way that guy got the data was trying to give researchers some data so they could find out insights about the people and that's what the  researchers want  Well, it got misused by one guy in one company  So then facebook comes back and they cut it off and then the research screamed bloody murder. You're keeping the information from us  They're they're they're often in a difficult position like that  So google too. I want to stand up for the idea  That knowledge and the idea of knowledge that comes out of data should be protected and we not only have a right from data  But at some point we have a right to data. We have a right to be able to learn things and understand things  and and but when we make this  this  especially in europe  Privacy uber alice  Which I understand and I get it  But it has other implications that we have to be able to examine and they're not all negative and they're not all out of some malign motive

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and and I agree with all that  Your argument often when whenever there's a story about techno panic is what is the actual harm?  And so if there's tracking and so on that's a great question that isn't nearly asked enough in general in these conversations  Certainly not in the the breathless coverage of tracking and all that kind of stuff  But in the case of facebook the harm  Is right in front of us. There are mob lynchings in india because of the way that  whatsapp  Functions there are teen suicides because of the way whatsapp functions. They damage democracies. They're they're a wonderful tool for  propagandists and tyrants  wonderfully effective tool they  They cause depression they cause addiction the list of actual material damage to people and societies is  Extremely evident and that's the difference this stuff about google getting data so that  Cities can design better cities. There is literally no harm  They're trying to actually improve the lives of people and in the case of a lot of the tracking stuff that goes on with amazon  And so on the harm is really difficult to find with facebook. It's right there the stories of actual harm people being harmed are everywhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's also stories of real benefit  And and I caution  The presumption of we see these stories everywhere for so for example  Um the presumption that we're all in a filter bubble  Yeah, erasmus kleis nielsen at the reuters institute for the study of journalism at oxford often points out  The evidence doesn't show that the data doesn't show that there aren't studies to show we're a filter bubble  Actually, it's the truth is the exact opposite that being on the internet exposes you to more opinions than you otherwise would have had  We've got to be evidence-based  And how it's harm and evidence both. Yeah, so I want to see the evidence and I want to see what's what and I want to  See the countervailing so so if we come up with a new rule to prevent that right?  What else are we then giving up what opportunities are we giving up as a result?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right the the so the the statistical and the the cognitive bias  Angle against my own argument is that facebook is just massive at scale if they're twice as big as another company  That should have twice as many horrible things that happen  And and if you're an ant if you're inclined toward anti facebook thinking then you'll you'll you'll dismiss all the positive stuff that they do  And you'll focus on the bad stuff they do and there's lots of bad stuff because they just have so many users  They're so gigantic and I understand that argument. I just to me the the thing that  You're talking about the people's right to have information  I think people also need the right to have information that isn't informed by a single entity and the way that they do business  secret, you know their algorithms the the problem with algorithms, of course that  Google grapples with this in europe all the time is that they are secret. Nobody can see them  They there's no sunlight being shown on those how do they work?  Why do they work the way they work like this is this is problematic  um, but but I think that the the the the most the most solid argument that you can make about facebook that's the most evidence based  Argument is the fact that they do have so many users how many people are on?  What is the total number of actual bodies who are using facebook instagram whatsapp and facebook messenger?  Uh, it's probably fewer than they say  But it's I mean each service is more than billion. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's it's probably a couple billion and then when you talk about facebook and instagram and uh, whatsapp  All combining their services together  So so they were talking even more of that like the monopolistic sort of discussion around facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have to admit that I I love the idea of of their being of of sources of information  Especially when everything's algorithmically filtered for different reasons to be  distributed and and the sources for those to be  uh, multifaceted instead of  Mostly from one place. Uh, just the the sheer

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're in far better shape scares the daylights out of me. We're right there. We are in far better shape than we were  30 40 years ago when if you lived in cleveland you had one newspaper right and three tv stations and that was it  And it was controlled by a few white men  Uh who were gatekeepers to everything that you wanted to know and learn and now through facebook through twitter through the internet itself  Obviously, but overall we have the ability to get to all kinds of sources  We never got to those benefits you're talking about are benefits from the internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not from they can also be benefits from facebook. I have no participation in that process

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I have I have discovered all kinds of wonderful and amazing things in people  Uh, probably including the sponsor that jason wants to get to now  Oh, especially the sponsor

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although I I just have to throw in there real quick sure brought to you by facebook  Oh boy, it just got awkward  Since stepping away from facebook and then you know in recently deleting it or whatever  The challenge is also the benefit in the sense that the big challenge is not knowing what everybody that I care about  Is really up to on a day-to-day basis

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The benefit is that now I talk to them about it and also not knowing about the people you don't care about that's another

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's true. That's another but that's another hidden benefit a kid from third grade that I was following  Yeah, it was a long time when I signed up for facebook back in the early of the mid 2000s  It was I got to collect as many friends as possible. Yes over time. It was like why did I do that?  I have no idea  Felicity let's take a break and thank the sponsor and then we can get back if we want to talk about facebook more we can  You know zuckerberg had his op-ed maybe we could talk about that or maybe we could talk about some other things  We'll figure it out  But first this episode of this week in google is brought to you by on deck  On deck is 100 committed to small business owners with fast easy and tailored  Financing your time of course is valuable  So you can get funding in as fast as 24 hours with term loans up to five hundred thousand dollars  And lines of credit up to one hundred thousand dollars none of which by the way requires business collateral  The application process is super simple  You can apply online or by phone and get approved in minutes and it won't impact your personal credit  On deck delivers some of the best customer service  With their us-based loan specialists and has an a plus rating with a better business bureau  They've lent over 10 billion dollars to over 80,000 small business owners and carry a 9.8  Out of 10 rating on trustpilot  On deck is the secure financing service that business owners everywhere can truly rely on  So you should check it out if you're a small business owner  And you need access to capital  Go to on deck.com  Slash twig right now to check it out read up on it see what it's like  And as a listener of this week in google, you'll receive a free consultation with one of their us-based loan specialists  You can apply online or by phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So we've covered the facebook. Yeah, we can continue this conversation on facebook. Oh, we will we will I don't doubt

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me say let me be clear here be very clear. I really appreciate mike. This is why you're so good at at social that  We disagree. We have a we have a wonderful back and forth  And and I think that's I really appreciate the tone of it. Yeah, thank you and and don't forget

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm saving technopanic.com for you. I still got i'm gonna hang on to it until you decide to write that book  Oh, you you have it you really have it  for you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, like yeah, because I was afraid so we're gonna do one more facebook one more facebook. Okay, what is this this one?  It is the fact that we have the sales department of facebook complaining that engineers have been going from the restroom  Into the cafeteria in bare feet what what?  So mike you're right everything you say about facebook another thing to add to the list, but this is like the engineers are going

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What would zuck do?  He'd also wear a bathrobe

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm happy you included that we could at least end the facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the way, one other quick thing it is interesting that they hired a new head of privacy from eff  They're hiring really tough privacy people. So, you know, all this is making a difference. They're they're  With with one step forward three back

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll try to do some things but we'll leave it there soon soon. They'll they'll catch up on those steps a little bit  um, what about uh  Maybe a little bit. I mean there was some news with uh with huawei, right the u.s.  Had their moment. I think a couple of days ago where they put down two indictments of the u.s  From the u.s department of justice to huawei. This was unsealed on monday  charging cfo meng wanzhou of  Of uh, let's see here fraud money laundering obstruction of justice. Don't forget conspiracy and conspiracy  That's a fun one regarding the sanctions violations with iran

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, is this real or is this politics? Is it maybe you guys have a perspective on this on this whole story?  I do. Yeah, I I do good. I don't know if you uh, I mean no, I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm i'm very much in the I don't really truly know what's going on what to believe here  You know what I mean? Yes, because there's a lot it is highly political as well, right?  um  I'm also kind of confused because we review huawei products on the network  And so then when a new huawei product comes out i'm like, well do I review it like at what point do I say?  Uh, let's not do that anymore  Or I don't even know, you know, because it's hard to know what the truth is

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So what do you think so there's the truth and then there's my theory which is uh,  Based loosely on how I understand the truth  So first of all everyone needs to know like huawei is not a huge brand name  It's mostly known in the united states as a as a smartphone maker  Uh, but they are the world's largest telecom company. So they are a giant they're bigger than at&t. They're just a huge company  They make equipment and so on and my theory is that they that lots of governments  believe very strongly that they are that they  Their identity as a private company is a bit of a mirage and that in fact  They're an arm of the chinese government, right and a tool for them to  Achieve the the objectives of the chinese government one of their objectives that everybody's freaked out about is that the chinese government wants to have  Uh access to the future of 5g everybody knows 5g is coming  It's gonna be super expensive and time consuming to switch everything over to 5g  right  And once they're there, they're gonna want to  the chinese government would love to have access to all of those  points of whatever and  The chinese government says that's ridiculous  They're a private company and huawei says the same thing but this is the suspicion that's it's not a fake  It's not a republican thing or a democrat thing. This is since bill clinton  This has been the strong belief of the intelligence agencies in the united states britain germany australia a whole bunch of company countries  And so they can't prove it. They don't have real  Really strong evidence for it, but they believe that this is essentially chinese government  That's taken over wants to take over 5g that wants to have smartphones all over the place  and so they just oppose it and so there's the  Claim that they may use huawei equipment as a spy tool sounds like conspiracy theory or hysteria  and it  might be  but um, but that's what is believed and  In addition to that the company did in fact separately from that having nothing to do with whether or not they're the government having nothing to do  With whether or not they're spying  apparently  Wanted to sell equipment to iran their us has sanctions in place where it punishes companies that do business with iran  So they created a hong kong based company called sky com  Uh, and it was just huawei, but it was just uh, they pretended like it was a a separate company sky com sold equipment to iran  And when they interact with the banks because the banks have to enforce this this this the sanctions  They said no no, we were not associated with sky com in any way when in fact it was just huawei  There was a whole deal on subsidiary huawei  That's what this is all about  That's what the the the fraud conspiracy and and then there's the related charges of obstruction and then the money laundering is a separate thing  So in addition to this fear of the future of espionage  There appear to be the claim is that there are actual violations of law around  Violating around sanctions. That's what this is all about

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that and then there's also an ip theft intellectual property

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So t-mobile had this robot that that was advanced  This is years ago actually that this happened a robot called tappy and it was a way to simulate a bunch of users on on phones  which  Uh various chinese companies are super interested in for a whole bunch of reasons and so a bunch of huawei engineers were given access by  t-mobile to  Look at tappy they all signed agreements and I you know, not none whatever but they  The the accusation is that not only did they take a lot of pictures did a bunch of measurements  Just trying to extract as much information as possible, but they actually broke tappy's arm off and stole it  So this is the accusation this is the ip theft so poor tappy cruel the one-armed actually broke an actual arm off of a robot

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, all right  I didn't know if that was just like code for they they figured out how to make it work  No, they literally ripped his arm off of his shoulder socket. Alrighty then stuffed it in their pocket

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And so that's the accusation  uh, so there it is and so  One of the things that I think is really interesting  Is that the ceo who is the uh, who is the founder of huawei's daughter by the way, this is a nice little  uh piece of trivia, uh meng huanjiao  She was arrested, uh by canadian authorities  Because the u.s wanted her extradited the u.s to face these charges and  the speed and and  ferocity of the chinese government's response  Kind of makes me think huh? That's weird because chinese government is is behaving as if  This was done to a diplomat or something

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, because I mean from what I understand huawei in china is one of the  Like the the premier brands, yeah, so and and is very critical to  To the economy there, right? Like I mean, there's there's so much money

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's one theory the other theory is that they're actually a wing of the of the people's republic, uh, people's whatever army  Yeah, right. That's the accusation that they're actually a part of the military  Industrial not the military industrial complex the military of china and so so so they so they they're they're considered like a  Potential military espionage  Uh scheme

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what I wonder though is so I think that's a very very good reporting on all of that and thank you  Proof will be in the pudding  If this just becomes a pawn in the larger trade negotiation. Yes. No, never mind, right?  Then that's that's when i'll decide how real  The concern really was yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Uh, and and that that is my fear as well. The timing is super suspicious  This is like perfect timing to use it as a pawn in these negotiations and that's exactly how  President trump negotiates he does something horrible and then they negotiate about the removal of that horrible thing, right?  And then and then you you cut he you know, he comes out ahead. This is the theory behind that style of negotiation. However  um  the  specifics in the indictment are look pretty solid and  Uh, you know, I can't speak to the timing but this seems like they  Very well may have done these things  and so  There it is. And then it also raises the larger question about  America's control of the global financial system when the u.s puts  Trade sanctions on a country. Uh, there's a lot of pushback  on that  Idea that power by china and russia and others, uh iran  Um  Because uh, that's kind of devastating and and so that's a that's a whole nother question  but yeah, I I certainly hope this isn't just a  bargaining chip

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That would be awful. You think man, uh, I mean man faces  big-time prison, uh  Sentence potentially here in the u.s. I mean, I guess so  Potentially, I mean it kind of seems like this is the kind of thing that they'd probably negotiate around that and yeah  And then you got that would be the end game, right? Right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you also canadians were in jail in china probably in retribution for the canada's arrest and it's just it's a lot of people's lives are  Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wrapped up in this. Yeah. Yep. And uh, yeah, and then you know, she'll probably end up sharing a jail cell with el chapo  Uh, that'll be an interesting, uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Situation the odd couple but I didn't know el chapo. So so he's on trial in brooklyn  Yeah, he's staying in the basement of the building because every time they were trying to transport him across he had to close the brooklyn bridge  Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hilarious. I mean the guy's a master. So if you if you're not familiar with this character, he's a master tunnel  He's escaped from multiple mexican prisons  The most spectacular case was he just they had a camera on him 24 7 and one one day  He just got out from his bunk and just disappeared behind the toilet  And they they all panicked when scrambling to his cell  Opened it up ripped off the toilet and there was a tunnel and in there was a track and what they built is a custom  motorcycle that had like train track bottom and he just and he got on this track and just  Hit the gas on this motorcycle and went a mile  In a mile long tunnel and then came out of a private house  in town and disappeared into the ether this guy is  He's not to be tribal with in terms of jail breaks. He's really good at it. Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How do you even do that? Yeah, uh  I don't know. I guess we'll have to interview el champo one of these days figure that out. Um  How do you break out of jail  Uh, and then how do we think this is going to affect huawei in its sales?  And actually I think maybe maybe the more interesting direction that I actually want to go like i'm thinking about going in this like smartphone sales  direction, but then what I really want to talk about is like innovation like this new  new brand of like  We're used to seeing like chinese phones be a few steps ahead  In terms of innovation and right now at this particular moment. We're seeing some really kooky things  Curious to hear you guys's take on it. I hope we're going to talk about the folding. Yeah, let's start there. Xiaomi has uh,  posted to weibo, I believe last week a video  Of I think uh one one of their senior level as co-founder president bin lin  Uh has a tablet device  It's kind of like in a portrait setup tablet device got a little bit of an arc to it  And I I don't know if the video if I included the video for you john and i'm sorry if I didn't  But anyways, he's using it suddenly flips it over folds the sides in and it becomes a phone kind of in portrait  On every with screen on everything. It's like your quintessential, you know modern  Foldable phone concept you can kind of see a little bit of it down there. So I did a an analysis, uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think three or four months three months ago or something about this whole folding phone phenomena because  Samsung has dangled some folding screen phones. We're gonna get something probably in in weeks from samsung microsoft does a bunch of patents  There's a lot going on and it seems like oh, that's the next big thing  No, it is not so these folding phones are not about to change the smartphone  Oh, come on, mike first of all, so you you guys report on all about android the amount the amount of ram in this thing  What was it like? Uh, I think 16 gigs or something 12 possibly. Yeah, it's 16 pretty substantial  Because they're very resource intensive, which means they're going to be very battery intensive and at all all of it  The combined with the technology and all the stuff that goes with it means that they're going to be very very expensive  So a phone like that that he demonstrated if they could go to market within the next year or so that thing was going to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thousands of dollars right? Well, and that's and that's in line with what we're seeing  Pricing for the  And then and then i hope he does and it would be good material for his comedy over the next year while they talk about

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How he like lost all this money on this piece of junk?  And the other thing is that when you you think about wear and tear on any sort of physical device  It's just reason suggests that opening closing folding unfolding  This thing is getting and and you can even see it even with all the prototypes  They try to special lighting and stuff on stage to try to dazzle everybody with this new technology  You can see that the the that when it's fully folded out, it's never flat  It's always kind of it had a kind of like a bump and like it  It has a memory about where it was creased and all that kind of stuff. It's just yes  I believe in all that android we call that the pucker. Yeah to quote steve jobs about the about the stylist. Yeah, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um, nobody wants to me is between that and the other phone that had that has no buttons of any sort  it's just this idea of  Class you hear you hear the the the the platform you hear people at facebook and elsewhere talk about things  They talk about the surface. There's a surface for this and a surface for that  Yeah, that's the way they kind of think of it, right?  And now you rethink that that surface and how anything can be done on it  And they can and these things can be anywhere and you can interact with them  It just starts to open up your mind about not just this  Single device that you carry around that operates in certain ways  It starts to at least make us think about other ways that we can interact with them. That's true. Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and I do think we're on the revolution. We are on the brink of is the revolution of  screens everywhere  intelligence in everything where  And we talked about this I think on twit a couple months ago where  It will be such a radical shift that the concept of sitting down to use a computer will seem quaint to  Kids who are like now 10 years old when they hear us geezers talking about how like oh  We're going to sit down and use a computer. They're like, what are you talking about?  Because like you'll never not be using a computer. They'll be everywhere. They'll be listening for your command at all times  and and you'll have  Augmented reality in your glasses and virtual reality will always be nearby and the window in your office will be a screen  And like it'll just go on and on  It'll be in my view  A kind of paradise. I'm sure there'll be downsides to it, but it sounds great to me  The future is not folding smartphones smartphones  Folding smartphones is how you get there right?  Well small folding smartphones is to me an example of desperately throwing advanced technology at a platform in order to milk it some more  But it's over the smartphone margins even apple is struggling to evaporating to to make those margins  They're commodity devices the innovation is in the ai in the phone and the services that you use and in terms of user interfaces  It's going to be screens everywhere screens in your glasses augmented reality and lots of other things voice interfaces  Are going to change everything but it's not going to be folding smartphones  It's just it's not it's both too early and too late for folding smartphones. Will it be buttonless?  Portless phones sure but the interface but the the interface that will enable it will be voice because you know  If you can talk to it and it does things for you then you know, you don't need to be poking at it  Um, it's not gonna you know, it's not going to be flexible screens  Flexible screens have a place as long as you don't flex them  So for example all these phones that have the screen that kind of go around the edge. Yep  Those are flexible screen phones. It's they you can't do anything with them as long as you don't move it, right?  You know bend it then it's great

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not the the vision that we have of like unrolling a scroll and having that be a display that you can like roll up  Into a nice roll and I think there'll be uses for that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it's but it's not going to be the smartphone replacement  I think you know, I think there'll be things you can you know smart placemats for you know dinner table  I don't know what it what it is. There'll be like objects  There'll be iot objects that happen to have screens that fold but it's not going to be you know, we've really  Been all been empowered by having supercomputers in our pockets. They do everything for us  they've replaced flashlights everything from flashlights to radios to this to that whatever and  That is  A powerful thing and will continue to be a powerful thing until we get all these next generation things years and years in the future  But there's not going to be a period wherever's got folding or even a significant minority has folding screen phones  They're too expensive. They're too unreliable. They're too ugly. They're too. There's too many problems with these things and  these companies are trying to dazzle everybody with this next generation technology, yes, the  Technology is impressive as technology, right?  Yes company's been working on it for decades and they're finally getting to the point where it kind of functions  but all this dazzling demo stuff is not  Is not going to result in a revolution in the consumer marketplace the phone is so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  last  Era of technology. What is the next era?  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You guys did a great job on all about android about heckling this whole thing about how he tried  Even in the demo is just like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To clunk it together and even when you watch it like once it snaps into place  You see the ui like do 10  Corrections before it finally figures it out and frames properly right?  You're always touching the touch screen and yes things are launching  How do you reject your fingers and everything?  one thing that struck me while you were talking about like this this tech utopia this future where  Technology where screens are everywhere and then that's going to be a wonderful place  Makes me makes me wonder if we aren't as just as users of technology  Conflicted with what we actually want on one hand that sounds like a tech a tech  You know enthusiasts  Desire to have something you know all this technology everywhere and it knows what you want before you know it and it can predict  All this stuff at the same time  That's exactly you know a lot of the same stuff that we criticize technology companies for doing  How do we how do we find that balance like how is there?  How is there a connective tissue between one point where it's bad?  We don't want that but yet we want the outcome of it if we can't have it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, here's the rule if we can't have it. It's good. Once we get it. It's bad  Operate oh great that I fear the future  I mean it's almost impossible to predict technology  When you look back at the predictions from the late 20th century about what the future would happen in the future nobody said  Oh, we're gonna have these so you know we have these social networks that track people and do all this kind  You know that we're gonna have flying cars and jeff haxton. It was gonna be amazing  The truth is as jeff alluded earlier  In fact, it has been transformative. It has changed our lives  Phones smartphones especially but lots of technology has really really changed our lives despite all the problems we're experiencing societally  Um, so it's impossible to say what those future problems will be i'm sure that we will have them  Yeah, there will be abuses. There'll be you know  Lots and lots of problems. I think that the great the greatest uh, not to keep um harping on china, but I think the greatest  laboratory for  What's possible in terms of abuse by technologies happening in china they're becoming an orwellian  I take clearly state where they're tracking everybody the social credit thing the most recent news is that  um  I don't know if it's a news or rumor somebody can in the chat room can let me know if this is actually verified news or  just a rumor that i'm mongering here, but  That there's a there's an app or something where if you get within a certain number of yards of somebody who owes money  That it alerts you so you can turn them in and and all you know, they're going in directions that are extremely

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Dark. Well, I mean, yeah, it just always kind of reminds me of uh of black mirror that that social  The social currency episode of black mirror  And and watching that and being like man, that's it. That's a strange world and then realizing that it's already happening  In china and and if that is a foundation  you know  That's actively operating there  I mean who is to say that that doesn't end up  Every, you know everywhere else it doesn't end up here  Maybe not in exactly that same way, but you better believe there are lessons being learned about how it's implemented there  That will be integrated into right into how it operates here  Yeah, I mean that might be looking into the into our future  I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think we're going to see a difference between free societies and unfree societies not based on who has technology and who doesn't  But who has the power to use that technology the right it's going to be a legal issue. It's going to be a  you know, basically a  Situation so let me give you an example. I wrote a a column years and years ago called I want to live in a surveillance society  everybody's like  Complaining about surveillance cameras everywhere in london like all the surveillance was happening and my view was  Okay, we're gonna have surveillance technology, but the public gets it too like we get to surveil them  We get to watch the watchers  It's not just every time there's a and this is one of the things that you know  You notice if you're a technology historian over time is that every time there's new technology  The authorities whoever they are governments police organizations  authoritarian governments free governments everybody  Says oh great. There's new technology. We can monopolize this to increase our power  Right over our opponents which in the case of law enforcement is over the criminals. So for example  Uh, you know you you and these things have to be  Dealt with in the court. So if all of a sudden you get new surveillance technology, right?  The police want to use it and ban everybody else from using it or you the classic example is an interrogation  interrogation rooms have existed forever, but as soon as there was  Inexpensive digital video now, there's a camera in every interrogation room those that footage is used in courtrooms, but only the police  Can decide whether it's on or not on or you know, they have a they have a one-sided  control over digital video surveillance technology in a situation where there are mano a mano with a with a  Suspect right so and there have been cases where people have secretly recorded  interrogations  In court it was established based on those recordings that the police had lied. I'm not  Anti-police here. I'm you know, there's some bad apples in every in every  profession  even journalism and so  In in in those cases that's a perfect example of how okay if somebody's going to record an interrogation  Let's all record it. Mm-hmm, right and and this is the going to be the difference  So the surveillance technology in China is only creepy because they are claiming a monopoly on that ability  If I also have an app that tells me when a creditor is coming to get me and when I if I owe money  You know, that's that's a free society  Yeah, if only the people who are out to get the people who owe money have that technology  That's an unfree society anyway, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Great that's the future we're staring at the future super depressing. Thanks for cheering us up  Why don't we cheer everyone up with a little Google change?  Yeah, let's do it  Maybe there's some things in here that'll cheer you up  Let's see here. We kind of already did the gmail update for Android. It's getting brighter. So look for that update  I got it today and it does look better. It's just not inbox  Anyways, we've already talked about that  If you've ever visited a site and you look up the URL bar and it looks like the right URL and then you realize oh  Wait a minute  They put in a character there that you know  Basically a fraudulent URL to make you think you're going to one place when you're actually going some race else  Apparently Google Chrome Canary 70 has introduced a feature called navigation suggestions for look-alike URLs you  Once that flag is active a panel will actually appear underneath the URL bar when it detects that a URL is close  But incorrect and it'll say something like did you mean to go to PayPal comm instead of PayPal or whatever the case may be  No word on when it's going to officially ship in the main  Real how is that a first step to killing the URL? I have no idea. You know what that might be  So was that that was the wire and help?  That might be the wrong well, I think yeah, I think that's the wrong link but that has something to do with no  It's the right link. It's just I mean  I may have pulled this information from a different from a related story and it's not talking about that particular thing  Google has something going on right now where they're  They're changing the omnibox to show sites differently. Maybe this is part of it. I'm not really quite sure but  Anyways, whatever it is. I'm against it. All right, good good. Thanks for thanks for the backup  Speaking of the omnibox. Let's see here  Chrome is apparently kind of sprucing it up to make it a little bit more search-friendly  Do more activities from there directly  So if you want to copy a web page, you can see in that little screenshot the page that you're on  It has a little copy or share button right next to it  So instead of having to go up there and copy the URL or whatever  It's like a single tap you can do that and move on with your life

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How many URLs do you think you copy per day in my case is probably 50 oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's constantly doing it. Yeah, I don't know if it's that much but definitely when I'm when I'm doing a show  I'm copying URLs like friends. Oh, yeah for sure. That's absolutely tweeting. So that'll be nice  Also adding voice input capabilities into the mobile search bar. So kind of embedded in there  I don't know if this appears on iOS. I know in the mobile web search. It's appearing on Android  I don't see why it wouldn't appear on iOS, but basically it's it's kind of one step  More towards bringing assistant into everything that they're doing  Bringing that voice search into the actual bar instead of just in the OS that you're using or whatever the case may be  So and also I think it will read your results out to you in its fun robotic voice if you like  I'm in favor. That's that's awesome. I like I think this is pretty neat  Of course, I have children so but they might be a little old for this  Maybe my five-year-old would like this apparently Google Home now has now works with a number of Disney like gold  You know those golden books that have the golden  the golden whatever covers  If you are reading a supported book and you tell Google Home to go into a particular mode like storytime or something like that  It will listen to you as you read it and as you say certain words  It will time like sound effects in music that coordinate with that story  So if it's Coco for example, and you introduce, you know this this page where Coco comes in and plays a guitar  Suddenly Google Home is playing, you know that guitar song or whatever  Kind of a neat little interactive thing that Google Home is apparently doing with some support books  I think there's like 20 books that are supported right now  So who knows how many of those they're gonna open up? But as a parent, how do you what do you think about that?  I think it's neat. I think I'd you really have to go a long way to like do that though, right?  Like I'd have to know that my Google Home supports this particular book, right?  I'd have to buy that book with the thought that okay, I'm gonna go home with it now  Maybe they'll have something called out on the books that says works with your Google Home  Yeah, that might be a good way to raise awareness. I'm honestly I would probably forget. Yeah, probably forget to use it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it's probably the first step in basically doing that for all books for everybody maybe or you know in an extreme case  Yeah  So yeah, I mean I also think it might be a distraction. It's like adding special effects to story time  It's I think it's I mean for especially really young children  My own impulse would be to like let's just teach the kids to immerse themselves in a book  Yeah, you know without the they can fill in the gap showbiz  Totally background for older kids. It might be fun. I mean you who knows but it's I think we're gonna get to the point where  someday  Every book will be an audio book automatically where the reading of it special effects all that stuff will be just compiled on the fly  Probably five ten years away from something like that, but this is a first step

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's neat like it's actually pretty familiar to me because we I can't remember the name of it, but my  My daughter has it's a stuffed animal  And you know it has a computer inside of it and speaker and everything like that  And there's a series of books that works with that animal  Yeah, that when you turn the animal on and you read the story  It's it's always listening for these particular hot words in the story  Yeah  and when you get to that point in the story that triggers the doll to like right laugh or say oh that was so funny or  Whatever interact with the story, so it reminds me a lot of that and I know when my daughters were younger  They loved that they thought that was awesome  I'm telling the story and then all of a sudden the doll is talking to them and it's totally related  So yeah, I could see it being a being a cool thing and then finally I do not put this in here

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that it's my fault. I put it in the wrong place. Oh, okay  Put it there. There's nothing to do with change log

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you should know the discarded smart light bulbs reveal your Wi-Fi passwords. They're stored in the clear

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I meant to put that another and I put in the wrong place

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

What is your tool or number or thing or whatever you want to call it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is a tool. So  recently  Microsoft got a lot of press because they added  You know the the basic story that people were getting was that the edge browser  was getting sort of this anti fake news feature and  What that was actually was that it now supports news guard and because nobody uses Microsoft edge  Everyone should know that news guard is actually a plug-in that you can use in Chrome especially but also even Firefox and Safari and  I would recommend it  So if you want to get this it's news guard tech.com and what what it does is is really actually very cool  This this by the way is a startup that was run by it has two CEOs Stephen Brill the famous Stephen Brill and  Former Wall Street Journal publisher Gordon Krovitz  They are co CEOs of news guard and when you have the extension installed it puts a badge on  Every recognized news source whether you see it in search results on Twitter Facebook  Reddit wherever it is it puts a little badge if it's agree to the page right next to the link  okay, or the headline or whatever it is and  That is the that's the rating for the news source  Not the article specifically. So if it's green, that means they say this is a red reputable  Organization, they do fact-checking they do blah blah blah. They have a long list of criteria if it's red  That means it's Breitbart or some other, you know  purveyor of of of  falseness in one way or another if it's gray that means it's something all the British publications that the Daily Mail etc  They're all gray because there's like well  It is some good journalism  But they also do some not so good journalism and so they and and when you click on the badge  You get what they call a nutrition label. So they actually go through all the criteria and say, okay, they do this they do this  They don't do that, but they do this this this this this and it said it's  Just like turn-by-turn directions in Google Maps. Don't take it too literally think for yourself  Don't drive off a cliff because it says, you know keep going  But it's just a nice visual thing the where you know, if you're about to click on something you see a red badge  You're like, you know what? I'm not even gonna click on it. And and that's a you know, it's it's a time saver  I think and also a consciousness razor  Above all all you have to do is go to the group. Go if you're using Google Chrome go to the Chrome store  Search for news guard and install it and it just happens

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Magically nice. I'm definitely gonna be only caution

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  About that is that is that I and I'm involved in project trying to aggregate  Many many many signals of quality of news. It's a one-size-fits-all judgment. Yes, and I'm not sure that that necessarily  Can hold there isn't there isn't a universal definition of trust  and so  You know, they they put the Daily Mail on the red list and other people thinks it's wonderful and and we can debate about that  but I  It's hard to imagine one entity

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Deciding for everybody the way I think people should think about news guard is that it's like subscribing to a publication  When you have a public a described in the if you subscribe to a new your local newspaper, okay  The newspaper is the editorial  Department is run by editors who are making decisions about what to cover how to cover it enforcing things  They're also essentially buying for lack of better term articles from Reuters and news  Aggregators that they trust but you're trusting that editor if you subscribe to that magazine  So you think of news guard as a as a as an editor company? They're making editorial judgments  And just as there are different types of newspapers that have different criteria for their editorial judgments. This is just one

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Editor editorial judgment company right but it's one that cuts across every news source  Yeah, exactly. So it's a little bit a little bit different that sense exactly as opposed to being able to say  I want to look at what the editor of the Telegraph says what the editor of the Guardian says  Yeah, and I'll get a triangulation different viewpoints

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's why I say think for yourself  But see how it how you like it and you may choose that  To to to not use them and maybe use another one or not use any or whatever  But it is a time saver I think in general their criteria very good the biggest criticism I have for them is there so many  Publications they have not evaluated so they just blank they don't have a badge of any kind  All right, and so you're kind of on your on your you're exactly where you were. Yeah. Yeah exactly  That's I was just gonna say that but it does surface  it was the degree to which Google kind of like, you know, the results are kind of like, huh, you know,  cuz sometimes you go, you know, if you go to Google News you search for something and  It'll show you five things or something like that and oftentimes the the top one has a red badge  Oh interesting why is there this big disagreement?  Like they'll put a Breitbart story as the number one source for some some political news  and so it kind of do do do you  Who's wrong there? Is it is it news garters at Google in my estimation so far? It's been Google  I would prefer that Google not  Elevate those to the top most of the time their top stories are all green but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway, it's something interesting. That's news guard news guard tech.com right now. I'm gonna check that out  Jeff you've got a few different numbers. So here's one

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I went to a town hall with my newly elected  Congressman Tom Malinowski here in Jersey and he was talking people were asking how do we get in touch with the other day?  so social media and  But then he explained that he had to have two accounts on each platform  It was a requirement now  So the one is rep Tom Malinowski and was Tom Malinowski and the latter is his account and he can say whatever he wants on  but the other is the government account and  He cannot obviously use that in any way to promote  The private account because the private account is basically considered permanently to be campaign and  The public account the rep Tom Malinowski account or the rep  Acacia Cortez account rep AOC account is considered using official resources  So which I think is kind of vaguely interesting and and probably not actually a terrible thing  But what it amounts to is you're nobody's gonna follow the rep accounts because you're only gonna get as press releases there  Whereas if you call I mean I wrote a piece a few weeks ago about Acacia Cortez AOC  Comparing her use of Trump of Twitter to Trump in McLuhan esque terms  But I think she is just  Incredibly brilliant at how she uses social media to do all kinds of great things to explain to have stands to argue to  to counteract  In absolutely brilliant ways and not just Twitter, but all the social platforms  But anyway, there's an AOC account that's her and there's rep AOC account and that's officialdom

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And and that system is what we've had for the president since the beginning  So there's a POTUS account right he's passed from president to president and there's real Donald Trump  the I  Just would like to point out though that these politicians who are really good at Twitter  like  President Trump like Cortez they  Are good at using social media not to so much thrill the public but to attract the media  so they uses it a lever to get media coverage and  that's something to keep in mind if you ever run for president because it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's our day to disagree a little bit Mike. Okay. I think that's true of Trump  I think people people give Trump credit for being good at Twitter  He's not media write a news story every single time he tweets and so he just is using media. That's that that's right  Whereas AOC I think is very different  She was ignored by media. She couldn't get she couldn't get arrested near any publications in New York  the only way that she got elected was through social media and she developed her own relationship with people there and  so she often is very  Dismissive or what the media doesn't care the media is now following after her because they realize the boat they missed  but but her social media presence is is  Sufficient unto itself. So I think there are lessons there for everybody to use social media. Well, she has constructive smart

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Conversations there. Yes, and she's also good on regular media. She's a good interview the I mean you have to talk about her because she's probably  the most  visible and  effective  Freshman ever I mean and oh, yeah, and it's because of her use of media both social and other  But I would I would say that to get elected yes, but now that she's elected  I mean I read stories about her all the time in my political newsfeed  She's like, you know, she's like one of the top people out of nowhere and she said this and she said that she said  You know, she's saying all these things and then when you dig down you realize she's saying it on Twitter  You see that's you know, so I think now that she's in office  She I think a lot of her media is just people are going to her for the interview  But a lot of her media is like she tweeted something and some of her best stuff is on Twitter  Like some of her most quotable stuff is they're quoting tweets. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In to user and for me I got to one of them is an actual tool and it's  Care of Kevin Toffle friend of the show  He wrote on his about Chromebooks.com  Site that a Chrome OS 73 dev channel apparently supports instant tethering for some  Non pixel devices for the very first time  This is a feature that you could do if you have a pixel device and you have a Chrome OS device  You can have it instantly tether automatically hop onto your phone's data connection  When it senses that it's close and you've got it all set up apparently he got it working with a Nokia 7 plus and a pixel  slate  And others are reporting that it works with the s9 and the 1 plus 6t  So the feature hasn't officially been announced yet  So probably there will be more information about this as it's developed out further device list  Maybe be released at some point  We need to enable the flag in order for it to start working and then when you visit the settings you can connect and verify  The device and hopefully it'll work for you. So
