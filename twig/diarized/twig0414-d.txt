The show we talk about all the cool things happening in the metaverse around us.  Or perhaps we're imaginary creatures and it's the metaverse that's real.  We'll never know but fortunately Jeff Jarvis is here to help us navigate these waters.  Hey Jeff, good to see you for the City University of New York is in his office.  Hello, yes here I am.  Be careful of the media you love is what your bag says behind you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That came from VidCon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Why would we be critical of the media we love?  Because that's how you keep loving it.  I guess considering that you're a reform TV critic.  Hey, that's my marriage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have this poster too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's my marriage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And this is also from VidCon.  Go talk to people.  Marty Barron, Washington Post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is a great quote and a good poster.  Marty Barron is a journalist featured in Spotlight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's what you have to do if you're going to be a reporter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's the one that's featured in Spotlight.  He's actually the editor of the Washington Post.  Oh that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But what Hollywood says is more important as you know.  That's Stacey Iggenbotham.  She's the host of the IoT podcast at IoTpodcast.com with Kevin Topol.  And has a very useful newsletter and blog at stacey on IoT.com if you're interested in IoT.  And who isn't?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And who isn't?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's the next big thing.  I think your husband.  Okay maybe.  Is he critical of IoT?  He's OD'd on IoT I doubt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He tolerates IoT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah there's really a limit.  I have the same problem with my spouse.  There's a limit to how far you can go messing with a household.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So is the problem with your spouse or maybe the problem is just with us?  Because that's.  Yeah.  I don't mean the problem is hers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean we have a problem.  Yes.  Whether the source of the problem is her or me I would say it's almost certainly me.  But yeah.  So it's not that I have a problem with her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can't even get my family to do Alexa.  I love Echo.  Echo is awesome.  You can't get the family to do it.  They will not do it.  They laugh at me.  They look at me.  They roll their eyes.  They're like oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was just demonstrating my new Echo show to some visitors and I called my kitchen and  there was somebody in there.  Surprised her a little.  Did you know them?  Yes I did know them.  But I surprised her a little.  Sarah who takes care of us.  But it was a great demo and then I couldn't turn it off.  She said oh that's OK.  I'll entertain.  So she's quite the singer and dancer.  So it's perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh excellent.  Speaking of which I just want to start here.  Please.  New podcast that's a musical.  Yeah.  I'm thinking Leo this is your next.  I missed my book.  Wait what is happening?  Musical?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No this is just is it a gimlet.  It's another one of them.  Public radio people.  No it's called 36 questions I think.  Stars Hamilton alum Jonathan Groff who was a wonderful King George III.  King George.  I'll be back.  You'll be back.  Yeah that was wonderful.  He's great.  It's a narrative podcast about a couple working out their marital issues through song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  I should do an entire episode in music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Whether it's Google or Facebook or Apple we'll talk about it even if it's bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Stacey your turn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't sing at that's not true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm telling you this is a fresh jolt of life into the into the format.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Producer Zach Akers said there's an unlimited amount of ways to go right now because the  podcast form is so young and so pliable.  No it's old as old as Leo.  I used to be young and pliable.  Yeah I don't think you know okay how can you mix up the form how do you mess with an audience  in an interesting way.  Absolutely I agree with that.  That's what's not just podcast but new media in general gives you an opportunity to break  with with the past a little bit right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well in musicals it's exactly the quintessential rom-com.  So having this sort of thing like for that story makes sense I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Isn't it the case Jeff you're old.  Isn't it the case that very often when you get new media the first thing that happens  is that is people try to take the old media and shoehorn it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Absolutely we see the future and the analog of the past yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And what what more old school than musicals.  Musicals.  Opera.  Opera that's well I'm sure there are opera podcasts.  I did not mind the idea.  In fact there's a you know there's there's storytelling podcasts there's a great fiction  podcast.  I don't mind that at all people putting a musical.  That's very interesting.  The problem with it is the cost of production on a musical is orders of magnitude higher  than just what we do.  The authorship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I haven't listened to it yet.  You want to try a little bit.  Let me see if I can find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you search for if you search on while Google Play they had the song separate from the from  the text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if you sort of like I think of the merchandising opportunities how could I not think of that  right away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could sell soundtracks.  You could license the rights to songs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So apparently these 36 questions are 36 questions that will help you fall in love with anybody.  So that's where the name comes from.  Let me see though if I can get the little bit of the music.  Graf is phenomenal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you search iTunes or Google Play for the for that title the songs are separate.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here are the songs from Act 1.  Is this it.  There's three acts.  Yeah.  This is it.  Here's songs from Act 1.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You share a lot in common with my husband.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is Jesse Shelton.  So if you just have a keyboard I guess it's not.  I actually love this idea.  Here's one with the Graf and Shelton.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I came out here for one thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that little thing one thing was to forget about you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But look at I just want to point out the list of people involved in the production.  Written, directed and composed by Ellen Wielton and Chris Littler.  Produced by Zach Akers and Skip Bronke.  Arranged music supervision by A.S.R.  Edited and mixed by Sound Design.  Mastered by engineers, sound engineering, production manager, production assistant, story consultant, percussion, piano, cello, trombone, bass.  And every it's well known that a musical to produce a musical on Broadway is significantly more than producing a play.  And I would imagine some of the same costs.  Well, in that case, you also have union costs, which are huge.  Yeah.  I mean, I just I think this is a great thing and I hope they can make money and make make their way doing it.  I think it's fantastic.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Are they doing Patreon?  I don't know.  I'm not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.  I just saw there was a Wired story about them.  Yeah.  They did Lime Street before, which was a I think a fictional podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was.  There's some great stuff going on.  My mom is a big fan of something called Crime Town because we grew up.  Oh, yeah.  That's great.  We grew up in Providence, right?  Yes.  So the first show is about the Providence mafia.  And they come back to it a couple of times.  Yeah.  So she's a big fan of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I love that your mom listens to podcasts.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's a gimlet show.  So that's great.  I mean, companies like Gimlet that have more money than we do.  Well, actually, I don't know if that's true, but they have more.  I'll bet you have more revenue than Gimlet does.  We probably have more revenue than almost anybody in NPR.  Yeah, I think we do.  We almost made 10 million in revenue last year.  By the way, I love your openness about that.  Well, I mean, I don't know.  Lisa doesn't, but she's my CEO and wife.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I think it proves the viability.  When I tell people the story of Twint in the media world, around the world,  their eyes bug out.  Yeah.  And I show them the shows and I say, look at this.  This is how you produce this.  This is a new way to think about content and video and audio  and a new way to have a relationship with an audience  and an old way to think about advertising.  It's radio, right? But it works.  And you have your own native advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It is different than radio in a lot of respects.  We only do a few ads a show.  The ads are longer than radio ads and they're much more personal than radio ads.  Our audience is more engaged than a radio audience.  The ads are much more expensive.  But the ROI is equivalently high or we wouldn't get advertisers sticking around.  And we do something that nobody does.  In fact, it baffles people.  Lisa got an angry email from somebody the other day  because he said, because we turn down advertisers all the time.  We vet them and we turn them down.  And he said, how dare you?  He said, I'm not going to propose my clients to you to have them be turned down.  That's, you know, I've never that's insane.  I've never heard of such a thing.  And so what really that points to is that the very big difference is that an advertisement on our shows,  and I think this is true of most podcasts, at least if they're successful and they do well,  is really a recommendation from the host and is based on the trust.  And if I accepted just anything, it would be problematic.  Because when somebody's unhappy with a product, they blame.  They don't blame the product.  They blame me almost invariably if it's an advertiser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, Leo, not speaking specifically, but generically, what kinds of sponsors do you turn down?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, if it's a product I don't like, we regularly get requests from antivirus companies  and other security products, which we turn down because I don't recommend any viruses.  It's just a variety of things.  It's on a case by case basis.  I wouldn't say it's a category.  I would say it's it's not a category.  It's just if that's a product, I can't get behind it.  It's a specific advertiser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you really just look at it on a specific basis.  Yeah.  So it's personal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's personal, which is why they get upset if I say no.  And it is challenging to say no.  I mean, we don't want to say, well, we don't like your product, so go away.  We have to say, well, it doesn't fit or it's a conflict or Leo uses something else.  But anyway, the point, I guess, getting back to the 36 questions in the musical,  is it's wonderful new medium.  But like a lot of what's going on in the Internet, I think a lot of companies start up with no plan or desire or means to make money at it.  But just the notion, well, let's just take a chance.  Let's try it.  Let's see if we can generate an audience, which is great.  I'm thrilled that there's that kind of experimentation going on.  But that doesn't mean necessarily they'll be, you know, how what's going to survive, what what's going to make sense.  I think it could be the musical could be much better than the news roundtable, which I've bet all my money on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't there a same the news program?  Or is that just something I've imagined in my head for all of my life?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It seems like there was a YouTube video.  Was it was that like not a thing?  Yeah, I think it was.  Auto tune the news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Auto tune the news.  Way back in the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  OK, well, there's I think that might still be around.  Oh, OK.  The Gregory Brothers did it.  Yeah.  So here here's the here's an example.  Actually, let me turn up the size.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Size fits all solutions.  I hear a foghorn.  Oh, legislature override a gubernatorial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is an early boring.  I'm not feeling any romance between us right now.  You got to do it like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ready?  This was a pretty remarkable week on the gay marriage front.  First of all, they have escaped like they're auto tuning.  He's posting.  Not posting in a decision.  It's pretty funny, actually.  Yeah.  Now you sound so fine.  Give me a number.  We can talk and grind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Those are the Gregory Brothers, I think.  Then there's Songified the News.  This is this is he's been doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that me?  Is that that app that turns spoken words to song?  Thank you for sitting down with me.  Were you ever bullied?  No, I wasn't.  Has it happened that somebody has has done this is Megan Kelly in the present.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I try and unwound myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I feel like you're trying to get out of balance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I go hard.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I go hard.  If I was off, I would not have gotten this far.  I go hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I go hard.  I go hard.  I'm familiar.  I say sit down, everybody.  They don't sit down.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  They refuse to sit down.  They don't sit down.  Sit down, everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's pretty good.  That takes some skill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Isn't that just like an AI?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I think you could do that automatically.  No, I didn't.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wasn't this like an app pick of yours?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was an app, but I don't think it was anywhere that good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it wasn't.  OK, that's a that's a pretty skillful thing to do.  You've got to edit it and tune it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes.  Although this was it this week that we saw that you could now do an AI that can make

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it look like President Obama's day job.  Well, this is of course this is the story in general is we're getting closer and closer  to a world where anything can say anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Anybody can be made to say anything or look like they're saying anything.  And I think this is what you're talking about.  So what was that called?  Oh, crikey.  OK.  But you know, there it is.  Scarily realistic AI video.  Put on a screen.  And then you can see it.  And then you can see it.  And then you can see it.  Scarily realistic AI video puts words in Obama's mouth.  This is I think it's good to talk about this only because I figure it's only a matter of  time before people are going to start doing this to us, to me particularly.  And and and people will believe this.  So it's important for everybody to know that this can be completely fake.  Here's an article from Boing Boing.  This is researchers at the University of Washington developed an AI model of Obama's lip movements  so that the bots lips sync up to any audio track.  Here's synthesizing Obama learning lip sync from audio.  Given this audio as input.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's been less than a week since the deadliest mass shooting in American history.  Our method produces the following output.  It's been less than a week since the deadliest mass shooting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So this is the actual video and the actual audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Foremost in all of our minds has been the loss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I wish they had picked something a little less sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Here's the ground truth video of Obama saying the same words.  Especially our friends who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender.  I visited with the families of many of the victims.  Oh, wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And one thing we saw their results first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  So so you got to watch this on Boing Boing, I guess.  But the so that fooled me.  Yes, I did notice the lip sync was a little weird.  But you see that all the time in video, especially ours.  So I didn't take it.  And I thought that was the original that they showed the.  They showed the AI version first.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is right. See, Eek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Eek. Eek.  Yes, super scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so is the next step in something like that to build a neural network that can tell when those are fake.  You know how like there's some awesome people who are really great at spotting photoshopping for like Kardashian pictures.  Is that like a skill set we're going to have to develop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, right now, the researchers at the University of Washington say it would be easy enough to prove it's a fake, you know, with with simple tools.  But I think it's going to get harder and harder.  I think that's the real point.  And yeah.  And in this world of fake news, it's going to get easier and easier to make.  Boy, that's going to be confusing for people, too, because we have been taught to trust our eyes.  You know, pictures didn't happen.  If you can't trust the pictures or the video, we have and we haven't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, we've been taught by entertainment to to suspend disbelief around images and movies and all kinds of things.  Yeah.  So it always depends upon the source.  I guess you're right. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. But OK, I think as a journalist, though, and even as a professor of journalism, that makes my job like so much more difficult, especially in a rapid fire news world that we live in.  You just saw me get fooled, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. True.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So we need to slow down.  We need to have we need a better systems of provenance.  You know, there's some simple tricks when you see a photo that's too good to be true.  So I was talking to so we announced something here at CUNY.  We're working with Stora, Fuller, and Moat on basically the first phase of this is a list of all the known really bad fake news sites.  One of the guys was telling me that when they see a really funny, weird, I don't believe that picture and they verify that it's made up, then they look on and they see that's been put on hundreds of sites.  And so there are going to be more and more technique.  The bad guys are always going to be a step ahead.  Just ask Matt Cuts. But we do have the technology.  You're right. Yeah. Yeah.  We're going to take this this data set and try to see how much prediction we can do around both the type of content that's there and also how it's promoted and things like that.  So, you know, Stacey, you're absolutely right.  It makes it more challenging.  But that's why there's also always a business opportunity.  Do you know Stora, Fuller?  Stora, Fuller is a startup that was bought by News Corp that that verifies social content and then sells it to media companies.  So there's business opportunity there, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But think, I mean, this gives new meaning to the October surprise, right?  Because when you're at the day before the election, let's say, and so many of the charters said this, and I think it's very astute.  It's the day before the election and you and you get the candidate saying something horrible.  Is there time? Is there time? Is there a phone ringing?  Is there a landline in the house?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm just ruining everything.  Wait, don't move, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Web 1350, 54K says something like that can he did he stop moving can turn elections.  Imagine a candidate saying something outrageous to everybody falling for 24 hours before an election.  Or here's another one.  A candidate could dog whistle something outrageous and then say, oh, no, that's fake news.  Yeah.  Oh, that happens all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Remember, everybody does something stupid and it's like, oh, my Twitter account was hacked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, that's right. That's the wiener defense.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, that worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hey, speaking of wieners, did you see Google Glass is back?  Jeff, are you going to get your Google Glass out of retirement?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't even get me started.  This is not doing it again.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a smart thing.  This is how it should have been all along, right?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How it should have been used all along.  Should have been.  Yeah.  Yes, we are using our show this morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead.  This is a great place for business type computing to go from business to the personal because  you get the economies of scale.  You're going to at a personal level, we just weren't prepared at the social kind of contract  level at the understanding of what it was going to take to make this real.  But heads up displays are something that are going to be really useful everywhere, but  especially useful in the business world.  And they'll pay the premium price tags.  They'll charge the things.  Now they have a little light that says when you're recording.  So, yay.  We'll learn some of those awkward encounters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is an article by Steven Levy and Wired.  He juxtaposes two different visions of glass.  On the left, the original vision with Diane Wein-Furstenberg, the designer, and Sergey  Brynne wearing their glass at a fashion show.  Forget that one.  This is the one that's important.  This is the one that's today.  This is a worker at a company called Agco.  They make agricultural machinery.  No, I had them on the podcast.  You did?  Oh, that's neat.  So, I think he comes into work, puts on glass, says, okay, glass, let's go.  And I guess, what is it?  So, tell me, what is he looking at in that screen over his red eyebrow?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, either videos or instructions on how to fix that machine or possibly data from them.  Do they use the glass?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, the camera in the glass?  Do they take pictures or something?  They can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, they can take pictures of something and send it along.  This is actually not, this is actually, these sorts of displays have been used for a while,  like Tetra Pak, the guys who do the little, I can't think of it, non-refrigerated milk  packs, like the Horizon Milk.  Those guys actually use Microsoft's, Asceptic, thank you.  I could not think of that word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Asceptic packaging, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, those guys actually use Microsoft's HoloLens to repair and deal with, yeah.  And that's a VR function.  I'm sorry, it's not a VR function.  It's an AR function.  AR function, right.  And so, yes, this is a similar thing.  And Epson has a whole line for industrial glass type things.  But Google has got so much more, A, name brand, and B, it's got all these cloud resources behind it, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So, when Google stopped the Explorer program, which is what you got your glass and I got my glass under, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Later, the name would change, it was the Schmuck program.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  $1,500, that's how much we were.  $2,000 for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What?  Oh, because you.  Because I bought the, I got, like, ouch.  Prescription lenses.  I got prescription lenses, thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So, that ended January 2015, but according to TechCrunch, they never stopped.  Ron Miller says they continue to sell glass to businesses.  They wanted them.  So, the EE, which used to be Explorer edition, is now Enterprise edition.  And they just announced the Enterprise version on Tuesday.  But glass never really left.  A lot of companies, GE Healthcare, using it.  Glass has been used in the emergency room at UMass Medical School.  So, it never went away.  It's really interesting.  It went away into my closet, I'll tell you that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But it's not, it's interesting.  So, there's a difference between glass, which is really just having a proximate screen.  Yes.  That you can read without, you know, using your hands or looking away from your task.  Versus HoloLens, which really, as you said, Stacey, is, it's augmented reality.  Superimposing, say, instructions on top of what you're doing.  Which I think would be more useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, the two things you should just think about is both of them are a form of a heads up display.  And both of them are giving information.  Right.  In an enterprise context, it doesn't matter if it's like fancy AR information.  Or if it's just like, even instructions for how to fix something.  Or a reminder of how many counts for CPR that you've got to do.  Like, I talked to a doctor who did a CPR app for Google Glass.  And that was like, it was basically a reminder for how to do CPR in this, if you needed to.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, here's a good example.  The rhythm on CPR has changed.  And we're supposed to now do it.  I, I, I, I.  Staying alive.  Yeah, we're still staying alive, right?  Yeah, but that's different than the way it was before.  I don't know, the rules have changed slightly.  So, you could have the Bee Gees playing in your Google Glass.  They did.  To help you.  That was part of the app.  To help you do it in the right rhythm.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was part of his app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's pretty funny.  I wonder if the Bee Gees approve the use of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't say no once it's out there.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can't tell by the way I use my.  I'm sorry, that's not the point.  This has now become the musical podcast.  The musical podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're getting there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm waiting for the Leo and Jeff duet.  Maybe, maybe you can argue about data rights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You don't bring me hard drives anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What else should we talk about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How about Jason Calacanis?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I put this on there.  It is.  He's driving me nuts.  You know, and I like Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's a character and you're right.  I can understand.  So here he is on Squawk Alley on CNBC.  What's he talking about?  The new news feed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, he's smashing Google and Facebook saying they're awful.  He's making fun of Google for the new news feed, which we'll talk about in a minute.  He's saying that there are terrible partners that Wall Street Journal and Guardian and New York Times left them, which is not really true.  They just a few of them kind of a few things, but they're not they're working together.  In fact, I just talked to people very happy with them and never really reveals the conflict of interest here, which he still runs the.  What does that say he has?  Was it a launch?  What was it?  No launches.  No, no, no, no.  It was on his car.  Lower three inside.  Inside.  So here's why Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is why Jason doesn't like Google, I think.  Inside, which is a newsletter, went from being a website with information to kind of a newsletter.  And the reason he had to do that is because it was entirely reliant on Google search results driving traffic was essentially demand media.  Right.  Right.  Is that unfair to call it demand media?  I don't think so.  Because demand media.  Well, go ahead.  It's kind of as a negative.  But the idea was it real news curated by real humans and that you would be driven to these stories by doing a search for.  And he had lots of people writing stories about a lot of subjects was demand media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We know other people's stuff.  Other people's words.  I don't.  Yeah, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Did he do that?  If that's the case, that's not so good.  Anyway, then Google basically killed him.  And I think he wrote a piece in his newsletter about that by by killing demand media, by D, D ranking it or lowering its rank.  And so he went to a completely different model.  And now it's all newsletters.  And that but if you look at it, you see the ideas similar, which is it's a lot of verticals.  So these are all topsy like that guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kawasaki's thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, there's been there were a lot of demand.  Yeah, a lot of a lot of things were like, OK, because there was they were an effort to just jump on to cheap content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By aggregating or repurposing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's got a conspiracy newsletter.  He's got a he's got everything you could think of is a news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Trump newsletter is updated like twice a week.  I wouldn't say that's often enough, fella.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now, I don't want to knock Jason.  I like Jason a lot.  And he's on their show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I will, because because because the the segment he should really reveal that he has why he has a sack.  He should revealed it and the show should revealed it.  And it becomes more of this new Google.  And it's just I get I get tired.  It doesn't get us anywhere.  All right. I gave you so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have a cool story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, wait a minute before we do, I just want to get to the news feed thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So they change when you hit the Google app.  I don't know if I've got it or not.  Used to be now cards.  Right now.  Supposedly, I thought it was now cards.  But now supposedly it's a personalized stream of news.  First of all, I want the now cards.  No, it's I think it's better.  It's still my now cards.  It's still now cards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But wait, it's just better cards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait, where is this on my phone?  You'd have to get the Google app on iOS or Android and you'd have to get it updated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I didn't get an update on the Google app in the last few days.  OK, maybe we don't have the latest.  But I've always had some news.  I've always had a smattering of news articles in my in my Google.  Now it's new cards.  It also shows where the news is.  Is this maybe a response to demand for more content?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, so here's the funny thing.  The way the way that the various news sites around said this was they said they like TechCrunch

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  called it a friendless feed.  A lot of others said Google has to compete with Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think it's competition with Facebook in the slightest.  It just happens to be another feed that has news in it.  It's just a little bit of a different thing.  But I think it's a little bit of a different thing.  I think it's a little bit of a different thing.  I think it's a little bit of a different thing.  I think it's a little bit of a different thing.  And the slightest.  It just happens to be another feed that has news in it.  So they call it a news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I must have it because I do see a lot more news articles than I used to see.  There are more things that makes me sad.  Google has never lived up to the promise of Google now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait, wait, no, no, no.  Stop right there. I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But it's so much could be so much more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, like what?  I mean, Google now right now, I'm in it.  I get my news stories that are personalized to me.  So it's got one saying I've shown interest in the Amazon Echo.  I've got a Tesla story.  I've got one about dogs because dogs, malware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it's a good news feed.  But look, it's not in it anymore.  I don't all I here's what I have news stories, a giant score, which could arguably, you know, the baseball team could be arguably a news feed.  And then at the very, very bottom, one little tiny card and fine print with the weather.  That's all I get.  I get my packages delivered.  Yes. You're not going to get it.  You've got the old one.  That's going to be gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although it keeps trying to give me recipes and their culinary inspiration card.  You do. Oh, I don't get that.  Sucks. Eggplants.  It's terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  For the last month or two in the Google Now feed, they've been saying, don't see your favorite topics.  Follow more topics.  Remember, what are your interests?  And I clearly they were aiming towards this.  It disappoints me because I think what now could could be is a highly personalized list of, you know, all the things that used to be your calendar, your directions to work traffic.  All that's what it gives me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it pings me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's like, you haven't been you should leave now.  I don't want it to be updated.  No, you don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because now it's just because I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like it.  It's like, hey, your package is about to arrive.  And by the way, you should leave in 15 minutes.  And yeah, that's Google now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't screw me over.  I feel like it's going away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you go to the bottom, Stacy and follow topics, you can follow IOT.  Not that you need to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, dude, it knows I like IOT.  But who needs another newsfeed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I liked it when it had a few articles.  Like, if it were really smart and said, look, these I know these are the four articles you're going to say I want to I must read those and then and your car.  I don't see where my car is parked.  You know, I see that.  Yeah.  Well, I'm saying I don't think you're gonna like Stacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's going away.  So I will say, here's a thought.  Sometimes when I'm really bored, which does happen, I sit there and I like I'm scrolled through all the stories.  I want more.  And usually I just go to more stories.  But I do that all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And that's what I'm thinking.  Maybe they got they got some telemetry.  I read these stories and I think I think they're just making a mountain out of a molehill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But we'll see if I get updated.  And if I do, I'll come on next week and I'll be like, Google destroy me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I may be I may be mistaken.  I but I'm just noticing, for instance, now the Android feed, there's no Google Now content.  There's like weather at the bottom on my iPhone feed.  It still has some Google Now content.  But I don't I my my fear is it's just not been updated yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I can go and customize my feed and it tells me, oh, Google, like it tells me all the things that Google thinks I'm following.  And it offers me my commute in places and I'm wondering, I don't see that anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I just I worry a little bit that Google might be turning away from something that they in my opinion, they did a good job, but they never did this good a job as they now promised more than it delivered.  There could have been so much more in there.  And maybe it was never personalized for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. Never had I was going to do more.  And I God knows I reveal everything to Google.  I hold nothing back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I've always loved now.  I've always loved it.  And I thought it was everything.  I thought it was like the future.  I was never disappointed.  Right.  Wait, I'm doing it wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So there are icons at the bottom of my Google Now feed.  Now, do you see those three icons?  The first one's a news feed.  But if you click the second icon, I now have calendar travel time, recent orders, all the so what they've got a message to hear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Leo says, welcome.  Here's what's upcoming.  Save time with info on your agenda, commute trips and day to day tasks.  All right here.  So what they've done is they've added a new tab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's what they've done.  Yeah.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can't see the cards.  OK.  So in other words, Leo, we both say, never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, not exactly.  Never mind.  This is definitely a change.  So can you get a close up?  Carson, if I over the shoulder shot?  Yes, not very close.  But to see this at the bottom, there's three.  Yeah.  OK.  This is news.  This is the old now stuff.  And again, I like some more.  This is a new one.  This is a clock introduction to recent.  What does that mean?  See what you found.  Rediscovered topics you've looked for in the Google app recently.  What?  Oh, that's interesting.  Interesting.  See all of your history.  So this is my history.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Find that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, this is good.  Find that page.  What that recipe article or site from a few days ago?  Save time hunting and find it here first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So all right.  So I take it back.  They're doing exactly what I wanted them to do, which is to add.  Everybody Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a race to the last 10 minutes.  It's fine.  Google.  It's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you know, we're not going to be alone because it defaults to that first tab and who you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  know, until you know the message to me why I did why I did do that immediately.  You know, but I think that's part of the problem is when you get something new and it has all  those blue boxes and say, hey, you can do this.  I always ignore them.  So the fact that it came up five minutes later, maybe it's more.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  OK.  So look at the bottom of your Google Now app.  Now this is on Android.  Let me just see.  I don't have that yet.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can I tell you that would be eat and drink entertainment?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  So this is so the good news is this seems to be.  Yeah, there there it is.  This seems to be adding that doesn't have the recent one, the time, the little clock,  but it does have these.  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's great.  Top at the very top.  Yeah.  There's an in-box.  You have weather, eat and drink, entertainment and sports.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  Weather doodles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Click on the right arrow.  Click on the right arrow.  Oh, all kinds of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Nearby florists, entertainment, translate.  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this was actually animal sounds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is cool.  The animal sound.  What sound does the sheep make?  What sound is the raccoon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Raccoons don't make sounds.  Oh, yeah, they do.  What?  Moo cow?  Thank you, Google.  Wow.  A lot of these are.  Where's Danny Sullivan when you need him?  A lot of these are.  Look, weather, sunrise, sunset, travel, book of flight.  So this is actually adding a considerable amount of capability to Google Now.  All right.  They're doing what I had hoped they would do with Google Now, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which was add sheep sounds.  Yes.  So a lot of.  So not not that level, but there's a hamburger menu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You don't know when you need that in an argument.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a hamburger menu in the old version, and that's giving me recent.  So the same thing that you see at the bottom, it's giving me reminders and customize, but  it is not giving me the option to do animal sounds, for which I'm very sad.  You're on iOS, right?  I know I'm on it today.  I'm on the Nexus 5X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, wait a second.  Creepy alert.  How does it know what shows I like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, oh, because of what you search is based on your search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So so Stacey, there's some stuff I have never searched for on Android here.  There's right.  There's Google and then there's a search bar and then there's these icons below it.  You don't have those little icons below it.  No.  So I've got weather, drink, entertainment, sports, and then a right arrow.  And that's what opens up this page.  Oh, well, you'll get an update then.  And this has a ton of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, I do get break is handy.  Whatever amount of talent, click on the eat and drink.  And it gives me I love that maps where it gives me the nearby restaurants.  Oh, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You should get that poster.  Roll a die.  Yeah, roll a die.  Roll a die.  There's also some of those were Google features.  If you just search for a roll a die on Google, it'll do that for you.  So this brings me to what Amazon's doing with the I don't want to use the a word, the Aliosha app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this is really trying to call it something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like a Saturday night routine.  Just pick up any word with an A.  Andrea, Alicia, Alicia.

And the other picture, I'm wearing my insecticide repellent clothing and pants and a Tilly hat  with a camera.  And it said, oh, it says it was a close call, but it prefers the Tilly hat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, man.  I wish I had this app on my phone right now because I would I have so many things I could  load.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can't what happens when you search for it?  You didn't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got it.  But it's it's a website that is only on the app.  It tells me to download the iOS app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  By the way, I accidentally agreed.  And now I have confirmed that pic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's going to recommend Tilly hats to you for ever.  And they're going to follow you all around the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So the Taco Bell and Petaluma across the street from it is the best taco truck in the world.  Taco place. Yeah.  Elroy's taco truck.  We tell people who visit Petaluma, don't go to any other restaurant.  Just go to the taco truck across the street from Taco Bell.  I would love to go there.  Next time you're here, I'm taking you there.  We'll have a taste test.  You can have a chalupa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Taco Bell is fast food.  It's all it is.  Chipotle is fast food.  Chipotle is better than fast food.  But Chipotle is better than.  You see, Taco Bell used to what I used to love years past was the Enchirito.  Oh, that was good.  It was very good.  They got rid of it.  It's foolish.  And then they had the grilled stuffed burrito, which I do like.  And they've added too much fat into it.  They have guac and sour cream, which I should say no to.  But if I say no to, sometimes they leave out the beans, too.  The beans are the whole reason I eat the grilled stuffed burrito.  So it's an issue.  But as fast food goes, it's not bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  By the way, I just got a text from the Amazon truck.  What's it called?  The treasure truck?  It said, way to go.  We'll let you know if we're rolling through town with something new.  So I'm on the treasure truck text list now.  So don't you find this...  By the way, I am endlessly fascinated these days by Jeff Bezos and Amazon.  I am, too.  I think he...  We live in really interesting times where you have people like Elon Musk.  Yeah, we lost Steve Jobs.  But to replace him, we've got Elon Musk.  We've got Jeff Bezos.  Who else?  Jason Calacanis.  No, no, no.  You can't say Larry and Sergey anymore.  I don't think they're really dialed in.  They're kind of checked out.  I think they're checked out.  And Bruce Porat is not a visionary.  You might say Sacha Nadella, but his vision is all in enterprise,  so it doesn't really interest me at Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think Larry is probably doing more than we know of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I can't get excited about something I don't know,  so I'm going to leave him off the list until I do.  All right, fine, fair.  Maybe he's doing something great.  I know he's building his own dirigible for reasons no one...  Zuck? Zuck?  Now, this is an interesting question.  You put Zuck in that Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos team.  You put him on that team or...?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, Zuck changed the society.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He changed society, but does he have an overriding vision?  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, the connected world, absolutely.  Yeah, but that's...  When I interviewed him for the book I sent you,  you'll find out why I argue what I argue.  And I'm sure he would not do this anymore,  but he called himself a social engineer.  And yeah, he's using engineering to affect  how we can connect with each other.  I think that's huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Do you want to rebut, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't, because my last interaction with Zuck  was like, God, almost 10 years ago,  and he was so young and so unformed.  So it was a really...  No, but I forget the division.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He was like a Gumby where they hadn't put the facial features on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He was. He was most visionary when talking about  how to architect Facebook for scalability,  and that was where his passion was at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I kind of honor that because he's done a great job of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He was actually more... He was blunt and open then,  he's more media trained now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, he was blunt and open,  but he was more blunt and open,  but it was about Memcached.  Yeah, Memcached.  Yeah.  That's good.  Go back to the situation, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You don't think that he has a vision?  I think... Here's my thing.  I think he has a vision. It's creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think his vision is not visionary.  Does that make sense?  So when you look at Elon's vision,  he took science and applied it to some things  that are pretty freaking far out there,  and he figured out a way to make what people think impossible possible.  In a way that feels very visionary.  I'm not actually sure Jeff Bezos has done something like that,  but what he's done is...  He's managed to do something really hard,  which is continuously...  He's built a reinvention, a reinventing corporation  that is highly effective.  And he knows that that's what he's done.  And Wernher Fogel's vetted AWS too, which...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think Amazon's brilliant,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  and I don't necessarily celebrate their vision.  Because it's clear that their vision,  as Ben Thompson pointed out at Stratecary,  is to take a cut of all financial transactions in the world.  But he's very, very, very good at moving step by step in that direction.  I mean, look at these things.  So I think Elon and Jeff...  Look, I feel like we're lucky enough to live in a time with two Da Vinci's.  At least business Da Vinci's.  These guys are really interesting.  And we've had one in Jobs.  We had one in Jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We had two in Laurie and Sergey in their time.  Yep, in their time.  You'd have to add in.  I would add in Zuck.  Zuck's impact on the world certainly is right on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I would add in Ev Williams.  Because Blogger and Twitter,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  though he wasn't the only inventor of both,  he was the tie between the two that was right on there.  He was the tie between the two that really changed my world tremendously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, he got me to pay five bucks a month in Medium.  Oh, really?  Wow.  You know why?  Because he...  So Baratunde has launched a pay behind a paywall blog,  an activism blog.  They're starting to put stuff that I want behind a paywall.  It's only five bucks.  I get all of it for five bucks.  I think Ev Williams' vision might actually...  I know we were skeptical that he could do this.  Because he said no more ads were going to do a paywall.  I'll never bet against Ev.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  After changing the world twice, in my view.  I will not bet against him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Look, this is the front page now in Medium.  It's changed a little bit.  It's a little different, isn't it?  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You might like...  This has become a very, I think, compelling publication.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I got to get that now.  Oh, jeez, another...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And these are things I followed, I guess.  Right.  Now, oh, here's the members only.  Let me click the members only.  This is stuff that I get because I pay...  It's five bucks a month.

Transcript:  Lee Alexander.  I write about...  You know, I don't...  This says recommended by staff.  Wait a minute.  Sorry for members only, but I am a member.  Maybe it...  Does it not know that?  I'm logged in.  Oh, am I...  Yeah, it says member.  Okay, so they have some issues on that.  View membership.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  So, Selling Our Grief, America's Appetite for the Traumatized.  So these are members only, see more members only stories.  Shiny Car in the Night.  I don't know, you know...  I'm not that bored.  You're not that bored?  You have to be pretty bored.  I have a subscription too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was...  Well, like a lot of this stuff feels very, very navel gazing.  Yes, there's a lot of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Too much of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so I'm kind of like...  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I can...  It's a blog.  It's bloggers.  Blogging was always navel gazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, so I don't need that.  I get enough of that.  I can get that for free.  I pay for, you know, good storytelling and journalism, and I pay for actual books and  other things.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is interesting.  Audio versions of some of these stories?  Is that new or...?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's...  It might be Spoken Layer.  They asked me whether they could do one of mine from like months ago.  Here, let's do one that Stacey will be interested in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Everything you need to know about buying an electric car.  Allison Moody, a multimedia reporter who covers this channel.  Let's listen just to see.  So would it be a robot or a human?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I think Spoken Layer...  If it is Spoken Layer, I'm not sure about that, but if it is, then it's mixed, but they  often are human.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Everything you need to know about buying an electric car.  There's a lot to know.  Here's a handy primer by Allison Moody.  That's not a human.  Audio versions are available only to media members.  Really?  The internet has been buzzing this summer with views about the future of electric cars.  Last weekend, Elon Musk tweeted a photo of the first manufactured and logged with...  Wow, it sounds so manufactured.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a little stilted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's not friendly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't sound like a real person.  It's a broadcast voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I hate broadcast voice.  What do you mean?  I never hear it anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're not broadcast voice.  You're human voice.  I have a little bit of an announcer in me still.  I try to eschew it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The only thing you have, Leo, is speaking with a smile.  I do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know how to really well.  Somebody once called me Mr. Smiley Smile.  It hurt my feelings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would do...  When I was in San Francisco, I did tryouts to be a movie critic on Kron.  They'd sit me down and you have to learn to read the teleprompter and all that.  They'd say, now speak with a smile.  I can't do that.  Wait, what is speaking with a smile?  Well, if you talk like this, you just feel pretty darn good about life and life itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Those of us who are happy in the world, we smile.  The smile comes through in our voices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there a female equivalent of that?  Because that's like Garrison Keillor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You could do it.  Just try it.  Let's do it right now.  Smile while you're talking.  Like overly broadly.  Yeah.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Just read something.  And then every once in a while, you just put a little crinkle in your voice.  Because you're so darn...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Am I mastered speaking with a smile?  I'm not sure.  I'm not even 100% sure what it is, but I feel really good doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes!  Is that close?  You did it!  Ah, yes.  You did it!

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, from now on, we're going to be the happy podcast just talking with a smile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We should just call it This Week in Smiles.  Everybody's happy on this show.  Does everybody in the audience want to suit us now?  Well, that's why when the guy...  This was a criticism.  This was when I was doing the site and one of my colleagues said,  You're alright, Leo, but you're too much smiley smile.  That was his point was if it's unmotivated, happy smiley voice, it's fake.  So you have to modulate, right?  Sometimes, you know...  But it's good to express emotions in your voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not bad at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But it needs to be...  Yeah, exactly.  Right?  Okay.  You can do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm genuinely very happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You have a happy voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm a happy person.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Unless you have those headaches.  May I ask you a personal question based on last week's show?  Yes.  Have you done the show with migraines?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a migraine starting right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh my God.  I feel so bad for you.  Are you on the topomax?  This is a little personal now.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't mean to be too personal.  Oh, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I just feel so bad for you.  I do too.  No, don't feel bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's going to be fine.  And actually, a lot of very nice people from the show have sent me all kinds of crazy ideas and stuff.  And not crazy like...  No, no, but remedies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, like nice crazy.  Yeah.  Like, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hey, if it works.  Somebody told me, because I mentioned that I have constant ringing in my ears tonight,  is that if you put...  You fold your...  You interlace your fingers behind your head,  but then you use a thumping with one of them against the stem of your brain that it will fix it.  But it doesn't.  It doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they just wanted you to make a funny face.  Or a funny little gesture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Deena Dell used to suggest feverfew.  Have you tried the feverfew cure?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have not tried the feverfew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think that's an old timey remedy.  Do they know what causes migraines?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have many thoughts.  It's something about...  They don't know what causes them.  But they made a lot of strides.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They know the etiology, the dilution and all that.  Yeah.  I used to get them...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you might argue they're not full migraines, but they were to me.  But when a leave was still prescription, somebody gave me a couple of pills and it just suddenly ended.  It was muscle related.  And so that alone...  Here was the weird thing.  That alone, knowing that I could finally find something that could relieve it, ameliorated the number I got immensely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I would imagine tension or the fear of getting it would probably...  Tension, yes.  ...probably exactly.  Exactly.  My doctor told me to leave his naproxen.  Told me to...  No, I can't remember.  To take it or not to take it.  He said something about it.  I can't remember.  I think he said to take it.  But if he actually...  How's your liver, Leo?  I think he said to take it.  Because I like ibuprofen.  He said, well, you should take naproxen instead.  But I don't know if that's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Naproxen's rough on your stomach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It can be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It can be.  But I am taking...  Maybe this is related because he said, you only have an 18% chance of having a heart attack right now, which I thought seemed high.  He said, that's pretty good.  But it seemed high to me.  But he said, but you should be doing a baby aspirin a day.  And I don't know if that was related to like, don't take naproxen.  So if you have stomach upset, maybe you don't want to take naproxen and baby aspirin at the same time.  I'll have to ask Dr. Mom.  Pick one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the way, since we've talked about cardio before, this is an announcement today I just put up on the rundown.  This has become a health podcast.  It has become a health podcast.  Wait, I have this Google Analytics story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're coming back to that.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We will.  Just while we're on health, just one more minute.  Yeah, yeah.  So AliveCore, the maker of cardio, which we talked about, has teamed up with Mayo Clinic to use machine learning to take their incredible database of EKGs now and predict.  Wow.  Yeah, it's big stuff.  This is Vic and Doutre's company.  Vic and I talked for about an hour a week ago because he wanted to tell me what the company was doing.  Some off the record for now, some not.  This came out today.  I think this is really cool stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I bought one just to have it.  I forgot to ask my doc if he would like me to send him EKGs.  You have to pay $10 a month if you want to send the EKGs to your physician.  Yeah, my...  I bet your physician doesn't want them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I bet he doesn't want them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The physicians are the best sales channel.  There's something called, I think it's Cardia Pro, which is how the physicians use it.  And they can get... you can get... you can send it every day.  And it has value.  I also talked to Vic about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But you've had Afib, so you're definitely a candidate for it.  You would want this.  Yeah.  Because this could...  Oh yeah, I'm obvious.  ... early diagnosis and yeah.  I have a family member who has it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  And is asymptomatic, doesn't know when she has it.  Right.  So an older family member, so we've been trying to talk her into it.  I don't know if my doctor will let me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's your body.  You can do it.  So this is, we mentioned it before, one of the few FDA approved kind of devices, medical  devices that are emerging.  It's also HIPAA compliant.  It's really an interesting product.  And it's cheap.  It's under 100 bucks to buy it.  The expense comes if you want to send it to your doctor, you have to pay a monthly fee.  But you can also just send it to them and they analyze it.  And I gather that's how they're getting all this data that they're going to share with  the Mayo Clinic.  It's interesting.  Did you, you must have been in our, in the agreement, which I didn't read, saying we  might be sharing your heartbeat with other people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And by the way, Stacey may be helping people in the future.  And I'm okay with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I am too, because my heart beats not going to be...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, fine.  Well, I was going to tell you, because this is, this was from earlier May, I think.  Did you see that there is an AI that detects AFib using Apple Watch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, we talked about that.  But that's, yeah, that's a little experimental, but it's, but it's exactly, basically because  it has some, there's so much data being gathered.  The Watch Watch can monitor continuously.  Here's another interesting one.  I'll give you.  A judge has ruled that pacemaker data can be used in an arson trial because the judge  said, revealing your heartbeat heart rate is not particularly too invasive.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although if I were a lawyer, I would argue that my heart, my client's heart rate data  could not be correlated with, you know, actually setting a fire running around because it could  have been tied to anything.  I've been watching an exciting movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So let me, let me read you the story and you can decide.  Okay.  Okay.  Ross Compton, a man from Ohio, was charged with aggravated arson and insurance fraud  based on his pacemaker data.  Compton told the police that when he saw his house burning last year, he calmly packed  his bags, tossed them at his bedroom window and carried them to his car.  Authorities got hold of his pacemaker data.  By the way, there's other evidence they found gasoline on his shoes.  I would hope so.  Yeah.  Authorities got hold of his pacemaker data and had a cardiologist review his heart rate,  pace or demand, and cardiac rhythms from that day.  The doctor went on record to say it's highly improbable Mr. Compton would have been able  to collect, pack, and remove the number of items in the house, exit his bedroom window,  and carry numerous and large heavy items to the front residence during the short period  of time he's indicated to, indicated due to his medical conditions.  In other words, his heart, his ticker's not up to it.  Compton's lawyer said, we take the strong position medical data regarding the inner  functions of one's body designed to assist a doctor in keeping a patient alive should  be safeguarded against government overreach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right, so here's where I think Stacey and I will agree.  I agree that that's overreach.  What do you think Stacey?  Totally overreach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let me just tell you what the, yeah, but wait, the judge said, Judge Charles Pater, there's  a lot of other information about things that may characterize the inside of my body that  I would much prefer to keep private rather than how my heart's beating.  It's just not that big of a deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's bull on a stick.  Crappy.  You can tell if someone's pregnant based on their heartbeat.  You can tell if you like age related illnesses.  You can tell all kinds of stuff from someone's heart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can tell what drug I'm on with my, with my arysmia drug.  Dr. Mom also points out.  You can tell if someone's sexually attracted to you.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Sorry.  I'm not.  No.  But I am saying.  Dr. Mom says in the chat room, that's why law, lie detectors are not allowed in court,  which by the way, they measure among other things heart rate because it isn't necessarily  indicative of a mental state.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's, that's one of these things where I think we are getting to a point where we  have this data and we're drawing conclusions, but those are not peer reviewed scientifically  valid compute conclusions.  It's correlation, not causation.  Right.  And I think it is a really dangerous legal precedent to say, eh, one, it's not private,  but two, that those could be that you should rely on that when I don't think you should.  We don't know.  We simply do not know enough about the human body and how people react.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So there's that issue.  And then there's also the invasion of privacy issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ah, this judge is an idiot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  EFF weighed in Stephanie LaCambra, who is a lawyer there said Americans should, this  is actually probably the real quote, Americans shouldn't have to make a choice between health  and privacy.  We as a society value our rights to maintain privacy over personal and medical information  and compelling citizens to turn over their protected health data to law enforcement,  erodes those rights.  That's the key there, making the choice between health and privacy.  Like, oh, but I better not get a pacemaker because the cops will want to know what my  heart rate is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, well, indeed.  And I'm getting trouble here politically, but yeah, there were, I forget the thousands  of people who deregistered to vote in Colorado because they didn't want their data handed  over to the, um, yeah, it's really, so people are doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wow.  Yeah.  Now all but two states have denied the request of the voting commission.  Well, they denied the request for some of the data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Texas just handed it all over.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They did.  And my dear governor in New Jersey said, fine.  I think, um, by the way, Chris, Chris, Chris, Christine, the most unpopular man in America.  Yeah.  He was at a Mets game last night, uh, and he caught a foul ball and they booed him for  that.  He gave it to a kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's still food.  Give it back.  We can't win.  You can't win that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, I'm almost starting to feel sorry for the poor guy.  Nope, nope, nope.  Don't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't do that.  Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So apparently I am a doofus for buying and liking the Nest IQ cam and Gadget said that  it just reminds us that facial recognition needs work.  I, I do.  I mean, I do.  It's got a six core processor in it.  It's got a four K sensor.  The idea of it is it sees what you look like and then allows you to say in a data frame  that you're going to be able to see what you're looking at.  But if anybody other than those people are in my house, let me know.  Uh, and Gadget's pointing out, uh, it doesn't, it's not very accurate.  So ready, Leo, are you ready?  By the way, this is Roberto Baldwin.  It looks like, yeah.  Oh, you got it.  Which one is that?  Good camera.  Stop rubbing it like that.  What is that?  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  That's, that's just the NetApp Mo.  That's the one I told you, you should have bought instead of the Nest IQ.  So can I get it now?  Yeah, you can buy it now.  I think it's $199.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Less than the IQ was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Um, well, I've already been told I can't have a camera in the house anyway, so it doesn't  really matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this one, this is the one you could get because everything's stored to an SD card  or you can send it to your own server on the property.  Is it your face recognition?  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So, oh, but does it text me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It texts you if you see if like, this is the, this isn't the camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You've got the camera.  Let me see if I can find the camera on here.  This is the one that just tests the air quality.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the presence or the welcome.  The presence is the outdoor one.  Yeah.  Their names are cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  See, I made a mistake because I went with Google.  I thought, oh, well, Nests has got to have this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, that's why I called you a doofus.  Yeah.  On air, no less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's all right.  Oops.  Did I say that?  Oh, no, I did that on purpose.  I'm joking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The entire chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm not interested in you at all.  The camera that recognized your loved ones.  Okay.  It's got a French happy French song.  I'm just going to turn that down a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh wait, last week I said something wrong.  You guys, uh, for borrow when we made fun of my pick last week.  Yeah, it is not an Italian company.  It's a Polish company.  Oh, well, I, that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's easy to be fooled for borrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, yeah, I just, I felt like I had to say that.  No, that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I feel a little bad that we had such fun with them.  The audience liked it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they liked it.  They, except when I called them Italian for borrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, any press is good press.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  They, they didn't seem to mind.  No.  Yeah.  So my Twitter account was fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The net atmo.  So do you have the outdoor one, the presence as well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But you, and, but you have been using the, the welcome for a while or you just got it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  No, no, I've used the welcome for a while.  I've had this for like, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You took it down so you could show us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I took it down a while back.  Um, but yeah, I've had, I've had a data.  I've had the, I reviewed it like two years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you can, so it does have local storage, but you could put it on Dropbox.  Yes.  Oh, so you really do control it.  I think you're right.  I think that's probably a good idea.  It seems to have the same capabilities.  It does.  But you're not putting them on a Google server somewhere.  Right.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it talks to lots of things.  I don't think it has an echo integration.  So but that's because it doesn't go to the cloud possibly.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's right.  So now you, I know you want to do this Google analytics story.  Can you hold for one minute?  I can totally hold.  Are you, are you having an earthquake in there?  Everything seems to be jiggling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm, I'm twitching.  Oh, okay.  Sorry.  I'll stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Are you seeing spots or anything?  Are you okay?  Everything's okay?  Yeah, I'm totally fine.  I'm just.  Is your vision narrowing?  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  I lose vision in one eye when I have my green.  So I can always see out of the other way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's because you're going like this.  Oh, it hurts.  Oh, God.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're going to take a break.  We'll come back.  You're still working on your doorbell story for Wirecutter, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know.  I'm so sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Y'all will be the first to know.  I want to put in a plug for the Ring Video Doorbell.  The one I use, the one I have connected in my house, the one that I have hooked up to  my Eero's, the Ring Video Doorbell is awesome.  You know I use it because every once in a while you'll hear wind chimes come from one  of my phones if I forget to mute them.  That means somebody is walking by my door or you'll hear bing, bing, bing.  And that means somebody's rung my doorbell.  The Ring Video Doorbell is a doorbell with a camera, a microphone, a speaker and motion  sensors.  It replaces your wired doorbell.  They have a version that has a battery so you can also replace or put a doorbell anywhere  even if you don't have wires.  It was easy for me to install.  It helped that the kit with the Ring Box came with everything I needed.  A screwdriver, drill bits if you need that.  I did not.  A little level.  And once it's hooked up and paired to your Wi-Fi, if anybody goes by your front door  or anybody rings your doorbell, you will be notified wherever you are anywhere in the  world.  It's really a remarkable thing.  They've actually extended it to include the floodlight cam, which is a motion activated  camera.  It's basically the doorbell minus the doorbell.  It has a floodlight attached to it too that lights up when people walk by.  You get HD video, two-way audio.  You'll know anytime somebody just steps on your property.  You can even see and speak to visitors or set off an alarm because the thing has a very  loud alarm on it.  When things go bump in the night, you'll immediately know what's going on.  The Ring floodlight cam and the Ring doorbell.  Wall Street Journal's best of CES 2017.  And now we've got kits for you.  They call them the Ring of Security kits.  You get a Ring video doorbell and you have a choice of either one, two or three floodlight  cams.  You connect it with your favorite smart locks, your hubs.  I can actually say to my Echo home, Echo show my front door.  I can see through the Ring.  With Ring, you're always home.  Deliveries, I know what's going on.  They have this great program called Ring Neighborhoods where you can see other people with Ring doorbells  in your neighborhood.  They've been doing this in Wilshire Park, an LA suburb.  They put one in ten homes, got a Ring doorbell.  And that reduced in six months burglaries by 55%.  One in ten, 55%.  That gave them the idea to do this all over.  So I can see who else has a Ring video doorbell in my neighborhood.  And if they participate, I can see what's going on outside their door.  So it's a neighborhood watch program powered by Ring.  I just love this.  Take a look at it.  Go to ring.com slash twig, R-I-N-G dot com slash T-W-I-G.  Take a look at the Ring of Security kits.  Get your Ring doorbell, get set up.  They have regular Ring kits and pro kits as well.  The pro is the one without the batteries.  It's slimmer.  It's got a 1080p camera in it.  And these, you know, I have to say these floodlight cams are gorgeous.  You know, I've had floodlights in my house.  This is much nicer looking.  Really, really sweet.  Save up to 150 bucks now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, my light thinks I'm dead.  There it is.  Sorry.  I was like, what is happening there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Google Analytics.  I don't even understand this article in Search Engine Land.  It says it's something called Ask a Question.  Stacey, you better explain.  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just thought this was cool because it's using, if you use Google Analytics.  Which I do.  Lots of people do.  Love it.  All of that data that's on your dashboard right now.  What they're doing is letting you just ask normal people questions like how many visitors  did I get?  What percentage increase did my site see year over year in June?  And it'll just tell you.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You don't have to look up the data and everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  So it's kind of like search.  But.  But for business.  But I mean, it's your own data.  Language.  Normal language.  Yeah.  Right.  Natural language search.  Natural language.  There you go.  That's the word I was looking for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So like it supports what and how many types of questions.  So what is my traffic in June of 2016?  And then how many visitors came to my site from Twitter last month?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So how else do you see this being used?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just I think about so this is to me what this is indicative of is voice becoming such  an accepted user interface to cycle through the massive amounts of data that we have available  to us.  And honestly, I'm surprised.  I'm surprised it took Google this long because they have such expertise in this area.  But I also see something like this.  If I were Tableau or some sort of popular ERP software, I would be tying my data back  ends with things like the Echo in building these types of natural language voice interfaces.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because that's this is this kind of data having it available.  Like think about any time you're in a meeting and you're like, oh, man, you know, what was  our revenue from this point?  You know, and you're trying to figure out like brainstorm stuff, having something that  you could just ask and give it to you.  That's great.  That is what computers do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That would be so awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I was excited by this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Echo, how many uniques did we have last week?  Things like that would be so useful.  Yeah.  I'm looking on our site.  I don't see where I would do that, but maybe it's on the app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It says it is coming to the desktop for the first time on the mobile app.  Users will also be able to use voice to surface data in Google Analytics after clicking on  the analytics intelligence icon.  Oh, OK.  And it will be available on desktops as of Wednesday.  The asking a question functionality will start rolling out over the next few weeks.  Well, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's why I don't see it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  But I will soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's fine.  I'm going to play with that.  I'll give you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just think I mean, I'm kind of enterprisey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you know, I'm not I'm really down market.  But apparently, according to Amazon, I should wear more bug repellent impregnated clothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Google says it doesn't underpay women.  And we don't have to tell you.  We know this.  This is a federal judge has actually agreed as limited the information the Labor Department  can request.  Remember, Google refused to give this information.  A federal court moved on Friday to spare Google from turning over information about how well  it compensates women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it not passing it over worse PR than passing it over?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I don't get this if you're paying attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think lately, there's so many more egregious things happening to women in the tech industry.  Maybe it's like, yeah, that's right.  This would be a good time just to kind of look over there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and an important thing that's going to make a difference here, Sudaparchai tweeted  this out today, is the AP computer science test story.  Isn't that great?  I am so excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I hope it's meaningful.  I tweeted it as well.  Turns out that and they think it's the hour of code and Code Academy and all of this,  you know, push to get more young people involved in coding.  Let's see if I can find the...  It's on the rundown.  Yeah, here it is.  AP.  Female, black, and Latino student participation in the AP computer science exams has more  than doubled in the past year.  More than 29,700 women or girls really took an AP computer science exam in 2017.  That's a 135% increase.  And 10 years ago, so 29,700 this year, 10 years ago, 2,600.  Amazing.  Great.  Still not enough.  Yeah.  But it's a head-long break.  Black and Latino participation, 170% increase.  More than 22,000.  That doubled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's taking.  So how many passed?  Well, that...  Now don't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Stacey, you just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Stacey.  Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, there's a lot of effort to get kids who are not necessarily prepared to take it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This probably means they took the...  Really?  Okay, I went to a school that was super competitive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I'm not trying to be a total jerk, but there was tremendous AP tests for like a freaking  badge of honor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So what you could be seeing is merely the push from the schools to get these kids to  take them as opposed to a genuine interest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there are certain...  And it could also be a rise in the number of AP computer science classes out there,  which would make a lot more sense.  Which is a good thing.  It is.  I'm not...  Again, this is not a negative thing.  I'm just kind of like, yeah, a lot of kids took a test.  So here's my question for both of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do we ever get to a point where we have a surplus of programmers?  We've been in this terrible shortage.  Is there a point where we could over, to your point, Stacey, we could overdo some of the  kids to teach programming and then there's not the jobs for them?  Is that ever possible?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the type of programming skills, like the basic programming skills, that'll eventually...  Everyone will know how to do it for the most part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't think this is really about making more computer scientists as just making more  diversity in computer scientists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I agree with that.  No, I'm talking about...  I'm just talking in general.  Could we make a mistake pushing...  Because basically we say to every young person out there in the world, we're sort of saying  plastics young man, it's programming young woman, and everybody should be programming.  Do we get to a point where we're like lawyers and MBAs?  Actually, we don't need as many as we thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, and I'm not a fan of saying...  I actually disagree.  When President Obama said he thought his daughters ought to have studied coding and that everybody...  He actually said everybody should study coding.  I don't think that that's actually true any more than everybody should study woodworking  or plumbing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it a way...  Okay, now...  We would say...  Go ahead, Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I was going to devil's advocate.  I don't know.  We say that everybody should learn how to read and everyone should learn basic math.  And I think coding may become part of that because it's going to become kind of the lingua  franca of a tech society.  So I think having a basic understanding of that is actually probably really good.  Do they need to be awesome programmers?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But understanding it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  And actually, this AP test was really a very fundamental computer science test that they're  talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, and I should also note, because somebody did point it out and they're right, you can  score from a one to five on the AP test and there is technically no pass fail.  But if you don't get at least a three, I'm going to call you a failure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Actually, by the way, there's a lot of controversy, I think, over the AP system.  AP test, yeah.  Amen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did not vote.  I was not a freshman ever because I got credit for all of my classes taking AP tests.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now it's nearly impossible to get credit.  You must be smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Atlantic had an article a few years ago.  Never a freshman.  That's your biography title.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Never a freshman.  Yeah.  AP classes are a scam.  The College Board earns over half of all its revenue from the courses.  This is 2012, but this has been going on for some time and there's definitely some thought  that this whole AP thing and the kind of pressure that you were put under in school to do it,  Stacey, is really a profit center for the College Board more than anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was like, I'm a typical girl.  We're overachievers.  That's what we do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's what we do, man.  I don't know if coding per se, I mean, look, I love coding and I encourage people who are  interested in it absolutely to pursue it.  I especially encourage parents with daughters who are interested in math and coding and  science and technology to strongly encourage them.  We had an, I think, it was a wonderful call on Sunday on the radio show from an aunt whose  eight-year-old niece had gone to code camp and she said, what do I do next?  She talks about it all the time.  That's great.  I don't know.  I think there's a lot of kids who pushing them into a coding class is just going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think learning the fun, I'm not saying they have to do it for the rest of their lives,  but I didn't love trig, but you have to know how to do it.  Do you?  Do you really?  No.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No, I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I love it too and I love algebra, but I don't think I've ever ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, algebra is different.  That's like algebraic thinking.  That's a whole way of solving problems in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The thing I've used in coding, actually computer scientists use trig a lot because if you're  moving stuff around, you've got to understand grids, X, Y, and vectors and all that stuff.  For computer graphics, trigonometry is a necessity, but I can't think of any other ... Carpenters?  What are you saying, John?  Who uses ...  It just makes paths in your brain.  He's saying it just makes paths in your brain like one of those wood borer ants.  Got it.  Yeah.  No, that is the argument, by the way, for teaching math.  When a kid says, like you said, I'm not going to ever use algebra.  No, but you're learning a method.  You're learning a method of learning.  You're learning a method of rigorousness.  That is the argument for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Math is really useful.  Basic math is ...  Well, with the kids ...  I got my first job as a journalist, I kid you not.  The question they asked me that clinched the deal, they were like, do you know the formula  for percent change?  Oh.  I looked at them like, are you kidding me?  I was like, of course I do.  They're like, you're hired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I agree with that.  I'm sure Jeff does too.  More and more, if you don't know statistics and probability, you should not be a journalist  because those kinds of fallacies can really bite you.  Yes.  Our numeracy is very bad.  Innumeracy, that's the word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Innumeracy.  All right, what else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What else?  Google's using ... Oh.  We didn't do it last week.  Do you want to do the Amazon AI that's designing phone cases?  I forgot to do it last week.  Have you seen it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, is this the ugly phone case guy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So Amazon has been doing an experiment to design phone cases using artificial intelligence.  It's actually, you can buy these cases on ... What is the name of it?  My Phone Case?  Something like that.  On ... My Handy Design.  That's it.  My Handy Design.  Handy is the German word for mobile phone.  Oh, I get it.  My Handy Design.  Yeah.  All right.  So here are some of the designs that are on Amazon designed by a computer.  Adult diaper worn by an old man with a crutch cell phone cover case.  I kid you not.  The toilet paper tube collection cell phone cover case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh no, let's move on.  Oh no, let's move on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Some of these.  Old woman with asthma inhaler cell phone cover case.  Worried teenage girl in bedroom with pregnancy testing cell phone cover case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So wait, how did they ... This is my favorite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is my favorite.  This is for you.  Cheese wheel on ... It says baddie, but I think they mean body instead of table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did it just take any photo that was out there or how did this operate?  I don't know who you stand.  I don't know.  Yeah, wait, how did ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't get it.  I don't know, but it makes for good ... But I think maybe this is a good case.  Cheese wheel on body instead of table.  Oh, I definitely want the galvanized steel wheelbarrow card isolated on white cell phone  case.  No, I don't know.  I guess what happened is they let loose something that would just take any image and offer them  for sale whether anybody would want them and then maybe they didn't sell any.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I imagine they did not sell a lot of some of them.  Maybe.  Cheese wheel, I could totally see my friend sporting them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's pretty funny actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I had the best sandwich, the street food in New York.  Oh yeah, tell us about it.  A place called Baked Cheese House, House, H-A-U-S, German spelling.  And they're on this ... In New York now, on 34th Street for a few weeks, they have these  And it was raclette cheese and a thin slice of prosciutto on beautiful bread and then  another little just job of cheese on the top.  I took a picture of it somewhere on my ... Why are you bringing this up?  I have no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You showed us, like half naked man with cheese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cheese wheel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's where Jeff's brazen.  This half cheese wheel being melted onto my sandwich and I want one right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've often called this the most intellectual show on Twitter, but now I'm going to call  it the most discursive show on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's better than Taco Bell.  I will grant that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's like Mr. Toad's wild ride.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the summer.  There's not a whole lot of exciting news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, wait, how about this?  Facebook executive and former journalist, Campbell Brown says, we're launching a new  subscription product.  This is almost exactly the same time as we talked about this last week as the big publishers  went to Congress looking for an antitrust exemption so they could collude and negotiate  with Facebook and Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, the announcement was coincidental, but I wasn't allowed to say.  You've known about this.  Not because of the relationship I have with Facebook, because I went to a Facebook event  which was off the record with publishers, but the publishers have been asking for this  for a long time.  This is finally a way for them to monetize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  People like the Wall Street Journal have been just basically giving Facebook content without  any way to monetize it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's really more about the funnel.  It's not that you're monetizing the content on Facebook and saying that if somebody comes  along and they happen to like a lot of your stuff, then you ought to be able to pitch  them a sub at that point.  You also ought to be able to cut them off if you say, okay, we don't allow you to read  that many stories, so the rules that exist.  What it will do is if you want to buy the Wall Street Journal, it will send you to the  journal site.  The journal will close the transaction.  The journal owns all the consumer information about this, so it's really a way to get down  the funnel.  Publishers have been begging for this a long time.  I talked to a major, major publisher yesterday who said that Facebook did a good job of listening  to what the publishers wanted and fed it back.  Now, the only fear other publishers have is those that aren't dependent on paywalls say,  that doesn't help us.  We still want advertising.  Don't go too overboard in thinking that solves all the problems of media.  That's just those big guys who can afford to have paywalls.  Nevertheless, it shows they're trying to listen.  They're trying to do things.  I think that's a fine and dandy thing.  I think AMP has included a paywall consideration of that as well, so they're finally in parity  on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's do some more Amazon stuff.  How about real quickly, Amazon has also been rumored to be launching a messaging app, which  I think is really smart, capitalizing on Google's complete inability to figure out what the heck  it's doing in messaging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fair messaging is as bad as their ability to connect people on the stupid echo for their  communications effort.  Maybe.  It's going to fail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Amazon is not a social place to be.  I don't connect to people on Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, but what if you just said somebody else, but the app, yeah, you're right, I guess.  The thing is you'll be able to shop with it, of course.  Here's what I think.  We've talked about Line, which is huge in Japan, WeChat, which is huge in China, and  they are used to do everything in these countries.  There you've got a point.  Nobody's really tried to create that kind of app in the United States.  I don't know why.  Because there's a lack of competition there.  Maybe, yeah, because yeah, it's true.  Part of the problem with messaging apps is there's just so many of them.  The market's so fragmented.  If you could own the market, though, as WeChat and Line do in their respective countries,  you can buy train tickets on WeChat.  You also have the advantage in China that a lot of people don't have computers at all,  but they have smartphones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there's also maybe a cultural thing.  We have this kind of weird cultural thing about selling out, and there are some people  do, not everybody.  But you don't advertise things to your friends.  I mean, I even feel weird passing on affiliate links, to be honest.  Yeah, that's true.  Is that what that's called?  Yeah.  So it may just be like, we talk about different things.

Transcript:  I don't know.  Okay, so this came from a site called AFTV News, and they have a graphic.  Apparently, Amazon's begun surveying customers to gauge what features are in interest.  They have a graphic from the survey one of the customers passed along.  Everything you've always wanted in a messaging app.  So here's what it says.  Everyone's on it.  Reach all your friends just using their name.  No numbers needed.  That does sound like the broken system that the Echo uses.  Keep private and secure.  It's got encryption built in.  All chats are automatically encrypted.  Works everywhere.  Desktop, mobile, iPhone, or Android.  Great for groups with app mentions, fast photo sharing, and video chat.  Group messaging is easy and fun.  High quality voice and video calls.  Amazon obviously is working on something like that with the Echo.  Call a friend one-on-one or get on a group call.  It's always free.  And of course, the obvious stickers, emojis, animated GIFs, filters.  They've got games.  Challenge friends and groups to games.  Customize chats with color coding or add nicknames.  Share your location.  Listen to music.  Order food together.  Split a bill and a lot more.  And I think this is really for Amazon.  This very last one is the most important thing.  Chat with businesses.  Get super service on your terms.  Make reservations.  Check on your orders and even shop.  So you're right though.  I mean, you've got to get critical.  Don't you have to get critical mass for this to work?  Your friends have to use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  That's always the challenge for messaging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, Apple has this advantage because everybody who uses an Apple device uses Apple's messages.  Right?  It's just not cross platform.  But Apple, I think Apple could do a lot of this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've talked about it.  But Apple likes privacy, remember?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  And that's the problem for them.  And then on an Android device, you can pick a third party app as your SMS app.  So you'd have to somehow convince everybody to download it and make it their SMS app.  Then it could be almost universal.  All right.  Maybe this is going to be a challenge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, they may do it, but I'm not sure they will do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But whether it will succeed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How much money will it take?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you know, there are things they failed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, many.  Look at the classic example, the Fire Phone.  Right.  Big flop.  I am.  I tried to get this, but I couldn't.  Now I should mention our sponsor is Blue Apron is one of our sponsors.  Amazon is doing something very similar.  They call them Amazon meal kits, but you have to be in a certain area.  When the word of this came out, Blue Apron stock tumbled because everybody's afraid of  Amazon getting into their market.  So this looks so much like a Blue Apron card.  Oh, wow.  It does.  They could have stolen this from Blue Apron.  Right.  And it's the same idea.  You get all the ingredients.  I wonder if they'll be using the Whole Foods.  Yeah.  Well, so the prices are more expensive, I have to say.  Seventeen different meals, not nearly the range.  And they offer the prices start at 15 up to $19 per meal.  So but of course, Amazon can control that price.  That's pricey, I think.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that is pricey.  Although with Blue Apron, because they're quote unquote negotiating with growers, doesn't  that help reduce the I mean, there's a Whole Foods markup.  You've got to take it beyond just Whole Foods.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.  No, I feel like Blue Apron has the logistics down.  They've got you know, they've put a lot of energy into those.  And again, I know they're a sponsor, so I don't want to sound like I'm bigoted on this.  There's other companies doing this.  Hello, Fresh.  There's quite a few.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've tried a bunch of meal plan kits, but they all have the same problem, which is you  have to actually make the meal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Tarson.  Yeah, right.  But you know what?  I've also tried the ones that was prepared and it's not nearly as good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, there's that new oven out.  Did you see it?  The Tovala?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm not buying another oven.  I just bought the June Oven because of you.  Tovala.  That's a good oven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a good oven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like the June Oven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm not complaining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Tovala is the $14 or $400 oven that has a subscription meal plan affiliated with it.  Oh, no.  It's a steam oven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes.  So, oh, so, oh, that's hysterical.  Yes.  So, when you buy the oven, you have to subscribe to their meal plan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  And then what happens is, oh, you found it.  You scan it and it does the steaming.  So ta-da.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So this is going to taste like dorm food.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the Wall Street Journal review said it tasted pretty good.  I haven't tried it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You don't have to cook it.  There is an advantage.  They do the prep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the meals are like, I think, between $12 and $15.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But that's, you know, that's kind of, I think, the little premium if you're going to have  it cooked for you.  I wish I didn't have to buy an oven for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and I have many thoughts on this.  So anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't have any more room.  I already have a June Oven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're like, Stacey, I already bought an oven.  Don't tell me about any more of your smart cookery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No more ovens.  No cookery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Jeffrey, you still there?  I think we lost you.  I'm still here.  I came back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You see me?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So Bixby.  Oh, right.  I got it.  You got it?  I got it.  I got it.  I have my Samsung Galaxy S8.  This was the phone made with a dedicated button just for the voice assistant.  For the whole time I've had this phone, all it really did was launch some Fakatka Google  Now style cards.  Suddenly the Bixby assistant arrived today.  She's here.  Would you like to hear her?  I would.  I'm going to play her voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't forget to include a specific app or generic service name for what you want me  to do.  For example, Google Play Music or Google Maps or a general category like music or maps  like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So she's given me some choices.  So what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just remember to use the app name or service and tell me what to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  She's more around, designed around opening apps and giving them a command.  So for instance, open Google Play Music and play the top charts, open contacts and find  David, open messages, show me the latest message, open settings, make the display brighter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Open Sesame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Open Sesame and make my dinner.  Open camera, take a selfie.  Here, let's try that one.  Oh, wait a minute.  I'm still getting tutorials.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can work with all these apps.  So let's make sure they're all updated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay, update.  I think they are all updated.  How many apps did she work with?  It's all Samsung apps.  So it's Samsung email, video player, voice recorder, Samsung notes.  It's apps nobody uses.  Although, wait a minute.  I take it back.  Facebook, YouTube, Instagram.  It says these are in the labs.  They don't work perfectly yet, but Bixby will learn as you use them.  Try them out now.  WhatsApp, Twitter, Tumblr, Gmail, Google Play Store.  Oh, so they are.  Okay.  So they are adding some.  Take a look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Take a look.  There are nearly 3000 different things I can help you with.  To find out what I'm best at, check out my Bixby in Bixby home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Show detailed information about my robot vacuum.  It's one of the commands.  Turn off iris recognition in Samsung pass.  Turn on airplane mode.  Change the view mode for the SD card.  It seems very focused on the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  As we interact more, you can gain more experience points.  Move up to higher levels by gaining experience points.  You can also check my newer looks and participate in special promotions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What do you think of the voice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not as friendly.  A little more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, there she sounded friendly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That was a smile.  Enjoy free offer from Google Play Music for Bixby users.  Get 14 days on us.  Or get your first three months on us.  Payment info required.  No thanks.  I already have it.  Okay.  Press and hold the Bixby key, then tell her what you want to do.  Let's see.  Let's see what the robot voice sounds like.  What time is it now?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.  It's 3 41 PM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, it's the same voice.  That's pretty good for a robotic voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there a male voice?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm told somebody said yes.  I'm at Bixby level zero.  So they're trying to gamify it, which is dopey.  Yeah.  Language and speaking style.  You want to try the male?  Sure.  Yeah.  Here's the male voice.  Bixby male.  Okay.  What time is it now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  It's 3 41 PM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Level up in Bixby and you can earn Samsung reward points.  That's what I need.  Okay.  So it's not the nice thing is it doesn't directly compete with Google because it's really more  about using the phone.  I think.  Anyway, Bixby is here.  Are we excited?  At least this button does something.  Oh, she's listening to me.  I'm you.  Oh, you know why?  She does.  I you can give her you can give him a command, which for me is Tilly hat.  Tilly hat.  It doesn't work.  You can have a two or two to four syllable password.  Open the gallery app and show me my latest photo.  I did it, but doesn't say anything.  Oh, good.  So that worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh my God.  Amazon just recommended the best item in the world to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're so far.  What she's so far.  She's looking at her Amazon recommendations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm like I'm playing with the Amazon app still.  I think this is a better app.  What elf earbuds?  Elves ear design.  So they're they're earbuds that have ears on top of them.  I like that.  I am I am sold, man.  Oh, they're in stock on July 25th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  OK, well, wait a minute.  Urban urban elf ear buds.  Yes, yes.  Wow, they are.  They're flesh colored.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know.  Well, some people's flesh colored.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, that's a good point.  Those that's creepy.  I think it's ugly.  Yeah.  Do they have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, but look, look the picture of the person wearing them.  Yes, they have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Look at the double taste you would get.  OK, I'm buying these.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  See, it's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  OK, I'm buying them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right.  Are there other Mr. Spock earbuds?  Yeah.  Oh, that's a good question.  Real seller.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, imagine those with those LED light  lash things that you bought and then boom, you are ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, I ordered them, but they haven't come yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can freak people out.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  OK, when I come on the show with my elf ears and my LED  eyebrows or eyelashes or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to be very excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I am too.  All right.  I think we can say safely that we have covered everything  that matters.  We have done everything of note everything  in the world of Google and the cloud.  Yes.  Net neutrality day of action organizers say 10 million  people saw the protest, 2 million comments to the FCC.  The FCC has said we're not going to show you  any of those comments.  Sorry.  You know, no, no, don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, if you send us other comments like about the voting

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  commission, we'll totally mail that out to everybody.  Yeah, we'll let you know about those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, let's have some pics.  Let's do some pics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Give me a bigger for her pic.  Yes, Stacey's got a pic.  She's been excited about it all day.  Go ahead, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, guys, you're going to love it.  It looks like a breast pump, but it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's good to hear.  That's a start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a lot happening here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a box.  There's wires.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's wires.  There's things.  I should probably have plugged it in.  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Sorry, you guys.  Go ahead.  You plug that in.  You know, I think, Stacey, you should wear those urban elf  earbuds on the show.  That would be quite a look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It would be certainly interesting.  It would be different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it has a microphone, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I have a microphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now Bixby's talking to me.  This is going to be another thing that's going to listen.  Help fix thin brows for mature women, pro makeup artists.  Cryptic crosswords for dummies cheat sheet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  So what I have here for us today is Smart Nora.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, did I bring?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You left Nora at home?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I left part of Nora in my bedroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Go ahead, get it.  OK.  While you're getting Smart Nora, Jeff  will give us his number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So we could do the fact that Tech Stalks finally  beat their record from 2000, but I think that's boring.  Wow.  Yeah, it's pretty amazing, right?  It took that long to get back up after the crash.  That's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  OK, go ahead.  I was going to give you a number.  You do another number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Another number.  Kevin Roos did a really good piece  in the New York Times, which he joined Scores.  I thought it was about 100 private groups on Facebook.  And it was a really well done, intelligent, open,  and curious piece saying that in this world where  Zuckerberg is trying to go to communities,  maybe the answer to this is private communities  where you're not showing off to the world  and you're talking to people who share your interests,  even if they are flat earthers.  So he asked permission to get into all these groups  and he got into all these groups.  Did he tell him he was a New York Times reporter when he

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  did it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think he did.  Yeah.  One told him to go blow off, but the rest let him in.  And it's really, really an interesting piece  that, again, was open to the humanity that's there.  So hats off to you, Kevin.  I have a number for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  OK.  That's how many people agreed to clean toilets  to use free Wi-Fi because they didn't read the terms.  Purple, which is a company in England that does Wi-Fi hot  spots, decided to just kind of have some fun  and add for two weeks a community service clause  into its terms of service agreement.  22,000 people signed up to perform 1,000 hours  of menial labor for the Wi-Fi access, including,  and by the way, Purple says, Purple  gets to choose which of these you do,  cleansing local parks of animal waste,  providing hugs to stray cats and dogs,  manually relieving sewer blockages,  cleaning portable labs at local festivals and events,  painting snail shells to brighten up their existence,  and scraping chewing gum off the street.  Just to make sure people were reading this,  they did offer a prize for anyone  who contacted the company and pointed out the clause,  one person.  One person did it.  In other words, one person in 22,000  reads the terms of services.  Yep.  Good gimmick, yes.  It was fun, yeah.  Did you get her?  All right, Stacey.  I did.  OK.  You're on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now I've got all my pieces.  There's a lot.  So there's this piece, this piece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Still doesn't look like a breast pump to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the part that looks like the breast pump.  It comes with its own little ear thing with all the tubes.  Oh, it's a nice little felt case.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes.  OK.  Wow, wait a minute.  Should we do a game where we guess  what that could possibly be?  Let's do it.  What could that be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here, I'll make it work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's see all the parts.  She had to go get something.  She had to plug in something.  It comes with a case.  It has a little strip.  She said a name.  Ready.  It goes on your arm.  It's going to punch Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it doesn't go on my arm.  Oh, it doesn't go on your arm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But you could put it on your arm if you wanted to.  Does anybody in the chat room any idea what this is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is a fist going to come out of it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  So I don't know if you can see it rising and falling.  Is it a bone phone?  It fills up with air.  Oh, it's rising.  It's getting bigger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Does that help anybody?  Is it a asphygmomometer?  Is it a blood pressure measure?  Let's see what people are saying in the chat room.  Is it a heating pad?  Air cast?  Is it an air cast?  It is not.  Is it a to-go food box?  Is it another oven?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it a helium drone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pressure.  All right.  Do you guys give up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  Clearly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're like, clearly we have given up.  It is an anti-snoring device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What?  No one would have guessed that.  What?  No one would have guessed that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, this is the thing that goes under the mattress that  lifts you up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It goes under your pillow.  It goes inside your pillow.  That sleeve that I showed you fits inside your pillow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And if you start to snore, it raises your head?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does.  It raises it up to this level.  This is the high level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  We're looking at the video right now.  We're looking at some woman hit a man.  Yeah, because he's a snorer.  I find women snore just as much as men.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I got it because I snore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  Let's see.  Go ahead.  Show Stacey so we can see what she's doing here.  OK.  Show us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this part right here is the speaker.  And it goes next to your bed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So that looked like a mouse.  I thought that was a mouse.  It does.  Speaker or microphone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry, microphone.  Thank you, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He obviously understands how this works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  So it's a microphone.  And it detects.  It says it detects snoring.  What it really does, it detects a lot of noise.  And you can adjust the sensitivity on it.  I don't know if you can see that.  And then what else to know about it?  I mean, it's smart only in the sense  that it has Bluetooth to talk to the pump, which  is located in this case.  Is there an audible noise?  So it's audible if you're laying on your side.  And I'm going to turn it off because it's like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How strong is it?  Is it strong enough?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's really strong.  So it's deflating right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And it lifts you up enough that that's  enough to stop snoring?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  And this I don't know because I am not a doctor.  And this is something they sent me to review.  I haven't purchased it.  I will be sending it back.  Don't worry.  But the thinking is that it moves your head enough  that it engages your throat muscles that  have relaxed or something.  Again, not a doctor.  So I have been trying it for a week.  And sadly, I don't snore every night.  So we can't figure out if it's changed anything or not.  So I'm not recommending that you purchase this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You haven't audibly snored though because otherwise you  would say it's not working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, see, this is my issue.  I have audibly snored because I have woken myself up snoring  because I am freaked out when I snore because my husband.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I should say this, and I'll say this not just for you  but everybody, sleep apnea is a huge problem.  And undiagnosed sleep apnea, especially in women  because doctors often don't believe women have this problem,  is actually can kill you.  So take it seriously if you snore and ask your partner  if you wake up suddenly sometimes  or you stop breathing at times.  That's a serious condition.  And a lot of people want out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm just allergic to everything in my bedroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The snoring is like because you can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's because I can't breathe.  I live in Austin.  It's like the allergy capital of the world.  Anyway, so this is the device.  I can say that I've slept on it and I don't notice it.  My husband hasn't woken me up yet  and said that I've been snoring.  I have not recorded my whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it doesn't tell you whether it inflated  during the night or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's no record.  No, there's no record because there's no app.  Well, maybe there's an app actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So Dr. Mom has said this does not win her seal of approval.  And sent me a link to the Mayo Clinic's diseases  and conditions, what causes snoring page.  And it could be your mouth anatomy, alcohol consumption,  nasal problems, sleep deprivation, sleep position.  So it's typically most frequent last  was sleeping on the back as gravity's effect on the throat  narrows the airway.  So that might, Dr. Mom, confirm this idea  that at least for this particular snorer,  it could fix it.  Now the one to worry about is obstructive sleep apnea, which  is a serious condition and you've got to pay attention to.  Very cool, Stacey.  Tell us how it works for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm thinking, yeah, I guess I've got to record myself.  This is actually one of my challenges  is I'm not sure how to really test it  because it feels pretty subjective.  Amin Ra in our chat room says he finds

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  a nice cold glass of water in the face  is very effective for curing snoring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, my husband, who is the nicest man as we all know,  he pats me gently on the side.  And so then I'm like, yeah, that's not going to be effective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I use the elbow and the ribs method.  That's much more effective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would be more effective.  He's just like, he pats me and I'm like, yes,  do you need something?  He's like, you're snoring.  I'm like, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, that's very nice of him.  So he wakes you up and stops you.  I think that's good.  Lisa just gives me an elbow on the ribs.  You know, I tried for a while is those breathe right strips.  They never worked for me.  Didn't seem like it did much either for me.  No, it doesn't work for much for me.  But it makes me look like an athlete.  I got the problem too.  So then I put some dark circles under my eyes  and I look like I'm going to the football game.  You say one Montana, two Montana.  Yeah.  Well, ladies and gentlemen, I don't really I was going to I  was I was going to save Bixby for my thing of the week.  But it was so you've done it already was so dopey.  I didn't I don't really care to do it that way.  I don't want to plug it.  So I think we can just wrap this up because it's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, this is good.  So I was next week.  I will hope to see you from Australia at 630 in the morning  there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, this is the one we're going to do from the Sydney Harbor.  We'll see the bridge and the sunrise in the background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I just froze.
