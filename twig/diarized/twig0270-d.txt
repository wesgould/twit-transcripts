CUNY.  Welcome back, mate.  Hey, thank you. I love London.  Yeah, did you have a good time? Looked like you had a good time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I had a great time. Good for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What was the best thing you did?  Evensong at St. Paul's.  Oh, very nice.  So, you know, you go to St. Paul's, which is the beautiful Cathedral Christopher Wren built in the 17th century.  It's in the Old Town, the city of London.  And it's just a beautiful cathedral.  And then you can go up to the Dome, which is really cool and a beautiful view.  Did a bunch of panos.  And then at five o'clock, they do Evensong.  And I was going to do Evensong either at Westminster Abbey or St. Paul's.  But we were at St. Paul's.  And it was so neat. So at five o'clock, they chased the tourists out.  I said, but we want to stay for the service.  They said, oh, yes, of course.  So you sit there very nicely.  And then the minister came over and said, we've got 70 seats in the choir.  You know, that's the wooden the Q, U, I, R, E, the wooden seats that the lords and ladies.  It was where the royal wedding was held, not Kate and Harry's or Will's or whoever.  But Charles and Diana's wedding was.  So you remember probably that all the fancy people sitting in these beautiful wooden seats.  Unsuitable, no doubt.  Yeah, and creaky.  But we but we all got 70 of us got to sit there and then the boys choir comes in  and they're sitting there right there next to you and singing.  And it was the most beautiful thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, wow. So neat. Yeah, it's really great.  Really enjoyed that.  It's very, very beautiful to hear a voice choir, really good voice choir up close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Also, changing the guard was fun of all things.  Oh, yeah. You were a tourist.  I did all the tourist stuff. I did the London Eye.  You bet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like the eye. I mean, you know, the giant thing in the middle of the.  I wouldn't like that at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like a bridge.  It's not scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It moves so slowly that they don't stop you to get up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My pops starts where I'll be stuck up there for an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It moves. It's like this is half an hour and it goes all the way around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't like things that happen slowly either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like right. You know what?  Do it or move or don't.  I am with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am with you.  Somebody who some comic said a Ferris wheel combines.  I think it was Jimmy Fallon, the worst of both worlds, terror and boredom.  It was fun.  And then Tower of London and, you know, just all the usual tourist things.  It was really double decker bus.  Yeah, you really did it up.  We only had four days.  I had toad in a hole. Didn't have bangers and mash.  I had toad in a hole, which is a sausage stuck into a Yorkshire pudding  surrounded by mashed potatoes.  So it's kind of like everything.  Wow.  That's the only English thing I had.  Everything else we went to French restaurants and wonderful food.  The food in London is fabulous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Food in London now going from a horrible, horrible food city to a great food city.  It's an amazing story.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Had a great time.  I love London.  And I apologize because so many people so kindly asked to, you know,  I got an email from a guy who drives the tube, drives an underground car.  And said, would you like to ride in front of the train sometime?  And I mean, just so many people said, you know,  would you like to come up in the gherkin or the shard?  And we were there for such a short time that we just did the tourist thing,  and that was it.  It was just Lisa and me just hardcore touristy.  The only weird thing is we're walking real quickly down the street.  We have a restaurant reservation.  We're going over to the West End.  And Will Harris is like at a bar just standing there.  The one guy I know lives in England.  He says, hey.  I said, Will.  Gave him a hug and then we had to say, we've got to go.  So that's it.  All right.  Let's talk.  Right now, as we speak, HTC is doing another bizarre event.  They've announced a new, is it the Desire Eye phone,  which is an all plastic waterproof HTC phone with 13...  13 megapixel.  13 megapixel out.  Remember now the HTC One is they made a big deal about having four megapixels,  but they're ultra pixels.  Now they've finally realized nobody wanted that.  So it's 13 megapixels in the back, but also 13 megapixels in the front and flash on both sides.  So it's the ultimate selfie cam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Without gimmicks, right?  It's like the ultimate selfie.  It's just a good front facing camera.  Right.  Which is all you really need for a good selfie.  No flip out screens, no crazy software, blah, blah, blah.  It's just a 13 megapixel camera for front facing.  As it should be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  HTC is famous for the software that they add in their phones.  You have an HTC One, but you're using the Google Play Edition or you used to anyway.  I used to, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've got the OnePlus One right now, but yeah, I was using the HTC One M8.  It got destroyed by the infant I live with, but I loved it.  Great phone, great phone.  But that, the 13 megapixel front and back,  that's something I really would like.  That appeals to the selfie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What did she manage to do to it to destroy a phone?  It's not actually easy to destroy a phone, except of course an iPhone, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It isn't. It isn't. That's a solid phone.  I heard her banging something really hard on the floor and didn't look up fast enough to catch.  She was really like, yeah.  And then the screen just never came on after that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Edda has got some real skills.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, she's good.  She loves the phone.  She always wants the phone.  She wants the phone.  She wants the tablet.  But yeah, we had to have a few discussions about not banging it on the floor.  You know, we naturally sort of use, you know,  like tend to handle these devices with a little bit with a little bit of reverence, even me.  I mean, I'm against cases.  I feel like these computers are here for us to use.  I want the computer to be there for me and not for me to adapt to the computer.  But I still am sort of very carefully handle it.  She has no such instincts about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's it. It's actually very it's very telling, isn't it?  It's very interesting.  HTC also announced they're going to do new software, new camera software for all HTC One owners.  And a new Zoe will be on iPhone as well as Android.  And that's a good idea.  I think the Zoe, which is one of the features I really like about the HTC One,  it takes a movie and stills at the same time.  I think it's a really nice feature and it would be great on an iPhone.  So we'll keep watching and let you know if anything else is announced.  But HTC doing its event right now.  And we're still on.  We were watching just before the show.  And I just don't understand why these companies do this.  Who's that to appeal to?  You got a bunch of tech, 50 tech journalists.  They don't want to see a fashion show, especially bad fashion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just yeah, it doesn't make any sense.  It's like just get a great speaker with a lot of personality.  Someone like you, Leo, who can who's got just a great voice and can project enthusiasm and but but sort of clearly explain something.  It doesn't have to be the CEO necessarily.  In fact, I don't know.  Sometimes I think it shouldn't be the CEO.  It shouldn't be.  Just get someone good who explains what the product is.  And that's it.  Show it.  Yeah, it's really weird.  But I think it's it's a partially a cultural, you know, it's a cultural thing, too.  I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The idea that it's got to be a big show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, mach show.  Well, we'll we'll we'll try to parse the fashion show and give you the actual tech facts as they emerge.  Part of the fashion show.  What is they talking about?  Why are they doing this?  Why?  Well, we could talk phones.  Moto X.  Now, you guys, you're still using the one plus one.  And I have to say, I'm really tempted to go back to the one plus one for one reason.  The battery life, the 20 hour battery life is so nice.  This is 12.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no, I'm sorry, Leo.  Twelve doesn't make it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't care if you got a leather bag battery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The one thing that's the one thing they did really well on this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The one is kind of very generic, right?  It's just like it's a it doesn't it doesn't scream anything.  It has no soul.  It has no soul, but it goes all day.  It has a hacker soul.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  But talk to me about the hint.  That's what I want to hear about, Leo.  I couldn't get it to work.  Oh, Jason had it last night, but he said this has been in Leo's ear and I am not going to put it in my ear.  Well, then I want to pay.  So I'll talk to you about it on Twig.  So, yeah, I got the hint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I of the three, I like the Moto 360 the best.  I think it is the best smartwatch of all out there right now.  The phone, if it had good battery life, would be good.  I did a review on before you buy and I wasn't able I had reprogrammed it to be something like OK, Moto X and it never would.  It just wouldn't wake up.  So I went back to OK, Google Now.  OK, Google Now.  Well, it's still not listening very well.  Didn't you change it to wake up?  No, I changed it back.  It said for best results.  Your password.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is there is there a way to remind yourself of the word you put in?  Yes.  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, they say they make you enter it in as text before you go on because they know that you will forget.  And, you know, people are, you know, a lot of the people Motorola were having going.  Hello, Jarvis.  One thing I've learned from the new iPhone, you know, the new iPhone wakes up when you say, hey, Siri, but all the time, you know,  you say, hey, Siri, but only if it's under power.  And one thing I've learned from that is that's too short a phrase because it wakes up when I'm listening to an audio book.  It wakes up when I'm talking.  It wakes up when President Obama says the word Syria on the TV.  Siri goes, what?  What?  So that's too short.  So and then they say this on the Moto X.  If when you're programming it, make it.  In fact, they'll even say, no, that's too short.  More syllables is better and probably more distinct syllables.  But it doesn't work very well.  And the hint.  Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.  Try that.  OK.  OK.  OK, Google Now.  Yeah, there it worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's five syllables, Leo.  OK, Google Now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  You can't fast, Gina.  OK, Google Now.  Yeah, now it's working reliably.  That's a lot of talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I know I liked it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wanted to say, OK, Moto X.  That wasn't very reliable.  Anyway, OK, Google Now seems to work.  And you train it and blah, blah, blah.  Oh, it's calling somebody.  No, stop.  God, seriously.  Please.  It did that.  It did that.  Didn't it do it that Chad when we were doing it when I was doing the review and before  you buy it started calling.  Yeah.  Chad said, you're in a phone call.  I said, what?  And I had to hang up.  Well, whatever.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Butt dial.  So the hint is, OK, Google Now.  The hint is the earpiece that makes the full set.  So you got the watch, you got the phone, you got the earpiece, you got the full legendary  armor set.  The hint is very small, has no microphone protrusion or anything.  It just fits in your ear like a little gauge.  That's not it.  It looks like it.  It's not it.  Is Jason here?  No, it doesn't fall out.  It's pretty good.  You kind of screwed in and has a face that will, if you wish, match the back.  I got the brown cognac leather, so it matched it.  Which doesn't really make you look more fashionable.  It just makes you look kind of weird.  Yeah.  And you can get fabric.  But not as weird as the generic Bluetooth dongle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, and it doesn't blink blue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's pretty unobtrusive.  And the sound is pretty good.  The problem is the microphone is in your ear, so it never does seem to respond.  Can somebody go on Jason's desk and steal my hint back?  John will do it.  Because I want to show you.  Battery life, obviously, on something the size of a dime, isn't very long.  Three hours.  But then you get a container that you put it in that has two more charges.  So you charge the container overnight.  Did you find it?  Yeah.  You charge the container overnight.  And then so when you're not using the hint, which by the way will be dead now because it discharges even when it's not in your ear.  So you put it in here.  So you have to charge it.  Like two or three times a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what that blinking is.  Yeah.  Well, that's another problem, by the way.  That's a charger.  Whoa.  So the charger is cool.  That thing looks cool.  But I didn't realize.  It's a good idea.  But I didn't realize you have to take that thing out of your ear and stick it in the charger through it two or three times a day.  Three hours of talk time.  It gets a little waxy.  Three hours of talk time.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It doesn't get waxy.  It's not waxy.  I'm just joking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know that looks pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's some yellow something on there.  No, the yellow is the pogo pins for the.  Oh, OK.  Fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  Oh, we're getting real.  That's a quite a close up.  And.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I'm not sure which is the microphone.  I think that's the microphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the problem is that's in your ear.  You can touch this.  So it'll work with any Bluetooth capable phone.  There's like a little hole there.  I don't know if that's the mic or this is the mic.  There's two different parts.  OK.  Maybe that's your ear.  That's the mic.  That's the mic.  That's the mic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the mic.  That's the mic.  That's the mic.  That's the mic.  That's the mic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the mic.  There's two different parts.  OK.  And maybe that's just a light.  I don't know.  You can tap it and wake the phone up.  But you can also, if it's attached to a Moto X, say, OK, Google now or whatever your phrase  is.  Although I never was able to get that working because the microphone stuck in your ear.  So then I called my daughter and she said, I can't what?  What?  Can't what?  Hello?  So I think that's going to be retired.  Oh, OK.  OK.  One more complaint.  It does.  You see, it's glowing when it's charging the device.  It'll go solid when it's fully charged.  That's really bright.  It doesn't look bright in here, but in a darkened bedroom, that's a flashlight.  I mean, it's that bright.  And so this you.  And it's the breathing.  Yeah.  And it's breathing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is not conducive to sleep.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a Mac.  Not the recent models, but there was a model of Mac that did that when it was charging.  It would breathe and it would make my better half crazy.  She would cover it in shirts like she would just like it could not be in the bedroom.  This can't be in the bedroom.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to charge this in another room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it makes it easy to find on the bright side.  It also senses that it's in your ear.  So you don't have to push any buttons.  It just makes it says made some music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because the thing that upsets me most about about earpieces is that when I'm trying to  hold it in my ear so I can hear better, of course, that's the off button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  It's telling me go to Bluetooth menu on device to complete pairing.  So because it's not paired, I'm going to go to Bluetooth and I'm going to say pair this search for devices.  So that's the nice thing.  Pairing is very easy, very quick.  And now it's going to be paired.  It'll pair to two different phones.  So you could pair this if you had another phone or actually I paired it to my computer.  OK, so now it's saying paired wants to access my.  My address book.  So let's just see now.  OK, Google, now.  It's working.  Maybe I just had a phrase.  It wasn't great.  OK, Google, now.  OK, Google, now.  While watch is listening, you should speak to it.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, what was what responded?  Not that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I have too many things listening.  OK, Google, now.  Oh, see, the watch is response.  Watch is doing it.  Crap.  OK, they obviously haven't fully thought this out yet.  People say that reviews have been fairly positive, but I don't think it's because I think the reviews actually haven't used it.  I don't think it's usable.  So that's too bad.  That's too bad.  I mean, on the other hand, remember, when you're using stuff like this, you're on the cutting edge.  You're using new stuff and you can expect some bumps along the way.  I wouldn't recommend this for somebody who just wants a Bluetooth earpiece.  I was listening to an audio book.  It was great because it's so small.  It just sits there.  It's kind of fun.  All right.  The reason I bring this up is because next week, right, that's the rumor, right, Jeff?  Next week, Shamu comes out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Rumor.  Rumor.  Rumor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is six, which is rumored to be almost six inch version of this, the Moto X.  With great specs.  If it better, more RAM, three gigs of RAM, bigger screen, five point nine inch, I think screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have nine.  It's pretty big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Still smaller.  It's still smaller than the Mondo 6, right?  The iPhone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, still smaller than the iPhone 6 Plus.  They have big bezels.  I like big bezels.  I cannot lie.  No, no, no.  The 6 Plus is 5'5", isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's five and a half inches, but the total phone size is bigger than the rumored size

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  for Shamu because of the bezels.  Oh, gotcha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, if it has better battery life, it might be a good pick because I'll tell you  what, if this had the same battery life as the OnePlus One, I'd say it's equivalent to  or even maybe better because it listens.  I like the little things that it does.  I'm sorry that they went to 5.2 inches.  4.7 was really great, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the battery life on the OnePlus One is pretty great.  I'm pretty spoiled at this point.  Yeah.  I don't even think about it anymore.  That's the one thing.  Go ahead, Jeff.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No, that was it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the one thing?  That's the one thing about the OnePlus One.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  By the way, the OnePlus One screen is, I believe, and others do too, the same part as in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  iPhone 5, 6 Plus.  Really?  Oh, really?  It's exactly the same size.  It's definitely...  It's got all the same specs as the same...  I think it's the same part.  It's the in-cell touch and all that stuff.  So, if you asked me what I should do, what you should do, I'd say wait for Shamu and  see.  I think that's where I'm heading, yep.  Yeah.  And for the price...

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Gosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gosh.  That's the phone to go with.  And I'm sad to say, it's such high hopes for the Moto X.  I'm going to keep using it because hope springs eternal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can I give you a little, a small watch update?  Yes.  So, if you have the latest update on the watch itself, you can now turn ambient back on and  it will last all day.  I did that and you're right.  They fixed the battery pretty well.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  That latest update really did make a huge difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then I found a little program called IntelliCon Watch Face.  Have you played with some of the third-party watch face apps?  No, not yet.  This one's great because it lets you...  You can have a Ferrari logo.  It adds some features.  This is the battery life of the watch is displayed on the watch now.  You can have this stay awake for five seconds or 10 seconds after you turn it on.  That of course will kill the battery.  And that is programmable.  That's East Coast time as you probably recognize since it's your time.  And all of this is programmable.  So you can make any face you want, which is kind of nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I'm going to be in Seoul next week.  And the LGR goes on sale in Korea on Monday.  You should pick it up.  Oh, you should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's expensive, right?  $250, something like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I haven't bought one yet.  So, you know, I'm too free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Come on, you better.  The LGR, it's the round one.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And no flat tire problem because it has the watch.  Well, it has a flat tire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You just can't see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah, but that's clever.  I don't know if that's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the flat tire doesn't exist if no one can see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't bother me.  I would rather see more of the watch and have the flat tire than less of the watch with no  flat tire.  In effect, it's got a flat tire all the way around.  The bezel is hiding.  Because it's a thicker bezel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All the way around.  I think it's...

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  So there's your phone wrap up.  Really, I was just stealing all about Android's thunder.  I'm sure you talked about all of this last night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We did.  We did talk about a lot of it.  But, you know, Android's Android.  We're all interested in Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But let's talk about Google.  What do you say?  We're going to do that in a second.  But I'm going to take a break.  As soon as we come back, we'll have some Google stuff and we'll have their Google change log.  I want to ask you about some fascinating journalistic stories, Jeff Jarvis, because you're our king  of journalism.  I presume you both read Kathy Sierra's post of yesterday.  Yeah.  No, I've got to.  Oh, God.  Okay.  While I'm doing the ad, Jeff, run to...  What is her pony?  Serious pony?  Serious, serious pony.  Seriouspony.com.  Run to Serious Pony and read it.  She says she's going to take it down soon.  So you might want to read it now, Jeff.  And we could talk about that a little bit, too.  I'll drop it in the dock, Jeff.  It's more of that troll stuff, Jeff.  And it's just, you know, it breaks my heart.  Just breaks my heart.  I think it may be down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really?  Presentation skills considered harmful?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She didn't link to it from her blog.  It was kind of like a hidden link.  Oh, maybe it's hidden.  Okay.  I'll hunt that down.  You do the reading.  It's in the chat room, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kathy is a technologist and an author of many educational programming books for years and  years and years.  Early, early blogger.  Great writer.  Just a great writer.  Powerful writer.  Great speaker.  A teacher.  I would call her a teacher but in technology.  And short, long story short, 2007 she is, you know, people are starting to pay attention  to her work because she does really good work and she gets trolled by an infamous troll  and horribly attacked by tons of people who dox her and publish her social security number  and home address and a bunch of lies about her family and her kids and her work and she  goes offline because she's afraid for her safety and for her family safety and she comes  back online, oh, I don't know, last year, 2013 I think, under a different handle, Serious  Pony and starts to publish a little bit more and I don't know, maybe I should pass this  over to you.  Her troll was involved in a court case.  Weave.  Weave.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She was involved in a court case.  And this is the thing, and this is where I got in a little bit of trouble because Weave's,  the case against Weave was terrible.  It was another one of those Department of Justice bogus prosecutions.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was a computer fraud and abuse act, right?  It was overreach.  I mean, it was a terrible lawsuit but this guy is also a terrible person.  But Weave is a hideous person.  He's hideous, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He was the guy who apparently doxed Kathy Sierra.  He admitted it in New York Times.  Now he denies it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, now he denies it.  He admitted it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not a nice person, really kind of in many ways, and she talks about this, not just a  troll but a sociopathic troll with real skills.  That's kind of the worst possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Extremely smart, extremely manipulative.  Yes, just a constant liar.  And you know, what got hard, what got difficult for her and what I can't imagine must have  been surreal for her is that a lot of people in the tech community support, you know, were  against the case against him, right?  There was a bad case against him separate from what he did for her.  We were torn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We were torn because this was, you know, he downloaded, it turned out AT&T had misconfigured  its servers and you could get emails of customers, iPad users, very simply with a script.  So he did it.  He downloaded something like 114,000 addresses.  As far as anybody knows, never did anything malicious with him, although that doesn't,  I mean, given his personality, I don't know.  But the prosecution seemed misguided and they were really going for the works.  On the other hand, it's hard not to celebrate this getting this guy in jail because he's  a creep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, because he's a horrible creep.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, what she's talking about in this and it's a very powerful article is how, you know,  this happened to her 10 years ago.  The hell doesn't go away.  And it's gotten worse and worse.  And yeah, and she's making an interesting point because, you know, I'm the one who says,  well, just ignore them.  They'll go away.  And she says it doesn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She has, she has a great list here.  Your choices, one leave, they win to ignore them.  They escalate, make life more miserable, DDoS ruin your career, et cetera.  They win three fight back.  If you've already hit the Kool-Aid point, which I'll describe in a second, see option  to they win.  The Kool-Aid point is brilliant.  I think it's a real insightful point, which is that that is not so much that your troll  hates you.  The troll hates the attention you're getting and you don't deserve that.  And you're all wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Especially if you're a woman, especially if you're a woman in tech, then you really don't  deserve it.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the logic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And so this campaign discrediting, you know, begins, you slept your way to the top, you  know, you, you, you made all this up.  You're actually, you know, whatever you, all the things.  And actually Anita Sarkeesian did this great talk at XOXO about how the ways in which trolls  kind of discredit women and all those those things were were done to Kathy just lies basically  about her. She and things would escalate like she she posted this blog comment, a comment  on a blog saying that she supported people who moderated their blog comments.  And that escalated into this giant lie about how she had issued DMCA complaints against  websites and had people censored.  And so she herself was a censor and against like, you know, a free and open web.  And people would just these these stories would just sort of grow and the meme would  catch on. And then suddenly she was someone who hated a free and open web because she  had said in a blog comment, she thought someone should be able to moderate the comments on  their own blog.  I mean, like insane, surreal, I cannot believe what this woman has been through kind of  moments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And and the thing is, it's surreal and it's beyond appalling and disgusting.  And she's felt fear for her life and such.  And it's extreme.  Well, but it's not really an outlier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the that's the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah, what I was what I'm saying is it might seem like an extreme.  And there's a lot of that.  There's also a lot that's short of that that is also irritating and difficult and and  not good for the net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, if you wonder why there aren't more women in tech, because I think I think there  are very few women, publicly visible women in tech who haven't experienced this in some  form or fashion.  Am I very few?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Very, very few.  Yeah, you know, one of our thinkups investors, the message DM me and said, have you ever  experienced anything like this?  I just seems like it seems like you're a little more visible.  Is this common?  And I was like, oh, I can tell you stories.  And I've talked about it a little bit here and I won't go into my whole thing, but I  love that Kathy made she differentiated between and this is something I know that's  subjective and you know it when you see it, but she differentiated between like mean  being mean to someone and then stalking them.  Right. There's like saying to someone like, you know, you're fat and stupid online is  like someone being mean on the Internet.  OK, block, ignore, whatever.  And then there's like I've taken a photo of your child and superimpose them on a  porn image and publish that or I've published your your home address and it encouraged  other people, egged other people on to go show up there.  Right. And there's there's a difference between those two things.  A big difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She talks about trolls posting flashing images in epileptic forums designed to put people  in fits and to induce seizures, to induce seizures.  And it's for the lulz.  And that makes it OK.  And people go, oh, well, that's terrible.  But it's sure funny.  It's not. It's horrible.  It's horrible behavior.  The reason I bring it up, you know, I mean, look, if you're a celebrity.  If you're a movie star, this happens all the time.  And and the the the general thing is just not to mention it and not to, you know, you  have security, you'll go to the police, you know, if there's a fear for your life or a  tangible threat and they will because you're a celebrity, they will prosecute.  And we see that happen.  But what we don't see happen is this kind of continuous drumbeat that goes on all the  time. What's changed is now, first of all, it's many, many, many, many more people are  exposed to it. And the tools for doing it, like and Twitter comes up again and again  in this and Kathy talks about Twitter, our new technological tools really facilitate  this. And and I'm starting to feel like we're taking a really bad turn here.  And it's not, you know, a couple of weeks ago, I said, you know, we had the case of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the naked celebrity photos and the beheading videos and I argued on the show, I don't  know if it was the last week when you were off, Leo, but I argued that that we might  be at a point where I saw people say it's wrong to share them, it's wrong to look at  them. And I saw the beginnings of a norm come out.  That's among civilized people.  There is a huge swath of people who aren't civilized or who are.  In fact, we've had this story on to trolls are psychopaths.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She says that as well.  She says that as well.  That we've is a sociopath.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I'm going to get I'm going to get in huge trouble here.  So I'm going to make an equivalency that I don't mean to make at all.  OK, and I don't want to also want to mention this guy again at all.  But but my little mini thing of my imposter who promised to change the name hasn't  not a man of his word.  He just went into L.O. and and used my name there.  You know, this is a guy who has a respectable job in a company with trust in its name.  That's all I'll say.  And I can't trust him.  He is not a man of his word.  He's he's a lying little creep.  And now, as I say that, guess what's going to happen?  I'll get crap now for now.  I don't have any humor.  And I'm not.  If you all, you know, it's just the fact that people think they have a right to  irritate other people.  The fact that if you're in any the weirdest part of the pathology of this is interesting  to me is that if you are in the least bit famous, people think that they can go after  you by least bit famous now means that you publish anything to the public.  That means if you have a Twitter account, it means if you have a blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kind of what Kathy Sierra is saying is just by sticking your head up in the world means  that people are going to want to try to cut you down.  And yes, especially if you're a woman who sticks her head up, that's really not OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. And the first time in history and in culture, we have a whole group of people  who are like famous enough to not have bodyguards, right.  But famous enough to have stalkers.  Right. Right.  And the system isn't built to deal with them.  And I know I went to the police when I was when I had my guy and they couldn't do  anything, you know, like you have to have whatever.  I won't go into the details, but they basically are just not not equipped and can't  help you unless she says they're not interested.  They're not equipped. And, you know, there's bigger, bigger things going on in the  world. I guess.  You know, it's a little both.  Yeah, you know, I mean, Leo, you went through this a little bit when one issue happened  with with your daughter. You know, it's like you have to have a documentation of a  credible threat within your state and it has to be said in a certain way that there's  no way that you can be misinterpreted any other way.  You know, and these guys know how to, you know, skirt skirt the line and send you  creepy pictures and write things about you that make you know that they they know all  these things about you right without making a direct threat.  I mean, there's it's and, you know, the police, they're like, print out the emails  and the tweets. I mean, literally, like, that's what that's what goes on.  That's the level level that they're at.  So they're useless. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The you know, Jennifer Lawrence said it's a sex crime.  It's not even a crime. It's a sex crime.  I don't know. We can debate that.  But I think she's amazing response.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Her response to that whole situation, the fact that she said that was a sex crime  and anyone who looked at my photos without my permission was perpetuating that crime.  That was just such a huge I mean, she's the first celebrity.  You know, every other celebrity is generally women, right?  Who's had leaked nudes have apologized.  Oh, it was a lapse in judgment.  I'm very sorry. They were shameful.  Scarlett Johansson kind of played it.  I was a Scarlett Johansson.  I forget which one was like, oh, I know my best angle was kind of coy about it.  I love that Jennifer Lawrence came straight up and said,  I was about to write an apology.  And then I thought, I don't have anything to apologize for.  I this was a sex crime.  That was an incredible that interview was in Vanity Fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ironically, owned by the same company that owns Reddit,  which I doubt she knew.  She might have thought about going somewhere else to do this.  But nevertheless, it got the attention it deserved.  And you can't disagree with her.  Here's the reason I bring this up.  But we had I had such high hopes for the Internet  as of being a democratizing medium.  And a lot a number of people said even in the earliest days,  yeah, but it's going to give people of who shouldn't have a voice a voice.  And I always said, you know, if it's in the light of day, this stuff,  the really bad stuff has to stay under a rock to survive  in the light of day and the free, you know, agora, the marketplace.  It'll go away. It'll shrivel up.  It'll dry up in the sun.  And and the true nature of humans will triumph.  And I'm afraid I was really wrong.  And it's very sad to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not ready to give up.  Not by a long shot.  I again, I point to the Jennifer Lawrence case.  I think the people all in all rallied around.  You didn't see them spread all around.  You you heard people say, no, don't even look at them.  That would be wrong.  There are always going to be trolls,  assholes, sickos, creeps,  idiots, crud buckets in the world.  Right. They're always going to be there.  They always have been. They always will be.  Now, you're right.  Is your point making the Internet makes more visible  only because we link to them, only because we say, hey, look at it.  Fight, fight. Look over at that.  Well, don't we need to? Not their fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You said you said norms would fix this, but norms aren't fixing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not yet. No, but I'm saying I but this takes time.  You know, insert Gutenberg lecture here.  One hundred fifty years to invent the newspaper.  It takes time for these norms to take over.  Well, I was researching the telegraph and I've got, you know, from from my  from 1860, 1858 to 1885, they still hadn't figured it out.  Yeah. It was the telegraph was still causing people problems.  There were still, oh, my God, people were getting married over the telegraph.  And this is dangerous.  Women have to stay away from the telegraph.  1865 women have to stay away from the telegraph because it'll  it'll expose them to the course of the corners of the world.  On New York Times, let us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. But imagine what that New York Times writer would think today

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  about the course corners of the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. But but but but hey, don't don't don't.  Part of the problem is.  So I spent my flight back from from San Francisco last week  writing an essay that I'm trying to place somewhere in German media.  I'm starting with the Frankfurt  Algemannan site talking about the German problem.  And at the end of it, what I argue is that we've got to also  have a discussion about the wonder.  And the entire discussion now has been taken over by the techno panics  and the protectionists and the controllers and the negatives  and the trolls.  There's also amazing and wonderful things going on with this net.  And I argue that we ought to have  said on the show before a world's fair of the net.  Yes, there's crap, but there's also a countervailing wonder  that's occurring that we're ignoring.  We're not talking about.  We're we're we're looking at all the bad stuff that comes up.  We're allowing that to win the conversation.  And we're also it's the fault of the public  for giving exposure to trolls, imposters, bozos, et cetera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People need to get indignant and and instead of saying  and Kathy Sierra points this out, there's just kind of this general,  oh, there must be some merit to what he's saying kind of a thing.  Right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because because your public and public people deserve this.  Yeah. You put yourself out there.  So so you're exposed.  So you so what what what happens to slap you in the face you deserve?  Obviously wrong, obviously ridiculous.  And we need more discussions.  I mean, I'll make another horrid,  ridiculous equivalency that I don't mean to make a equivalent.  But what do we hear in the discussion about terrorism and Islam?  Well, why don't we hear more Islamists?  Oh, well, we do.  But what gets attention is the terrorists.  It's the fault of media to a great extent.  It's the fault of of conversations.  And and, you know, when you look at at at in London,  there were stories that when the the the Brit was beheaded,  the Muslim community in the UK expressed outrage.  So there's a story where it got there.  You know, it's always been there.  You know, it's been no doubt about that.  There's a hashtag not in our name.  Yes. Right.  So so it used the tools to try to turn around and we need more of that.  Exactly. And we need the same thing with trolls.  We need that. We need the problem is this thing was where you get to the  Kathy Sierra, you know, horrible thing here.  What you probably need to do is you need to get to the problem.  What you probably the first step is we all have to ignore them.  If you point to a troll, you are equally guilty of whatever  that troll has done. Full stop.  You are complicit trolls crime.  Oh, isn't that funny? Look at the fight.  Oh, it's just funny. It's just lolz.  No sucker. You just did it yourself.  You were an accomplice to the crime.  If you look at pictures of Jennifer Lawrence, you are committing a sex crime.  She's right. If you can't look at child porn because it's wrong,  then how can you look at the stolen photo and say it's right?  You are responsible for the behavior.  So at a level of ignoring, we have to get to there.  Then there's the question of do we get to a level of condemnation?  Does that just give the trolls what they want?  Oh, I kicked up a storm, maybe.  But at least we have to get to the level of ignoring.  And and and what we have to do is rather than shaming the troll,  shame the people who point to the troll. And I've done that.  I've gone to people and I've said,  did you really want to give that guy attention?  Do you really want to do that?  And then I've people, reasonable people say, OK, yeah, you're right.  It was wrong. So we all have a responsibility to do that.  So shame it. Ignore the trolls and shame the troll promoters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's and that's using social norms to correct.  Yes. And you know, if we don't succeed at this technology,  if we don't succeed at this, everybody worthwhile is going to pull back.  We're going to lose the the the discourse.  We're going to lose the potential of the Internet.  It'll it'll become a wasteland because anybody who has any sense  will just stay out of the public eye.  Yes. And you don't want that.  You know. And you want women in the game industry,  you want women in technology, you don't want women just to say,  God, this is a crappy place to be.  I don't want to participate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, it's funny, that's the kind of the insight that I had  about all this. And I have to say that Cathy's that that that essay she wrote

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  really was everybody should read it.  If you have any doubt, if you say, oh, no, this isn't that bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Read it and then say, it's it was definitely a bit of a reckoning for me.  Right. Because I mean, I build a product whose premise think up,  whose premise is that participating on the public network is a good thing.  Period. Right. And and and I don't know.  I mean, this this this situation, you know, I think of the more I think about it,  the more I wonder about that.  I mean, I do believe that I want to believe that,  but it gets harder when this stuff happens.  And one of the insights that I've had is that the the social networks  that I love and feel safest,  especially around sharing, are not public networks.  Like my favorite social network is a private mailing list  that a friend of mine set up that is friends of friends.  Everybody knows someone else through some other context.  And and it's and it's incredible.  And I and I grow from it and it feeds my soul and it makes me feel happy.  It makes me feel safe. And I share.  And and a similar thing from subscribe to a friend of mine who has a tiny letter,  which is like an email newsletter.  And she she wrote a response, actually, to Kathy's post, saying that, you know,  she didn't have a public response.  But these are some of the thoughts that are going through ahead  after reading it three or four times.  And that was one of those things.  I was like, OK, yes, this is this is going on.  It was kind of it was a level of discourse that wasn't going on in my public feeds.  I mean, part of it is that Twitter is isn't isn't fit for long form  discourse because it's it's it's 140 characters.  But it feels like the like networks like Twitter and Facebook are more about  sort of public performance,  whereas the networks where I share with my friends and and interact and sort of,  you know, and learn and grow are more are semi-semi-public, not totally public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google, at least, is responding.  They say we've a Google spokesperson.  This is in the face of  an attorney who sent a letter threatening a hundred million dollar lawsuit to Google.  Does he really represent the stars?  We don't know who he represents.  It may not represent anybody, maybe an ambulance chaser.  But Google's spokesperson responded, saying we've removed tens  of thousands of pictures within hours of the requests being made.  We have closed hundreds of accounts.  The Internet is used for many good things.  Stealing people's private photos is not one of them.  Typically, they'll wait until they receive a copyright notice in this case  because it's a violation of community guidelines with respect to nudity and privacy.  We're turning this around in days, in hours, not weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And wouldn't it be nice if everyone got the same treatment that Jennifer Lawrence gets?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's you know, that's another point somebody made after  Robin Williams passed away and his daughter was getting horribly harassed.  Then Twitter took action.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's a PR issue for the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. It's a black a black mark.  But when when normal people complain.  And the other thing I come I came away with was, boy, a huge amount of respect for any woman  who dares to raise her voice in public these days.  Yes. And I just it makes me so sad.  You know, you could talk about STEM education and all of that.  But it has to start in the public spaces and it has to be safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It does. It's up to its responsibility of all of us and to defend someone.  You know, if if you're in an office place and you see someone sexually harass a woman  and you sit back and don't do anything, you're complicit.  Yeah. Right.  And it's just like that in virtual space.  Just like that.  And, you know, there's a discussion in the chat room about about, well, what about the right to be forgotten, Jarvis?  I was thinking about this today and my argument, I spoke to a bunch of Germans last night about their problems, as far as I was concerned, and talked about the right to be forgotten.  And, you know, my general argument is that there are already laws in place and we don't need laws written to technologies and changing the technology.  And that Jennifer Lawrence's photos were stolen and violated the rules of Google and Google takes it down.  The difference with the right to be forgotten is just someone coming along and saying, well, for whatever reason, I didn't like this.  And there isn't a principle to work, except I didn't like it.  Now, would it be nice if, you know, we've stuff could be erased all across the net?  You can argue, yes, but you're never going to succeed at that.  It's a whack-a-mole game that's never going to end.  No, no erasure and no technology is going to solve that problem.  And there are free speech issues.  You know, we in America let the Nazis march in Skokie because we know that most people are smart enough to realize that they're the idiots.  The problem with the net today, I think, Leo, and your point is we're not acting like the idiots are idiots.  We're celebrating the idiots.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody's pointing out this happened, has happened before in a very small way in CB radio.  Remember CB's Breaker Breaker One Nine?  Yeah.  It's still around.  It's been rebranded as a family radio service.  But if you use, if you go into those CB channels, it's horrific.  It's awful.  And it got off pretty quickly.  Because you have to get a license because you had to pass a test and had to get a license.  And there's a, and by the way, maybe even more importantly, and I'll ask the Ham's because our Ham Nation show is tonight and they're coming into studio.  But I think even more importantly, there's a very strong culture in Ham radio of following the rules and doing the right thing.  And this is okay.  And this is not okay.  It's a, and it's a culture that is perpetuated by the elders in the Ham community and passed along.  And it's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But stay on that for a second, Leo.  You can still have somebody who needs their meds, somebody who's psychopathic.  They can pass the test.  They're smart.  They can get the license and they can go on hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they'll be very quickly shunned by the Ham community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  What about talk about that?  What does that mean?  Why, why, why did that happen in Ham?  Why not here?  Why, why aren't the grand elders of blogging and tweeting, uh, behaving rather than saying, ah, fight, fight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, good.  That's what we need to do.  You know, I don't know why, but that's what we need to do.  I think partly because Ham's, uh, there's something about Ham's they, the, the people who are attracted to Ham radio are often, uh, very public minded.  Very, it's a different, it's a culture.  That's fascinating.  I've always been fascinated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, there were people who wanted to connect with people and that is the essence of the net.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But no one had to take a test to get on the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, or on CB radio.  Anybody can do it.  And CB is useless now, by the way, it's dead to anybody except the trolls.  This is what happens with these guys is if you, if you don't do something about it, if you don't weed your garden, then all you have left is weeds.  All the, all the flowers die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's Kathy's point about, about, I had learned that lesson when I ran new sites and I thought, oh, people comment, let's let them comment.  Let it go.  Let it go.  Let it go.  No, it's the broken glass problem.  To quote Giuliani, uh, you do that long enough and people will just realize, oh, I can do anything here.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Right.  But Giuliani cleaned up New York by getting rid of the squeegee men.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, in other, in other minor crimes, like broken glass and graffiti and broken windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Street.  The squeegee men tried to drag me out of my car and put my wife into premature labor.  Geez.  It was not some minor.  These were scum bucket people who were there, you know, Oh, they're just cleaning your window.  No, if you don't, if you didn't pay them, um, they tried to go after you.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, New York went through real, a real Renaissance after the, after this small policing effort, uh, putting more cops on the street and, and  not ignoring minor crimes.  And maybe that's what we, maybe we, these are, these are, I bring both of these up because maybe these are models for what we need to do on the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's kind of a different thing though.  Isn't it?  Right.  I mean, there's no government, there's no police.  No, but we can do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We keep our, we keep our neighborhood up.  We keep our neighborhood up.  We do this in our chat room, by the way, because we learned very quickly.  If you don't immediately ban people who are even just taking the subject off topic, the thing disintegrates.  And most IRC is like that.  If you go into normal IRC chat room, it's like, ah, but we got, thank goodness, 12 or 13 or 15 or 20 great moderators, all volunteers, uh, who keep it on point.  And that makes a big difference.  And people often, uh, bridle, they say, well, free speech.  I should be able to get to do whatever I want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And, um, no, not your living room.  Yeah.  Not your living room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we want it.  We want to make, we have a goal for our chat.  We want it to be on topic and to the point and no ad hominem attacks and that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And, and we need to do that in general.  And of course, I mean, look, look also what happened with the society and Hong Kong of the young people there.  Right.  They, they, they knew what would have come down upon them if they went over certain lines.  And so they self-enforced their own lines and said, we're here to make our point.  Not to do, we're here to do this and not this.  And it was an incredible community started and people sharing things and benefiting each other and using technology and mesh networks and phenomenal efforts.  A society, we are a society on the net.  Now the net is the whole world.  So it's all the good and all the bad of the, of society, but we have to set our own rules here.  We have to encourage the good and ignore or discourage the bad or discourage those who encouraged that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Meanwhile, federal agents are fake setting up fake Facebook pages and people's and real people's names using real people's pictures from their real people's phones.  This is this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess my imposter is a federal agent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That blows me away.  A DEA agent commandeered a woman's identity.  She was arrested, but never convicted of a crime.  She, she, they got her phone.  They took pictures off her phone.  They put them on the fake, some, some fairly sexy pictures on the fake Facebook account.  With, with her child.  With, put pictures of her kids.  Oh my God.  She was apparently sentenced to probation, so she was convicted, but she pled guilty.  While she was awaiting trial, the DEA used this stuff that they had garnered in the investigation to create a Facebook page.  They friended felons.  It was a honey pit, honey pot.  The woman now 28 sued, accusing him in federal district court in New York of violating her privacy and placing her in danger.  The government says, hey, when she was arrested, she gave express permission for the use of photographs contained on her phone.  Simply by granting access to the phone and consending to the use of that information to aid in an ongoing criminal investigation.  Whether she actually knew that they were going to make a fake Facebook pages in dispute.  We'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sure she did not.  I don't think that's what she thought.  I don't think that she imagined that was going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Or pictures of her kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can we just all agree to leave the kids out of it?  Can we just leave the kids out of it?  I kind of feel like say whatever you want about me, Photoshop, me to your heart's content.  Just keep my kid out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that was one of the things Sierra complained about is that her family was dragged into it.  Let's take a break.  We've got to find something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry, that was depressing.  I didn't mean to give you a downer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You, I'm the one who brought it up.  The whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm glad you did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, when I read that, I thought we're talking about that today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm glad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  And I do want to talk a little bit about what you can tell about you from your Facebook likes.  Quite a bit.  And we've got our change log coming up in just a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Google Change Log.  The Google Change Log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This isn't so much more important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And now, ladies and gentlemen, Gina Trapani with the latest from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I've run out of things to complain about regarding Google Voice  because the one thing that I've always complained about,  I think that all of us complain about, the one thing,  this would be a perfect product if is getting resolved.  Google Voice is finally supporting MMS, multimedia messages, baby,  photos in Google Voice across 100 different North American carriers.  There's a but.  Google's been working with a ton of carriers, including AT&T, Sprint,  T-Mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And as Jeff would say, a really big but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a big red check mark size.  Throw the Vs in a but.  It's a but.  It doesn't work with Verizon.  Ah!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  100 carriers except Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Except Verizon, which is a big except, unfortunately.  But you know, so you'll get many MMS messages, not all of them,  which is an improvement.  I mean, before you got none.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, good.  You won't go over your bandwidth limits on Verizon then.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe it's a bit spotty.  What is with Verizon?  What is with them?  All right, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm going to save that rant for Jeff.  Yeah.  But we want to feed the fire a little bit more.  T-Mobile.  The Verizon fire.  T-Mobile.  A little update to Google Play, especially movies.  You can now pre-order movies on Google Play.  So this features only be available in the US.  And although other countries will be added soon, Google says,  it means that if you see a title that's going to come out on Google Play,  you can pre-order it.  And you don't get charged until it gets released.  And you get an email letting you know that the movie then is in your library.  So they're going to be shooting to offer things for pre-order  that are in theaters now.  So this should hopefully go soon.  You know what I want next, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What?  Here's what I want next.  When there's some obscure, because I live way out in the suburbs,  when there is some obscure foreign movie that I'm interested in,  that I'm never going to go into Manhattan to watch  because I leave Manhattan to come home,  and if it's not going to be out on video for nine months,  I want to bookmark that in Google Play.  So when it comes out, it says, hello, Bozo, it's here.  You're a stupid, boring foreign movie.  And then that's actually useful.  So next step, Google.  We're never saying that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My tastes are much less intellectual than yours.  But there'll be times when I'll be like, what's the next Hunger Games movie?  Just do a Google search for the next Hunger Games movie.  And sometimes there'll be that remind me buttons.  I'll say, OK, yeah, remind me.  They always come out in November.  And then it's exciting because whatever the weekend in November,  it gets released.  It'll let you know.  I don't know if that will work with the not huge blockbuster movies, though.  I don't know if it'll work for your indie foreign films.  But that should work for every movie, honestly.  Let's see.  What else do we have?  Oh, so Google Now can now surface your past and upcoming bills  from your Gmail account.  Google Play.  Drive people.  What?  They know my bills?  How could they possibly?  Yeah, the Google app for Android and iOS now has access to your Gmail account  because you gave it access to your Gmail account.  And if you get email with a pay to do and an amount information about a bill,  that's creepy.  You'll get a card in Google Now letting you know, I need help.  Well, sometimes I love this.  I automate everything.  But every once in a while, there's that month where something happens  and I just don't have enough money.  So I'll take it.  I'll take whatever reminders I can.  I think the next step is to pay my bills, Google.  Just do it.  Just pay it.  Move the money.  Do what you got to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do whatever it takes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I had a thousand great reasons to get married.  But number one was my wife handles my bills now because I was awful at them.  You got yourself a CEO as a girlfriend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me tell you, nothing like it.  Everybody should have somebody who understands money in their life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who does the money stuff in your house, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I actually really enjoy the personal finance stuff.  So I thought you'd be the one.  Yeah, me too.  Yeah, I enjoy organizing those things.  She can do arithmetic.  I'm not as good at it as Lisa.  So good job, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, anybody's better than me.  Have you ever had your water or your electricity turned off because you  forgot to pay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  No.  OK.  Yes.  Many times.  Oh, you had plenty of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it's not that I didn't have the money.  I forgot to pay for months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or you said, oh, I'll do it tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just I don't know.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who's thinking about your water bill until you don't have water?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's they get your attention when the water stops.  And then you have to go down and say, I'm sorry, here's the money.  Please turn my water on.  Well, send a guy out on Monday.  But it's Friday.  That's when they work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do I pretty much automate everything.  But every once in a while, I get like, oh, I have to transfer some money.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was using a service called PayTrust.  I don't know if there's still I know there's still around because I still  pay him 10 bucks a month for nothing.  But they used to where they were in Sioux City or Sioux Falls, Idaho.  And I and I was I thought, why are they there?  And then I realized because there's a big prison there.  And all my bills were going to this prison.  And being entered by prisoners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, my. What could possibly go wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What could go wrong?  Anyway, so reminders about your bills, so the Leo's water never gets turned off.  Thank you, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't have a lease.  At least you've got a Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, if you don't have Lisa, you have Google now.  I don't know. Google now will never be as good as Lisa, but we're getting there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's amazing. Never misses a bill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A little update to Chromecast.  I know I think Jeff was kind of making fun of this a little bit last time.  I think we talked about this a while ago that it was on its way.  You can basically set the images that your Chromecast shows,  kind of like a screen saver or a slideshow.  It already shows gorgeous pictures.  It does. It shows some gorgeous pictures.  But now you can customize them to be your own photos, your own photo, photo albums  from Google Plus, or you can choose artwork from galleries and museums  via the Google Cultural Institute.  You can choose news and lifestyle images from the New York Times, the Guardian  and the US, or you can choose.  I like this one. Satellite imagery is the hardest to reach places on Earth  from Google Maps. I like a good Maps slideshow.  So in order to do that in your Chromecast app,  open the Chromecast app on your phone or tablet and select backdrop  from the left the left menu, and then you can choose what images you want to see.  And Jeff, I see you just added something to the change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just added something because I don't understand something.  So somebody on Twitter, who was it here?  The nice person on Twitter, Blakenship, I think it was Brian Blakenship, said  there was an update to Chromebook update makes it easy to juggle multiple accounts.  And Brian said, we'll let Jeff Jarvis be the judge of his easy functionality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they've always been able to do that. I understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know if this is new about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When you when you first turn on your Chromebook, it shows you the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's not easy.  You should be able to go back and forth within one account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe that's what they can do.  I just log into my account or there's a guest account or you can have other accounts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I horn my way into the change log here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm glad you did. A handful of Chromebook features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A SAML standard. Do you have any idea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Asmol. The enhanced identity features primarily focused on enabling the SAML  standard used by common enterprise.  That's why I don't know what it is.  It's enterprise. Enterprise authorization providers.  So it sounds like this is a way for you to switch between your personal account  and your organization's, you know, your sort of your Google for work  account easily using that enterprise standard.  I actually don't know what SAML is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Something so I'm something security authorization markup language.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There you go. Oh, of course, it's a markup language.  It's a normal. It's a mall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Special security assertion markup language.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Enables users to bring their own Chromebooks to the office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I bet you it means you could authenticate with some.  If you click on the link on the bottom of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a link to the single sign on solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, right, right. More more manageable for IT.  OK, so they're trying to bring in.  They want to bring Chromebooks in the enterprise.  It's already using. Yeah, it's enterprise.  Google sign on. Yeah, enterprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. Never mind. Never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's neat. Yeah, that counts.  It's a change. It counts. Thank you. Thank you, Jeff.  All right. Right.  That's all I got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is the Google change log.  Thank you, Gina Trippani.  So how much does Facebook really know about you?  A study by researchers at the University of Cambridge  gathered data from 60,000 Facebook users  and with their likes alone,  predicted a variety of personal traits,  including gender, religion, sexual orientation  and substance abuse.  So I thought I'd, I thought I'd try this.  The article in Slate talking about this  explains something kind of weird.  If you like curly fries, you're likely to be intelligent.  And that seems counterintuitive since those things  will kill you.  But it turns out that people swim in packs.  And so at some point, somebody who was really smart  did a like on curly fries  and their equivalently smart friends,  because smart people seem to like each other,  were influenced by that.  They liked curly fries.  And this is an actual signal.  And eventually enough smart people liked curly fries  that it seems more likely that if you like curly fries,  you'll be smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Huh?  Well, I would say Facebook doesn't know about me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, let me see, because I ran the program.  This is, they have two, they have two versions of this.  There's one called youarewhatyoulike.com  and there's one called applymagicsauce.com.  They're both from Cambridge.  Applymagicsauce gives you a JSON feed of your traits,  but which you can parse, you know, in your brain.  But this one, this one is a little bit easier.  So apparently I am conservative and traditional,  not liberal and artistic.  Same here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That seems wrong to me.  It's way wrong.  And it says, by the way, that I am  because one of my conservative traditional friends  is Chris Hughes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I've made the mistake  of befriending some Republicans.  There's my problem right there.  By the way, Alex Gumpel,  you're my most liberal and artistic friend,  as is Will Harris.  How about that, huh?  You're very liberal and artistic.  Did you know that, Alex?  Based on your likes.  I am well organized.  Apparently Facebook does not know about those bills.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We just argued against that, didn't we?  We can't even do our bills.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am not spontaneous and flexible.  I am shy and reserved.  Yeah, but you notice these aren't overwhelming percentages  one way or the other.  So it's not a strong signal, right?  And also how I use Facebook  may not reflect my real personality.  I am assertive and competitive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gina, don't go do this.  You're gonna be the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're all the same.  Cause we would be because we're in a cohort.  Yeah, it's true.  We're in a cohort.  Calm and relaxed as opposed to emotional.  Well, I'm not.  Really?  What a shock.  My most calm and relaxed friends are  Kevin Rose and Steve Wozniak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just so right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Personality twins, Jeff Jarvis, you showed up.  Nice.  And David Pogue, I think.  Jeff Jarvis, David Pogue, Carly Perkins, who works for us.  Martin Sargent from Tech TV  and Jenny Moyer, who's a friend.  And then my opposite, Alex Gumpel, well, look at him.  Dan Farber of CNET, Kevin Rose, wait a minute.  He's my opposite.  So this is very interesting.  My one click, I don't find this very accurate.  My twin, Randy Zuckerberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who is your?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Randy Zuckerberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is who you are?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My personality twin, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't use Facebook so much,  but I really liked analyzewords.com, which looks at Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, you do, in fact, I saw you and,  or somebody and Anil talking about  whether you're analytics or not at Thinker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what should it, analyzewords, was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, analyzewords.com.  You pop in your Twitter handle  and it tells you, it kind of gives you,  it does a personality analysis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This stuff is very close to astrology, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It says that I'm very upbeat, I'm very worried,  and I'm a little bit angry and not so depressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, on Twitter, I'm extremely angry.  And extremely upbeat.  I'm highly plugged in, highly personable.  I am only an average Spacey Valley girl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think I got high on Spacey Valley girl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think this is so, and apparently my thinking style  is very high for analytic, that's the strongest signal.  And look at all the tweets that's analyzed.  Then you can analyze a friend and compare yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  I'm plugged in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you are.  Let me compare myself to InfoSec Taylor Swift.  She's very angry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we were having this discussion  about whether or not ThinkUp is analytics.  I mean, certainly it is, but we were talking more  about how that really, that turns off,  because it's a consumer product, but it's called analytics.  There's like some dissonance there, right?  Because John Gruber actually said,  when you say social analytics, I hear tool for D-bags.  Yeah.  Which I think is like,  it's like one step above SEO.  Yeah, exactly.  Right, and he compared it to SEO.  Exactly.  And he said that there's plenty of good worthwhile SEO,  but the word has become so sullied at this point,  and that's happened to analytics.  And we've had a really hard time explaining what ThinkUp is.  It's like, no, it's not an analytics dashboard  that a brand with a CMO is going to use.  It's for regular people, but regular people  aren't asking for, looking for, or relate to analytics.  So yeah, we changed our tagline to daily insights  about you and your friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Insights are better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it isn't exactly analytics,  because it's not analytical in that sense.  I mean, you don't get a graph or anything.  It's just like little insights, little nuggets.  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  I have more followers than 89% of the people I follow.  That's kind of an, that's a new one.  You just added that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is a new one, yeah.  So a 2,000 of your friends would-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Would reach a bigger audience if I retweeted them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And for some reason, I reply to that guy a lot.  I don't even know who he is.  Probably a troll.  And here's the-  What was your percentage, Leo?  Huh?  What was your percentage?  89%, I have more followers than 89% of the people I follow.  Yeah, that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Huh.  That must've been-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was probably the 20th anniversary of John Lennon's killing.  That must've been.  I would guess.  That must've been it.  Or 30th.  Yeah, it would've been 30th, holy cow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, wow.  Anyway.  Anyway.  I just learned from Gina that I'm ready for Hillary  is following me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not that John Locke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was just-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like it.  So more news from the, more bizarre news  from the HTC announcement.  They have announced a new camera called the HTC Re,  I kid you not.  This is a little black plastic periscope,  kind of a GoPro, $199.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They make a point of saying,  if you're gonna climb a mountain, you use the GoPro.  This is just for you nebishes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, if you don't ride crazy bicycles off,  it's a strange form factor.  They're-  What do you do with that?  You tap the button on the back to take a still,  you long press it to record a video in 1080p,  or you front press the button on the device  to record it slow-mo.  So it's a very simple UI.  There's no viewfinder.  I don't know how you then get,  oh, the camera can automatically back up  to Google Drive Dropbox or your phone  when you're connected to wifi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The camera connects to wifi,  or the camera can see your phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you're gonna see, this is an internet of things play.  You're gonna see more and more of this stuff  where this stuff sits on a network,  and then the intelligence is not in the camera,  it's in the phone,  and then they're both on the same network,  and then the phone goes, oh, I see my Re,  and let me send the pictures to Dropbox or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I still contend you're gonna end up wearing your computer.  It's gonna be that big,  and you're gonna have one computer  with a great battery,  and it's gonna talk to peripherals,  and everything else in life becomes a peripheral computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wanna replace my spleen with a computer.  Can I do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who needs a spleen anyway?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't need the spleen.  It's just kinda-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why do I have to vent it all the time then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're venting your spleen again, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know what that means.  I don't wanna ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, don't.  It's not, it's-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's okay, Gina, it's okay, it's okay.  It's okay.  You ever heard that phrase?  It's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's venting his spleen.  It just means you're-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, okay, it's a phrase, okay.  It's ranting.  I was worried that it was a Jeff medical procedure.  I wasn't sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not one of those prostate moments, don't worry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you know, now that you've raised that,  we could go down there, but we won't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, vent your spleen, Google tells me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So-  Figurative.  James Frye, or is it Frey?  How do you pronounce his name?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I think it's Frye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fryer Frey.  Spelled Frey.  I liked his novel, which was a million little pieces.  Was that what it was called?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, he's the dude that made up a bunch of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he got, it was a really good,  well, it was supposed to be a memoir,  but it really was just a novel.  And so for some reason,  I don't really understand he got in trouble for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, because he, Oprah loved him,  and he came on Oprah, and then he had to go back on Oprah  and get beat up by Oprah because he lied to Oprah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you know what?  It was a really good novel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He just, he went with the marketing part  around it being a memoir, right?  He didn't direct anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess he's rehabilitated now  because Google's working with him on a project,  which will combine, this is all,  what do they call it, transmedia.  It combines interactive novels  with augmented reality games.  This is the next step for Ingress.  By the way, we have a bunch of Ingress devotees around here.  How many miles have you walked, Jeff, on Ingress?  Like he said, he said,  I've lost 173 pounds or something.  Wow.  It's always in kilometers, so he never knows.  We don't know, it's kilometers.  How many kilometers?  91 in the last couple of weeks.  He's done 91 kilometers in the last couple of weeks.  91 this month.  He's doing that stupid game  where you try to take over post offices and IHOPs.  Anyway, so the next thing is going to be end game,  The Calling, augmented reality interactive game.  The idea is to build a whole world around these novels.  So they're gonna have puzzles,  but I guess they'll be in the real world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The video right there, she is not a good actress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Transcript:  Dad was right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's acting right now.  Oh boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't want to believe him, but he was right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The world has been mutating.  The last 10,000 years, the world has been mutating.  Is it the actor or is it the script, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Unrecognizable.  It's broken.  They found each other.  He was always telling me,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  he was always telling me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, I can't watch anymore.  What is gonna happen?  She's really, I'm sure she's mad.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sure she's very nice and she got a big,  she's about as lucky as the runway models on the.  Wait, what she's doing is hard though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, she's just, she's.  It's hard, I agree.  It's a terrible script  and she's trying to make it real in a camera.  And there's like five Google guys looking at her.  Yeah.  So it's hard.  It's hard.  She needs a James Cameron to come in there  and work with her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's hard to say that the world is metamorphosizing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I wouldn't wanna be in that.  I would be just as bad as that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they have a site.  Niantic Labs.  Like they just do anything until you buy the book.  Yeah.  When you buy the book, it's very unclear to me  what actually happens here and what you get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  This is a Niantic project.  It's something called the Jarvis Resurrection.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's click on this and see.  Parting words number five.  That means I'm dead.  Thank you very much.  Wait a minute.  The Jarvis virus.  What the hell is that?  It turns all the blue ones green.  It's very rare.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, wait a minute.  Bring it back.  Bring back the Jarvis virus.  There it is.  The Google guys, they have something with the word,  the name Jarvis, don't they?  No, it's not me.  It's cause of Iron Man?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's Iron Man, right?  It's Iron Man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's nothing.  Okay, she's still talking, but now she's stopped.  And now it's ancient societies.  I don't know what it means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The world is changing.  It's mutating.  Dad was right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Dad was right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anything else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was an unlikeable person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you read Mr. Schmitt's new book?  I started it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And?  I went to speak at Google and all I got was  it was a sticky book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How Google Works, Eric Schmitt and Jonathan Rosenberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's very much a management-y book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not my thing.  That's the thing.  If they would actually say how Google works,  I would read that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Larry's, don't look up Larry's prelude.  What am I trying to say?  Forward is good.  Is forward?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does he actually talk about,  I mean, is it just celebrating all the awesomeness  that Google is or does he,  are there any lessons learned?  Are there any failures?  Were they, you know, what they came out of it?  Or is it just, is this just about how great Google is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do you get creative people?  No, it's more presumption.  Once, because you want to be us,  you might ask, what would we do?  It's been done.  This is how you can do that.  This is how you hire really smart people.  This is how you do, you know, like, like, like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's chapters called culture, strategy, talent,  decisions, communications, innovation.  The funny thing is the Wall Street Journal  assigned Stephen Sinovsky,  the failed architect of Windows 8 to the review.  And now we know what Sinovsky's been up to.  It's actually the shortest thing Sinovsky's ever written.  He must've had somebody really edit it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me go to the Larry, I've got it here.  Cause they did a half price deal  if you pre-ordered it on play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I bought it.  And then I got a pre-ordered.  That's not nice to remainder a book  before it even comes out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if you go by the way, Jonathan Rosenberg's,  or no, Eric Schmidt's Google plus feed,  he has a really funny cartoon.  All right, all right.  I'm up for that.  I'm trying to find the visiting thing.  Here's your Larry says,  over time I've learned surprisingly  that it's tremendously hard  to get teams to be super ambitious.  It turns out most people haven't been educated  in this kind of moonshot thinking.  They tend to assume that things are impossible  rather than starting from real world physics  and figuring out what's actually possible.  It's why we put so much energy  into hiring independent thinkers at Google  and setting big goals.  Because if you hire the right people  and have big enough dreams,  you'll usually get there.  I envision this kind of grin now.  And even if you fail,  you'll probably learn something important.  All right, I'm bored.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's Larry.  Moving along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would like them to hire creative thinkers  who come up with a word other than moonshot.  Yeah.  Can we make that happen?  Yeah.  I'm tired of hearing moonshot.  Let's come up with a different word.  I want to hire a creative thinker

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  who can figure out how to do multiple accounts.  Oh, that.  I yelled when I spoke at Google last week  at the work work group.  I said, I'm going to start there.  I'm going to break you people.  I want multiple accounts to work well  and it doesn't work well.  I'm pissed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What was their response?  Did they look at their shoes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess that's why they made the announcement today.  I must work.  Did you also see, interesting too, I think, Leo,  is similar to the end game thing,  is Google doing cross media, cross platform marketing  for the movie Interstellar.  And this starts to show how Google Plus  becomes a monetizable thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ah, a little, so not an ad, but native content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Interstellar.withgoogle.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Interstellar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Withgoogle.com.  There's a good title.  There's a story of there too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they're.  So this is transmedia.  The idea of transmedia, Lucas is a perfect example,  is you have a world, a universe,  like the Star Wars universe,  but you give people a variety of ways  to get involved with it.  Not just watching the movie,  not just reading a comic book or a novelization,  but also action figures, video games,  Lego pieces, whatever you can think of  that will get people introduced to the world.  And then of course they consume the rest of it.  So what do I do?  Launch Space Hunt.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm gonna let you do this.  I'm gonna watch you do it.  What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now what?  Here we are at Saturn.  Distance from the earth is a lot.  If you had to walk here in Ingress,  Star HD 11506 identified the universe.  Oh, and now I can download this.  This is like wallpaper.  It is.  So is this gonna be a movie, Interstellar?  Yes.  So now it's just by doing this,  it's convinced me to download this crappy wallpaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Those days we had wallpaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wallpaper.  Wait a minute, back to the moon.  What's this?  That's not the moon, Leo.  Back to the Death Star.  The universe is always expanding.  Keep searching.  Jupiter's red spot is actually a massive high pressure storm.  It's been going on for hundreds of years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh no, not Matthew McConaughey.  I cannot abide him.  Have you seen his Cadillac commercials?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That commercial, no, it's not a Cadillac.  It's a Lincoln.  What about Cadillac?  It's a Lincoln.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See how effective it is?  Oh my Lord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is a little bit of an annoying commercial.  I loved him in True Detective.  I think he's a good actor.  But he is kind of an annoying person.  I don't know what this is.  And this is, companies, every 10 years  that companies come back to this  will make this mysterious puzzle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You wanna immerse yourself in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'll immerse yourselves in,  and then we can sneak ads onto your system.  I mean, remember the BMW ad  that was at the very bottom of the page?  Yeah.  And you'd say, what is this strange thing?  And you'd click it.  This has been going on since the internet was invented.  Now I can hear the golden record.  So some of this is real content.  Oh, well, just push me to YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just, for this warning,  they said, come on, you can,  you know, you can tell you about the good.  We would always put a line.  I wish to extend greetings and friendly wishes  to all of you.  And receive this message.  The sounds of earth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who not come to earth, it is very boring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the time this, by the time Veger exited the galaxy,  we no longer were using vinyl records,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so we should have sent a CD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm a member of the committee on outer space,  and we believe, say, this committee,  good for we.  My dear friends in outer space,  as you probably know,  my country is situated in the west coast  of the continent of Africa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think they know that.  I don't think they know that.  Otherwise, yeah.  What's the country?  Continent, Africa, what's that?  Samsung 60% profit drop as sales slow.  Yikes.  Yikes.  People are finally catching onto the crap  that is the Galaxy phone series.  Or no, that's mean.  I shouldn't say it that way.  But I feel that way, deep down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We couldn't tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's weird.  I mean, I thought you couldn't stop them.  They were a juggernaut.  They spent more than a billion dollars in ads last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We talked about a little bit last night on all the Android.  They're getting hit by both ends, right?  Their high-end phones are available much cheaper  from new manufacturers, the OnePlus One, for example.  And also, the iPhone, now that you've got a bigger iPhone,  people might be switching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But this happened, oh, well, no, this is a prognostication.  It hasn't happened yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hasn't happened yet.  It is going to happen.  But it's an issue of they're not selling phones.  They're just not selling phones.  Which is amazing, given the amount of marketing  and advertising they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and her tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So my tip of the week is an Android Wear app  that I really like, and I'm actually ripping this off  from Erin Karsten, who was on All About Android last night.  This was his app in the arena.  It's called Wear Mini Launcher.  It's a launcher for all your Wear apps  that you pull over to the side  and you get a grid of icons in order to launch your apps.  So by default on Wear, you have to go to,  okay, Google, and then slide down,  and then go through all these menus,  and then go to More, and it's a bunch of swiping.  And this Wear Mini Launcher actually just,  you swipe in from the left, you get a grid of icons,  you can launch whatever app that you want,  and I use the Stopwatch, I use, I got Flopsy Droid.  Flopsy Droid? What's that?  Yeah, it's like basically Flappy Bird, but for your watch.  I got Google Keep, your settings,  I've got a Baby Lock app, which is really what I needed.  I need to just be able to launch that Baby Lock  as quickly as possible.  Lock it!  Yeah, because the Moto 360 will not have the same fate  as the M8 had.  So yeah, I really, I like it a lot.  If you have Android Wear, check it out.  You know, I sort of, and I have to say,  I'm backtracking here,  I sort of mocked the Apple Watch a little bit,  because I said, oh, look at those grid of icons.  That's crazy, that's stupid.  I gotta say, this is basically a grid of icons  of your third-party apps, but I really like it.  It's a really quick way to just, to launch something  rather than have to go through the regular,  the default rigmarole that's not, you know,  default Google app that's in a card for Google Now.  So that's Wear Mini Launcher,  and it is free in the Play Store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree, and I use it.  Installed, just installed it.  I really like it.  Awesome, cool.  Also, as long as we're talking about Wear stuff,  IntelliCom makes some watch faces,  customizable watch faces, which I really like.  On the Moto 360, it comes with its own  really pretty nice watch faces,  including a dual face that lets you do two times.  But this is from IntelliCom.  You could put the Ferrari logo or the Google logo there.  I actually have an LCD that shows the East Coast time.  I showed this earlier.  Battery life on my watch.  It's free, it's really great.  IntelliCom, I think it's called Wear Faces.  But I like the fact that it's really,  we're starting to see customizations for this.  For instance, you have to download a little program,  but normally if you say take a note,  it goes to Google Keep, but you can have it use Evernote.  I just, Phil Leiband was on this triangulation on Monday.  He told me, it's in the Play Store little Evernote stub  that doesn't even show up as an app on your app launcher,  but somehow modifies Evernote  so that that can be the default note application.  I'd like to see more of those.  That's really great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My watch, by the way, this is the kind of thing that happens.  Yesterday, it just, suddenly I realized,  I haven't had any notifications on it all day.  And I couldn't get it going,  so I had a little mute thing on.  I couldn't figure out how to get it off,  so I had to rebuild the watch.  You slide it, okay, let me just show you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you slide down.  You slide it down.  What, it was?  Okay, so you got the watch face?  Two things to know about with the watch face.  You already know, you double tap it  or just say, okay, Google.  If you press and hold, oops, nevermind.  I wasn't talking to you for this time.  This one time, you press and hold,  you could change the watch face.  I do that, right.  And if you slide down, you can mute or unmute notifications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, nevermind.  Well, now it's not unmuting.  I can't get it to unmute.  Well, that's, I don't know.  There it is, there it is.  Okay, got it, all right, thank you.  Nevermind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually, are you guys liking your Moto 360?  Yeah.  Yeah.  When we were in London, we used it for navigation.  So you can, you know, have Google Maps.  You tell it, you know, navigate to the Tower of London.  And then it will show you an alert.  Okay, Google, navigate home.  It'll show you an alert.  As you get close to the corner, you gotta turn on.  Let me just put my home address in here.  And I'm going to navigate.  You can choose driving, bicycling.  I'll choose walking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Doop, doop, doop, doop, doop, doop, doop, doop, doop, doop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Navigate.  And now what it's going to do is it could calculate the route.  And as you're walking, your wrist'll buzz  when it's time to make a turn.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  North on Taylor Street toward Washington Street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It'll even talk to you.  So it tells you which direction to go.  And then I think this, you guys with glasses,  probably already familiar with this,  but I think that's really a good use for the watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's neat.  That's neat.  At first I was like, wait, do I need to just walk like this,  you know, the whole time?  And no, you-  It buzzes you.  Yeah, you walk the direction you're supposed to go in  and then it buzzes you when you're supposed to turn.  That's really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was great for getting around London  where we didn't know where we were going.  It really worked well.  Your number of the week, Mr. Jeffrey Jarvis.  Right, right, right, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, well, I'm going to be a boring old poof  talking about my favorite topic, the right to be forgotten.  Okay.  Just a little number update here.  So far 135,000 requests representing 470,000 URLs.  This is the new part.  Google has refused 30% of them.  About 50% have been taken down  and the rest required more details.  This comes from a register story  talking about how some Irish people were complaining  that Google didn't do what they wanted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there, so there.  There.  My tool comes from Paul Therotte  on Windows Weekly of all things.  It's a Microsoft product that is kind of cool.  Microsoft Zim, spelled X-I-M, a free download.  It's for Windows Phone or Android.  I put it on my Android.  And you're going to like this.  In fact, if you check your Gmail, Gina,  you might have a Zim invitation from me.  What it does is it allows you to share pictures  and control that share on your phone.  The other person does not need to have Zim installed.  They just need to check the, I can text or email.  And I'm going to create a new Zim.  I can get the Zim from, if you show my phone,  I can choose it from my camera roll.  There it is.  Camera roll, OneDrive, because it's a Microsoft product.  Dropbox, Facebook, Instagram.  I'm going to choose my London slideshow.  These are pictures I took in London.  Select them all.  I'm going to have them go to Gina and Paul  and let's start it.  And now in theory, you don't even have to be  on the same network and you don't have to have Zim installed.  You should get a text and it's web-based.  Oh, let's, I think we picked them.  And now it's started.  And it's web-based.  And so you'll get a link to a website.  And then I control the slideshow.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Isn't that cool?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very cool.  Are you getting it?  Did you get it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm trying to find, I haven't gotten the email.

Transcript:  It would have come to your Gmail.  Maybe I screwed up.  I couldn't get Paul to see it either.  But this is nice because you don't have to hand your phone  around the table.  You can just add your friends.  If they're in your contact list, it's quite easy.  And then you can just show them your pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Weird, I didn't see the email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  Maybe it doesn't work.  It's free to try.  I tried, I searched email.  Maybe I sent, I might have done it to the wrong address.  Oops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Very cool though.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  X-I-M, Microsoft Zim.  All right, that's it.  We're done.  Thank you very much, lady and gentleman.  No, no iOS.  Sorry, folks.  Gina Trapani is at ThinkUp.

Transcript:  And I'm blogging again at my old, old domain,  which is new again, scribbling.net.  Yeah, I'm actually doing the Ohms 30 day blogging challenge  from three days in.  And actually today I got a pass  because my talk from Xoxo got released on YouTube.  So it's now on my blog.  So yeah, I decided smarter wear sounded  too much like underwear.  You got me on that, Leo.  I said that?  This is my new site.  I'm so mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But this is my, yeah, so my Xoxo talk is there on my blog  and I've got a transcript of the talk  if you'd like to read instead of watch.  And yeah, a couple other posts, just little things.  What's going on?  What's scribbling.net?  Yep, that was my first blog ever that I started in 2001.  The domain was anyway.  So going back to old, new, first principles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very cool.  You know, I hadn't mentioned  but we had the with known people on  and I actually set up a with known blog at leoville.net.  I really like this.  The old idea of this is you post on your own site  and then it syndicates it out to Facebook or whatever.  And so I've been posting pictures and stuff.  There's kind of like a tumble log  but what's cool about it is when you do post something  you can have it go out to Twitter, Facebook, Flickr.  And I imagine they will add more in time  and Foursquare, you can even do check-ins  via OpenStreetMap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, I've been seeing your posts  around the different networks  and seeing that they're originating  from the with known site.  And I have to say that they're really,  they look really good.  They look very native.  They don't look like they're syndicated.  Like I really like how you've been,  how it looks like the software works really well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think so.  I mean, it's very early days.  It's an open source project.  But I said, all you need is a lamp server  and you do have to have PHP 5.4, a fairly recent version.  That was a little stumbling block at first.  Thanks to Bear who helped me set that up.  We were able to get that going.  It is primitive.  It's early days.  There's lots of features I'd like to see,  but I like the idea of posting on my site.  The pictures live on my site.  The posts live on my site,  but they get syndicated out to Facebook and Twitter  and Flickr.  And I think that's a good way to do it.  Yeah, very cool.  Mr. Let's see, we're done.  Mr. Jeff Jarvis.  Oh, he's gone.  Well, hi, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
