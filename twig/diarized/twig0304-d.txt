How are you today?  Got the day?  Are you on like a, because you're a professor.  And I spell that P-E-R-F-E-S-S-R.  Since you're a professor, does this mean you get the summer off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, because I have a center.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you profess all year round?  Yes.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Whether you want me to or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Also with us Mike Elgin, the man in charge of tech news tonight.  Our daily dose of tech news every Monday through Friday 10 a.m. Pacific.  Good to have you again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Great to be here. I love this show. It's so nice when I, I always listen to it whether I'm on or not.  And usually when I'm in my kitchen doing the dishes and listening to it.  This saves time.  Well, nobody can hear me when I'm shouting at the, you know, this time I have a microphone and it's much better.  Actually Alexa can hear me now. I have my Amazon Echo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Came yesterday.  So did Kevin.  Oh it did. He's really impressed by it. He's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So mine wasn't supposed to come till like August, but I think Amazon does this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They drop it suddenly. I mean like literally yesterday.  It's on its way. What? And it came.  That's great.  Yeah, it's pretty cool.  I noticed we're not, I mean I already set it up in the kitchen.  It's not like after Michael asked it a few times to tell a joke.  And I asked it to read my audio book and then said, OK, that's great.  And then I said, OK, that's enough.  The daily briefing I played with a little bit. That's kind of cool.  You can say give me my daily briefing and you set that up ahead of time, but it has NPR and other audio news.  Yeah.  That's kind of, it's like the radio.  It's like a radio you can talk to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I guess.  Did it read, did it computerized reading of your book?  No, because it's my Audible book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's Audible.  Amazon owns Audible, so it makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. And that feature is like 24 hours old.  Something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's pretty new.  What I discovered is because I was asking on the shows yesterday, should I use my iOS or my Android device to set up?  Because it works with both.  And then I thought, you know, I wonder if I use a Kindle Fire, if it'll be different.  The Amazon tablet. And it is.  Is it?  The Fire interface is much more elaborate.  Really?  Lots more you can do.  They give you suggestions.  They use the tablet space.  I think it's, yeah, I think it feels like it's, you know, kind of, well, Amazon's going to favor them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're a little bit more experienced now, aren't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  At least.  It's, welcome to the future.  Impressing.  All right.  Let's see what else is going on in the world.  You have a little scooblet, Mr. Mike Elgin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this is, this is actually, this is somebody who addressed this to me.  You're talking about the Google survey around the idea of a Google monthly movie pass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Google movies, you can rent movies, of course, and buy them.  Right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So somebody named Hugo Sejas, or Seyas, got a survey in Google survey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that something you sign up for, the Google opinion rewards?  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And he asked me if I knew if something was being developed.  And the answer is no, I don't.  But it's interesting that somebody is asking about the possibility.  So it looks like a Google monthly movie pass is something they're thinking about.  And I really think this is the future of all streaming and downloading content as we see with Apple Music,  which is that one of their key differentiators is the family plan.  They're always looking for these ways to bundle and discount and so on.  Yeah.  And I think that has everything to do with how they can make, how they can lower prices in turn,  even in a way that's acceptable to the content creators.  Right.  Right.  So presumably Google can go to Hollywood and say, you know, yeah, we'd like to have this  monthly movie pass, which maybe gives you a discount or does this, that and the other thing.  Yeah.  So who knows?  Who knows where they're working?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Who knows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or this guy's just getting trolled.  Who knows?  Well, what's strange is it asks him if he has one, which he couldn't unless there are people who do  and we just don't know about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The great A-B test in the sky.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like it's like, hey, do you have one?  Well, no, I don't.  But where could I get one?  It makes sense.  You know, in fact, that's in a way what Apple announced on Monday is that they're going  to finally, instead of just selling music, they're going to let you stream it kind of  a monthly kind of like Google All Access or Spotify.  Actually, Spotify had a big announcement today.  They are, boy, are they taking off.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What did they say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A hundred?  They have now 20 million paid subscribers.  Now, what's interesting about that is it took them five years to get to the point where  they had 10 million.  And then it took them one year to go from to double that, to go from 10 million to 20  million.  So they've doubled in one year the number of paid streaming subscribers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And something like 100 million now or 80 million total.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, like 75 or something like that.  I believe it's 55 unpaid.  So, yeah, that would be 75 million total, which is a huge number.  And really to have 20 million in this market, it's a very large number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is easily.  I mean, Pandora is the biggest with 100 million users.  I don't know how many paid subscribers they have.  Spotify's number two.  By the way, this came out as part of a raise.  They're raising money.  They just raised another more than half a billion dollars, 526 million dollars.  That basically tells you investors feel like they have the inside track against Apple.  This would be the time that Spotify would try to raise money, but people might be reluctant  to give them money waiting to see what Apple Music does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, now that we've seen what Apple has announced, I think Spotify is in a great position.  I don't think what Apple announces really setting the world on fire.  I saw a lot of shrugs, didn't you?  Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's clear that the only thing that would propel Apple Music forward is just that it's  on every iPhone, that it's on every, I presume, every iPad, that you get three months free.  It's funny, though, the one thing that's really a big differentiator for Apple Music is this  24-hour radio station, which is not exactly innovative.  That's where the DJ they hired from BBC One went.  He'll be coming out of Los Angeles as a DJ, I think, in New York and then one in London.  But that's free.  How do you get that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't have to buy it.  It already was free.  BBC One, they're essentially going to recreate BBC One.  BBC One has been available globally to every single person with an internet connection  for years, and nobody has cared about it.  This is not a differentiator for Apple.  I think it's kind of weird, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The idea of a one-size-fits-all DJ radio station.  It's weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't get it.  I keep thinking that this Connect service is essentially a place for artists to post  all their stuff, their concerts, to interact with fans and so on.  I think that could maybe be a differentiator for Apple, although we don't know what that's  going to look like.  But I can see that for a lot of superfans, if superstars like Lady Gaga and really big  are devoted to the Apple site, to Apple Connect, then I can see a lot of fans going there and  sort of taking away followers from Twitter and places where they're already interacting  with fans.  Yeah, maybe.  Yeah, maybe.  And if anybody can do it, Apple and Jimmy Iovine can do that.  I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But who knows?  People really seem to think a lot of Jimmy Iovine.  I don't.  I feel like he's taken Apple down basically an antiquated road, the old music label way  of doing things.  But down to the point of having a radio station seems very retro, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My brother-in-law is at the Apple WWDC, and he pointed out that they're selling Apple  t-shirts for like 25 bucks.  In other words, Apple makes tons of money on literally every single thing that they  offer in any context.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple is a recording superstar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think what Jimmy Iovine brings to Apple from Apple's point of view is radical profitability  in music.  Whether they can pull it off or not, I don't know.  I think generally speaking, overall, they're hatching a scheme where they're going to make  money not from the streaming, not from downloads, not from any of that stuff, but from other  stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's so funny because Beats One, which is their version, it's almost as if we've invented  radio on the internet.  If you have tune-in radio on your iPhone, you have 30,000 radio stations available right  now.  24-7 global.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The we invented radio on the internet is literally a joke on HBO Silicon Valley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Radio on the internet.  We've invented it.  This is not the Apple show.  We certainly discovered it, discussed it enough on Monday and Tuesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's going on, and there's a few other things in the rundown that I think that Apple  is now attacking the advertising business model.  Flat out attacking the advertising business model in a couple of ways.  That's what Cook's whole screed about privacy is.  Privacy depends upon data to target.  Apple says, well, we don't do that because we never figured out how to do advertising.  But having lost that, they attacked Google that way.  That's number one.  Then number two, I just saw Josh Benton at Neiman, I follow in news, just had a panic  because he saw that in iOS 9 there's ad blocking.  Oh, interesting.  And so I think you see something coming together here where Apple's going to, like a news  corp, say we're going to make our money on finding ways to charge consumers and not dependent  upon advertising.  That's going to be our business differentiation.  Very interesting.  We're going to attack, we're going to use the consumers we have to attack those who  are supported by advertising, which includes not only Google, but also all of media.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep.  Well, but that's so look at if I were Apple putting myself in their shoes, I'd go all  in on that.  That's your differentiator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, that much is OK.  But when you build an ad blocker into your operating system, you're having a huge impact  on the entire media and especially journalism industries.  You're having an impact on society.  Now you can argue that, you know, a fast forward button was built into VCRs.  You know, OK, there's no God given right to force advertising on people.  However, if you kind of make it too easy to block this because people don't like it, then  there's an easy response.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Huge impact.  Just block iOS from your website.  It's like who it's like people complaining about Google News.  Just you don't have to participate.  You say, hey, if you're on iOS, I'm sorry, we can't show you ads.  So we're not going to show you our site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but there's also these these these blackmailing ad blockers.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ad block plus will go to you and say, if you would like to be seen, all you have to do  is pay us some money.  That is racketeering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is just straight up racketeering.  But apparently legal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think it's more complicated because they have a approved ad policy that you can't  have flash in the ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can't have you should if they listen, if they were truly consumers, they wouldn't  charge they wouldn't they wouldn't extort the money out of the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, there's ad block, which there's it.  It's also that's the other thing.  It's a little confusing.  There's there's a business and then there's an open source project.  And actually, I think I'm confusing them.  One of them is I forget which one is.  Is it ad block plus that is pure and ad block?  That's not.  You know, they're competitors.  Ad block plus says used by over 50 million people, a free ad blocker for Chrome ad block  says the number one ad blocker with over 200 million downloads.  At which one?  Which I think ad block plus is the one that has approved.  They did the deal with Google.  They have the approved track where for a small fee, you can get through an ad block.  I believe is the open source one.  But I block plus plus is a program.  I might be wrong on those.  There is certainly that is certainly controversial.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think this is where Apple's headed.  Apple wanted to have an ad model.  They they tried that, but they failed because they don't have the whole world.  Well, we keep ignoring and I'm going to get, you know, Apple fanboys going after me.  But Android's the biggest by far.  Android is where the reach and the volume is and is going to be worldwide.  And so Apple sees that it's not going to be able to kill the ad market.  It's already failed at the ad market.  So why don't why not just attack the ad market?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And the downside for that, the potential downside for Apple is that, in fact,  advertising is a very democratizing form of monetization  simply because it's a it's a it's a transfer of wealth from the people who buy ads to those who don't or can't.  So, you know, who in the world?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me hear that again, because I need to understand that.  Why is why is this democratizing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, so let's say you have somebody who lives who lives in  some country and makes $15 a month.  Yeah. Right.  OK. And and there's a set of four to pay a buck a month.  You're not going to buy any of this stuff, but you can he can use if he can get on the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You get everything you get on Twitter or, you know, Google BuzzFeed or Google Search  is supported by ads to get that for exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the reason you're absolutely right, Mike, and it goes further, too, is that now in a world  where we all have our own websites that can be supported by advertising, then  that's that's doubly democratizing.  Yeah, because it can support more people speaking and you don't you know, you don't just have a  small one percent able to buy the content from a small oligarchy of media,  which is where it heads if we kill advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. But but Apple's going to say, well, it's not our responsibility to preserve media.  It's our responsibility to do what our customers want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but does that mean that means interfering with the business?  When I when I give you a website and say I can give this for free, I do it under  some business rules and I say here's the website, but I have ads with it.  That's the deal. Right.  And Apple is interfering with that.  They're they're they're enabling the changing of the site to do that.  Yeah. And and and that would be like saying I'm going to I'm going to do a service where I'll take  the newspaper and I'll cut out all the ads for you and deliver that to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple is yeah, and Apple's for the global one percenters.  No question about that.  Yes. But for them to suggest that that and that their attack on advertising is somehow  a an ethical issue or something like that.  I mean, Tim Cook makes it like, you know, those evil advertising companies are harvesting  your data. They're doing this bad thing.  We're the good, pure and right people.  No, we're the we're the people who sell really expensive stuff and make a ton of money on stuff  that most of the world can't even dream of affording.  And so we have the luxury.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, kill some people, drive people to suicide, making these things.  But never mind that. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But OK. And I don't every time I get this battle.  I don't need to go on an apple attack. No, no, this is good.  Every time I get no, no, this is a conversation we cannot have too much, I think, on this  network. And there's some we've had it many times.  I've had it with Steve Gibson because he loves ad blockers.  He's concerned about privacy more than almost anybody.  Part of this is the ad industry's fault, right, for making ads that are so horrifically  over the top and annoying.  And the response, by the way, to ad blockers is to make it worse, is not to make it not to  back down. Right.  And being opaque about all the things that were used for targeting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. My my entire argument is that the salvation of the news business is going to have to be  to be more relevant.  That means we have to know people as individuals.  That means we have to have data.  Otherwise known as information about them so we can give them greater relevance.  And when voluntary, there's nothing wrong with that.  But the ad industry and the media industry and the technology industry, all by being  opaque, allowed that to be demonized.  We talked about that on the show many, many times.  The walls, the journals, what do they know?  And now Apple's just playing right into that.  The same as as News Corp has.  And, you know, it's interesting.  We had on our Web page a very, very interesting conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Very kind of odd, eclectic privacy policy at Twitter TV, which I wrote many years ago and  which was somewhat out of date saying, hey, we don't want anything about we don't want  to know anything about you.  And so we're not going to collect anything about you and go on and go on about your business.  That changed over time because we put Google Analytics on there because we do want to know  how much we don't want to know anything about you.  But we do want to know how many people visit our page and stuff.  But Google Analytics then gives Google a kind of a window into our users.  Plus, there's ad banners on our site, which those came later.  And of course, whenever you serve an ad banner, the ad server, whatever it might be.  And I believe it's Google. It's Google.  It's doing that gets information about you, who anybody visits our Web site.  So we got then we got approached by a organization created by the ad industry.  And they said, you have to fix your site and tell people what you're doing or we're going  to report you.  We're going to turn you into the FTC.  And I think that my initial reaction was screw you.  But I think what it really is, is the ad industry responding probably to a consent decree with  the FTC, but maybe not maybe just proactively saying, well, we better get this in.  So when you see that ad choices thing, that's it.  They said you need to have a much better privacy policy that's very clear about what you're  doing. It's so interesting because this came from the ad industry.  And you need to have a link that says ad choices that shows what you can do to opt out.  And it's the industry trying to self-regulate before the government comes in and says, well,  you better you better get your house in order.  So there is some awareness of this.  Yeah. And we spent a lot of time and money, by the way, making that work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And personally, I don't think there's anything wrong with ad blockers when people  choose. I don't like the idea of ad blockers that are enabled by companies as an opt out  kind of thing. But I think that for anybody who wants to opt into an ad blocker, that's  fine. And nobody you know, advertising is not a requirement for you to to listen to  or purchase the things that they're advertising or do any of that stuff.  If you are going to decide in advance, you're not going to buy anything from advertising  and you don't you're not going to read them anyway and you don't care about them and you  don't want to see them. That's fine.  You know, the vast majority of people who get ads served to them are never going to act  on those ads. They're never going to click on them or even look at them.  And so that's just that's fine.  There's nothing wrong with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That even raises the issue of do ads work at all?  Do banner ads work at all?  Does anybody even see him anymore?  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's that's exactly the point.  And I think that's that's right.  But what what what is going to make them work?  Greater relevance. What fuels great relevance data for information.  Exactly. And let's try another on the right or wrong idea here.  What if Apple provided a mechanism and we know the technology exists, we see the jokes  about it. You know, millennials become snake people and said, oh, we're not going to  bother your pretty little head.  We'll create a product that takes out anything that's  Google related.  We'll just take take out, you know, we will take a given publication and give it to you  cleansed of something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we should mention ads, cleanse of content.  That Apple themselves are not making the ad blockers.  They've just made it possible to do on iOS what they're or they're about to make it  possible to do on iOS. What you've been able to do on Safari and Safari.  Yes. And Firefox all along, which is they've enabled that capability for people to  add to Safari for iOS.  So Apple hasn't really taken a stand in there.  I mean, it's kind of.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of like they're saying, well, you can if you want to.  And of course, a user would have to download this, right?  User would have to install it. I don't.  I don't know, I feel like it should be up to the user, but it's the same thing.  I feel like you know what?  This argument is very much like the Napster argument.  I feel like it's it's what we need to do is educate users and viewers and listeners  and readers that this free content is provided to you thanks to our advertisers.  I think our audience knows that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there was a horrible I think it's in the rundown.  There was what I think was I didn't read the whole study, but what I've seen of it, an  awful pen study on advertising.  Oh, where'd it go?  It was in the rundown, wasn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, the group that called us is the Digital Advertising Alliance.  And I I never really quite figured out why they were harassing us.  We did comply because it's the right thing to do.  But my sense is that this is probably funded by the you know, the IAB and the other ad  people saying, well, we better do something here, because if we don't, the government will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Some reason I can't get the comments to work on Erica.  Just here's a story about it.  So there's a there's a pen University of Pennsylvania study by three academics saying,  well, consumers don't like this idea of exchanging data for for for content.  But the way they worded every damn question was so loaded.  You know, do you agree that it's OK to get to discount something if a store you're  allowed the store to monitor you?  You agree it's OK to get content if it's OK for people to take information about you  and you don't know it.  You know, it just it just stacks them, puts the thumb on the scale on the way this is  done. You can you can turn around and say, would you like to have one one hundredth of  the content you have today?  Yeah. Would you like to pay a huge fortune to companies like the music industry has said,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  though, all along as if you keep piracy, pirating music, you're never going to get any.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, fair point.  But I think that the point here is it's trying to argue that along with Cook that all  data is evil, data is bad.  Data is just information and relationships are based on data on information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cook is saying is we want to give you a choice.  Does it feel a choice?  They have a genuine because then the other you know, they say that and then they then  they crow about how many credit card numbers they have.  I mean, yeah, but I think it's I think it's good business for them to say we're in the  favor of privacy. Not everybody is.  Other companies want to use information to tailor ads or whatever.  We don't want to connect that.  They even said on stage on Monday, we don't want to know that.  We don't want to have that information about you.  And that's a perfectly reasonable place for them to be.  And if consumers really want that, that's a compelling sales point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Are you guys familiar with Google contributor?  No, what's that? You know what this is?  I've never heard of this until last night on all that Android.  Ron mentioned it. Basically, it ties directly with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, we talked about a year.  I hadn't heard of this until yesterday.  I was like, what are you talking about?  We talked about it, but this is a very few and limited number of blogs where you can  pay directly for a blog.  Two dollars, five dollars, ten dollars a month.  But the participating sites are very limited.  In fact, right now, people are going to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's also just today, every daily newspaper in Germany signed on with Blendle,  which is a micro payment platform.  The belief in my industry has been that micro payments will save us.  People will just give 10 percent, 20 cents for an article.  It'll all be OK. B.S. never going to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We consider it a paywall early on, and I just didn't.  Oh, you did. Oh, yeah.  We've considered all all forms of monetization.  My initial plan was to be like the modern  a Patreon to be a subscribe, not a forced subscriber, but a voluntary subscriber.  Yeah. Paid donations.  That still kind of lingers on on the website.  And people do give money and a few thousand dollars a month.  And I appreciate that. Thank you.  But we couldn't. But the option of saying having a paywall or we even consider  that sometimes now, maybe we should make certain things  have behind a paywall like chat behind a paywall, which, by the way,  we're not going to do. Don't worry. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's going to kill chat and start a paywall.  Go ahead. Start the rumors now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But A, it is fundamentally undemocratic.  In fact, that was one of the criticisms you had is what about the guy  who a buck a month sounds like nothing to us?  But what about the guys making 15 bucks a month?  That's a very good point. We want we don't want to be undemocratic.  But also when you have a technically sophisticated audience,  any paywall is doomed to failure.  Dignation did that briefly.  They said if you pay, if you donate to Dignation,  we'll give you early access to the show like a week ahead of time.  In fact, they're doing it again.  They're bringing back Dignation.  They're going to do a one off.  And if you donate to it, it's quite expensive.  You can get it ahead of everybody else.  And what happens with a technically literate audience is they immediately say,  Oh, yeah, I'll buy it.  Give it to everybody.  You can't. Suddenly, if you have a paywall, you're in the whack a mole business.  And I don't want to be in the whack a mole business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually think that when you talk about this whole issue of advertising,  contextual advertising, I am bugged by the by the fact that it's an airheaded  conversation to say that contextual advertising or any sort of  personal data collection is bad is to say is like saying drugs are bad.  Well, you know, heroin is bad.  But the Novakane or lidocaine or whatever it is they use to dull  the my teeth before the dentist starts drilling is good.  You know, it's not the data collection is bad.  Is that there's a potential for bad data collection to abuse and sell your personal  data, which could lead to spamming and exposure to all kinds of problems.  And so, you know, some some data collection is is  divorced from the individual.  So they just basically say, OK, we want to know what you're doing,  where you're doing it, how much you're doing it, how much you get paid,  all this stuff. But your name is not associated with it.  And that'll be lumped into a big database with a million other people.  So we know that, you know, this stuff about this large population,  there's absolutely nothing privacy violating about that.  The problem is that we don't have nobody has that conversation.  It's either like, oh, put up ad blocks and we prevent anybody  from knowing anything about us or we give everything away.  And those are not the two choices, actually.  And in fact, Apple is so good at communicating this stuff  because they're collecting all kinds of information and they're keeping it  on the phone. Right.  But there's a lot of that out in the outside of Apple as well.  They didn't invent the idea of giving you the benefits of  of data collection without actually abusing your privacy.  Lots of companies do that, including Google, to a very large extent.  Much of the data collection they do is completely harmless  and does not violate your privacy.  They're just lousy at communicating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google's more honest in some ways. Yeah.  But Apple's more disingenuous about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think no, I think I think Apple.  Apple is I like what I appreciate about what Apple's doing from  from their keynote, actually, on Monday, is that they pointed out that, look,  we are giving you many of the benefits with your iPhone of  location data and all this kind of stuff with with Siri and preemptive,  you know, preemptive notifications, all that kind of stuff.  But it never leaves the phone.  We're not going to take it and put it in a remote database  and share it with anybody and all that kind of stuff.  OK, so everybody who does that sort of thing needs to communicate it  the way Apple did so that we know the difference between  the kind of data collection we want and the kind we don't want. Yeah.  And so if if I would fault Google for anything,  it's their failure to communicate what they're doing with the data  and to sell it to us. I want to be sold on  the benefits of their data collection.  They just say, oh, you know, here's here's our you know,  here's the information, here's your dashboard about all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do that. Right. They say what they've got, what they know.  But you're right. I need to be very clear about how it's used.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But on the rundown somewhere, as I put an economist piece up  where where it's it's oh, the algorithm,  capital T, capital A. Yeah.  And in there, it says I went to Google and I found out what they thought about me  and they were wrong about this and that.  You know, it's just a head targeting man.  It's no great mystery.  There's also a screed on rewrite, read, write, then, I guess, the new read,  write, web reborn rewrite.  I don't know what it is today.  That's the that's the you're showing now.  So the algorithm, which is kind of ridiculous because it  mystifies the algorithm so it can demystify the algorithm.  And, you know, an algorithm is nothing but a formula and data is nothing but information.  And we've we as an industry have allowed all of this to become too priestly  and mysterious. And it's biting us in the ass because we've done this.  Yeah. Now, algorithms are mysterious.  I think I talked about it my visit to to Facebook.  It was it was kind of how do we explain algorithms are just, you know,  a formula to do something nice for you. That's all.  And and I think the priestly cast of geeks made it made it seem so mysterious  that it's really going to be harmful to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and then there's also if you start  blocking ads, then what the other thing that happens,  the unintended consequences is the ads go underground.  In fact, CNN has announced  a new unit.  This is from Fair, Fair.org called Get This Courageous,  which will not report news, but instead will take money from corporations  to produce content that resembles news, but is actually PR.  They're going to.  And this is kind of what The New York Times does with its native content.  Native. It's all. Yeah.  They're going to help companies create CNN like stories  because who was better at that following BuzzFeed's model? Yeah.  But New York Times does it. BuzzFeed does it. Journal does it.  They have native content units and CNN is now going to do this.  And this is my problem is as soon as you start pushing ads  underground, advertisers want to reach you, they're going to reach you.  There's another. They start doing native content or you put Pepsi cans  on this table. And I mean, that's just that's the next thing.  It's going to be everywhere in other ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually don't mind, you know, advertising that is comes  in the form of articles, as long as it's clear, as long as they're not tricking  the consumer, there's nothing wrong with with that sort of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why it works is because it tricks consumers.  If it didn't trick consumers, it'd just be another long ad and nobody'd look at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I talked on the show about how I did a test with the word promoted.  And and 54 percent of the people didn't know what it meant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, CNN says this isn't about confusing editorial with advertising.  This is about telling advertisers stories, telling similar stories,  but clearly labeling and differentiating that this is CNN.  We're not here to blur the lines.  This is exactly what the New York Times lady said.  Remember in that speech we played where no people know the difference.  I think it's apparent the reason advertisers want native content  is because people don't know the difference.  Well, why wouldn't you want it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Always, always wanted this.  We're just so desperate now.  We're selling our soul. We're doing it.  Well, you know, I ran a weekly.  There are advertisers who came in and tried to make a page  look just like editorial elements.  No, no, no, you can't do that.  OK. And they try another thing.  And now we're saying, OK, and here's the price.  We're competing with each other and we're going to commodify even our soul.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's good for me because it means the people who don't do that like us

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  will shine. I hope there's this.  But it also leads. There's this read, write piece I was mentioning,  which is which is the can you spell irony?  It's all about how I hate advertising. Advertising is awful.  But of course, it's brought to you by Disney. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's the unintended consequence consequence that I've never heard  anybody talk about, which I think is around ad blocking,  which I'd love for us to start a conversation about generally  on an ongoing basis.  And it's like, oh, we do talk about it a lot.  Well, it goes like this.  Certain types of people are going to do ad blocking.  Technical people, right.  People who, you know, smart people who are paying attention,  who feel comfortable adding things to their browser, you know,  extensions and so on.  And that skews the the money, frankly, that is in the hands  or that's targeting those kinds of people.  It changes the the basically the nature of theoretically  the nature of the the general mix of companies that are succeeding online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so if you want to know why tech TV went away, I could tell you exactly.  Advertisers, I was told this by a tech TV executive  because I was very much lobbied tech TV's executives to focus on.  I said there's one and a half million programmers in the United States.  That's a tech computer program.  That's enough people to make this a viable channel.  Focus super serve that audience.  And I was told in no uncertain words that the brands don't want this.  They say smart people don't are not seduced by brand advertising.  They don't buy by brand. They're smart.  We don't want smart people.  And so that's to underscore what you're saying.  The people who block ads, the people who are smart, the people who are insightful.  Advertisers already don't want you.  That's why there is no tech TV.  They can't make it financially viable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly. And ad blockers are a direct action, a direct expression of that of that notion.  Let me just give an extreme example.  Let's say the Raspberry Pi people wanted to advertise Raspberry Pi, a wonderful product  that's aimed at a very specific type of person.  And then on the other hand, contrasting with that, you have a sort of snake oil salesman selling a weight loss pill.  OK. What's going to happen is that the type of people who they're going to advertise to  for the Raspberry Pi are going to be using ad blockers.  The ad will be completely ineffective.  The weight loss pill is going to be everywhere.  They're going to make a fortune and the Internet will be overrun with weight loss pills.  And the people who would buy such products and the people who would build a better tomorrow  will never discover the Raspberry Pi because they're using ad blockers.  So it's just it's a it's a the demographic issue needs to be emphasized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you do raise the point, which is also important, which is it's a minuscule number that use ad blocks.  And even in our sophisticated audience, I don't think I think that we probably have a much larger percentage of people  using ad blockers. But that's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right. Chat room, chat room. Fess up.  How many of you use that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How many of you in the chat room? I would say it's a large percent, probably half.  How many people? Yeah, you just just say yes or no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, you use that blocker, don't you know?  Yeah. Yes or no. I have a no. Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So no. Shout it, Pat. No, no.  Me. No. Yes or no. Yes.  I do not know. Yes. It's about 50 50.  I'd say. Well, maybe it's a lot of yeses.  A lot of yeses are coming in a little slower to admit it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, this is this is public.  So I've seen it publicly. But The Guardian,  which has a membership program, went to people who used ad blockers and said,  would you consider, you know, like support in this with membership?  And it was a very good conversion. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's a guy who runs a marketing agency who says, yeah, I use it.  But see, ad blockers don't affect us particularly.  They we have banner ads on their website.  And those are usually we do sell those not for a lot of money.  Most they always go to an existing advertiser.  They're part of an overall ad by the truth is the ads.  And by the way, the new website, the ads are the banners are very much reduced  and very, I think, subtly.  We really wanted to make the new website look good and not be overrun by that.  The ads that work are the ads that we do, the interstitial ads we do.  And it's one of the reasons we do them very differently.  And you know what?  There's no way I could stop somebody from fast forwarding to an ad.  And I bet you. OK, let me ask you that.  How many of you fast forward through our ads?  Oh, yeah, that's the best argument.  And yet I got to say this.  What really happens and I think every podcaster knows this  is that your community is so devoted to what you do that they buy the products  specifically to support you. Right.  Our ads work better for advertisers because of our community.  Well, a lot of our our.  OK, let's not. I'm sorry. I asked that question.  Don't mention that that you skip the ads.  Would you mind keeping that yourself?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I find I find my own behavior being such that with like Howard Stern  and Twitch shows, I get I get I had a part of the content.  Like I want to hear why we do it that way. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And and so, yeah, we we want to incentivize you not to skip them. Right.  And we also want the community  to be loyal to us and love us.  We want to make we want to soup.  We I always take the attitude, let's just super serve the community  and they'll take care of us. Right.  And that's kind of the best way to do it.  And taking care of us, by the way, does not include donating.  I mean, no agenda and other shows that are totally donated.  A donation run are always going to be smaller.  Nobody's going to be able to run an enterprise of this size.  With the 20 shows we do on donations alone, it's just not doable.  If it's a couple of guys in a microphone, maybe. Sure.  So but we're never going to if somebody said,  if ever you block people, use ad blockers, I'll stop listening.  We never would do that. That's not how we work.  In fact, most of you who listen to shows, you download the shows  and you put them on a device of any kind.  We don't we don't in any way limit what devices you use.  And you listen to it. I mean, that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But let's let's go here.  I think a media site may forget paywalls  because what I want to argue to media sites is that you should  you should calculate the value of a reader and act accordingly.  And a once a month reader who comes is valueless.  A person who uses an ad blocker is valueless.  A person who comes off and allows the ads has value.  So I would support I think, you know, what would a media site  lose by blocking ad blockers?  Just saying if you use an ad blocker, sorry, you can't you can't come to our stuff.  I would do it if you do it, do it explicitly.  Yeah, I would. Very much so.  So I'm sorry. This is the deal, folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'll tell you what they would lose, though, Jeff.  You know, a lot of this a long seduction for this kind of thing.  I mean, if if let's say somebody is watching this show  and it's the first show they've ever watched.  And they're they're trying a whole bunch of podcasts  and different types of Internet shows and Internet TV.  And they sort of watch and then they move on and go on and forget about us  for a while and come back in another three months and watch again.  And, you know, to it may take two years before that person is like,  you know what, these shows are fantastic.  I'm going to sign up for all of them.  I'm going to be a loyal person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely. Yes, you're absolutely right.  No, and all I'm doing is making for the sake of the argument  a corollary to the paywall argument, because the exact same thing  you just said about about that is true of paywalls, too.  Now, the argument back is, all right, you do a porous paywall  where you get some sampling.  You're still rewarding the freeloader and penalizing the loyal customer.  But even so, I think you could do a block.  What do you want to call it? A block blocker.  Notice I said B, not C, a block blockers.  And do it in a porous way.  You know, you got OK, folks, here's your first of five pages.  You can get it without ads.  And then we're starving you, man, because F you. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's somebody sent a link in the chat room.  Look at a site.  And this is I don't want to pick on these guys,  but this is a very similar site to a lot of sites.  Extreme Tech, which I think is still as if Davis property.  Yeah, there's a takeover at the top.  That's an ad. Yeah, that's the ad ad ad ad.  There's it's almost all.  Which, by the way, serves their advertisers terribly.  I have to say, I don't I have just skipped through a bunch of ads.  I don't even know what they're for.  I don't. Yeah.  And I think everybody who watches this show knows that we don't even see them.  It's just it's not there's a chunk of our brain that's not that's just not doing it.  Yeah. And I also hate this.  You might also like this has always driven me crazy.  This is out of that junk.  Yeah, that actually annoys me because it's there's an example of trying to trick.  Masquerades, that masquerades is actual content.  And it's not it's advertising content.  And that pisses me off. Yeah.  Chum boxes, that's what it's called, because they're chumming.  I think that's probably what it is called.  There's they're chumming for viewers like you would chum for sharks.  But this is what the consequences is.  And you know why? Why banner ads don't work?  That's why. Yeah, because people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But if you if you this is my argument, though,  if you as long as we keep going to a volume based reach and frequency business,  then we're asked. I agree.  We have to go to a higher value business.  And that it once again requires relevance, requires data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which everybody says, but we don't want to give you data.  We want privacy.  So what's going to happen?  You're making an argument for give up your privacy because the only way to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, but that's no, no, no, no.  You're saying that, I know, to be a host of the show.  And you're going to get to get to twist my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just want people to like me, Jeff.  That's all I do. People are not giving up your privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're not going to be privacy at all. What am I giving up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree, because I use I use all this stuff.  I mean, I use Google now. I use everything.  I don't do everything I want about me. I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I when I buy at Amazon and Amazon stores, what I buy, I'm not giving up my privacy.  Would I use a frequent buyer card at the grocery store?  I'm not giving up my privacy when I use a by my beloved United  Miles and they know exactly where I've gone and they reward me as a result.  I'm not giving up my privacy.  I'm making a transaction and it's a fine transaction.  Giving up your privacy is is is when there's a, you know,  well, this one.  So after after visiting both Facebook and Google and being there at I.O.,  one thing that occurred to me was that in essence, they will always be  two halves of the coin never joined.  Google knows more about  content than anybody else.  Google has this incredible power to be able to analyze your photos  and find golden retrievers.  Facebook knows more about people than anybody else,  but they don't know that much about content.  And as a result, we're kind of safe because no, they can't put the two together.  They're going to compete.  The only entity that can put the two together is the government  when it snoops on both in the Internet. Right.  And that's why that's frightening.  That's that's a true loss of privacy when you do not know what's happening to you.  You have no transaction whatsoever.  You have no control and transparency whatsoever.  And they can tie together information that you, in fact, left siloed  multiple places they pull together.  Government is the threat to your privacy, my friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's true.  Of course, what about people say, well, yeah, but if Google collects all that stuff  and then gets a subpoena from the government, they're going to give it to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Then your problem is with the government and it's subpoena.  Not with Google.  No. And that's the New York Times.  How to cover magazine, how to cover  a cover last week about technology is changing the world.  Really? Oh, I thought that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the Times is on it.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And in the editor's note, the beginning, it just now blithely says  the technology companies willingly cooperated with this.  Right. Which is the opposite of truth.  And it's not true.  And they cooperated with with with subpoenas and with with quiet  warrants that they they didn't have any choice but to cooperate with.  But that's that's just spreading a false meme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To me, the biggest problem with contextual advertising  and the harvesting of all that data is they seem to harvest a lot of data.  But the ads aren't particularly contextual.  Where are all these contextual ads that know exactly what I want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are there recommend that stuff that you already bought?  I guess it's so funny because the preponderance of ads I get as I surf around  is stuff that we advertise for because I've already bought stuff like that.  And it's it's like I already bought it.  Right. It's like Amazon always tells you  if you look at Amazon recommendations to buy stuff you just bought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's literally the least likely product you will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I just bought that. I don't need it. Thank you.  I'm not going to buy two of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, when I talk to some people at certain big California companies  and I said, we need more data and the standard answer is  you and media won't know what to do with it.  Yeah. Yeah. And they're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So really, what you are, Jeff, is kind of the sibil.  You're you're you're inhaling the natural gas and you're saying,  I warn you, this way leads madness.  You shouldn't be doing this. Ad blockers are bad.  You're going to lose all the good content you ever cared about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And killing the killing the I just had blockers killing the market.  Yeah. Killing the ad market by demonizing cookies.  Right. And so on and so on.  What you're going to end up with is a one percent served.  The Wall Street Journal will be fine.  Wall Street Journal keep going forever.  It'll be absolutely OK.  The Financial Times will be fine.  And their magazine called How to Spend It.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sandy, they'll be they'll be a great show.  The Rob report is not going away.  Not going away. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But but someone has Mike said earlier, someone who is poor  and can't afford to buy this content.  Well, there won't even be anything for them to buy because that that will have  fallen apart before there's even an opportunity to spend on that.  So this whole idea that we should just shift away from advertising, advertising  is I want to say it again, is what freed us.  Alan Rusberg drew the now departed editor of The Guardian.  So the advertising freed journalism from ownership and control by political parties.  Advertising is not a bad thing.  It gives us free stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just went to the Rob report and there's an ad takeover by McLaren.  Yeah. Oh, those guys know where to advertise.  And it ain't on Twitter. I can tell you that right now.  Bespoke tailoring at Vestia's new Fifth Avenue Studio.  You don't even care if this is native content, right?  It probably is. Who knows? Who cares?  Finally, a luxury super tank you can call your own.  The Ripsaw EV2, the world's fastest dual tracked all terrain vehicle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, come on, we got to get them as an advertiser.  I'd love I'd love to read that ad on TNT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fellas, you know, you want a tank.  Perhaps you thought you couldn't afford one.  Maybe that used Abrams M1 in your driveway is all you'd ever want.  Oh, now Ralph Lauren eyewear just covered the the tank tank takeovers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, just, you know, one one parting shot  against the old model of advertising and in favor of the new.  If we ever get to the point where we have great contextual advertising  and if it's really great, ads will tell me what I want before I know I want it.  And I'll generally want it and I would just buy it directly.  And I won't have to go to Amazon.com, just buy it from the ad.  And, you know, we're getting there slowly.  That's Google. That is Google's Nirvana. Exactly.  And the opposite of that, if we learn nothing from Mad Men,  we should have learned about the manufacturing desire.  When you have a mass media that's going out to the whole world of every type  of person, male, female, young, old, no matter what they're interested in.  In other words, the old television model, the way you advertise is you tell  you convince people to want things they wouldn't otherwise want.  That's a manufacturing desire.  That's the old TV advertising. Well said.  And the future is when they tell that I tell them what what I want  through my actions, through my interests, through what I do.  And then they give me what I want. That's how it should work.  I just hope that they figure out how to make it work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I've said for years.  We just want to tell people features and benefits of products. Yeah.  Hopefully. And by being niche broadcasting, we have an advantage  because we don't need to gather information on our audience.  We're niche. Same kind of like the Rob report.  The Rob report knows they should advertise, you know, tanks, personal tanks.  Yeah. By the way, this this really looks good.  Yeah. This luxury super tank you can own.  It's a half track. Look at that.  There's nowhere I couldn't go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, oh, I see one coming to Petaluma now.  Visa, I can't believe you could buy this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Moving on from the segue already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, my God, I want it.  My tank will crush your segment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, by the way, it has doors that open like this.  Not doors that open like the doors that open like this for the two comma club.  Is is Silicon is the TV show Silicon Valley going to change our vocabulary?  I think I think it is.  At least among a certain group.  Yeah. Doors that go like I want doors that go like this.  All right. We're going to take a break.  I wish I could sell you doors that go like this.  The new, by the way, the new Tesla.  Yeah. Doors doors that go like that.  Nice. They know what rich people want.  That's right. Our show today brought to you by Zip Recruiter.  If you're in business, you know that getting the right talent, the right.  I call them talent.  The people who work for you, that's your talent.  That's what makes your company sing.  And you get in the right person in there is so important.  That person.  Does it makes your company work.  It makes your company succeed.  But where do you find the right candidates now, thanks to the Internet?  Of course, there's a ton of job sites, so that's a lot easier.  But the problem is, there's a ton of job sites.  So which one do you want?  I mean, everyone has a different kind of slant and so forth.  Here's the key.  Zip Recruiter dot com with one zip recruiter post.  You go to 100 plus job boards, one click.  And you're and by the way, they also have a database of up to date resumes  that people have supplied to them.  They will also, with that same click, match you to candidates  for more than four million resumes.  If you're saying, well, I don't.  That means I'm going to have a lot of applicants.  Don't worry. You don't get emails.  You don't get calls. It all goes into the zip recruiter interface.  So you could quickly rank, rate and hire.  400000 businesses now use zip recruiter.  And it's so sweet.  We used it and I was so pleased you could try it out for free.  Four days free that really four days, believe it or not,  that could be enough to get that right person right now.  They're waiting for you to go to zip recruiter dot com slash twig.  Screen rate and hire the right candidate fast.  Zip recruiter dot com slash twig.  You know, it's such a great thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I think you've got a great you invented a new slogan for zip recruiter.  Make sure your talent has talent talent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You want talented talent. You want untalented talent.  Yeah, we get called talent.  You know, show hosts are called talent.  But I think really anybody who's working in your company,  you should think of them that way. They're the talent. Right.  They're the brains.  They're the the people who make the difference in your company.  I really like that.  That was a line in the latest book about Steve Jobs becoming Steve Jobs.  The author.  Said that Steve Jobs understood that the company was one of the greatest  inventions of the 20th century, or maybe the I guess companies started  in Holland in the 17th century.  But the idea that a group of people would band together with a central purpose  is so powerful.  And instead of seeing Apple as a hierarchy of the boss,  the managers, the employees, the grunts,  he saw it as a group of people with a united goal, a united purpose.  And that's really you could see that in Apple's DNA, can't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can. And and this is that notion is, you know, is something that  is, you know, people who are against unionization,  like the CEO of of Whole Foods, for example, right.  Anti-union would argue that that it's in fact unions that disrupt  the singleness of purpose.  It pits management against.  Well, then the union becomes the purpose instead of the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now we have Gawkers unionized and now we have a whole bunch of writers  from sites are trying to get together and have a big meet all get unionized.  I just started chortling on Twitter.  So fine. So they all go on strike.  See, I'm kind of a union guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know maybe I'm an old progressive. I'm an old line progressive.  I just feel is there's no doubt that in the beginning of the 20th century,  unions saved working persons.  Yep. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was then they became their own their own.  Yeah, maybe. I'm not.  I'm not sure that there aren't industries that need them.  But I do believe that many of the industries that did need them don't anymore  and that they're counterproductive now.  So I think it's kind of an industry by industry thing.  But I think the idea of Gawker employees like, you know, screaming scab  at the people who still want to do blog posts is hilarious to me as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The giant inflatable rat. That's the one I like.  They put you've seen those, Jeff, they're for some reason they're all over New York.  I guess there's a lot of hotel strikes and stuff going on in New York.  Have you seen the DARPA challenge blooper reel?  So the DARPA challenge is so cool.  The it. Whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is almost identical to the Russian police officer drunk blooper reel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what's cool is the DARPA challenge, which has been around for some years,  it was originally about autonomous vehicles.  That's been solved. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I went to the first one.  They were driving off the road like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So now they've changed the challenge and it's kind of cool.  They give you they give these these robots are not remote controlled.  They're they're autonomous.  They have to solve a real world problem.  And some of the problems are supplied at the, you know,  right before the competition begins.  Yeah. So you can't like write a lot of code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm getting empathy for machines here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The kind of apparently the Skynet takeover is a little ways off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm sorry. I shouldn't laugh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you can laugh.  You're right. You shouldn't, Leo, because when they realize that you're laughing at them

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and they can do something about it in 2015, we noticed that you were mocking us.  Yes. We now will take you back behind the studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Remember, our memory is forever.  Show you what we can do now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We never forget the if you want to.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  If you want to know more about the DARPA robotic challenge,  I think it's still going on.  It's the Robotics Challenge dot org.  And what I love about this is the progress that they've made.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you went to the first one.  I went to the first one.  And the starting line was unbelievable.  Just, you know, 90 percent of the field just failed immediately.  There was even they even had a motorcycle.  And all they were trying to do is drive a road.  They were trying to drive in a dirt road, you know, as like as like 10 miles  or something like that.  And the vast majority were just driving up on the edges and falling over  and doing all this kind of stuff.  It was just it was such a difficult problem that now we take it for granted.  That is totally solvable.  And it's not amazing. It's not so long.  What is it? Ten years, 15? Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not so. So actually, it is over.  Robots from the Republic of Korea and the United States won three and a half  million dollars in prizes.  The first place, the two million dollar prize  goes to Team Kaist of Daejeon in the Republic of Korea.  Its robot was DRC Hubo.  Second place, three a million dollars from Pensacola, Florida,  the robot running man.  We really should have been there. Yeah. Next year.  Can we cover this? Yes, let's do that.  Oh, third prize. The next challenge.  So Pittsburgh got the third place, half a million dollar prize  with its robot chimp.  Twenty three teams. You saw the robots. They're big. They're scary.  They look human.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Put an Arnold Schwarzenegger exoskeleton on them and you've got, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Terminator. The the the idea on this one was kind of inspired by the Fukushima  Fukushima earthquake in Japan, the disaster in the nuclear plant  that they actually had to send human, sad human beings into basically

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  why do we assume that the that the form should be human?  Most everything you showed, there's a good reason for that.  Two legs and two arms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Atlas people now owned by Google had a good reason for that.  And that is that the world, the human world is built for humans.  So, you know, if you have a human shaped robot, it can get into a car.  It can it can walk through a door, can go upstairs,  it can do all the things that are built for human beings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you want to hear the challenges?  I don't know if I could do these.  There were eight tasks all related to disaster response.  Oh, it's Fizzhead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that what it's going to sound like to me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, driving a car alone, forget this autonomous vehicle.  They're going to have the robot get in the car.  Now you know why they're human and drive it.  Walking through rubble.  We saw some robots not do that well.  Tripping circuit breaker.  So going up to a circuit breaker, opening the box and flipping the switch,  turning valves, climbing stairs, covering a press conference,  hosting a podcast.  What that shouldn't be on.  No, hopefully they're falling over.  So that's you're asking a good question because I'd like to I'd like to do  the next one and I don't know when the next one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll find out. We'll make sure we cover it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It'd be so great to cover that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really fun. I want to see Leo.  I want to see you interview a robot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's you know, well, OK, well, that's the interesting question.  So in the the original DARPA challenge, it was just driving a car autonomously,  which we solved.  Right. Soon we'll be in them.  This year, it was robots flipping switches, driving cars themselves.  What will it be in 10, 15 years?  What will we be asking those robots to do?  Very human like tasks, I would guess.  Nanny robot nannies, nannies, maybe.  Yeah, there's no reason for them to host talk shows.  Thank God. No, because they wouldn't waste their precious time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've got better things to do.  That'll be the challenge. Come up with a reason to host a talk show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good Lord.  I just so by the way, that video is on the Discovery magazine's website.  And let's see if I could find it for you so I can.  So because I know you want to share this with all your families and friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the Mark and Greason line, too, is the first half of the of the  dialectic is robots or hasn't worked, it's never going to work.  It's just awful. And the next one is robots work too well.  It's going to be a little job.  I think we're getting close to that, frankly.  Yeah. This is a very good story today, which I put up about about how  self-driving trucks are going to hit the auto industry.  Really? I mean, I mean, the trucking industry.  Yeah. Really hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One and a half percent of the workforce works at drive.  At driving, whether it's driving a taxi or driving a truck.  Those people, I think, are threatened in the next decade.  Yeah. Those jobs. That's a lot of jobs. Yep.  This is Discover magazine, not Discovery, the TV network,  the most epic robot fails of the DARPA robotics challenge.  This is my favorite one.  And somebody made a robot standing in the door and just says, I don't know.  I know. I'm sorry. I shouldn't laugh.  I'm in deep trouble.  Me, even that.  Do you want to see the some of the winners?  Yeah. Here is this is the case to the the Korean robot.  The challenge, again, getting in a car and driving it.  I mean, that's kind of mind boggling.  Yeah. That a robot could get in a car and successfully drive it. Right.  There's the robot. I guess.  He's already in the car.  Look, he's holding his hat for some reason.  He's got a hand on his hat.  I have such a headache.  I don't want my hat to fall off.  Look at this. Oh, is he going to hit that?  He's got to go. Oh, see, that's to really pilot it.  Holy cow. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's here's something scary that's also Google related.  We're talking about how I went to the original grand challenge.  It was in 2004.  2004. And Jason, I put it in the rundown.  I colored it pink.  But I searched for DARPA in Google photos and found them.  Yeah. How did your pictures?  How did it recognize the DARPA Grand Challenge using the word DARPA?  As robots are smarter than us already.  Incredible. So these are some of my other way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Robot ride side saddle. Is he going to get out?  Look at that. He does exactly what he's supposed to do.  Again, I want to emphasize this.  There's nobody human remote controlling this robot.  Yeah. That robot did it by himself or itself.  Do you want to see him getting out of the vehicle?  This is fun.  This is the winner. One won a big prize to two million dollars.  I'm sure most of that money was well spent already spent.  Yeah. Before they won it.  So now he has to get out, raises his hand off the wheel.  Turn very careful.  I noticed he rode side saddle.  Why bother getting your legs in there?  I guess, except for the accelerator pedal.  It's not like they're running.  But remember, this is 11 years ago.  Cars were driving off the road.  Yeah.  That's amazing. It's only 11 years.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is why I want to live forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If self-driving cars had robots,  then we'd probably feel more comfortable.  Oh, yeah. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you'd personify him. Johnny Cab.  Yeah, exactly. You're in a Johnny Cab.  Wow. He's grasping the frame.  Yeah.  Remember, this huge computation going on at this point.  There's no they have to figure out where they are, what they're doing,  what they need.  They were not.  They were not given a road map of the vehicle  or where they were going to go ahead of time.  This is all in response to the environmental stimulus, of course.  Otherwise, it's useless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have to make sure they don't flash their underwear to the paparazzi.  It's very complicated computationally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is an antidote. Wow.  Look at this. An antidote to the robots we saw falling over.  Yeah.  You can see why they fell over. This is not easy.  Right. Look at this.  He's good. Yeah.  He bends his knees. Always want to shift.  Oh, my God.  It's not exactly going to chase you like the Terminator, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you can see just those of us who are intuitively familiar  with Moore's law that this would just get faster and more accurate  and point where they'll be able to get out of the car and like faster  than a fraction of a second. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In other words, perfect accuracy.  We only have a little bit. Right.  There's only a little window of opportunity for us.  Meet me. Sex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, we can have our brains transplanted  transplanted into a jar that sits on the robot's body.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I feel like that's a separate track.  I kind of want those track.  Maybe get to do that in parallel, because I feel like one's  getting a little bit ahead of the other at this point.  And I don't feel like the brain container is going to be here in time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look at that.  I want my brain container to have like Oculus Rift, like Lash  to the outside of the jar so that I can just live in virtual reality.  Look how stable that is. Yeah, it's amazing.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  DARPA Grand Challenge. It's over.  There's the winner. There's your winner right there.  His name is Hubo, and he'll be knocking on your door in 15 minutes.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  We're 11 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it was only 11 years ago that these cars are driving off the road.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I've been using a new service that is being tested  in San Francisco called Lux, L-U-X-E.  I can't wait. It's fantastic.  It's fantastic. Look at Hubo got on his knees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know what's going on. He's a Muslim.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's a Muslim. He's going to.  He knows which way he's going to go because he's got built in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why is Hubo? Oh, Hubo rolls.  Oh, son of a gun.  We're in deep trouble, folks.  We are in deep, deep trouble. That's really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But anyway, Lux, for those of you unfamiliar with the services,  it's kind of like Uber, except they use your car instead of theirs.  Basically, what you do is you go to you go to San Francisco.  I'll drive in there.  Parking is hugely expensive.  Really difficult to park. It's expensive.  And so you just go wherever you want.  You say, I'm going to be at this place in about five minutes.  They meet you there.  They are either on a scooter or a skateboard.  They have little blue jackets. Little shirts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Little jackets. I saw a guy hanging out with a blue jacket.  I was there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You just hop in the they just hop in the car and drive your car away  and you do whatever you're going to do.  And then when you want you summon it, just like Uber.  And they come and you they get out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Mike, you know, that one, I don't know, something kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You got to trust the guy in the blue jacket.  Well, that's one part of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it almost seemed like this is  I don't know.  There's some progressive part of me that says this is like taking a homeless guy  and say, hey, just drive my car around till I need it again.  I hope that that's not.  But that's what people think about.  You know, not criticizing.  I'm not criticizing you, Mike.  I imagine myself using this. It makes sense.  But then I'm thinking, what is there?  I can't figure out what it is.  There's something a little off about the concept.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It feels elitist because basically what you're doing is  you're turning the whole city into a into a into a valet parking service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They have their own lots.  Yeah, they will wash your car if you ask them to.  You pay them, of course.  I should have asked them to. Yeah, my car's filthy.  And they are insured.  So if they do run off with your car, you have it or crash it.  Yeah. You know what it is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, I despise valet parking.  I go to California, make fun of it.  I ridicule it. I park around the I despise it.  It's a very California thing to have valet parking.  But here's the best part of Luke's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's but it but it's it makes material sense.  So if you go to New York City and you want to park your car,  it's not arguing with any of that sensibly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a there's a so here's how you get on the valet team.  They say 15 to 25 dollars an hour.  You keep everything you've earned.  That doesn't include tips. I bet you tipped them.  No insurance, gas or hidden fees for you.  Have to jog, scooter or skateboard around San Francisco to meet customers.  Stay in shape as you explore the city.  Well, see, but see, the cool thing is the hourly rate on  Luke's is less than any parking garage in San Francisco.  In fact, you can keep it overnight for an extra 10 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So for twenty five dollars, they'll keep your car for 24 hours,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  which is like 60 or 70 bucks at any hotel in San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But but the point the reason I brought it up is that this service,  obviously these guys are going to be replaced by robots in five years.  The robots are going to come across.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know why? Because autonomous cars are going to eliminate the need for these guys.  That's right. We won't even own vehicles.  It's right now in San Francisco, L.A., Chicago, Seattle and Boston.  I found out about it because our travel guy, Johnny Jet, told me.  And I haven't had a occasion to use it yet, but I plan on it.  This is the uberfication of everything. Yep. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I tell you, this model is going to succeed.  And the reason is it feels so damn good to use it like we, you know, we  I've been to the city and places where you just you can't park.  And it's crowded in this rush hour. And it's just a hassle.  We just want to go to a restaurant, have a nice meal and then leave.  And you just pull up right in front of the door of the restaurant,  get out and just walk into the restaurant.  It's so now here. All right. Here's my question, Mike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So is there going to be a war between valets?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we actually had a war.  My son and I, he came from Silicon Valley.  I came down from Petaluma.  We all had dinner in San Francisco and we set it up to where we put it in  and we push the button at the same time.  We had a race. My guy blew his away by about 10 minutes.  But yeah, your guy was on a skateboard.  You're going to you're going to pull up to a restaurant

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that has its own valet parking.  And instead, you're going to have your valet.  The two of them are going to get into a fight. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then that's why we have a smartphone so we can video  that confrontation, put it on YouTube.  It's part of the circle of life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google announced on Friday that they will start putting accident reports  on their self-driving car blog.  Yeah, they've been, you know, they've been kind of harassed into this.  I think the  originally at a shareholders meeting on Wednesday, Sergey Brin said,  we don't need to reveal accident details.  Nothing can be perfect.  Our goal is to just be better than humans.  On the other hand, they've been getting a lot of pressure  for consumer watchdog and others  that they really need to tell us how reliable these are.  Obviously, currency is always smart. Yeah, you might as well.  It looks like you're hiding something if you don't. Right.  All the accidents they reported so far were the fault of other drivers,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  not the cautious driverless cars or I think at least one case.  It was the Google driver who got in to the driverless car  and decided to drive it himself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Rear end crashes are the most frequent accidents in America.  Not much you can do about that.  I've been rear ended a couple of times, usually from an idiot  looking at his phone, usually a human, always a human.  We've been hit from behind seven times, mainly at traffic lights,  but also on the freeway.  We've been sideswiped a couple of times and hit by a car  rolling through a stop sign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's what we don't know from the reporting that Google has done on accidents.  We don't know how many accidents would have happened  had the driver not taken over control.  So let's say an accident is about to happen.  The driver does what he's supposed to do, takes control of the vehicle  and prevents an accident.  And then no accident happened.  No accident is reported.  And so we don't know how safe...  Right.  There's a big difference between having a professional driver  in the front seat paying attention whose job is to make sure  there's no accident and me snapping in the back of my car  while the car drives itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is at least they've got the transparency.  This is the first report. This was from the month of May.  They tell you a lot.  They've got 23 Lexus SUVs on public streets, mainly Mountain View,  nine prototypes, mostly self-driving on closed test tracks,  one million autonomous miles,  796,000 miles in manual mode,  10,000 autonomous miles a week per a public street.  So this is the report.  You could show this, Jason.  I don't think this is a secret.  Interesting situation of the month.  I'm going to read this every month.  I want to get this is like a newspaper.  Self-driving cars are good at keeping track of multiple moving objects at once.  Skills that were on display in this situation involving two cyclists.  The two red rectangles here.  Let me make this a little bit bigger so you can see it.  Those two red rectangles are cyclists.  The red trails behind them show the path.  So this cyclist is wobbly going from the center lane into the right lane.  This cyclist is going in the opposite direction.  Both the cyclist on the left had entered the left turn lane,  but veered back into our path to continue straight across the intersection.  He changed his mind.  I was going to turn left. I think I'll drive straight.  At the same time, the cyclist on the right entered the intersection,  traveling against the flow of traffic.  The cyclist, that cyclist then took a sudden left turn  coming directly at us in our lane.  Our car was able to predict the cyclist's path of travel.  That's the turquoise line that the car thought the cyclist was going to take,  of course, going right through the car.  So we stopped and yielded.  If this happened at night, it would have been very difficult  for the human driver to see what was unfolding.  They're going to do this every month. I love this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And in other news, we'd like to announce that we're inventing  the self-driving bicycle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think they need it.  Isn't this great that you actually can see the map of data that the cars got?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to know, did it ever, what was it, was it Robbie the Robot or who was the...  Does not compute, does not compute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was, yeah, that's Lost in Space.  Lost in Space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What was his name?  What was the name of the robot?  It was Mr. Smith.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the ultimate moment for the chat room.  Yes. Chat room, the name of the robot and Lost in Space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And every, by the way, here's every accident documented.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So here's what I want to know.  Does the self-driving car ever hit a point of overload and say, does not compute?  I can't, I can't do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's what happened in this one. It just stopped.  It said, you know what? I don't know what these idiots are going to do.  Right. I'm just going to stop and yield.  Yeah, I'm a Darwinian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So let's just let this solve itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Now, that's when they get rear-ended, by the way.  Right, exactly.  Why did you stop in the middle of the street?  There are all the accidents one by one described.  Then they have, this is good, what we've been reading.  The Atlantic City Labs, Google's, the articles about the cars.  This is a little newsletter.  It even has a little graphics describing how we've been doing this month.  That's going to be on the self-driving car page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What I want to know too is, is there like a new monthly challenge?  How do they set the goals?  You know, is, oh, we got to take it into snow.  Yeah, I don't know.  When do they consider it ready?  Bridges and the metal, you know, what are the things that it can't do well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, if I have a choice between the Google self-driving car  and the self-driving car from Delphi Auto Parts, I'm going to take the Google self-driving car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What about the, this is the rundown, what about the Baidu slash BMW  self-driving car?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know about that.  The Baidu self-driving car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why would BMW, I guess BMW doesn't have enough technology,  so it has to go with somebody.  And of course, it can't go with a California technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because Audi already did it.  So if Audi does it, BMW has got to do it.  Apparently, the official name, oh, my God,  the official name of the robot in Lost in Space was Robot B9,  but he was always just referred to as Robot, mostly by Mr. Smith.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the creator, apparently, I'm seeing this,  searching for this, is Robert Kinoshita, who died at the age of 100 this year.  No, really? Yeah, yeah.  He created? He was a TV and film art director, Robert Kinoshita,  and he created the robot.  He came up with the Danger Will Robinson.  Danger, Danger Will Robinson.  And he lived to be 100.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have every one of those robot sound effects from Lost in Space on my other robot.  His lines have outlived him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was someone in the chat room when I asked the question, said, I'm not 60, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's coming.  It's depressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm so depressed.  You wait, you wait, you wait.  Your kids will be saying the same thing about Hodor.  You'll be laughing your head off.  That's right.  Hodor, this, Hodor, that, that.  Criminy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Get into this century.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I saw a guy tweeted a couple of weeks ago saying that his daughter asked him, why do we say hang up the phone?  And he said, I feel like I'm 92.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dial and hang up are both archaic.  Google will not receive transaction fees for Android Pay as Apple does for Apple Pay,  but not because they didn't want to,  but only because rules have been changed.  The card issuers standardized security system means they won't get revenue.  Apple made their deals like a year ago or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the banks were all afraid that they'd miss out on the big opportunity.  And so they allowed themselves to be negotiated into this point where they're paying.  Apple's amazing.  And then by the time Google got around to it, they're like, we're not paying for that.  What are you kidding?  We were locked in for three years with Apple.  But as soon as that's over, we're going to renegotiate.  And you need us.  So, ne ne ne ne ne.  But poor Google went and said, hey, we just want the same deal you have with Apple.  And they're like, no, we don't even want the one we have with Apple.  How often do you hear that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Poor Google.  Everybody wants the deal that Apple has with anything.  Apple is not afraid to exercise its considerable market clout.  And is very good at getting that done.  Oh, by the way, if you're an Android user, don't get all excited about Apple music.  You won't get it till this fall.  Sorry.  I don't understand why, because the Beats app is on Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have to hire some people who know how to program for Android first.  It's Apple's first Android product.  Is it really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is.  They have never done an Android app.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Interesting.  Yeah.  Maybe they'll like it.  They're like, hey, this is great.  We should do more.  That's not going to happen.  They've always been cross-platform with music, though.  iTunes was on Windows very early.  So you can't not do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although Steve Jobs fought it, right?  Basically, his team said, no, Steve, you've got to have a Windows version.  It was good they did, because it only took a few months before the vast majority of iPod  buyers were Windows users, not Macintosh users.  But they didn't learn that lesson, in a way, did they?  No.  Look, it's so important to Apple that Apple Music succeed, I think, that they should have  really had the Android version ready.  I don't...  We're talking about developing an app for Twitch using our API.  It does take a while.  The developers we've been talking to, it'll say it'll be about $80,000, and it will be  ready at Christmas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you know what, Leo?  I'll bet some great fan will beat them to it and do a better job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Perhaps.  I know some great fan will beat them to it.  Dmitri Ilyalan, who wrote the Windows Phone version, has already said, I'm going to do  a Windows version, a universal Windows version, Windows 10, Windows Phone, Xbox One version.  I'm going to open source it.  And I bet Dmitri's typing right now, aren't you, Dmitri?  We gave him access to the API.  The new website was supposed to launch tomorrow.  I'm knowing there's some hiccups, not our fault, not 4kitchen's fault, but with some  server certs and stuff.  But when it launches, there will be a public API that will launch with it.  And I get a lot of requests from our audience.  For instance, the number one request that we get that we do not fulfill, why don't you  have your RSS feeds include every show you've ever done?  Which is, I think, in my opinion, a fundamental misunderstanding what RSS is.  The feeds are supposed to tell you there's a new show.  In fact, there are people like this in American life, the feed has one show in it.  Well, but it's the poor man's API.  But that's what they've got, right, is the feed.  So they're saying, well, can you give us a feed with all 511 Security Now shows?  It would cost us so much money because the feed file would be one and a half megabytes.  Most podcast clients check every hour to see if there's an update because really what the  feed's about is what's the new show.  And we have 70,000 downloaders or subscribers on Security Now.  So 70,000 megabytes, no, I'm sorry, 105,000 megabytes an hour.  That's 100 terabytes an hour every hour of every day would kill, would be out of business.  But the new API, so what I want to do, and I think we'll do this, is I want to create a page,  a snippets page on our Wiki with little program snippets.  The new API would make it trivial to write a little program in Python or Ruby or whatever.  They would just say, download all Security Nows.  And then you go for a cup of coffee and then you're going to have all the shows.  So that's how we're going to fulfill that request.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We shouldn't recommend that people do that because that's going to be huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, if somebody really, people, for some reason that's the one show.  Nobody says, can I have every episode of Twig?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or tech news. I want to know what the breaking news was two years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, nobody cares. But Security Now is really about teaching you about computers and security.  A lot of schools use it, professors use it in classes and so forth.  You talked me into it. I want them all.  Yeah, you should have them all.  What we should really do is sell a DVD set.  Or just ask the NSA, that's right.  Any other stories here? Google's now on tap. Finds in-app answers.  We talked about that before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think, have you played with the new touch to search feature in mobile Chrome?  No, is it already out?  It's out. I have it.  So when I go to a web page where your name is on it,  tap on your name and hold down and it pulls up a search request based on that.  Wow.  In context, see if it works for you in Android.  Do you have an Android phone with you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I'm so embarrassed. Mike and I are both using iPhones.  Oh, I'm ashamed of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Out! I'm taking over the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It looked pretty fickle of me to have an Android phone and an Android Wear watch during Twig,  but wear an iPhone and an Apple Watch during MacBreak Weekly.  I need to be consistent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mr. Howell, do you have an Android phone? I know you do.  I might.  Let's take over the show, Jason. Just turn off their cameras.  It's yours and mine now.  Oh, Lord.  Danger Leopold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Warning!  I've actually rapidly come to the conclusion that smart watches in general,  and the Apple Watch specifically, are dopey.  And I don't want to wear them anymore, but I feel like I can't really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll get to that in a second.  So, Jason, is it working for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what I'm trying to do right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, what do you do?  Describe this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How do you do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's okay. So, it's working.  What's he supposed to do, Jeff?  All you basically...  It's hard to show, but basically I selected Spotify and the wall of text,  and down at the bottom is this little contextual thing that rose up.  So I can scroll up on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's the Now on Tap.  And that's search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So on a web page, all you do is mark a word and it will create a search query.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right there.  It's wonderful.  Apple can't do that.  Well, here's something you can do on Apple that is actually a Google feature.  It's the location-based search, and it includes voice search.  This is amazing. Check this out.  I'm going to do a Google Now voice search.  This is the coolest thing.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay, so here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is the address of this place?  Which place did you mean?  And it's giving me three of the things in the neighborhood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, because it doesn't know exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we'll get to the...  Okay, so it's giving me the address of Twitter.  Now check this out.  Now I'm going to go back to the search, and now I've told it where I am.  It knows where you are.  What is the phone number of this place?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It doesn't say it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because you don't have a phone.  Because you don't have a phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.  So basically, it takes the location.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the right phone number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and so this is fantastic.  I didn't even know you had a phone number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nobody answers it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't get me wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You'll get my voice saying, what do you want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now that also works with landmarks.  So say you're outside Koi Tower and you actually don't know what Koi Tower is.  You can say, what is this place in front of me?  And it'll say, that's Koi Tower.  So it'll identify.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So is that kind of now on tap, early release?  Because now on tap, because Chris is going to do Google Now now.  It's context.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the power of context.  Which, by the way, is data.  It's privacy.  It knows you're in Koi Tower.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh.  Well, I can't wait.  That's exciting.  Also, Android TV.  I bought the Nvidia Shield Android TV, installed it in my home.  I like it.  It's a little...  It didn't come with Netflix.  It doesn't have Amazon, which bugs me.  But it does have Hulu.  Google Music, I can play through my stereo because it's part of my home theater system.  It feels fairly snappy, but it's really Android.  It really feels like Android.  The store, though, will only show you TV-appropriate apps, much like Google TV did a couple years back.  But apparently, there are 600 of those TV apps.  You can browse them and find them.  A lot of games.  I would say almost all games.  I immediately installed Crossy Road.  It's kind of fun to play Crossy Road on a 70-inch screen.  That's kind of fun.  The Shield comes with a game controller, not the remote.  So you're playing with a game controller.  I think you can get a remote.  You can buy the remote.  I think everything is going to be speech-enabled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Otherwise, they're all going to respond.  Or have a sensor in them that detects that you're holding it.  Therefore, that's the one you intend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think, in fact, that's the plan for some of these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's going to become so ubiquitous that we're going to all have to be very careful about what we say on our shows.  Because we're going to be triggering all this voice stuff.  It happened to me the other day, Dr. Canal.  We were talking about the Amazon Echo.  I can't say the A word.  And her Amazon Echo launched into a...  But people are going to have Google Now, they're going to have Siri.  It's going to be a big problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what we do now is we have different names.  Siri's real name is...  And we'll have to start publishing a guide.  Shlomo.  So we say, hey, Shlomo.  I think we decided that Amazon's Echo name wouldn't be A-L-E-X-A.  But I don't know what we decided.  What did we decide?  We had a name.  We're going to call her Alberta.  And then Google Now.  We don't have to worry about that.  But you can't say, okay, Google.  Oh, God, I just did. I'm so sorry.  My Xbox is Xbox.  So if I say...  Well, for you, I'll say Siri.  No, Shlomo.  Oh, yeah. Hello, Sailor.  That's what Dr. Mom calls her A-L-E-X-A is.  Sailor.  Hey, Sailor.  The problem is you can't...  You only have two choices. Amazon or the other name.  The problem with that also is it's just the name.  There's no hey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if you just say her name...  But the hey thing that Siri has now is just really dumb.  It's like, hey, Siri.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know why they do it?  The same reason Google has a multiple syllable.  Oh, K, four syllables.  Hey, Siri is not enough.  Because frankly, if I have my iPhone plugged in and it's turned on,  it wakes up for TV shows.  It wakes up in the middle of the night.  I don't know, because I'm snoring, hey, Siri.  I don't know.  So the longer the better.  I eventually made my phone, my Moto X say, help me Obi-Wan Kenobi.  And that one never went off by accident.  So false triggers are becoming a big problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You didn't add my only hope?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I thought that was a little too long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A little too long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple TV has, if they had apps, 70 apps.  Roku has 2,000 apps.  Fire TV, 1,700 apps.  So Google has a little catching up to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Android TV also just did something that they needed to do since they launched  and updated the Play Store.  So now you can find all the Android TV apps on Android TV.  Before it was like, it was a curated list.  You knew there were more out there because if you went on the mobile,  you could install things to it.  Now you can find it all through Android TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is interesting.  linear TV channels.  That is live streaming.  Well, live is not the right word, but you could watch ABC.  Yeah.  That's good for us.  That means a Twit app could be on the, you could watch Twit that way.  Yeah.  So if I go to the play.google.com  and I search for TV, what do I search for?  Oh, no, apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, apps.  Yeah, I'm not sure that there is a category specifically for Android TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you see one?  I don't see one.  Pretend play.  Should I click that?  I wouldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's in the family blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that pony play? What is that?  Okay, that's something else then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Comes with a safe word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  So I guess on the shield though, it will give me a category.  Yeah, you'll get a list of only the things that are Android TV compatible.  Yeah, you can't see anything that's not.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what I'd love to see Google do, and Jeff, what would Google do?  I'd love to see, so Microsoft today unveiled the more details about their service hub.  And the Microsoft service hub is a beautiful product.  It is a stunningly good product, perfect for its purpose.  And we can go into that.  I'm sure you guys went into that.  We're going to go into additional detail on that on Windows Weekly.  But I would love to see Google spearhead the consumerization of something like the service hub.  In other words, imagine an Android TV that was a 4K touch display with two HD cameras, lots of sensors.  Where you can interact with it in a whiteboard kind of thing, play games that where you touch the screen or maybe you don't touch the screen.  But I would love to see the TV be replaced by something that is a very high resolution touch display like the service hub.  I think consumers will want that.  We're going to buy one.  Fantastic.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For the shows, right?  Yeah, no, not for my house.  Lisa, I'd like to show you a PowerPoint presentation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, but they're expensive.  So the 55 inch is $7,000.  The 85 inch is $20,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it is a thing of beauty.  I saw it in San Francisco on Friday.  It is just so good.  I would love to have this in classes, right?  Yes, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think classes in board rooms or meeting rooms, conference rooms, are really where this is designed for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But for education, I'd love to see the Android version because I think they could get the price down.  Microsoft is building this in Oregon.  It's a good price.  They make a compelling case about how the things that it replaces, it's far cheaper than the things that it replaces, the projector and all the rest.  But it's still $20,000 is a lot of money.  I'd love to see Google spearhead a project where all these different TV, Sony and Samsung and these different companies are competing with each other on price to get that down under $10,000 for the big 80 plus.  There's a Samsung version of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I saw it at IFA in Berlin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's funny because I saw it on TV in House of Cards.  You remember that really phony scene where the guy's got a Samsung tablet and he says,  let's just put it up on the big screen and it goes like this and swipes the tablet and goes, was that House of Cards?  I think it was.  I saw it on TV.  But Microsoft only runs Windows 10.  What does Samsung run?  It must run Android, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are versions.  There are things from Infocus.  There's an Infocus product.  And they run Windows 7 and they're vastly less elegant, vastly less integrated.  The Surface Hub, there's nothing like it.  It's way better than anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've tried since tech TV days to get, I mean there's been devices like that.  They had special pens and stuff.  But the problem with shooting them on camera was hard because the lights in a television studio in those days had to be so bright that the TV would get washed out.  But you see it on CNN all the time.  Right.  Yeah, I'm thinking, I don't know, I guess we put it on a stand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They make a plethora of stands.  You can take your picks, including ones on rollers.  That's what we'd have to do.  The fundamental stand has rollers on it.  It'd be perfect for our shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we could roll it behind you for tech news tonight and you could, today rather, you could tap it or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's an example of how it's contextual.  You basically walk up to it and there are apps that, for example the main app, which is OneNote, will have controls on one side.  And they're right there and you can tap the controls and then right on the whiteboard and stuff like that.  Another person comes up, two sets of controls appear.  The Skype connections are all stacked on one side.  So you could have ten people on a line and the Surface Hub would handle all those connections.  It's just so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let us take a break.  Unless there's some news that we haven't mined.  Jeff, is there a story?  Mike, anything that we didn't...  I jumped around a lot.  But one of the things I love about this show is it's very informal.  There's really no structure to it and we kind of just talk about whatever the hell we want to talk about.  It's like a box of chocolates.  You never know what you're going to get.  Life is like a box of chocolates.  Okay, get your picks ready.  Our show today brought to you by a really great company, Braintree.  I was talking to the CTO the other day.  He said, not exactly.  We're actually in Chicago and San Francisco.  But one of the founders was a fan of, I think, John Adams, a president born in Braintree.  And so he thought, oh, it's a good name for a company that has brains and shakes the money tree or whatever.  Anyway, it's a great name for a company.  You can't forget it.  And it's very cool.  Because what Braintree does, if you're a mobile app developer with a few lines of code, is give you a secure payment solution your customers are going to love.  It's Braintree's V.0 SDK.  It gives you or your customers the ability to pay in almost any way.  Credit cards, yes, but also Apple Pay, also Venmo, also Bitcoin.  Bitcoin, which is cool.  They have other stuff coming.  You know what I'm talking about.  Basically, that's the beauty part of this.  You as a developer don't have to worry about it.  They add the features.  They make it seamless.  They make it magical.  No wonder companies like Uber use Braintree payments.  Because for Uber, what is the selling point for Uber?  There's two.  You push a button, somebody comes.  Number two, you get out of the car and you're paid.  That's Braintree.  Lyft and Uber, Airbnb and Hotel Tonight.  GitHub, Munchery, Living Social.  I bet you Luxor uses it.  I don't know.  It's so straightforward.  Any language for the mobile web, for your app, it is a full, what they call, a full stack payment solution.  Start accepting PayPal, Apple Pay, Bitcoin, Venmo, credit cards and more.  Couldn't be easier.  And as a little pot sweetener, your first $50,000 in transactions fee free.  Yes, fee free.  Braintreepayments.com slash twig.  You can sign up to use the sandbox so you can see how easy it is to integrate it into your app.  Very simple.  I think you'll love it.  As a developer, you'll like the ease of use.  Your customers will just, the one touch checkout means they don't have to enter a credit card number.  They don't have to mess around.  You get far fewer people abandoning their shopping carts.  Braintreepayments.com slash twig.  I am a believer.  And you know, you use it.  You already use it.  You lose it all the time probably, right?  You might not know that, but you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's funny because I use the whole list.  It's like Airbnb, Uber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everybody.  But to me that's the selling point, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  You get out of the car.  So yeah, it's really...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's the selling point.  Friction-free, right?  I'll give you a little tool in absence of a tip from Gina Tripani.  This is actually the reason I'm mentioning this is it comes from Google.  Google supported this research at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology.  If you've ever been a birder or you just look out in your backyard and you go,  what the hell is that bird?  The Merlin Bird ID app for Google Play or the iOS App Store  will let you take a picture or feed a picture  or even go through a checklist of 400 North American birds  and determine what that bird is.  Are birders going to love this or hate this?  Well, birders probably don't need it if you're like a really sophisticated birder.  You look and go, there's a purple-billed orange-tailed thrush.  Or whatever.  But I am always wondering, what the hell is that bird?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And is it edible?  That's the important thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, there's five steps, five simple questions.  What size, what were the main colors, what was the bird doing?  Why was it doing it?  Why was it doing it?  You also get bird photos.  Birding is big.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  There's an amazing collection of bird samples.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you already know this app?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I know the site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, Effin Dunn knows the site.  So you also can hear what the bird sounds like.  You should just be able to point it at the bird.  Come on, Google.  Effin Dunn is always giving somebody the bird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I imagine they collect the data, right?  70 million data points.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's pretty good too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  70 million observations from the E-Bird Citizen Science Project.  Yeah, that's my data.  So Google was involved in this, as was the National Science Foundation,  and the Pennington's Wild Bird Food.  But I just thought that's kind of cool.  See, sometimes big data is something as simple as what the hell is that?  What am I looking at?  It's actually fascinating because you know they could do this for people.  There's a story that I ran across and almost covered on TNT this morning,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but it turns out that it's been in the news, but under the radar for a while.  But the law enforcement and a few universities are working on a tattoo database  where tattoo image recognition.  Is that unique?  Right now they have 70 keywords.  So when the police have a suspect or whatever and they enter in identifying information,  there's 70 words they can use to describe a tattoo.  It's a twit logo.  Right.  Now they're just using machine intelligence to identify tattoos.  And it's a whole, it's becoming an important part of the FBI.  That makes sense actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's an identifying mark that's often unique.  The Merlin Bird Big Bird Data App.  Big birds.  Big bird.  Big bird data app.  The app replaces Google.  No, I'm sorry, it's Google backed.  It does say, this article does say will identify a bird just from a photo.  So I guess that's just one of many.  Researchers have created a computer vision technology that will identify a species from a single photo.

It is a product of the Empire.  And on the rundown I have a 2012 Guardian review of the pizza for even the progressive snooty guardian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  From that long ago.  But see theirs is lateral.  It's a little bit different.  There's a lateral wiener.  It's going around.  It's curved in a way that hurts.  I think Pizza Hut has actually refined.  I think it has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But if you go below there's an Australian commercial for it.

Transcript:  I think you're going to want to apply.  Should I find that?

See but I think the Pizza Hut one in the U.S. is going to be better because the hot dogs are like little pigs in a blanket.  They're sideways. They're little mini dogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's meant for you know popping at a party.  It's like a party popper hot dog crust.  Like break off a piece.  Delicious looking.  Yeah you can just break off a piece.  It's like I'm on the go right now.  I'm in a hurry.  I just need one of these to go.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's bangers and pizza.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a little more labor intensive this way I have to say.  As opposed to just looping the hot dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Singapore called it the double sensation pizza.  No no that's something else.  Pizza Hut Middle East released pizzas with a crust stuffed with cheeseburgers and the other one with chicken nuggets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did I know you were a grill guy at McDonald's?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know if you knew that but that's what my high school job was and actually for the first couple of years of college.  Oh wow you know what I was?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was the kitchen manager at Ponderosa Steakhouse.  Nice.  And did I ever do this for you?  So I was taught to use the lettuce slicer by a very short guy who said keep your finger outside and if you come outside you'll be okay.  And it's sliced off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh my god he's got a lettuce slice injury.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I made a piece of the finger here.  See that?  I made true chef salad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh who got the salad that your finger piece was in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The manager was trying to figure out whether he could save the salad and was convinced that no he should throw it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're going to pixelate that shot by the way because you just flipped us all the bird.  I didn't realize this but remember the original Facebook like button had a thumbs up?  Yes.  And I'm going to move that because culturally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes that's not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That means up your something.  It means sit on this and rotate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think in the Middle East.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's still the logo on the building isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah Americans are going around Abu Dhabi going hey that's great and the guy's going.  I'm going to kill you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the source of all the tension.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is actually in fact it really isn't over religious.  It's over the gesture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It started with the American tourists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't that still the gesture on the street sign at one heck of a way?  Maps now.  Not on the like button.  Do you have a number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Your number should be 28.

Transcript:  I thought he showed us the number 2 right?  Or was that 11?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, hey, hey.  Up your chef salad.  No my number is 1.  Larry Page is the highest rated boss.  Yes I saw that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Rightly so because golly he must be fun to work for.  Who was the guy before?  LinkedIn's Jeff Weiner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So 97% approval rating for Larry Page.  Rose from 11th place last year because he's been highly visible.  Of course they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do they talk to employees to find this out?  Yeah, it's an employee survey.  US employees only.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google also the best tech company to work for.  Glassdoor is the site that does that.  As opposed to Glass Ceiling.  Yeah that's right.  I guess that's the point.  Number 1 Larry Page.  Mark Zuckerberg 95%.  Tim Cook only 94%.  He's number 10 on the list.  Jeff Weiner down to 13 places.  Down 12 places to number 12.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well we're sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We just want to apologize to our viewers in the Middle East for showing that.  Yeah you've got to feel like the people who get that survey may not be completely forthright.  Oh I love Larry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not like Google is watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did it come to them in email?  Because if it did I don't know.  This really may be more a measure of how paranoid you are as an employee of a company.  Do you have a nice little pick for us Mr. Mike Elgin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do.  It's a kind of picky tippy kind of thing.  Android users for a long time have enjoyed a feature in Google Maps where you could do a search, find a place on Google Maps on your desktop.  And then you'd get a send to device option that would just send that location right to your phone.  And you could do directions or whatever you want to do.  And it hasn't been available to iOS users because Apple has essentially blocked them from having that kind of integration.  So Google in its desire to be cross platform to provide benefits to all of its users no matter what platform has found a really really clever work around.  They're sending it via notification.  So now send device exists on the iOS platform and I'm going to demonstrate it here.  Put the camera on here.  So I've got a I've got Twitter here.  This is a Silicon Valley on this map right now.  And on the desktop I have Twitter and I'm going to click send to device.  And you're going to see that the map will suddenly move.  That's right. OK. So it's asking me send to Michael's phone.  OK. It's Michael. It's Mike. Google.  And what's going to happen is you've jumped to Petaluma.  Now he did that somehow through notifications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. That's interesting. Yeah. It's very interesting.  How long before Apple blocks that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. I mean they can't really quite block notifications but I don't know how they automatically.  Sometimes you get the notification say do you want this? You click it and it goes.  Sometimes it just goes.  And I don't know how they do it but it's quite miraculous and it's a great feature and a major convenience for people.  I give that two thumbs up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. Oh sorry.  That was painful.  Now I can I'll never look at this again the same way.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where is that bad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't recall where but it's basically.  I think in Italy that's bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a hole.  That's bad in Italy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What about the British V thing?  Oh you do it one way.  I always forget which way is the wrong way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John we just grossed John out.  We've lost most of our worldwide audience.  I want to on behalf of all of us here at Twitter apologize to our global audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the OK sign is very not good in Brazil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Brazil.  You know I feel like every time I travel it's a landmine out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't know what's going to happen.  That could be bad too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's apparently an entire Wikipedia article on AOK.  I guess here's how you'd say AOK in a variety of nations.  It actually was invented by U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel John Shorty Powers.  He was public affairs officer for Project Mercury.  Short for all OK right.  It's a diving signal.  I've used that in diving scuba diving.  In some Mediterranean countries like Turkey as well as Brazil it is a vulgar expression.  Either an insult or God it's terrible.  Wow when the sign in most continental European countries when the sign is a sign  is placed over the nose with the nose protruding through the O it means drunk.  In the Arab world it's used as a threatening gesture as in saying you will see you'll see.  And occultists believe it's the number 666 because of the 666.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well I just think it's AOK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
