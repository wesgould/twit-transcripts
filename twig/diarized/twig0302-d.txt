Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's see.  Open it up.  Is it going to get right away?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it?  Are they edible?  Oranges, yeah.  I heard that tomatoes are poison.  I just want to warn you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Also.  If you leave my cell, I'll bring the cat in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Love the cat.  He was here last week.  That's great.  Also here for the first time, although he's been on all  about Android many times, from Ars Technica, one of my  favorite tech blogs, Mr. Ron Amadio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey.  Good to see you, Ron.  Awesome to be here.  I'm thrilled to meet you.  This is really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Big fan.  Read you religiously.  We quote you all the time.  And I try as a policy to always say, from Ars Technica,  Ron Amadio ready.  Although I mispronounced it all along.  I kept calling you Ron Trapani.  Ron Amadio.  I got it now.  And you cover Android.  What's your beat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Android, Google stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You wrote a great piece on what to expect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  At Google I.O.  Very long.  I always try to go as in-depth as possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we talked about it on Sunday.  And I always feel like you kind of know.  You have sources, right?  You're not making this stuff up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  No.  Kind of.  Sometimes.  I do not.  No, most of the time it is just research.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So is Android M really going to be marshmallow?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  No.  No, we're just messing around with that.  I just wanted to.  I was bored writing this.  This is me procrastinating.  That's what the lead entry of this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK, this is good to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  On a tech blog, when you see a big image with Photoshopped  text, that's the guy that doesn't want to write.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  I was just, oh, this is bored weight.  I could take this craft marshmallow bag and turn it in.  What's the font?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You actually did it beautifully.  Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And yes, too many people steal my pictures.  You're a Photoshop wizard.  You have to hide something in there.  You are a Photoshop wizard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You got the bent with the weight.  Yeah, that's nice.  That's nice.  I'm impressed.  I'm mightily impressed.  The heck with this tech writing stuff.  Going to design.  Far too long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Before we talk about Google I.O., that's what you and Jeff  are here for.  You're not going I.O., right, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I may be.  I haven't got a ticket, but I may get a sneaky pass.  It starts tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Working on it, yeah.  OK.  Down to the wire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Kevin got himself a Google uniform so he can go in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, no, I'll be wearing somebody else's badge.  But then I have been known to wear yours in the past.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  X-Nay on the edge, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They live stream.  You'll have to change his accent.  You'll have to sound American today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They live stream so much of this stuff, though.  I don't know if it's worth going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In fact, we're going to cover it.  So I'll be in here early for Mike.  Mike and Jason are going.  Right, Jason Howell?  That's right.  Looking forward to it.  Neither of them are going to be here tomorrow.  But I will be filling in for Mike with TNT at 8.30 AM.  Shortly after TNT, we'll go to our live coverage of Google I.O.  And we do what we always do.  We'll stream the keynote live.  And then Gina and I, Gina Trippani is going to join me,  and Ron Richards and Aaron Newcomb will comment.  Right.  Two and a half hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Make sure you go to the potty beforehand.  Get ready.  I'm exhausted just thinking about it.  And if Larry comes out, it'll be three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hope Larry comes out.  That was cool.  That was like three years ago.  He came out and answered questions  and talked about Google Island.  And he'll never be allowed to speak.  The PR people said never let Larry on stage again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, he's in charge.  He can do whatever he wants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but I feel like that there's  got to be PR people who are saying Larry.  We would really prefer it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But the head of PR just left.  Uh-oh, that's not good.  That's right.  The head of PR just went to Uber.  Uber.  Oh, what a bad move.  So they may be able to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, they need PR help.  If you're in PR, you go to where the stink is.  Yeah.  Because that's where the money is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  God, I need some PR people.  Boy, do we stink.  So come on over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, you've practiced on the various Google execs  gaps over the years.  Then Uber is probably a good place to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess so.  If you can do a PR, if you can explain Eric Schmidt.  Yeah.  You can.  Sayings from Chairman Schmidt.  You can do Chairman Kalanick.  Hey, before we get into a Google I.O., I just wanted to  mention, and I'm curious because here we have Professor  of Journalism, City University of New York.  We have an actual working member of the tech press,  Ron Amadio.  We have Kevin Marks and I, who just are on the beach.  Picking oranges.  Picking oranges.  So Vox buys Recode.  Now Vox is the parent company for originally the sports  blog SB Nation.  But then they did this beautiful thing with The Verge.  They launched Polygon, which is a gaming blog.  They also have a Vox blog now.  So they're kind of a growing site, tech site.  They buy Recode.  Now the first question I have, because this isn't the end,  by the way.  There's another bigger fish coming along.  But the medium sized fish eats the little fish.  In an all stock transaction, I read somebody, and I'd love  you guys would be better than I to explain this, to  explain to me.  Somebody said that means that Recode had run out of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Does that sound credible?  I'm thinking that must be kind of what's going on.  Dan Lyons in Facebook, I just put it up, had a post saying  that he argues simply that the economics of online publishing,  quoting him, are disastrously bad, been clear for years.  People keep trying.  New hot sites come along.  Get VC funding.  He's saying basically there's no business model there.  So this is another giga home.  That's what he's arguing.  Now with no facts here, and other people came in and said  you don't have your facts right, but didn't correct.  So I have no idea, but I do want to know what was the  business of Recode.  Recode did get an entertainment business, an event business  going.  The code conference is huge.  Right now they charge big money for it.  I don't know how many comps they give.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But giga home had a number of conferences as well.  Yes they did.  Yes they did.  The old thinking was the conference can save you.  TechCrunch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's funny, my entrepreneurial students this  year, every year there's some kind of a cliche in their  businesses.  Five years ago it was we'll be viral.  Now everybody said we'll have events.  So events have become the cure all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I avoided that with the plague.  People often say to me why don't you have a  twit event or something.  I think you should.  Yeah, no, see I'm not doing that.  Sorry.  I think you should.  And then I love this paragraph.  By the way, I might mention that Dan, who was faked Steve  Jobs, and then he went to, what is it, On?  He went to not a tech blog, but some social site.  But he was going to be their tech blogger.  It didn't work out.  He's got the best Boston accent ever.  Then he was at Gawker for like a week.  Yeah, for no time at all.  For no time at all.  And now, besides working on a book, which apparently got a  good book deal and that's why he quit Gawker, he's one of  the writers for Silicon Valley.  And I'm convinced that Dan, I really wonder, you saw Silicon  Valley this week, this Kevin Rose joke?  I didn't see it, no.  Oh, gotta show you the Kevin Rose joke.  Oh good, okay, show it.  Oh good, good, good.  I guess I can without violating any.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I'm assuming that they've hired him to do the  fake Steve Jobs for their fake exec person.  I'm assuming that's the reason they've come to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like he's adding verisimilitude.  He's the verisimilitude guy.  He's the guy who says, oh, let me tell you,  cause this year especially has been really right on about  funding, lots of in tech jokes.  I don't know how I can play this.  I think I can't legally play.  Well, I mean, I can do it illegally.  I don't think I can do it illegally.  I'll do it if I can do it.  Maybe I have to go in there.  Let me see if Gizmodo, fittingly enough,  Gizmodo might have the video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We offer commentary and it's very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you?  Say something.  It's commentary, we're commenting.  We are.  Yeah, they're gonna give them the quote.  Yeah, they'll just give these screenshots and quotes.  So it's the guy, the jerk from Hooli, right?  Who's talking to his board after a massive failure.  This is not a spoiler.  It's a comedy.  Question.  And then he murders them all.  Question, what is failure to the ignorant?  Are those in conventional industries,  the recent Nucleus Glitch,  Nucleus is his product, it's a flop,  may seem like a failure in the negative sense.  But we in the Valley know failures like this one  are really stepping stones.  To bring us the iPhone, Steve Jobs first had to bring us  the Newton.  To bring us Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg,  first had to bring us Wirehog.  Before he brought us Dig, Kevin Rose had to bring us  a whole lot of useless things.  And he shows Pounce, Milk and Oink.  And then after Dig, as well for that matter.  So it's a dig.  And I wonder though, I have to ask Kevin,  if Dan, either it's possible Dan has something against him  or more likely he thought it'd be funny and why not?  Would you mind?  I wouldn't mind being skewered.  It's just fun to be honest.  He's kind of a negative guy, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In this post about Recode, he then goes on to say  that personal brands, go ahead Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can I read this?  Please do.  All that nonsense about journalists  with big personal brands was just that nonsense.  Walt Mossberg's power came from his association  with the journal.  POG was better off at the Times, is it Yahoo now?  Levy who's at Medium was better off at Wired.  Nate Silver was better off at the Times, 538.  The late David Carr knew this  and I suspect Nick Bilton does too.  Nick's still at the Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He'd be better off still writing about tech perhaps.  Well, he's on the fashion page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The old D conference was powerful  because it was attached to the journal.  Its descendants still draws an audience  and still commands a high ticket price,  but it's not the same.  He's talking about code.  This is also maybe there's some Schadenfreude.  Yeah, there is a speculation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Listen, I think that the other way,  was the business of Recode great?  If it was so great,  no, they probably wouldn't have sold it.  However, does Recode work very well with Vox?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Especially for a stocks transaction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, but does Recode work well with Vox?  Yes.  I brought 15 German editors there a week ago  and saw Lockhart Steel, their new boss.  And Vox is a really amazing company.  Jim Bankoff has done a wonderful job.  They have infrastructure, they have ad sales,  they have audience.  Better yet, they have a great CMS.  Everybody loves a CMS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ron, do you have a good CMS at Ars Technica?  Yes, we do.  Do you respect paragraphs too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Ars Technica tech team is incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There was an article in the New York Times saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the reason people go to work for Vox  is because after the interview process,  they then say, well, let us show you  how you'll be writing your articles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wrote posts in TextEdit on the plane  on the way over here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the manly way to do it.  You're in IRC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're not using some fancy slack.  You're in IRC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're a man.  I wrote a post on my phone from the mall.  Wow.  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  Yeah, you can poke with the browser and everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But then this is the best rumor of all.  I just love it.  Oh, oh, oh.  The bigger, the whales coming.  And apparently Comcast was an investor in both these  outlets, is gonna take them both in.  And they're all gonna be Comcast companies.  What a fate worse than death.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How crazy has journalism, tech journalism been lately?  Like Giga Ohm's gone and now there's Zombie Giga Ohm  coming back and-  What's the Zombie?  I didn't hear about that.  Some company bought him and his-  They bought the name?  Former founder of Today Media.  Right, they bought the name.  Oh, oh, must be just dying inside.  It's his name.  I don't know who's gonna work there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, cause Fortune hired five.  Knowingly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, everybody had jobs.  They didn't just stick around.  But Verizon owns NGadget and TechCrunch now.  Yep, yep.  And Huff-O.  Right, and Comcast could own-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm just gonna say, we're proud  of being bloody independent.  Bloody and independent.  Bloody and independent.  And we are bloodied, but we're still independent.  But I feel like we've demonstrated there's,  I don't know how, but there's a market for tech information.  I think there is.  Ours does okay, right?  Although didn't ours-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm spoken for with a giant media conglomerate already.  Yeah, Conde bought it, that's right.  But Conde hasn't messed with it.  Right, yeah.  Conde was very smart.  Just as they did with Reddit,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  they kind of let Reddit be Reddit.  Yeah.  Let ours be ours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, which is nice.  I guess you know the worst possible outcome  of all of this acquisition stuff.  What's that?  Tech TV and-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tech TV and Comcast, I know.  That's why I shiver when I hear the Comcast.  And it would make sense, Comcast bought NBC.  They wanna be a content company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's disastrous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's bad for journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it is, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't feel like Verizon running Gadget  is gonna be really independently reviewing phones anymore.  As we know, CBS made CNET change their best of CES  because they didn't like the Hopper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Corporate, bad corporations, corporate politics matters.  When I was at Entertainment Weekly,  I had a top executive of the company come  and we had regraded shows, movies.  He did a grade point average of what we were doing  every week and said we were being too mean to Hollywood  just as they were merging with Warner Brothers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I could tell you truthfully,  the real reason that Twit exists,  the sole and only reason is to be independent  because I just don't want anybody to tell me  what I can do and can't do.  You wouldn't listen anyway.  No, I got a lot of trouble all the time.  Although to their credit,  Ziff Davis was a good corporate parent.  Well, they knew, they were a publisher, right?  They were a publisher.  They were a good corporate parent.  So for instance, we were gonna publish  a guy named Bunny Wong who I love,  he was at MIT at the time,  and he hacked the first Xbox.  We were gonna put him on and show everybody how to do it  and where to get the chips.  And to their credit, Ziff Davis,  which knew that Microsoft,  which was a big advertiser, would be furious.  We were nervous so we went to our management and said,  well, we're gonna do this.  And they said, go ahead, absolutely.  They talked to the lawyers,  they made sure that we weren't breaking any laws,  which we weren't, but no, they stood up for it.  But that's the difference,  but I don't think Comcast would.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The only hope in a large company like Comcast  is that you can hide.  They're so big.  They won't notice you.  They won't notice you, yeah.  They're busy running, what is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like Condi.  NBC?  Yeah, Condi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you ever go over to the New Yorker and hang out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  Kennedy Faire's sick.  The World Trade Center's security is very, very high.  So you can't even go from floor to floor.  I'm allowed to go to like my floor in the cafeteria  and get harassed by security all the time.  But it's really fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I bet, I bet.  I think it's great.  I've always thought the world of ours  and I was really pleased that they let ours be ours.  And you know what, ours,  despite you're doing more lifestyle stuff  than you did before,  but it still feels very much like a blog  for technology enthusiasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, definitely.  We have like a culture thing.  But not like the Verge,  which basically went whole hog on this.  We'll do like Star Wars  and kind of stop it around that level.  But look at this. Which is cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You do great stuff.  The female mathematician who changed the course of physics  but couldn't get a job, that's great.  Nintendo's first online shooter Splatoon.  Source Forge grabs GIMP.  Now see, you're not gonna see that on The Verge.  You're not gonna see that on The Verge.  This is great.  Still the best.  Here's your, you're gonna live blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My live blog, yep.  This is it. Two and a half hours  of endless, endless stuff.  Typity, typity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By the way, I've gotta ask you a technical question first.  The wifi always sucks.  The cell lines are all jammed.  How do you do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They let the journalists in early this year  and there will be power and hard wired ethernet.  It's gonna be so awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they want you to live blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow. Yeah, definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it's the opposite of Apple.  But yeah, the front row ethernet thing  is a lot of conferences do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's smart because-

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The challenge is you gotta bring your hub with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's also, as we remember Apple telling everybody,  turn off your wifi.  We can't show off this feature.  You don't wanna have that habit.  All right, Ron, what are we expecting?  Will there be BMX riding skydivers?  Will there be a giant Rube Goldberg TikTok clock?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The fluff I try not to deal with.  But- Come on.  Well, you don't know.  That's all we care about here is the fluff.  Yeah, you'd have to talk to stunt coordinators  in the area or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they've gotten away from that a little bit.  Although, wasn't it last year they had that clock?  No, it was the year before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, last year was just the Rube Goldberg thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That clock thing.  Yeah.  And the giveaway was a piece of cardboard,  which I thought was- Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Brilliant. Right.  Yeah, the hardware this year is weird.  It's like I'm just drawing a total blank  as far as what- Well, it could be a pixel.  You know, you always get goodies.  Right, they could give away a pixel,  which would be old.  Yeah, I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But like, I-  It's just not that changed.  Geeks will say,  I already have one I didn't use.  This one's not so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, I've been investigating,  I couldn't use the pixel on any of the shows  the last generation, but the new,  I don't know if it's Chrome OS,  but you can now choose resolutions in Chrome OS.  Nice. Oh.  So I gotta bring it in and we gotta get-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And now that you've ruined your keyboard,  you have to have a new computer here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, John Salinino, we gotta get a Type-C to HDMI.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, it doesn't have a charger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You have two other USBs here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but I know I need video out,  so video comes out of that thing.  Oh, right, yes it does, yes.  Yeah, Apple has them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  70, I bought one, $79.  You could buy a Chromebook for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey, hey, fightin' words, Marks, fightin' words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could buy a Chrome stick for that anyway, yeah.  A Chrome bit, yeah.  That will be one of the things I'm sure they'll show, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They will give away Chrome bits, I'm sure, yes.  They might give away Chrome bits, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Like the geeks, you know, when they gave away the watches,  and oh, you're all gonna get the square watch.  Oh, you're gonna get the round watch.  Yay!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Took them three months,  but they finally get you the Moto 360.  I never got the round watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They were lookin' to gift horse in the mouth.  You're gettin' anything free, naked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This year, maybe the OG Urbane?  Oh, I'm just thinkin', I'm still on my free crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, what goodies do we get?  I'm sorry.  I mean, like my only just straight out guess  is maybe they do a Chromecast 2,  and everybody gets one of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what would, yeah, that's one of the rumors  you have in your, ours story.  What does a Chromecast 2 have in it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We've had Google executives like publicly talk about,  you know, there will be a Chromecast,  we're working on new hardware.  It's gonna show off a bunch of multi-screen features.  So like, you know, you have your phone on,  and your, something's happening on your phone  and you're like, oh, something's happened to my screen,  and there's a lot of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like hangouts might pop up while I'm watching TV.  Yeah, I'm not sure I want that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think what they've talked about  is like game controller stuff,  or you know, you have some weird little viewfinder  on the screen and there's a like full game  playing on the television, like a Wii U kinda thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Last year they did that whole thing with the games,  the multi-games into one game and all that.  Right.  So they never really did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  But they, I don't know, they have so many,  they have so many like holes in the Chromecast right now  that it's just not up to the task of,  I guess modern video streaming.  Well, as you point out, you could go to 802.11ac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  You could go to 4K, although I don't know  if 4K and a stick, I guess you could go 4K.  I mean, Android.  Go 4K.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like in terms of keeping up with Android TV,  Android TV's gonna do 4K, and you know,  they have boxes coming out that'll do,  that'll do AC and all this other  like fancy connectivity stuff,  and they need to get that in a little package,  like the Chromecast.  The Chromecast is two years old now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kevin would know because,  Kevin was one of the creators of QuickTime.  So it would require hardware decode, right?  Well, for 4K.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  Well, or it would require a CPU with a,  yeah, you would want to,  it's not gonna be the CPU.  It's gonna be hardware.  And it would be outfitted in something that small.  Yeah.  And he'd know that.  As if pulling, yeah.  So, eh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, they can do VP9 on hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are there systems?  I guess there are.  Raspberry Pi, I think, has hardware decode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There are some.  I don't know how much they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'd be surprised if they do a 4K Chromecast right now,  but unless they're just doing it to show off,  because the point of it is that it's everywhere,  and there isn't that much 4K content yet.  I put that out over the years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there's Netflix.  And that's one of the chief features of a Chromecast,  is Netflix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  YouTube does 4K and VR and 3D.  That's right, it does the VR.  That's a really important point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If they want to show off what YouTube can do.  Yeah, it's all YouTube stuff.  It's the YouTube cast.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can't.  What they can do better is the sound stuff.  It's quite, I haven't,  I've not managed to get the Chromecast  to give me decent surround sound with anything.  Really?  Maybe they didn't even license Adobe Decoder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe they just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, the problem is that they're feeding,  they're feeding into the TV.  I'm not sure, I don't know the details  of what audio specs they're feeding into the TVs there  and how stable those are.  So maybe they're just doing Dolby over stereo  and relying on the Decoder or elsewhere to do it.  But I was playing with this before thinking,  okay, I've got all these things that will work on Chromecast.  Will any of them feed 5.1 around to my TV system  and I couldn't get it to work?  So that may be something that,  and I'm not sure if that's a hardware limitation  or it's just that they haven't spent time on it,  but that would be something that would be,  I would assume would be something you could improve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would be something that I would assume  only you would even know.  That we are so, we don't care about audio.  We've been conditioned by an iPod to listen to crappy audio.  I never, ever hear anybody say I want better audio.  Does the Neil Young thing really sound better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know.  That's a no.  That's an honest answer.  For how much it is, that's a no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I bought it, I love it, I listened to it,  I just bought, re-bought for the seventh or eighth time  the entire Beatles at 24-bit  because I found a little USB metal Apple  that has the 2009 remaster in 24-bit.  I have to ask Kevin Toffle about this.  But it's really hard to separate psychology  versus actual hearing, right?  It sounds better to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Adding more bits, adding more sample rate  or adding more bit depth doesn't actually help very much.  What helps is adding more channels.  And particularly for the Chromecast,  it's in the device that is most likely  plugged into multiple speakers.  If there's one place in your home  you have got decent speakers set up,  it's attached to the TV.  So that would make sense to me as a direction to move in.  And it makes sense to me as an audio thing as well.  I've had this debate at SF Music Tech  with the Pono advocates and things.  There's a lot of woo in the stuff they're selling.  There's a lot of woo in the stuff they're selling?  Yeah.  Woo!  Yes.  Snake oil.  They have guys who, they have like old music guys  who's hearing probably rolls off at 2K  saying that they can hear the difference.  And they say, and the digital stuff  is like fluorescent lighting versus natural lighting.  They talk about a woo like that.  Actually, practically, digital sampling in A-B test  is at 44K stereo.  You can't really tell that apart from the higher stuff  when you actually do empirical tests.  So adding extra bit depth and adding extra sample rate  is something you use for mixing  because there you want to move things  by fractions of a sample because you're trying to fix phase  and you want to do multiple layer mixing and balancing  at high resolution before you mix down.  So having them for studio recording and for mixing  gives you headroom.  I want to act like I understood that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, basically it gives you room to move.  But once you're listening to it, you don't need that.  Now, I've also, here's what I've,  I know I'm going to interrupt you briefly  because we're going to get to the Nyquist theorem  and all of that.  But here's what I've been reading lately  is it's for sure the case that the super high sample rates  of 192 kilohertz are creating distortion  and weird effects that may be perceived by people like me  and Neil Young as being better,  ringing and weird things.  That's absolutely true.  It seems to be even pretty serious recording engineers  agree sample, and this isn't mastering,  obviously what you're saying, Kevin,  it may not matter later, but at mastering,  a sample rate of let's say double CD, which is 88.2  would be fine.  88.2 24 bit would be as good as you ever needed probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They normally master at 48, 96 or 192.  Right.  So they're already doing a sample rate conversion to 44.1.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, one of the things Neil Young said is that  that conversion, because it's not having or doubling,  is not going to be as good as if you did 88.2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  To, not really.  I mean. Okay, I got it.  Not these days.  The thing is, depending what you're doing,  you do enough time stretching and mixing  and bouncing around in the mix these days anyway  that doing a sound break conversion is basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's absolutely true is the room, the speakers,  the reproduction, all of that have much more impact.  Your age, my ears, all have much more impact  than what the original.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So the things that actually matter are more channels.  That's good, I'll buy that.  If you have a 5.1 mix of something,  especially if a concert recording or a classical thing  or something like that, and you have 5.1 speakers  or 7.1 speakers, that is definitely better.  You can hear that better.  It'll give you a better sense of the presence of the room.  There's more going on there.  The challenge is not many places have 5.1 speakers  or 7.1 speakers, but the place you do have them  is attached to your TV.  So this is why doing that with the Chromecast  and the TV attached things makes more sense than elsewhere.  The other thing that matters is having isolated tracks,  having multiple tracks that you can take apart  and put back together again.  And that's something that is valuable for people  who want to remix it, valuable for people  who could potentially remix on the fly.  And there's a market for that.  There are already people who sell, they call them stems,  they sell isolated tracks of all the different pieces  in the mix so that you can remake the mix yourself.  That's fun.  That's also a valuable thing that they could sell as music  and makes more sense than the Pono thing.  Whereas Pono, they're just saying,  we're taking the final mix and we're giving you  more bits of the final mix, which is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, to be honest, probably if there is a benefit  to the Pono, it's also a higher quality DAC  and a higher quality amplifier.  They use a very good DAC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but you can...  I know.  That's completely marginal.  Yeah, the Apple gear has actually got a pretty good DAC.  Yeah, probably your low end Android has a DAC.  That's probably true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's one of the reasons I say that people don't care  about audio is that I was very,  I thought this year would be the year  that phones would have better audio,  like higher quality audio.  And nobody's made any effort in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But isn't the network in between a mess?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The difference, the rise of headphones,  the rise of headphones, good headphones,  not piece of shit headphones like I'm wearing,  means that there is an audience for better audio now.  That's true, because everybody's wearing Beats, so we know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The point is if you go to the electronics shop now,  like a third of the aisles are headphones.  You know why, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a very high margin business.  You could take $10 with the components  and charge $400 for it,  because it's got magic sauce, just like the Pono.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know, there's a bunch of that too.  But some of it is, there is a difference  between a speaker like this that I pay $10 for  and the one that goes over your ear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I bought very expensive magnetic planar headphones.  You won't.  Oh no, there's this noise.  They sound really good, because I spent a lot of money.  Now we're going to move on, because this is not the,  I don't think Google I.O. will be all about audio.  Somebody in the chat was putting, say again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  One more little thing into this.  Yes.  So there is a structural problem that Google has,  which is the latency of audio on Android.  Let's talk about that, because there's this 10 millisecond

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  kind of baked in latency that is a real problem.  It's one of the reasons I understand  that you don't see a lot of performing music apps on Android,  because the latency would kill you.  Why is it there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because this is like a really deep design problem  in the operating system.  That's why it's not fixed.  The way Linux works is that it has a pull model  for audio.  Have I got this wrong?  Basically, the way, I'll just go back the other way.  The way Linux works, it works the old fashioned way  and underneath Android is Linux,  which means that it ends up with lots of buffers of audio  and everything adds buffers to make sure  that it doesn't have a gap.  And so you end up with more and more latency.  Someone did a very good analysis of different Android phones  and how much latency they have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Superpowered.com has a really good article explaining this,  if you want to know more.  It's the first time I'd ever heard of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But the headline is burying this a bit,  because it isn't a 10 millisecond problem.  The problem is that it's like 100 milliseconds  for many of the phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's additive, because it's not just,  it's here and there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and Google talks about audio latency,  like every year the way they do audio and performance.  Oh, we've got it down this much more this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They know this, they've addressed it, huh?  They've trusted it a few years now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, they haven't, because they've got to structurally change  the way the operating system works to do it.  So the difference is, is that iOS-  Is it the Java VM or is it?  No, no, it's the way interrupts work  at the operating system level.  So the way interrupts work on iOS,  there's a special interrupt that's just for audio.  It has higher priority than memory paging  and it's round robin called,  which means that you can build an audio pipeline  that has very low latency,  because you can guarantee that it will happen  every 64 samples.  With Android, they're on the Linux model,  the audio pipeline is not working with buffers that small.  And also it can't do the chasing the head thing  where the read point is chasing the right pointer,  because they can't guarantee that they don't cross.  Whereas on iOS and Mac OS, they know that they won't.  So what that means is that there is just more latency  at every stage of the process.  So the problem is the kernel, you'd have to-  Yes, you'd have to change the microkernel to fix this,  the kernel.  You would have to change the model,  that article explains it,  but you have to change the way audio is processed on it  such that there are high priority interrupts on iOS,  pulling audio through the system and things feeding into it.  Whereas on Android, you're pushing audio into buffers  and the buffers are getting played out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it ends up being not 10 milliseconds,  but as much as 100 milliseconds each way  or one fifth of a second round trip,  which is enough to really kill the beat.  It's like whiplash, not my tempo!

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's doing the same thing.  So on iOS, they made it pull the audio  all the way through the process.  Whereas on Android, because you're pushing it in,  you push a buffer in and then when you're processing it,  you pull a buffer and push a buffer  and pull a buffer and push a buffer.  So each stage in that chain makes it worse.  Is this still a problem in Lollipop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You still don't have music apps and mixers and anything else?  No, I don't see any of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Any of them that you do see are made by third party  hardware solutions, essentially.  Oh, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you'd use, yeah, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, you can't do it in software.  Or you have to, basically they have to write it once  for each device they're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is not an issue for somebody listening to music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But the reason this is gonna,  well it can be an issue for listening to music.  It means that when you do track skips and things like that,  then you get more lag.  And the Bluetooth play out has more lag on Android.  Oh, but come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, we're not talking a second.  We're talking a fraction of a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, but it can be a second.  That's the problem.  Because by the time you buff it up  through a series of things that are all doing this wrong,  you get that problem.  But the reason they're gonna have to fix this  is the VR stuff.  Because if you've got latency.  Yes, latency is death in VR.  When you're doing that and the audio isn't moving,  you fall out of the world.  Suddenly, the birds aren't staying over there  when they turn your head.  The birds are lagging.  Is that a barf problem?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah, absolutely.  But the barf problem is visual, I think in most cases.  But nonetheless, if you had audio latency,  that's gonna be a huge problem  if your audio drags behind this video.  That's not a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So in order to get the headset stuff working well,  they're gonna have to fix this.  And I suspect they are gonna have to change  the kernel to do this.  Which is a big operation.  It basically means ripping out the guts of Linux,  having a giant fight with Linus about it  because he doesn't care.  And going through that process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The chat room was saying that this was actually  Linus's choices that created this problem in the beginning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I put it the other way around.  It's more that when they were doing Mac OS X,  they hired audio people who actually cared about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they paid attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I was working with them at the time.  So they were all musicians.  They all wanted to use their Macs as effects processors  and they didn't want to have to have  racks in there to do it.  How is Windows on this?  They also,  Windows has the same problems.  I mean, they've got,  what Windows has is like four separate overlaid APIs  for doing audio, some of which are better than others.  Because, but the basic level of interrupt stuff  is still pretty bad, I think.  They may have changed it more recently.  I haven't written audio code on Windows for 10 years.  Have any of the phone OEMs fixed this themselves?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Samsung or Sony?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There are some proprietary APIs,  but then you've got to write to the Samsung API  and things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, like this is AmpliTube,  specifically for Samsung devices.  Do you use this for your guitar?  This is, yeah, so this is guitar amp simulation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and the Gear VR is basically the video version  of this where we sat down with Samsung  and tweaked their exact implementation of video  to get latency down.  Yeah, because they'd have to fix it for Gear VR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And Oculus is using Android, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, the Gear is in Oculus slash Samsung project.  So yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want this.  This is going to come out tomorrow.  I don't know if Google will show it at Google I.O.,  but the new Nvidia Shield Android TV version.  Before you run out and buy a Chromecast,  this plays games, 4K movies.  It's kind of a console with a Tegra X1 in it  and three gigs of memory.  How much?  Oh, I don't know.  The shields are more expensive, I know.  I don't know.  Have they announced a price?  Chattar mentioned this.  This looks really, this looks like something.  Like I have a Fire TV and I've never connected it.  I have, I don't think I had a Google TV  and I was, 199 bucks.  Okay, is that the only listed?  That's the 16 gig.  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There is a rumored 500 gigabyte version.  There should be a storage.  What do you think?  And it's really nice.  It is the next generation of Android TV, definitely.  Like I have a Nexus player  and that thing can't play 1080p video smoothly.  So that's sad.  It lags all over the place.  It's just terrible.  But this thing, it was playing 4K video content  at 60 frames a second.  Wow.  Like buttery smooth.  Oh, I'm buying it.  You can plug all this stuff into the USB ports.  It's Android so you can plug in webcams and storage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ecosystem's important because it's competing with me  for my Xbox One.  It would take the same slot, right?  So Xbox One has a good ecosystem.  I've got a lot of great games.  I mean the best games,  or at least competitive to Sony.  It's got most of the media stuff that I wanna do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like it seems like Android TV with the shield  has a good hardware platform,  but does anyone want to spend $200 on this  when you can get an Xbox,  you can get an Xbox 360 for that much.  Yeah, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hulu Plus, Pandora, Vivo, Red Bull TV.  I didn't even know that existed.  YouTube, Crackleplex, that's important.  TuneIn, we're on that so you could listen to us.  Games though, these are Android games, aren't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, and Nvidia's gonna try to do their own game store thing.  But no, I mean, there's still Android games  at the end of the day.  But I can play Doom 3, come on!  So they have the 16 gigabyte version listed.  Grand Theft Auto 5 is 65 gigabytes.  So there's the difference between Android games  and real games.  They're just not on the same level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, back to Ron's.  You didn't do this on a phone.  Ron's outline of what we expect for Google I.O.  So that's the Chromecast slash,  maybe they'll show the Shield too.  I mean, it's their platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Shield One.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Shield One.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the Shield's not out yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's maybe tomorrow.  Right, right, right, yeah.  That's what I'm thinking, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that'll be your future Android TV box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Android M, what do we know?  Fingerprint API, which is nice.  I like my S6 has the fingerprint reader,  which I understand is not Samsung's,  but comes from, who's the fingerprint reader from?  The one, same people who do the...  Synaptics?  Yeah, synaptics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which is better, that or Apple's?  Oh, on the Galaxy S6, it's really good.  It's pretty close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Maybe Apple a little faster.  But it's pretty close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  On the Galaxy S6, it's synaptic,  I'm sure I'm saying the name wrong.  It's synaptics, yeah.  Yeah, okay, it's that hardware,  but Samsung's proprietary API for the fingerprint stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But now there'll be a fingerprint ecosystem in M.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the guess.  I mean, this is all research stuff that I'm hoping is...  No, Ron, this is true.  This is factual.  This is the facts, Jax.  But yeah, you need a fingerprint API  so that developers can make stuff  and so that OEMs will actually put a fingerprint reader  in their phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  S6 is pretty good.  I can use LastPass.  I can, Samsung's web browser will let me log on  to websites using fingerprint.  I can use Google Wallet with it.  I mean, it's pretty, it's just, you know what?  It's more extensive than Apple's  because Apple only, only Apple supports  their fingerprint reader.  No third party apps.  Well, wait a minute, no, LastPass does.  I'm sorry, I take that back.  No, I lied.  In fact, all the same stuff.  Passbook works with it.  I take it back.  You shouldn't ask me about Apple stuff.  I don't really understand Apple very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, well hopefully you'll be able to use your fingerprint  to do Android Pay, which the difference between that and.  What's that from Wallet?  How does that?  Right, exactly.  The difference between that and Wallet  is gonna be branding.  The name.  You know, Apple did their Apple Pay thing.  Oh, it's Apple Pay and Android Pay.  Yeah, so we've gotta, you know, rename everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, you know.  So they gotta relabel the point of sale system  because they've already got Legos on them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That seems.  No, they just have those fish bones.  It doesn't actually say Wallet.  Right, usually it doesn't say Google Wallet.  It has the W on it.  So they don't have to.  Yeah, it's called the Google.  They should name it Android Way  and then they wouldn't have to change the W.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they're like, they're supposed to be some kind of API  to let other apps plug into the Pay system somehow.  I'm not sure what other apps would wanna do with that,  but I guess Amazon could have you do, you know,  fulfillment through Android Pay or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of course, Samsung's trying to do the same thing  with Samsung Pay.  They've got, they bought Loop Pay.  They're trying to work with swipe readers  as well as tap to pay readers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would love to try Loop Pay.  Like it's in the phone and they need some kind of.  They haven't turned it on.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Do you use an S6?  Is that your phone of choice?  No, I have a Nexus 6.  Nexus 6, I knew it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've got a stick with the stock Android.  But it's gonna have Android M on it next week.  So, you know, or tomorrow.  Oh.  Developer version.  Sure, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, he's special.  Yeah, he's special.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I'm guessing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And he's guessing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But no, that's what happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you get your PHY invite?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no.  Me either.  Even you?  Yeah, I know.  Even you, what about you?  I know.  PHY's tough.  I don't know too many people that have even covered it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We all got that email that said,  you're gonna get it before summer's over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Check back in the summer.  I think most of the people that got invited  were people that said they don't have a Nexus 6  and need to buy a Nexus 6.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's evil.  Oh, I thought we'd have an advantage as Nexus 6 owners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Right.  Oh, that's evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm gonna check my other email address.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't be, I know, you know what?  Every day I check for Google PHY.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm such an idiot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh my God.  Did I get the invite today?  No.  What else?  Let's go back to, let's go back to the.  When you do get it, would you have,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  if you were me, would you change your number to it?  I've got an AT&T grandfathered unlimited account.  Grandfathered, good news is unlimited,  bad news is I can't tether.  Oh.  Well. Would you switch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're not getting unlimited.  I don't think Google PHY, I think,  I'm sure you've talked about this many times  on all about Android, is a price competitor.  It's the same price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It depends.  You get the option to save money  if you don't use your internet.  Well, you get the option to do that with any phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you don't use data, yeah.  No, you pay for too much data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, you pay more.  You only pay for what you use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're red.  You're red.  I'm drunk, I'm sorry.  What does the M stand for, really?  Marshmallow, meringue pie, marzipan.  Just like last year.  Last year we had L. It's just L.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they're not gonna say anything,  it's just gonna be M.  Although it. It's good SEO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was, he does have macadamia nut cookies  sprinkled throughout it.  It does, right.  There's an internal.  Right, which they do that, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's just to tease you.  Wait a minute, Chris Michael in our chat room says.  Shouldn't it be M&M?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If there's gonna be any candy,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it should be M&M's.  Or here's some macadamia nut cookies.  Nice.  Let's just try them.  Just to see if it would be a good operating system name.  What do you think?  I'm allergic.  To macadamia nuts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh my God.  Or to cookies?  No, macadamia, no, not cookies.  Can't you tell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, you're like a skin and bone.  Somebody in the chat rooms,  Chris Michael said he got his fine fight.  And you're right, he does not own a Nexus 6.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, conspiracy theory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I hope you're gonna make back that, what, $600  on your hopefully cheaper cell phone service.  Yeah, that's gonna take a while.  Since you have to buy a whole phone.  I don't think it's that much cheaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This Apple watch is looking mighty fine right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's square, I can't deal with square.  Look, before all this Apple watch stuff,  we would do the Android Wear watches,  and if it was square, it was an immediate no,  get out of my face with that square watch.  And then Apple came along and all of a sudden,  it's okay, square's cool now.  All of a sudden, square's fine.  All the kids are wearing square watches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it would be neat if they actually did  $1400 worth of technology.  What I'm sure they're gonna do is take a $200 watch  and put it in a $1000 case.  Or, what is the Moto now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Moto 360 is now 150?  Something ridiculous they love, yeah.  Because, of course, they're blown them out.  Do you think they'll announce something?  No, Moto doesn't usually do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they wouldn't announce it tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a right now feature.  You just plug your lollipop phone.  Yeah, that was a lollipop thing.  They announced this last year.  And because we're moving at the speed of car manufacture,  it has only come out right now,  which is just excruciating.  So I have to buy a new Hyundai?  Yes.  Or you can get a really horrible ripoff Pioneer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's an aftermarket head-end.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The $700 one has a resistive touchscreen.  So, you know.  Resistive is the worst.  Right, a plastic bubble that you poke.  For a capacitive that'll run you $1,400.  Oh, yai, yai, caramba.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We had Phil Nickinson of Android Central  was on the show last night.  He's been playing around with that  for the last couple of months from what I understand.  The $700 resistive screen.  He said it's actually not that bad  considering the fact that you don't do a lot of fine  kind of dragging on it.  You're kind of ham-fisting controls when you're in the car.  So like just going boom on a. $1,100.  You know what I mean?  It's different.  But no, $700 is expensive for something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A Nexus 7 was $200.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's that or buying a Hyundai.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  True, yeah.  But.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, yes.  I was at that event yesterday.  I wasn't sure what time.  Ah.  But yes, Chevy.  So Chevy's doing 14 models,  which is basically their entire lineup.  Cause I mean, they only have like 16 cars or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now I do want a Camaro.  Yeah, there you go.  You could get that.  Yeah.  Cause that's it.  I'm not gonna buy a Chevy Spark.

Transcript:  It's a little cooler than a Hyundai.  I get a Volt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'd get a Volt.  Volt's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The new Volts are weird.  They are?  Are they?  They look like Honda Civics with crazy girls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, they have one.  Yeah, they have one there.  Year after year.

Transcript:  Yeah.  The Volt, the Suburban, the Colorado, the Tahoe,  the Silverado, the Camaro, the Malibu and the Cruze.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Unless it's a Transit van,  it'll probably run Android Auto and CarPlay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm really feeling like this is the way I wanna go  because I don't care what kind of car,  and I have a very fancy Audi.  It's built-in system is junk  compared to the state of the art in a mobile system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nobody over there has ever heard of like a 60 frames  per second animation or smooth scrolling or anything like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you kidding?  It does have Google Earth in it.

Transcript:  This is where we...  So I can see the tops of roofs as I drive down the street.  Didn't it drive you into a lake?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it didn't drive me into a lake.  I was driving down my driveway.  It thought I was in a lake.  Right.  Well, there's a difference.  I was dry.  Okay.  That got fixed.  That was fixed.  That wasn't Google's fault.  It was just an antenna, bad antenna.  Finally, the Audi people said,  oh yeah, we found it.  It's a bad antenna.  They replaced it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not been a problem.  It's good that your car has connectivity because...  Yeah, 3G T-Mobile.  Hyundai, they're like,  in the summer, you'll be able to upgrade the car on your own  because they've sold the cars already.  They're like, you'll be able to upgrade the car on your own  by going to your computer,  plugging in a USB stick,  downloading the software,  sneaker netting it out.  Doing an image for your car.  To your driveway.  I can do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I never had the nerve quite to do that.  And I'm like, the car really doesn't have wifi?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I have a T-Mobile SIM in my car.  Okay.  And a phone bill for your car.

Okay, right.  Right, apps will be able to like, well, eventually.  Apps will be able to supply Google Now cards on their own.  Yeah, we knew that.  Right, there's a pilot program going on already.  But I mean, that's what this is.  It's just stuff that they're working on and all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you have a macro key on your phone  for Aparna Chenapragada?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I have a copy paste.  A copy paste, yeah.  And extensive Googling to make sure  you get all the files and the right spot.  No, I'm excited about the virtual reality stuff  just because we know next to nothing  and it's super scary.  Good, good, good.  Changes subject there, Phil.  Very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that I've been told by people in the know  that we're gonna see a surprisingly large amount  of cardboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, who was it that just left  head of Google search design to go work  on the cardboard team?  On the cardboard OS.  And I'm forgetting his name and I'm very sad because  We had it on the rundown last week, I forget.  But yeah, like, I mean, you're gonna go from  billions of people to this little tiny cardboard team  from what we know.  Well, that's the point.  Which says like they must be working on some crazy  new thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If cardboard equals search, that's pretty good.  Search?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there's been what, a Reuters report that said  they were working on a VR operating system.  Because right now you  Wow.  Right now VR apps are really weird.  Like especially

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're Android apps, right?  And with two windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, but like launching them and getting into that mode  is super clunky.  Like, you know, you take the phone out and you start it  and you stick it in the box and make sure everything's  set up and the Oculus Rift is even worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It doesn't have like an RFID tag to launch.  I thought it launched.  You can, yeah, they've worked on weird

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  little launchers and stuff, but  this was supposedly like a whole operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, F and done, Jason.  How do you, when you wear, he has Gear VR.  How do you, do you launch the Gear VR app  before you put it in the helmet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When you connect it to the helmet

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It has RFID.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When you connect it to the mic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It senses it.  It says, oh, I'm in VR.  Thank you.  That's going to be obsolete tomorrow.  No, no, that's the  Oh, you got the S6 version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is this the S6 version?  Oh, okay.  Fancy.  Will it work with an edge?  Yeah.  Do you mind if I wear it?  Yeah, you might want to take the cover off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why?  It's not a, there's nothing going on.  Do you need the cover?  Don't you need?  No.  What if I wear it like this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That looks great.  That's how the kids wear it these days.  That's how the DJs wear it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Again, like the fingerprint stuff,  this is a proprietary solution  and Google kind of wants to do their own thing  and get the whole ecosystem on.  It's much more comfortable than the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's got nice eye cups.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's weightless, it's smaller.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it was 200 bucks, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How much weight does the other phone have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The phone's nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have an S6, I wonder if I should get this.  Why do you keep getting it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You should put it on without the phone  and that looks great.  Oh, there's USB on one side.  You get giant goggles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I have to put it in the right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did I do it right?  That's gotta be right.  Yeah, it seems to have like attached.  Looks good with the S6 back in there.  Now what do I do?  Oh, it's talking to me.  Welcome to virtual reality.  Have you used this yet?  No, I just  Am I being the first person to use it?  You shouldn't do that, Jason.  You should get to do the  I already pulled up all the plastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Leo, you saw it with the Gear VR.  Oh.  It's gotta be illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's discussions about it from people like  I'm the guy who sits on a plane with a Gear VR.  Yeah.  Where do I get one of these?  There's gonna be 20 pictures of you right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I feel bad for whoever sits next to you.  You'll probably bump it into one.  Yeah, right.  With your head.  It'll be off in your VR wonderland.  That's all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, plus the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, because there's nothing in it.  You just have a phone.  How are you liking your S6?  Have you had any lag problems or anything like that?  No.  I think they've licked those.  It's not doing anything.  It's in configuration mode.  You gotta take glasses off, right?  Oh, you're doing it?  Yeah.  Oh, that doesn't look at all dorky.  Yeah.  You look like Bender.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Doesn't he?  It totally looks like Bender.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What does the outside world look like right now?  Looks like a plywood scene.  It's all kinds of little images.  Oh my gosh.  If you get the angle just right, it's giant eyeballs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I really want this now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Leo, did you notice any sort of difference  in the clarity of anything that you saw?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It looked like it's still a little low resolution.  Yeah, it's the same resolution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a 2K screen or whatever, so it's not gonna be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like 720p.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you wear glasses, what does it do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It has a focus ring up here.  Oh, okay.  So as long as you're...  I'm gonna...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the focus length on this one, Leo,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  is greater distance than the first one.  Now, is this the Innovator Edition for Galaxy S6 Edge?  Yeah.  I can have it tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Uh-oh, I'll do it, Leo.  Go ahead.  I got nothing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can just watch it through the whole Google IOs  because I can watch this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why don't you wait one day and see what comes out tomorrow?  That's true.  So that it's not instantly...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly what I would do.  Instantly obsolete.  I got the V.O.!

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  Wait, do it so that they announce virtual reality stuff.  It's dependent on you.  Right.  Take one for the chief.  Wash your car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where did you get yours?  Did you get it from...  Huh?  Best Buy.  They have it in stock?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Impulse Buy.  Shifting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  I see two to five weeks, but you know, they lie.  It's Amazon Prime.  As soon as I log in, it'll be tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So that lenses thing that reminded me  of an art project I saw this week.  This is this thing called smoraandupsidedown.com.  And what he did was, it's part of the Art of Resonance thing  at Autodesk P9.  He took the photo booth effects on the Mac or on iOS  and recreated them with physical bits of glass  so you can just look through some lenses  and have your face go square  and have giant googly eyes and things like that.  Smaller.  Really, just looking through a pane of thing?  Yeah, so it's a...  Smaller and upside down.  It's a big lump of resin that is a lens  that does the effects to your heads that the...  Oh, here we go.  So it's a funhouse mirror.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's a lens rather than a mirror, yes.  Smallerandupsidedown.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I thought that was funny.  As it was, it was fascinating because...  You're easily amused.  When those things came out whenever it was,  five years ago, seven years ago,  we'll play with them for a couple of days  and then use many more.  It was, it sold more Macs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The photo booth sold more Macs  than any other app on the Macintosh.  Oh, I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But for me, it was this weird thing of like,  I remember playing with that with my kids.  It's like strange nostalgia, but creative physical.  I think that was quite a fun art project.  Yeah, that's neat.  So that's...  But when Jeff put those lenses on his face,  they reminded me of the,  my eyes just got really big thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, are we eating the all about Android  white chocolate macadamia cookies?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, you're the first to christen the macadamia nut cookies  on any Twitch show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who brought those?  I thank you, whoever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This was a terrible idea.  Did you bring them?  I'm tempted to eat on air.  No.  No, go ahead and eat, who cares?  Yeah, who cares?  I eat all the time.  I'm a professional podcaster personally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're a professional.  No.  All right.  What else?  Google I.O.  This is, this is, we're not,  this is gonna be a five hour show.  Yeah.  Smart home stuff.  Smart home?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's fun.  So Google has, who have they acquired?  It's Nest and Dropcam and this company called Revolve  which made a smart home hub.  So kind of a thing that ties all of your...  Like smart things.  They'll know everything about you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They'll know when you have sex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sure.  Hey, I'd like to know when I have sex.  If you wear the Fitbit or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Please wake me and tell me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Last night really?  I don't remember that.  Okay.  Just checking.  Macadamia Break Weekly.  I like the name.  The new thing.  The new thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is Brillo, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, the Internet of Things OS.  Now is this related to Android you think or is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What the report said was that it's being made  by the Android team.  Why they did not just come out and say  it will be based on Android is a little weird  but I can't imagine it wouldn't be.  But yeah, it's kind of like when Android started  where you have this...  You have a bunch of OEMs making all this weird software  that they're not used to making.  So you have a lock company having to make  this Internet of Things software.  And Google just wants to come in and say,  here's our software, it's free.  Use it as a standard.  And everybody will use it to make your light bulb  communicate with your dishwasher and all that stuff.  But that's kind of what Microsoft's doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're giving away Windows 10 for Raspberry Pi.  They have two or three IOT SKUs for Windows.  Not that I...  Who would want to run Windows in an embedded environment?  I mean it just doesn't seem...  It seems like a little...  But there's I guess every ATM machine in the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but I mean Android seems like overkill  for this stuff too when you can do it all  on a little microcontroller and whatever else.  So I mean all we basically know is that Google's  stripping down probably Android to run on little things.  But we don't know why or why it's supposed to be better

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  or anything like that.  If I were John Chan, if I were the CEO of BlackBerry,  I would say, I would be putting all my arrows  behind QNX for IOT.  They have a real time, really nice real time  operating system they bought.  And you're absolutely right.  It needs to be something designed for embedded systems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but then you need to make money if you're BlackBerry.  Right, where Google doesn't.  Right, Google will just make money other ways.  So you know, that's how Android works.  Here it's free.  It's free, we have too much money, we're good.  We have too much.  And then everyone else is just like, oh.  Too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And what else?  This is, I'm excited actually.  We start our coverage 930 Pacific, 1230 Eastern time,  1730 UTC, right after TNT, I'll be doing TNT tomorrow.  And then Gina Trapani, Ron Richards, and Aaron Newcomb  and I will cover Google I.O. all two and a half hours.  If we start at 930, we should be done by lunchtime.  Yep.  Good luck.  Yeah, if lunchtime's two in the afternoon.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then there's millions of sessions to watch  and go to and everything else.  Did we talk about privacy controls?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, who cares?  Google controls my privacy.  That's the truth.  Well, but they have to respond to what people  are very much concerned about.  Bloomberg said they're gonna give users greater control  over what apps know, what apps can do.  But I feel like the controls are pretty good.  How are they gonna get, how would they be different?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's all or nothing right now.  They used to have app ops where you could go through  and toggle, you know, I don't want Facebook  to use my camera, I don't want it to use my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apple kind of does that.  You have to ask, Apple, it'll say in the manifest  what it wants, but then in order to get camera access  or contact access, it will ask.  You could say no and the app will continue on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it may not, if it's Instagram,  it may not be very useful, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Where with Android when they did app ops,  you said no and the app crashed.  So then they took app ops away.  And they're gonna bring it back, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, we'll find.  You know what, speculation is one thing.  It all happens tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If there were gonna be a big surprise,  and you have not, even you have not gotten this coupon.  What would that be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google Now.  They can't do hardware.  I mean, it really bugs me that they're gonna have  a fingerprint API and know nothing  that has a fingerprint reader.  I would love to see.  Like an extra 6.2 or.  Or some kind of.  How about a little.  A plugin thing. A security dongle for you.  That's not good.  That's no good.  It's for developers, they could test at least.  I guess, well they might do that.  They might do that.  The Chromecast would kind of be surprising.  I mean, they've talked about it, but I.  I would think we would hear more by now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What would.  How about an Amazon Echo?  You know, I always, I really thought Google let Amazon  get away with Echo.  Because that, Google Now in an Amazon Echo.  Watch him carefully, I'm gonna talk.  What?  Google Now.  Just see what his response is.  Google Now in a hardware device that sits in your house  and listens would be really cool.  I think we're.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That would be a thing to do with the Chromecast, right?  If you put a little microphone in the Chromecast  so that it could pick up stuff.  Behind your television.  Behind my TV, yes.  Hey, hey.  Yo, yo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I hope you.  It says I do.  I think we are due a smart home hub.  The Xbox does it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would be good.  So a hub that you could talk to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, since they bought the SmartThings competitor.  And they have Nest.  And they have all the smart home stuff  that's not doing anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google Glass version two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They just rebooted and.  I love that reaction.  Seriously.  I mean, they like just rebooted  and they have Tony Fidel in charge now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I actually just realized.  I have a museum of dead technology in my office.  I now have to add the glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  Next to the Newton.  Hey Jason, when you're done with your glass,  would you give it to me for my cabinet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I still use it.  He does.  I use it.  The only thing I use it for is recording video  when I want a first person kind of recorded experience.  It is a very nice.  When we did that great ad.  It's nice for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For a blue apron he was showing cooking.  And it's so funny because you put the glass on recorded  and you cooked a whole meal because you had both hands.  And in order to do the same thing,  we were doing a tip for the new screensavers  and I was showing stir fry, set up a camera,  how to work around a tripod.  We didn't know if the angles are right.  It was a fixed angle.  Oh, it was such a pain.  It's the easiest thing in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, GoPro's are 200 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a hat.  Well, I do have a GoPro with a head mount.  I could have done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's not $1,400.  And it's not a Nexus.  It's not a Galaxy Nexus camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The quality is good though.  Look at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sort of.  It's a little green.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a camera from a 2011 smartphone.  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Galaxy Nexus basically.  But hey, I had it on me and all I had to do  was make sure it was charged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The camera jiggles.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why didn't I think of the GoPro?  I have the head mount and everything.  What was I thinking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You bought into the hype.  I bought into the hype.  Well, that's what Leo's all about.  I am the hype.  You'll go buy any hype design.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There was a time when flip cams were a big deal  Remember those?  And then everybody had one in their phone.  So, easy to buy the hype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Matt Cutts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's gotta be,  I think he's gonna be the first person on the Mars  or something.  He's working on something super secret.  He's gotta be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was an article,  and in fact it mentioned him a few months ago,  saying Google puts people on the beach  because they keep them out of competitors' hands.  And they just say, enjoy, relax.  And if you think of something you wanna do, okay,  but you don't have to do anything.  I feel like that's what Matt's doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know, I think it is.  And I can see how, I always said,  but my line about Matt is always  that you would think he'd be the meanest person on Earth,  but he's the nicest guy on Earth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, we love Matt.  And Matt, if the next thing is like doing podcasts,  you know where your friends are.  You better or else they'll hate you.  Search Engine Land says that there is a new head of  search spam at Google, which was Matt's job.  So, Google has not named that person  because he's not public like Matt was.  Matt was really about, he did the webmaster videos  and all that great stuff.  He appeared here all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you're gonna have just rulings come down  from anonymous Google web spam person?  Hey, if I were them, I would do that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wouldn't you?  You don't wanna be known as the guy.  Be hounded by SEO experts all day.  You're going down the mall.  You're outside Hot Topic.  And somebody says, hey, you're Matt Cutts, aren't you?  That would not be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's actually Matt Cutts and he's just tired of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, that's the best theory of all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's still Matt Cutts.  He just doesn't want you to know.  That's how I wouldn't be surprised.  That's brilliant.  Google has new head of web spam.  And by the way, Danny Sullivan, if anybody knows his Danny,  won't be the new Matt Cutts.  So Matt Cutts still gets to be the old Matt Cutts.  It's the old Matt Cutts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google's looking for a new head of PR.  Maybe it should be Matt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Matt would be great for that.  So Matt is one of the first 100 Googlers,  maybe one of the first 10.  Was it that soon?  Yeah, he was very early on.  He told us, I've forgotten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm sure it was quite first time, but he was very early.  He was very early.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So he probably doesn't have to do much.  He can probably just hang out.  Yeah, in Silicon Valley, they do that.  Remember the guy, Big Head, he's beached at Hoolie.  And he has a place up on the roof  where the other people are beached at Hoolie.  So speaking of roofs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Up on the roof.  I went to Facebook.  That was yesterday, how was that?  It was great, it was fascinating.  I was talking with some people there  just about stuff that I, wonky stuff I do,  but I got to walk the roof.  The garden roof.  The garden roof, yeah, it's quite amazing.  The building is weird because as you know, when you go in.  It's like paint stripping.  First, it's a parking lot.  It's nothing but a parking lot in the first level.  So it's a really kind of ugly thing.  It's a very parked lot. That's very hideous.  And then you go up, plywood, and what they said was,  they purposely made it look incredibly unfinished  because that's what Facebook is.  Facebook is always learning and changing.  And so it's nice, it's very nice.  And then the roof is just, the amount of dirt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have like this much soil.  It's a green building.  It's probably part of the LEED certification.  But it's like that much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They were digging a hole for a trench something.  It was quite a dig.  That's gotta be a lot of weight.  It's lovely to walk around.  You know who has that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ford does, and the Rouge plant.  They're growing the fibers they use in the seats.  No.  Nine acres crisscrossed with trails.  Did you take a walk?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh yeah, I walked.  I was meeting with somebody and he said,  we want to walk while we meet.  So we went and walked around the roof.  It was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I see what you're saying.  This looks like a crappy  Silicon Valley apartment complex  with the garage on the first level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So then you go up a stairway and it's  It's like a Motel 8.  by raw plywood and you get up  and it's even rarer than this.  Rarer.  Rarer.  Rarer.  Rarer.  So the beams are all still bare  and have the chalk marks on them  and all that kind of stuff.  But it's very nice space.  That is so beautiful.  They don't have a golf course up there?  And it's unbelievably long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A putting range?  They should.  They really should.  I'm witnessing the bet there.  Little sand trap?  If Google, I mean Facebook were a real company,  they would, but because they're hip,  they don't play golf.  They play, they probably have a ultimate frisbee course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you know, over the old days  when Mark wanted to hire you,  he'd take a walk with you.  So now I guess he has the place to walk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's Steve Jobs thing.  We're actually looking at using Facebook's Parse,  which we keep hearing about every year at F8.  They bought them a couple of years ago.  We're trying to figure out a way with our apps,  because we're gonna do new apps,  once the new site launches,  that you could use the app on say your iPad  and then pick up your S6  and it would leave off where you left off.  But in order to do that, you'd have to have an account.  Which is a good thing.  Parse does this for free for like the first million users.  Like Facebook just like says, yeah, whatever.  So I think we might do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So then your account is actually a Facebook account.  So you're excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I asked about that  and you could sign up with Twitter or Facebook  or have a standalone.  And I asked, I said,  this is a shared data with Facebook?  He said, no.  So you're right though, Kevin.  I wanna look into that.  Cause I don't want,  I know our audience doesn't wanna be channeled  into that ecosystem.  But that would give you notifications too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So whereas at Google, you go to a place  to pick up the wires and things you need.  At Facebook, they have vending machines for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait, meaning like I need an ethernet cable  to run down to the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or they have phone covers or things.  I didn't stare at it.  When you need a USB-C function.  They have a model.  I think you've had those too.  They do?  Oh, I didn't see that.  I wasn't allowed in that room, I guess.  They have a model of the whole building  and the model itself is just amazing.  It's phenomenal.  Did you meet with Mark?  No, but I saw him.  So he's still in a fishbowl office.  So I walked by and we waved to each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did it look like the office in the social network?  I can't remember what the office was.  Was it the retired Eduardo Saverin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No.  No.  The office he had in Palo Alto was the same thing.  It was a three-sided fishbowl.  Wow.  And so we walked by and waved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not as opulent as Apple's new headquarters  or Google's new.  I would not call it opulent at all.  No, it's interesting.  No, it's good for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It sends a message that says we're in progress.  Yeah, break things.  Yeah, it says break things, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like that, actually.  I think it's risky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's always been said that  when the company builds  its massive corporate landmark headquarters,  that's the first sign it's over.  It's the beginning of the end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's caddy corner from one hacker way  from the most recent headquarters.  Good.  Do they keep it?  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.  They're just growing.  Yeah, this is building 20, so it's not like building one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Building 20.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's why they moved down there  so they could expand it to the swamp, wasn't it?  Yeah, boy, there's swamps there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, let's take a break.  We'll be right back.  We've got more.  Kevin Marks is here.  It's always great to have the Tumbler himself.  Mr. IndieWeb.

Transcript:  I grew up in South Jersey part-time, in Cinnamonston.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was listening to Jungle Run  at 192 kilobits per second,  90 to 24 bits yesterday.  That sounded so good.  I felt like I was in Jersey.  I could smell the boardwalk.  Oh my God.  And the taffy.  But there's a whole farm area.  People think Jersey, they think factories, they think...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I live out in what?  It's beautiful.  The farmland, yeah.  It's a beautiful state.  The garden state.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's South Jersey.  There's like a solid line.  South Jersey's all pine trees.  Yeah, there's a solid line  where it becomes all factories immediately.  That's the pine barrens are out there.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  That was the greatest, the pine barrens.  Mr. TV critic.  Oh, yes, yes, right.  Greatest episode of The Sopranos.  Yes.  Where Pauly Walnuts...  Stuck in the pine barrens.

Google has patented, patents,  I don't like to do these stories  because as everybody knows,  patents have nothing to do with products.  It's just the lawyers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then people, the writers read way too much into them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they have patented a way to predict  what you like by accent.  And the story says that this is offensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why is it offensive?  If you say tomato.  Profiling by accent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Profiling.  No, it's not offensive at all.  No, it's not.  I would like a nice restaurant for tonight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to go to Amadeus.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They have a very good pasta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's where you would want to go though, man.  I feel like the Italians would know  where the good pasta restaurants are.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And if you talk like a truck driver,  you're gonna get the best truck stop, dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I doubt very much this is an actual product,  but it's kind of a fun thing.  The patent implies the Germans prefer German food.  I think that's safe.  I think so too.  Fried food at least.  Is music coming out of you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not me, I think it's that computer over there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, careful.  That guy's, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what he's following.  He came in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I'm imagining like a My Fair Lady service  where you have to teach people to give different accents  to their socials.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I governor, I like a mate pie.  Ow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How about a grammar researcher?  If you don't use whom properly, we won't serve you.  Yeah, that's good.  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I know, if you use whom properly,  they mark up the price a bit.  That's the target.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Kevin, did you see John Oliver, not John Oliver's,  I'm sorry, Bill Maher's British accent?  Why does everybody have a British accent routine?  No.  Oh, oh, brilliant.  Was this on his TV show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Quickly, search.  I'm just abused that there's this assumption  there's one British accent.  Oh God, there's so many, that's the beauty of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, so.  You've got the Dick Van Dyke Mary Poppins accent.  Okay, okay.  You've got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Look up Brits for brains.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Brits for brains.  You know what I like is all of the,  it's changed in the 50s,  but prior to the method acting,  every actor in Hollywood had a faint British accent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oops, I'm sorry, look up Bill Maher Brits for brains.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got it, okay.  Let's watch, the luck of the iris.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, we sure jumped that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, I never watched.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I never watched.  Someone has to tell me why Americans  won't take anything seriously  unless it's delivered with a British accent.  There you go, killing words.  Why in movies, even ones where the actors are Americans.  People who play my secrets.  Playing people who are not British,  they still put on a British accent.  It's true.  Here's Brad Pitt as Achilles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My armadillos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My brothers of the sword.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My brothers of the sword.  He's from the Midwest.  And he's a Greek.  In ancient Greeks were not.  But neither were they from Notting Hill,  so why does he have to say sword?  Sword.  Why is sword more serious than sword?  Here's Marlon Brando as Superman's dad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  All that I have, all that I've learned,  everything I feel.  Everything I feel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Brando, the greatest actor ever.  You mean even he can't talk American?  Did biblical people have British accents?  Jennifer Connelly here in Noah?  He's not from America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Jor-El's from Krypton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Her 600 year old husband is putting  three million animals on a houseboat.  But she's using a British accent  because she doesn't want to sound silly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's true, so there you go.  That's why we have Kevin Marks on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's why, because it makes us sound smarter.  He actually makes us sound stupid  next to him.  Yeah, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Periscope has come to Android.  Sad.  At last, at last.  At last.  Just before the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just before the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you a per, well, Meerkat's been out  for a while on the Android.  Which he didn't do either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So we could simulcast on Periscope right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know what I think of these live streaming apps.  Of course, I spent a lot of money, time, and effort  creating an entire live streaming studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now you're ahead of the trend again,  saying get rid of live streaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At least my video is sideways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's one of Mary Meeker's points in her thing today  is the rise of vertical video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, thank you, Mary Meeker.  She is a futurist, isn't she?  So she does this every year, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  She just dropped the slide bomb at Recode.  Oh, let's go look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is a slide bomb too,  because she's not notorious for aesthetics.  So Mary Meeker's slide share 2015.  She is what?  She's an analyst, right?  A stock analyst?  But she's famous.  She's with Kleiner Perkins.  She's a VC, okay.  She's famous because she's gotten things right in the past.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are you periscoping?  We're already on the internet.  How much it irritates you, so I thought I would do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It doesn't, it's...  So that was free.  That was free, so you just downloaded an app and boom.  How do I stop this thing?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, continue.  Give Jeff heart.  I'm trying to run the slide now, hang on.  Here we go, internet, here it is.  Internet Trends 2015.  She gave it at Code Yesterday.  Outline, internet, two thirds of a generation in.  Key internet trends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So slide 22.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Slide 22, should I jump?  Lots of people using the internet.  Lot of them on mobile.  Companies.  Too much information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Rich.  Actually, you can do this,  we can do this as a blip, this is great, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Internet, oh, here's the evolution of content discovery,  the VCR in 1975.  Streaming radio, 2012.  Now it's Chromecast.  Sector of economy. Society has arrived.  The internet is 100% consumer, but only 10% policy thinking.  Key internet trends.  Lots of mass.  Smart throne subscriptions.  A lot of them.  Up, up, up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Average GDP per capita in five countries  with a greater than 50 million population, 44,000

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  in the countries with, I don't know what that means.  Can you do a Mary Meeker slideshow in four minutes?  People in the developing world

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  have less money than the developed world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, people have less money in the third world.  Okay, time spent per adult user per day  with digital media in the USA is going up.  Is this a good one for you, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, mobile is a big slice of that going up too.  But you know what's not going up?  Other connected devices.  Advertising and monetization equals something.  Time spent, oh, here we go, this is what I like,  in media versus percent of advertising spending.  Doment advertisers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is the slide she does every year  where she keeps saying there's this giant opportunity  in mobile advertising and it never appears.  She's had this same slide pretty much for like four years now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She doesn't have to make a new slide.  She is terrible at slides, I just want to tell you.  These are the worst.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are we at 22 yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that the one?  No things, vendors, brands,  consumers should be excited about.  Ah, this is the stuff we care about.  Get ready, get excited.  What should I be excited about?  Pinterest is adding cinematic pins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  These aren't very exciting, these ones.  This is like advertisers should be excited about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google Local, ad inventory ad, Facebook carousel ad,  five second video ads, buy buttons on Twitter,  Facebook and Google, we mentioned that,  that Google's going to put buy buttons in their ads.  I'm not excited.  Something funny happened on the way to the small screen.  She got a little joke in video then.  Here's the vertical video slide you mentioned, video now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, the next one is like percentage of it  is vertical or something.  Though I'm not sure, this is time spent on things  where we can't do time spent on video.  Time spent by orientation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  This is funny given this woman is dedicated

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to a misuse of bar charts.  That's not a bad bar chart.  Stacked bar chart, I don't like stacked bar charts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So 29% of video is wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  When it's something like this,  where the top one is moving and so on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  Top one's moving.  Horizontal screens are losing ground to vertical screens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is what these analysts people do all day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  2010 was, oh you idiot, you're holding it wrong.  Right.  2015 is, this is the new way to hold it.  This is the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've been saying that for a long time.  So the idiot column is growing.  So get the next slide here.  Full screen vertical video ads on Snapchat.  Nine times higher competition completion rate  versus horizontal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's the thing that made me cause the button,  I can never work out how to dismiss anything on Snapchat.  You quit.  Because it's the entire screen.  Right.  Just the entire screen.  It's like with the other one there's a back button.  But interesting that that makes some sense to me  and it's something that we see in the periscope things as well.  It's like, oh, if your screen's that way around,  we'll as well fit it up with video too.  Even if it means you're looking through a pillar.

Transcript:  Reimagining continues.  Forget enterprise.  Enterprise software used to be about  making existing work more efficient.  Now the opportunity for software  is to transform the work itself.  That's completely meaningless.

I'm going too fast.  Facebook messaging, Snapchat, one user, another user,  context identity, more up close and personal,  select top countries for mobile subscriptions,  messaging plus notifications equals a lot of text.  Reimagining content, Pinterest growth, music,  holidays, sports, this is better than Google Zeitgeist.  You know what, there's still 137 to go.  Oh jeez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, you know what?  People listen to her because she,  users generating their content, a la Periscope Meerkat,  are recreating their internet.  What the hell does that mean?  No, no, I understand that.  In other words, it's IndieWeb.  No, but it's what...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's my excuse and I've seen to it.  It's basically saying that people are reinventing  their image now.  And not using the...

Transcript:  What's the power of myth?  Joseph...  Campbell?  Campbell said, if you don't like the cult,  the dominant culture, make your own.  Yeah.  It's what geeks have been doing since day one.  Users are recreating the internet.  Reimagining internet usage.  12 to 24 year olds remain trendsetters.  No.  I hate that.  Social media usage among American ute.

Transcript:  It's funny, Michael, our 12 year old came in the room  yesterday in my office and said,  how many phones do you have?  And he said, there's five phones here.  I said, yeah, and I got two in my pocket.  True story.  And you never call anybody.  No, I hate the phone.  When I wake up, the first thing I do is reach  for my smart phone, 80%.  I spend more than two hours a day using my smartphone.  78%, we would all be in this.  Oh, God, yeah.  Of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sure, the alarm goes off,  so you're gonna turn your phone off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're not even halfway through this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is just, they don't actually have like,  to communicate with other people about stuff.  Unless that's the case.  No, look at these, this is millennial smart,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but these are smart.  This is the camera, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, but one of my big use cases is sending a picture  of something to my wife saying,  is this the thing you wanted, or vice versa?  Her saying, have you seen this thing?  Actually, like, taking photographs of stuff.  Oh, we do that all the time, yeah.  Yeah, and they don't have a category for that,  so I think they didn't ask us the question.  Or maybe that's under to post on social media.  This is Periscope, there's a picture of Periscope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh my God.  Well, there you go, here's the numbers.  Here's what counts.  India, well actually look at that, India, that's important.  In 2014, 198 million internet users.  In China, it's 632, but more than 45% penetration.  So the real growth market here is India.  India is gonna be big time.  And we've mentioned that before.  Yeah.  And then Nigeria, we talked about M-Pesa on a tweet  on Sunday, Indonesia, Nigeria, Mexico.  And India, by the way, only 16% of the population  has internet, so you have huge opportunity.

Speaker: UNKNOWN

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The future is here.  The future is now.  Okay, we can wrap this up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm exhausted.  We haven't talked about a thing in the rundown,  which is fine.  I don't know, is there anything here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sad, Mandriva is gone bankrupt, gone belly up.  Mandriva was the distro, Mandrake distro of Linux  that we installed most often on the screensavers  many moons ago.  It was the easiest to install.  It came to a world where Slackware  was the dominant Linux distribution  and impossible to install.  And Mandrake came along and really made it easy.  Red Hat came after.  I think, was Mandrake, maybe you remember, Kevin,  a version of Red Hat chatroom would remember?  Don't remember.  Yeah, they sold Mandrake at Walmart, says Doug PDX.  I remember that, you could go to Staples  and get a Mandrake box.  That's right, I forgot that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Pretty bad memories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I think there's a new, basically,  if you're in the market for that,  you basically just put a Chromebook these days.  That's the thing.  The Linux on the desktop is here,  it's just that it's Linux on the desktop  and Linux on the phone.  It won.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, it won, but you don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.  And to some extent it rung  because it stopped sort of slavishly mistaking Windows,  which was always the problem with the Linux desktops.  They were like one version of Windows behind.  Love Mike Masnick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In terms of UX.  Tech dirt.  He's talking about the New York Times,  they did a profile of Fusion, which is this new network,  partly owned by Univision, partly owned by Disney.  Yes.  They hired some of the best people out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Incredible smart people, Felix Salmon is one, Anna Holmes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  From the Atlantic, what's his name?  Kevin Roos is there.  However, from the leaked Sony emails,  not faked, leaked Sony emails,  according to two senior Fusion staff members  who spoke on the condition of anonymity.  Because they were going to be beheaded.  Disney put the organization on notice,  it would not take kindly to coverage  that might dent its standing with consumers  after Fusion published several stories  about the hacker document trove from Sony.  Fusion is not alone in negotiations  to create a vice cable channel.  Disney and Hearst insisted on a clause  protecting the companies in the event  that vice content embarrasses Hearst or Disney in any way.  God am I glad to be independent.  So this is how we started,  talking about how these big corporations  do not understand editorial integrity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It comes down to one person protecting you.  When I was at People Magazine, which I confess,  my editor, Pat Ryan, may she rest in peace,  God bless her, my mentor, would protect me.  When I would criticize it as HBO,  Michael Fuchs, the head of HBO, would scream up,  fire that bastard and come back down.  And she would say, F you back, and it would go back down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But who's protecting people now?  Is there somebody?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What I'm saying is it comes to a brave boss  or brave editor who, but the most insidious thing  in a company like that is not necessarily what's ordered,  it's what people think might be ordered.  It's the chill that you put on yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Caesar's wife must be above suspicion.  I don't know what that means.  Where does that come from?  It's vaguely Shakespearean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was with some Americans who moved to the Guardian,  and they said that the British,  see what you think about this, Kevin,  throw them absolutely nuts,  is the Brits would come up and say, you okay?  And the Americans would say, do you know something?  I don't know, is there something wrong?  Do I look bad?  And I found out it was just the British way to say,  how are you?  True, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Interesting.  I don't recognize that one.  You don't, okay.  Maybe they're trying to sound American.  Maybe they're trying to sort of say something  to the Americans in some sort of reverse cultural thing  of like, oh, Americans are okay.  You're not okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's not that.  Yeah, it's that problem, yeah.  Is that, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Comcast, knowing that soon,  the FCC will be taking comments,  complaints really, under the new net neutrality regime,  which begins in a few weeks.  Comcast quickly, just the other day,  fixed up its interconnection with level three.  They've been going back and forth,  and a lot of this had to do with,  originally with Netflix,  just in general with this whole idea of gatekeeping,  I think, and have paid tears.  So that's good.  You want to clean all that stuff up  before there's actually teeth in the regulations.  You wouldn't want that to get in the way.  We mentioned give all acquired by knowingly.  Actually, you did more than I thought.  Yeah, see?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're pretty good as a host.  Yeah, don't knock it.  Don't knock it.  You ought to try doing this for a living.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We accidentally blew through the list, didn't we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we blew through your list.  And I can't wait for tomorrow.  It's going to be exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's going to be a crazy, crazy  18-minute with bloody fingers.  The new photo app.  Everybody knows that, right?  Yeah, Google Plus is losing its photo section.  Well, that's the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are they taking it out of Google Plus, you think?  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Of course.  I mean, what do you mean?  It's going to be in both places?  I would imagine it would share to both.  Yeah, right.  But it's going to be like, it'll be a neutral kind of place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Bradley is in charge, I think, of photos and streams.  Streams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, Google Plus is going to be just a stream,  and it's not going to go anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How many crossing stream jokes has he endured?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We will watch that with interest,  because that would, I think, be the beginning  of the end for Google Plus,  if they take the photos capabilities out  and externalize them into a photos app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think Google's done with artificially propping up  Google Plus, though.  I mean, they just did the tweets and search results thing  the other day, and they're just like...  Twitter won.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But the issue is that they do need streams.  Facebook is a stream of attention.  Twitter is a stream of attention, and so on and so on.  Google does not have a stream of attention.  Google's still based on a page-based web.  Well, they have a stream of attention to Google now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're actually building a different platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How much time do you spend with Google now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's the Google way of looking at it.  The point is not to dominate your thing.  It's just to send you the bits that matter.  Right, but what I'm saying is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't Google now the results, not the end?  I mean, it's what you're using that to get is stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The problem is that the advertising model  is going to be based on attention streams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I don't think they put ads in Google now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No.  Well, they kind of do.  I mean, they say...  Really?  Sure, they say places to go and visit and stuff like that.  Well, that's not paid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, is that paid?  Is that paid?  It doesn't say paid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you know it's paid?  That would be not bad.  That would not be cool, man,  if it was paid and they didn't say it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is the first time since I sat on the show  where I just had...  You have a ton of stuff in there.  No, I don't have that much.  It's because you're traveling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm traveling, that's right.  Google now is so much better when you're traveling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't have Edward Snowden in here for the first time.  Every single time.  Now I have Tomorrowland.  I wrote a post about Tomorrowland,  so now that's going to be there for weeks.  How'd you like that?  It was okay.  I wrote a post on Medium arguing that the problem is,  as I well know, that optimism doesn't sell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I read that.  Yeah.  Yeah, cranky pessimism is always the way to go.  That's what sells.  That's what sells.  Taurek learned that, taught me that years ago.  You got a problem with that?  The master.  He's the master.  You can't, basically,  because I'm Mr. Smiley Smile, I love it all, right?  And he said, oh, you're stupid Leo, don't do that.  He said, you cannot go wrong dissing a new technology.  Oh, occasionally you say something bad about a mouse  and people remember that for years.  But for the most part, you're right.  The most new technology is crap.  So it's a safe bet if you say, ah, ugh, life sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it goes beyond that.  It's also, how's this going to ruin us?  Yeah.  So my argument is that dystopianism  is basically the ultimate hubris,  because it says, your fellow man and woman  are too stupid to use this stuff.  They're going to use it to ruin life.  They're all idiots, and I'm smarter than them  because I can see this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it's funny because you wouldn't think this,  but you are one of the most optimistic people I know.  Why wouldn't you think that?  Because you're so cranky.  I'm not cranky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  God damn it.  How dare you say that I'm not cranky.  No, but you're really quite the pie-eyed optimist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I am, I am.  You believe in the future of humankind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, even more than you do.  You're an optimist too, but I think I'm even more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm an optimist, but it's hard to maintain my optimism  in the face of the truth about people.  Are you an optimist, Ron?  I think you're an optimist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  People say I'm rough on phones when I review them,  but yeah, I'm always optimistic about stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hope for the best, but I have to say,  almost every phone disappoints.  Every phone disappoints.  There's yet to be the perfect phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, come on, wait a second, wait a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Give me a phone and I can run.  Ron and I will tell you what's wrong with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sure, you can find hope for what it can be,  but this is a miracle.  The Nexus 6.  Phones in general are a miracle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, but just the people in charge  of making them are not very, like, okay,  every phone today is basically a game console.  It's like the fastest possible specs you can imagine,  like eight core processors.  My S6 gets hot.  And like 2K screens.  Q, Luis, TK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm flying over the earth in a box  and I'm complaining about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sure, but that doesn't mean that everything that is out  is perfect and there's no way.  No, I never said perfect.  What I'm asking for is like a business phone.  Remember like Blackberry where you could have.  What?  Wait, wait, Blackberry is your standard?  Yeah, an actual Blackberry,  but just that there is a market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Something with real functionality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There is a market for something that values  like battery life over just let's make the numbers  on the spec sheet as big as possible  so that the phone can,  I have no idea what run crisis,  like what do they wanna do with these eight core processors  and everything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think also, Jeff,  it's stipulated that this is a miracle,  that we have in our pocket more power,  basically a main, a super computer.  That's stipulated, that's not the issue.  All of these are that.  And then you get greedy.  Right, that happened six years ago.  All of these are that.  Now the question is, but do they live up to,  that's baseline exactly.  Miracle, we live in an age of miracles

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  and that's the baseline.  Here's the way I've been doing it.  Here's my Matthew Ingram argument the other day.  Give me the business terms.  All right, so give me the terms  of what would make a phone satisfy you.  Well, apparently Ron wants a Blackberry.  Battery life.  Okay, fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Battery life is inadequate across the board.  Except maybe the OnePlus One.  The OnePlus One has decent battery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I charge my phone at 8 a.m. today.  A Xiaomi Note 4.  Because I had to get up to go to the airport.  And where are you now?  So, oh, I've charged it twice today.  Yeah, I carry a battery with me.  Jesus, I don't have that problem.  Just.  Well, when you're traveling  and you're gonna be up for however many extra hours  I'm gonna be up for today, changing time zones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  iPhone does pretty well with battery.  I will grant you that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What else?  Nothing.  So just battery.  Just battery and you're satisfied.  No, no, just, don't give me a 2K screen.  Don't give me eight core processors.  I love my 577 dots per inch.  What does that say?  Approximate 12 hours left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look at that.  Is that a OnePlus One?  What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's the Nexus 6.  It says 12 hours left.  That says a lie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because you haven't used it.  That's called standby.  Right, look at all your notifications.  You have 10,000 of them  because you haven't looked at your phone  in the last three hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They do that on Google Plus all the time,  they show that graph.  And then the question is,  have you turned your phone on at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And just every phone has to be as thin as possible.  And it's like nobody.  Screen hasn't been on much yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, what's the screen time?  Not much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They grew in that chart.  It is so useless.  What is the little ticks and nicks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, no, I think that's a useful chart.  It basically is saying,  of the time that was spent there,  what was on and where,  and what was causing the drain.  And so I've got a decent WiFi  and mobile network connection,  so that's not causing the drain.  Whereas if it's bad,  then you get little yellow stripes there,  and then you see the slopes in the thing.  And the screen on little bands there,  you tend to see slopes down there.  It's more useful when it isn't projecting

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what's wrong with it,  is that it needs Kevin Marks to explain it to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but I find that easily diagnostic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, but I actually download G-SAM battery monitor  most of the time,  because I find that a little more granular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I have, what's it called here?  I have two hours left.  Two hours left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you've charged it twice already.  I've charged it twice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look at that graph.  Yeah, it goes up and down,  up and down, up and down all day.  But this is the charging graph.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, you can see the graph going up  where it's charged, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I have battery guru on.  Is that worthwhile or not?  No, that does nothing.  It does nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Take it off.  But part of that is you're up there  where the reception's bad.  So it's working hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's warm right now.  It's been in my pocket.  It's hunting.  What do you have Ryan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Mine's as cool as a cucumber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really?  My iPhone doesn't feel anything.  It's on Wi-Fi?  It doesn't love anybody.  It is a cold, hot slab of glass and metal.  I noticed you said that in a British accent.  Yes.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's get our tips and tools and numbers and things  and all of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But one more thought on the phone.  So I had a fascinating conversation this week  with Quinn Norton about this  because she was doing that art project  at P&I and I was talking about.  But she says she likes to write on her phone  and there is now this small cult of people  trying to find the Android phones  that still have physical keyboards  because they want to write on their phone  and they like having physical keyboard.  And it's hard because the market's moved against them.  And so that's another one of these things.  It's like she really likes people to write on her phone.  She has a lot of reporting from strange places,  having a QWERTY keyboard she can type fast enough on is great.  Having a screen chest to keep wiping  because she's somewhere that it takes their stuff.  I can see that she and Ron are going to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  on an island cult somewhere, the Blackberry cult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, that's a great example though.  You have all these companies  and everybody makes the same phone.  That's a good point.  That's a good point, yes.  Nobody tries to make one with keyboards  and one with a really long battery.  It's just as fast as humanly possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But the fault there, I would argue,  is not the manufacturer's fault.  The fault there is, as always, is the telcos.  Because the telcos won't sell too many models.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And the reviewers, but yeah.  No, because the reviewers give you a checklist.  And so then it's like, has this got a good enough screen?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think actually that is true,  that we are somewhat at fault.  And have been for years with the feature charts,  not just for phones, but for software.  You can blame us for Norton internet security  and Microsoft Word, because we just have feature lists, right?  Well, it's got all the check boxes.  It's all people ever wanted.  I agree, I think it's our fault.  I take all the blame.  We try, I try, we try to do something called,  I like to think of as functional reviews now.  Where we don't look at speeds and fees,  partly because a website's a better place for that.  You can look at numbers and you know.  But video and audio is really about emotion, about feeling.  And so I think it's better for communicate  how you feel about a phone  and what the experience of the phone is like.  And so we try to focus on that,  kind of a more functional review.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the interface response.  Yeah, just how, you know.  Yeah, I hate when they hold the phone  and read off a spec sheet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because you can see the specs, that's not a problem.  But what is it like to be using,  we try to do that with our review show.  What does it feel like, should you buy this?  What does it feel like to be the owner for a couple of weeks?  How was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's hard because every device is so good  that the baseline is just like,  well, this has 1% more than this for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, battery life often is a killer, right?  A deal breaker.  On a lot of these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But like half the time,  the biggest difference is the design.  The outside looks different.  Well, that's why I like the edge.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it's so pretty.  It's like a fine jewel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The screen, curviness doesn't bug you out.  Oh, it totally bugs me.  Like your app's supposed to be black.  No, it's horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's got this big bubble on.  And there's all sorts of spurious touches  because you're holding the screen.  But you love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it feels beautiful in my hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's gorgeous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's beautiful.  But see, that's what matters.  It doesn't work right, but it looks pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Also, that's exactly what I'll talk about is,  hey, this is the most beautiful phone I've ever used.  I mean, it really is.  However, you got this little issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I mean, they're all so close now that that's.  It is.  Sometimes that's what you want.  Sometimes you just want something that,  I want a phone that's just nice.  Because everybody has the same processor,  the same amount of memory, the same screen resolution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have a super computer in my pocket and I'm complaining.  Yeah, no, we love our little phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, because you had to spend $600 on one of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I spent $2,300 for my Osborne One.  Right.  Right.  Oh yeah.  We got one in the basement.  The rubber is all disintegrated.  I spent $3,000 for my NEC Impact printer.  I had to rewire the parallel cables.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nippon Electric Company.  Yes, it does.  Mr. Marks, you got something, a tip,  or you want to talk about, oh, you got IndieWeb coming up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  IndieWebCamp.  I want to talk about IndieWebCamp.  So IndieWebCamp, so IndieWeb, I've talked about before,  it's the idea of using the web for your own purposes,  not for companies' purposes at the shortest.  But IndieWebCamp is the heart of this, which is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  IndieWebCamp where everybody sleeps alone.  Because they're independent.  Oh, I thought just because they couldn't get laid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I didn't mean that.  I just meant they're all independent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What a necromancer.  Sorry, Kevin, I was trying for a gag there.  You're being derogatory.  Okay, so what I'm trying to say is,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  IndieWebCamp is an IRC channel, it's a website,  it's a whole bunch of things.  But at its core, it's an annual camp  over a weekend in Portland.  And this year, it's July 11th to 12th.  There are also other sites being set up as well.  I'm not sure if they're all up yet,  but people are talking about having a parallel one  in Brighton in England and possibly one in Europe as well.  That'll be the smart one.  Sorry, I'm trying again.  But previously, I think previously as we've had  staggered ones in different places,  and there were several of those this year too,  last year we had some going on in parallel  in different parts of the world.  So I think that's going on here.  But going up to Portland for the 11th and 12th of July  is when this will be going on and doing this.  And the format is usually the first day we get together  and talk about what we've already done on our sites  and ideas and things.  And then the second day we sit there and hack on something  until we've got something new and interesting.  And then the end of the second day,  we show off what we've built.  So it's a fun weekend of working on your own site  and learning from other people who are doing the same thing.  And I found it very useful over the past four or five years,  four years I think it is, I've been going.  So just wanted to mention that.  If you're interested in web development,  have a look at that and also go to indywebcamp.com  and look up our chat room if you like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And thank you for the work you do.  Oh, I agree.  I use, with known as my blog platform,  leoville.net is there and it's just great.  And I really want to figure out, Kevin,  and maybe while you're at IndyWebCamp,  you can put a little bug in Ben and Aaron Joe's ear,  because we're going to Europe at the end of June,  actually it'll be before the camp.  But I want to be able to like journal from my trip.  And IndyWebCamp on mobile still doesn't,  it's hard to upload, I can't upload video and audio yet.  I want it to be kind of a full tool  that I can journal from.  They're getting there, they've made amazing progress.  It's really kind of cool.  Now when I Instagram it goes right there.  We mentioned that last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Audio and video are harder,  because there's just not the support there  at the web level.  Basically the hard part,  I think Ben read about this this week,  the hard part is it's very hard to get the phone  to the transformation before it uploads.  So by default, the web stuff is set up  to upload the raw version, which means it takes forever.  So you need a client side app to translate it  from the full version to the compressed version  before you upload it.  And that's the piece that's not quite there yet.  So the answer may be a companion app that does that  and then you then post those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, I'll take anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then they get a render video on your cell phone battery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, oh, you got a number for us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it's the trade off, isn't it?  It's battery versus bandwidth.  It is, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What was it I saw a Bored Elon Musk?  That's a great Twitter account to follow.  I'll tell you something about how you're gonna do a video  of watching your battery go down.  You ruined the punch line, whatever it was.  So it was a weird number.  So this is kind of a confession.  In the past, when it comes number time  and I've grasped for straws,  I have gone to the Millward Brown brand value ranking.  And so I looked at it this year and it said  that Apple has retaken number one position from Google.  Oh, hey.  Apple's brand surged 67% in value.  Well, how the hell do they know that?  It's magic.  So I looked up the methodology  and it's a bunch of smoke and hooey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We've talked about this before.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I think with you.  Really?  Maybe not, but I didn't.  So they take-  Maybe on MacBreak Weekly because it's kind of goofy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We take the financial value- Brand Z.  And multiply it by brand contribution,  which is expressed as a percentage of financial value.  The result is brand value.  Brand value is the dollar amount a brand contributes  to the overall value of a corporation.  What?  And they measure such things supposedly  as whether it's meaningful, different, and salient.  How do you measure that?  It's the richest company ever.  That's good.  I apologize for using this number.  Number one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  We're number one.  Get them a foam finger.  It's actually pretty amazing given that  they're actually doing better than they were

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  when Steve Jobs was alive.  Qualitatively, that's true.  Does anyone agree with that?  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Well, financially.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you guys think-  Financially.  Financially.  No, in terms of brand value,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think I agree with you, Neuron, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I think brand value isn't going up.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is going up?  Yeah.  Look at this watch.  They got people paying $17,000 for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How many schmucks bought it?  $30,000 a week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a million a month.  That's interesting as the first kind of Tim Cook product,  I guess.  I don't think so.  Product, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think it succeeds as a product, to be honest.  But it's selling like hotcakes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that doesn't hurt the brand?  Well, in the long run, it might.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, that's a good question.  That's a good question.  Short run, no, but long run, it might.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is a new thing.  I mean, it's probably pretty hard to screw up the iPhone.  Well, that's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's hard to come up with a successor to the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  You guys were just a minute ago  complaining how imperfect it was.  Well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nothing's perfect, Jeff.  We know that.  But it's pretty good.  But I'm just saying that that's the challenge is  if you had the most successful,  I think arguably the most successful product  in the history of the world,  in the iPhone, how are you gonna do better than that?  Water.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Make it faster.  Make it faster.  That's always the answer.  And apparently this year, it's thinner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And bigger?  Yeah.  Bigger, faster, thinner.  Do you have anything you'd like to share with us?  I mean, we don't have to.  I don't know if we're surprising you.  But any tool that you'd like to use?  What's your phone?  Have you found a phone with a perfect keyboard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't want a keyboard.  Oh, it's not you that wants a keyboard.  He's the one who wants the battery.  Kevin's friend wants the battery.  Yes, I want a giant battery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Quinn wants the keyboard.  Who wants the keyboard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, my favorite tool is a gigantic battery  that's this big that I carry with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I found a, there's one company that makes  a Qualcomm 2.0 quick charger battery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh yeah, yeah, I've heard about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and that's nice to have.  It's called Aukey, A-U-K-E-Y.  It's about, it's almost, I think it's 20,000 milliamp hours  or something.  It's enough to charge a phone a few times.  And it's not, you know, it's the standard size  of all these kind of like cigarette pack batteries.  So I carry that around in my briefcase  and that's gonna give me three charges  and in about an hour I'll get full charge.  Which is nice to have.  There it is, AU, no that's not it.  This company, right company, but they make.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They make a quick charger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There it is, that silver thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just a battery with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like you've seen these a million times,  but it's the only one that I know of  that's Qualcomm quick charge 2.0 certified.  Okay, it's only 10,000 milliamp hours.  Is that the same as quick charge that this uses?  Yeah.  Yeah, Qualcomm.  Yeah, it would work with the Nexus 6.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But maybe your Galaxy S6, maybe not.  It does work with the Galaxy S6, yep, just fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, isn't that weird, because it's a Nexonos.  But somehow it does quick charge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, it's just more voltage,  so it shouldn't be too hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's just more voltage.  From your mouth to God's ears.  Ladies and gentlemen, Ron Amadio from Ars Technica.  ArsTechnica.com, you must read him every single day  because he, no, seriously, I do.  So you should too.  It's really a great resource.  We don't do reporting.  We do commentary.  I let you hardworking fellas do the reporting.  Get out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Start tomorrow, I'm ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're gonna live blog the whole thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  On this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  Okay.  What time are you showing up at Moscone tomorrow, Maureen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  I need to go see Andrew and talk about that.  I don't know, early, very early, who knows.  When are you showing up tomorrow?  About seven, I think it was the job.  When we get done drinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're gonna get in line.  Is it at Moscone West?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Moscone, yeah.  The big one.  Yeah, I think so.  And press the escort upstairs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it the little one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, the West is not the big one.  The big one's on the underground one.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Everything's at West, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, West is where Steve would give his...  Hollowed ground.  Yes, his iPhone keynote was at West.  The iPad was not.  That was Urbibuenna Center.  All right, well we'll cover it tomorrow.  I'm excited, we'll be watching.  I'll look for your shining faces in the audience.  And our tweets.  And your tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you're the kind of guy,  you like to go to the track and the seminars.  Yeah, the real stuff.  Conferences, you like to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but also, I mean, the thing about the keynote  is you can pretty much do it as much  by watching the stream and tweeting as you can  by sitting in the room.  Because everyone else is just sitting there  just rettyping anyway.  Absolutely.  I love doing what we do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People often think that I'm mad at Apple  because I don't get invited to Apple events.  No, I would still be here.  Because as long as they stream it,  the hard thing is when they don't stream it.  But then we're needed more than ever  to analyze the live blogs altogether.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was way more informed when I didn't write  that I could sit at home and just watch everything.  Now I have to deal with logistics and all this other.
