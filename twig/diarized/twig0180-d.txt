Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Group hug, group hug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And this lady here, Ms. Gina Tripani.  And Aaron Newcomb's here too, which is great.  And Aaron brought his old radio with him.  And he's still getting Franklin Delano Roosevelt speeches on his radio.  It's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a lot of latency, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's got old radio on there.  Walter, you are not being logical.  Actually, the story's interesting. It's a Raspberry Pi in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right. So what I did was I took an old Philco radio, circa 1940 something.  I'm not sure exactly what the date is. And went ahead and put a Raspberry Pi in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can you roll it over here, Burke, so we can see it between me and Aaron?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's pretty interesting because I really wanted to.  I've got a pretty big library of old time radio shows.  And I thought what better way to listen to them than on an actual old time radio or out of an actual old time radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the Pi's LEDs even glow blue, which I love, through the grill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the Pi is in the back and it's hooked up to Wi-Fi.  And I wrote a little web page control for it so I can skip tracks and change the volume and things like that.  Because it's a little bit difficult to do that when that's meant to be set on a table and you kind of forget it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is your grandpa's radio, but it doesn't work the same as it used to.  That is so neato.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, as I talked about it last time I was here, I think, at the end of the show, I mentioned I was working on it.  That's great. How hard was that to do?  It wasn't hard at all, actually. Raspberry Pi is so user friendly.  If you know Linux, if you know how to set up a web server or how to do just about anything in Linux,  especially if you know how to do it on the command line, it's really easy to get the Raspberry Pi up and running and get it to do whatever you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And is the web page in PHP? How's that working?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The web page is actually a Perl CGI script because I know Perl better than PHP.  So I did it in Perl and loaded Lite.  I'm not sure exactly how you say it.  Lite HTTP.  It's a web server.  Commonly known as Litey. So I put Litey on there.  And it was up and running. Actually, it took me about five hours.  The web server is running on the Raspberry Pi.  The web server is running on the Raspberry Pi. So you can connect from your Android, you can connect from your laptop, change the tracks, change the volume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The neat thing about this is the Raspberry Pi was what, $30? I guess the Wi-Fi one is a little more expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The one with networking, the Ethernet built in is $35.  And there it is.  This is Dimension X still, I think.  There's no reason you couldn't have Twig.  Absolutely. See, it's all running through M-Player.  So M-Player can stream across the internet.  So you could actually run Twitch shows if you wanted to, just have it running all the time.  Are you using any original speakers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I couldn't because they were powered speakers.  Plus the wires were so degraded.  I mean, you wouldn't really want to do that.  That's what's actually running it.  Oh, sweet.  That's the guts in the bag.  The Raspberry Pi, a little USB hub, an Ethernet dongle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Total cost?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Less than $50.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm telling you, man, you've got a business there.  Make that, just go buy a bunch of old radios and make those. There's a business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll tell you what, I mean, I encourage anyone that's into making or hacking and they want to get into this,  I really encourage them to go out.  I'm getting one. I want to do that. That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You've got to get one. $35, you can't go wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the nice thing about it is it's all running off of an SD card.  So I can change this from this. I can pull out the Raspberry Pi,  stick in another SD card and have it be a media server running on my network,  streaming media or playing my videos or whatever I want.  When I'm tired of that, take out the SD card, stick in another one, and it's back to the old time radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pretty darn cool.  It's a lot of fun.  A lot of fun.  I knew Gina. I said Gina, when she sees this, will squee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, part of it, right. One half of me is squeeing, the other part of me is going like nerds.  Nerds, nerds.  But I have to say, I'm kicking myself. I haven't played the Raspberry Pi nearly enough.  So that looks like a really cool project. Yeah, it's really neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thanks.  So how was, we're going to do a little, because we haven't seen each other in a while, so pardon us folks.  You can fast forward if you want, but I just want to find out how everybody is.  How was your holiday, Gina? Was it your baby's first Christmas?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it was baby's first Christmas. It was wonderful.  We had a really nice, chill holiday at home. Very chill New Year.  Sleep before midnight, because the baby's up at 3 in the morning, so it wasn't very exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's funny. You really pretty much, the end of your staying up to midnight has happened.  You will never again say up till midnight.  Yeah, no.  Because you got 18 years ago and a bit of 10, and then you're so old, it's like,  I'm going to bed.  Whatever.  I went to bed at 10.30 on New Year's Eve.  I watched Anderson Cooper and Kathy Griffin.  Wasn't that wild?  Not at all.  Wait a minute. I had never, so I'm watching the usual stupid, taped in October, rocking New Year's Eve.  I mean, they literally tape it in October. I had somebody call me and say, you know, last year,  say, you know, I was at the Disneyland when they taped the segments with Fergie for rocking New Year's Eve.  It was October.  Yeah, that's great.  So it really feels canned.  Yeah.  So I'm turning around and saying, why? And nobody, I guess they figure ABC's got it.  We're not going to do it. So China Television, ABC, and then I find CNN.  Not only is it live, but Kathy Griffin is apparently attempting to kiss Anderson Cooper's sardine repeatedly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They were just like, he was giggling. Like, it was so funny. I thought it was hilarious.  I was just so happy to find the New York, the Times Square ball drop, like on a channel other than like the Spanish channel,  because here, you know, here on the West Coast, it's like you couldn't.  So I was so thrilled to just do the New York ball drop. I texted all my family on the East Coast and it was fine.  But those two were, they were just a mess. I thought it was hilarious that Anderson was giggling and that she was being so wildly inappropriate.  So inappropriate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was fantastic.  At first, I thought, my God, Cooper must be dying. But apparently they do this every year.  She disrobed last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're like BFFs.  They put off signs for her that says, no nudity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then Psy, Oppo Gangnam style, wanders in and stands down screen so he looks like he's three feet tall.  Oh my God.  You have no idea where he was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This isn't awkward at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have to say that's New Year's Eve, but it inspired me because I realized that they are the only people really covering it live.  And by the way, on the West Coast after nine o'clock, it's like go home.  Right.  Because New Year's happened in New York. What are you guys doing?  So I'm going to do it.  And we're going to do it.  Twitter style, internet style.  We're going to do it 24 hours.  We're going to start with the first New Year's Eve in New Zealand.  Oh, there you go.  And talk to people via Skype at the top of the hour for 24 hours.  That's awesome.  Just go through that.  Next New Year's, we're planning it already because apparently I have to plan something like that in advance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Are you going to do a pull a Jerry Lewis here and be there for the whole thing?  I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to wear a tuxedo by the end.  I'll be singing.  And my tuxedo.  Can you be drinking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll be drinking.  I want in on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You are in on this.  You're our San Diego correspondent.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good.  It just has to be before 10 p.m. Pacific.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Etta will be big enough.  We'll be able to have her on the party hat.  She'll be able to be in on the bus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think we have viewers all and listeners all over the world.  I think that we can easily find somebody from every time zone, all 28 of them or something, and have a New Year's ball drop.  28 ball drops.  Yeah.  Yeah, because there's some half hours in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That would be really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know.  I said the same thing.  And Kevin Marks said, oh, yeah, you'll have to do it for 28 hours because there's 28 time zones.  He fooled me.  And then I realized it can't possibly be 28 hours.  The Earth still revolves around the sun once every 24 hours.  It actually revolves, it rotates every 24 hours.  So I realized, oh, that's because we've got some strange time zones in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Will it be possible to get a live feed from something at every single time zone?  Is that the challenge?  Or is it just me kind of sitting around?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the challenge.  I'm going to create a Google Doc at Start Now and say if you're going to be in Perth, if you're going to be anywhere, we have to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, in your audience, you're going to have people who are going to move time zones that night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, just to do the coverage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there's like seven time zones in India.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You'll have your new Samoan fan.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google Plus Hangout would be perfect for that because people could just whip out their phones and join the Hangout.  Hey, look, there's 50 million people behind me or whatever.  That's what I want to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have someone in Qatar.  I met a fan who watches the show in Qatar at Google I'll get him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cool.  So I invite you all and you've got a year to prepare.  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm buying the no-dos now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Make a note.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So CES is going on right now and I'm not there.  You notice that?  And can I tell you how happy I am?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You were just in and out for your keynote was really, really good, Leo.  Oh, you saw that?  Yeah, I watched it.  I haven't watched it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wish I'd known I would have been better.  I'm glad I didn't know.  Let's put it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And very open too.  You know, Henry Blodgett put up some of his business stuff saying he was open.  Nothing compared to you, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, so let me explain.  I was not keynoting CES, but I was keynoting the New Media Expo.  They very wisely decided to move.  It's the formerly blog world and New Media Expo.  Now they just call it New Media.  It's all New Media, right?  Blogs, podcasts, YouTubers, it's all the same.  And they moved it to right before CES.  So they in Vegas.  So the presumption is, and I think it's wise, that people will come for that and CES.  And so they asked me to speak and I did.  And as I usually do, I like to tell our story and kind of tell people what it's like  and what the opportunity is, what the challenges are and all that stuff.  So it was fun doing it.  It's a great audience.  And we streamed it.  And I think it's a special.  I think it's a Twit special.  Oh, it's a Twit special.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Perfect.  Yeah, because I got to see that.  I saw one of your former keynote.  You've done this before.  Yes.  And you're just great, Leo.  And it looks as if you get up there with zero preparation.  Like the one that I saw, he just got up there in his suit.  And no, but you were your sort of regular charming self and told the story.  And you could tell you were just kind of doing it right off the cuff.  And it was great.  It was so great.  So I'm excited to see this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, he was doing it off the note too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I had a Galaxy Note 2, but that was only because there were some numbers in there.  I want to make sure I got those right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And no, you're exactly right, Gina.  I used to prepare.  And Lisa told me, stop preparing.  Those are the worst keynotes I've ever seen.  And so I'm just charming.  I meant that as a compliment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You came off as someone just kind of telling a story, having conversation.  That's the best way to do it.  I mean, not many people are talented enough to be able to pull that off.  But it was sort of wonderful.  Now that's good.  Lisa's right.  Lisa's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, she's always right.  I've learned that.  She's always right.  The truth is, this is, to me, the most important talk.  I've given this talk several times for New Media Expo, the most important talk I do,  because it's tough being a podcaster.  Then the next night I went to the International, you can tell just from the name,  the International Academy of Web Television Awards, which were done like the Oscars.  They had video bits.  They had presenters who had scripts on prompter.  It was in a big auditorium.  It was very glitzy.  People were all dressed up.  They had a red carpet.  And I thought, this is kind of like, this is New Media people kind of wearing their mommy's high heels.  It's kind of, we're dressed up.  But I have to say, the quality of stuff that's being done in episodic web series is pretty amazing.  There's some stuff that is very, very Hollywood quality stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You guys watched the, what is it, H Plus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  H Plus was one of the big winners.  Oh my goodness, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very well done.  I mean, super high quality.  I hate that it's so short because it's like, you get into it in that five minute time for whatever it is.  I don't know why they think it has to be short form.  I don't either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that was a mistake.  I think it was a big mistake.  Because the last week thing is longer than the show.  Right.  Did you see CES at all, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then I did CES yesterday, Tuesday.  So speaking of CES, if it weren't for Android and Samsung, flatline, I'm not kidding.  There's a few interesting things.  LG had an NFC capable printer.  So I took a phone, they have an Android and they have an iOS app.  But it works best with Android because you have to have an NFC chip.  So you walk up to this little printer.  I posted a video on Facebook because it wasn't worth doing much more on, but I thought it's worth showing.  I could probably show it.  Let me see.  I probably have it right here.  What am I thinking?  I recorded this.  It's cool because it uses NFC.  It uses NFC to pair to Bluetooth, I should point out.  And then it prints.  But it's cool because it means you can walk up to an arbitrary printer with your smartphone and just print.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the NFC is built into the printer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  So it works best with a Note or some sort of Galaxy device because they have the NFC chip in it.  Your Nexus would work.  Nexus, yeah.  Anything that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you have to have this particular printer.  Yeah, it's a little...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me go to my Google+.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It would be neat if it was an add-on.  It was something you plug into an existing printer, you know, with the NFC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was just going to say, I'm sure you could do this with Raspberry Pi pretty easily.  Just a matter of time, isn't it?  You just need one of those little NFC chips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm going to do my Dvorak imitation though and say, if that's the most exciting thing you've got to say, yes, you're right.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There was a lot of stuff like that.  A lot of kind of chintzy stuff, you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was saying in the pre-show, I started doing all about Android.  Last night was our first episode and we covered some stuff from CES.  And I realized, I thought I knew a lot about Android until we started talking about Android-powered cameras,  and Android-powered gaming consoles, and there's a Vuzix smart glasses with Android.  I mean, it's pretty incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Samsung has the Android-powered refrigerator finally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's just what you want, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Phones that you can drop in the toilet, thanks to Sony.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In fact, there were also a lot of these Android Roku sticks that are kind of cool.  Yeah, a few Google TVs.  Here it is.  Here's the...  Let's see.  Can I play this?  I'm going to put it in my pocket.  Are you getting my audio?  Because if you don't hear it, it's not going to really be very interesting.  So we're in the LG booth, and of course a lot of people are looking at and amazed by the Ultra HD 4K displays.  They've got beautiful OLED displays.  I don't know how I'm going to choose from that, but I'll tell you one thing I wouldn't mind having.  It's these.  This is the pocket photo.  It will be $200.  It's not available in the U.S. yet.  The idea is you put the pocket photo software on your Android phone or your iPhone.  Actually, iPhone's Bluetooth.  The Android phones, because they support NFC, I could just take this picture and tap it.  Can I tap it to one of these?  I've never seen this printer before in my life.  And now I'm printing via the NFC.  Actually, I think what it does, I misunderstood it.  I think it's doing a Bluetooth pairing.  And then it prints via Bluetooth.  But it's quite quiet.  It prints the little tiniest thing.  It's $200.  So the NFC is for Bluetooth pairing.  It's kind of a silly little...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's a little tiny printer there.  It's a little tiny printer.  You could carry that in your pocket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the market for this, because the whole point of easy pairing with NFC is not that you own it,  but that stores have it, or it's just at places.  And you just walk up to it.  You took a picture, and you go, a bar, for instance, would be great.  Have it in a bar, and it prints it out.  Ease of use.  Ease of use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Polaroid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And this is what NFC is probably going to be better for than almost anything.  You know, the Samsung folks also had NFC tags in the lobby of our hotel.  So I go, oh, this is exciting.  And I go like that.  And what does it do?  It pulls up a web page for the hotel.  It's like, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, did you hear what Disney is doing with...  I don't know if it's NFC or RFID.  Wristbands.  The wristbands, exactly.  Yeah, they're doing wristbands.  So you just walk around, no more tickets to the park.  Well, eventually, no more tickets to the park.  You buy your wristband.  You go up, you want to ride a ride.  You just scan your wristband.  You want to buy something.  Buy some candy.  Scan your wristband.  You know, anything like that.  You just go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's really cool about it is that with permission, the data will be in there.  So when you go up to Sleeping Beauty, Leo, which I know you will, she'll say, oh, Leo,  I have a new agent.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Finally.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you load it with cash?  Do you put money?  I think it's a credit card.  And does it do the fast pass thing on the rides where you'd be like, hey, I want to  ride this ride, like notify me.  Exactly.  Before you get there, this is, you know, Gina's doing future research.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like before you get to the park now, you could sign up for your fast passes.  It's loaded into your wrist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's great.  It's a great idea.  And it's great for Disney because they get tons more information that way.  Who's riding what ride?  You know, all that kind of stuff.  Who's buying what?  I don't know, Jeff, you can comment on whether that's scary or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you're opting into it all.  Right.  And so you have full control.  So the parent can say, you can know my name.  I really don't want you to know my kid's name, whatever.  You're in full control, which is great.  And what I like about it is that it's Disney being Disney.  It's a little microcosm, perfect world.  And maybe people will get used to some of this stuff there and say, it's not so bad.  It's not the mark of the devil.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, actually that ties into Bill Clinton speaking at the Samsung keynote at CES.  Samsung had to hold its keynote till Wednesday morning.  So they kind of, so it was this morning.  President Clinton was kind of like their guest.  I mean, it's not Bill Maher or Lady Gaga, but I guess it's OK.  He was a president.  But what he talked about was the fact that cell phones and Samsung is one of the leaders in low end  smartphones for the developing world are a huge and very important part.  And this is, of course, something he's very involved in.  Part of the economy of developing nations is for many people, it's the way they bank.  It's the way they make payments, not NFC, probably.  I don't know how they're doing it, but Android powered mobile devices are very important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just read a pretty fascinating paper by a professor Gordon at Northwestern, I'm forgetting his name,  in which he was arguing about the three industrial revolutions and the growth that comes as a result of them.  So if you can see that.  It's a bar graph on his Nexus 7.  Basically, that's what's happening to growth and so it's going to go back down again.  So anyway, in this paper, he was arguing that the toilet and running water, it was a far more important invention for the world than afterwards.  But Marcel Bowens, who writes great stuff online, P2P foundation, I think it's called, said no, that today in certain poor places,  people are choosing cell phones over toilets, given the choice, because the cell phone has an impact on their living and how much value they get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Even where they don't have power and they have to go and rent power, there's a guy with a pushcart power and they go and they plug in,  because there's no electricity in some of these areas. It's really remarkable.  Other CES events, Pebble says we're going to ship our Android powered smartwatch January 23rd.  At last.  We're all Kickstarter subscribers, are we?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not.  I am. I didn't do Pebble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's what I meant.  I mean, of course, we all use Kickstarter.  You have to be like not in touch with the world not to use Kickstarter.  Actually, you've moved to your eBay.  You've got an eBay habit now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What happened was, is the Kickstarter fever got to me.  So I just sold two of my Kickstarter things on eBay, basically for break even and got out of them.  I had this I think I told the show before I had this one thing where you had a case to an iPhone 4 and had a single magnetic card in it.  And that could that could mimic all of your credit cards.  And I realized that was I'm not going to use that sold it for a slight loss.  And then I just got the first heart rate wristband only no chestband.  Oh, this is great. I got to get that.  You know, like I'm taking beta block my heart.  I reckon my heart rate up and I get the thing and I say it just lands like a thud said, oh, she's a.  Yeah. And I ordered that.  So I'm now eBay man.  So I went on eBay and I sold it for a slight profit.  So between the two, I'll break even.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And now you're buying stuff on eBay.  So it really is about eBay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I bought myself a Galaxy Note 2 because Leo convinced me I should get it.  But now I haven't turned it on yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I ordered a I ordered a DIY make your own cheese kit like a mozzarella cheese kit.  Right now, I should say that like I'm not really like I can I can function in the kitchen.  Like I can make coffee and I can make toast and I could put together a dinner.  But I'm not I'm not exactly a cook.  Well, my wife saw this and she just went.  She just sighed.  I was like, come on, it's like make your own.  What's at home? Come on.

Transcript:  Is that the one you got?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, it's a Kickstarter.  It's a Kickstarter campaign.  It's a Kickstarter.  Yeah, it's a Kickstarter cheese making kit.  Let me see if I can find it.  It's probably on my profile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I could just probably search for a cheese making kit Kickstarter.  Yeah, fine.  Good idea.  Make Cheese Incorporated.  Let's make cheese.

Transcript:  Did you pledge enough to get the mascarpone included?  I didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just straight mozzarella.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it does make thirty batches of mozzarella.  So it's quite economical.  Thirty batches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm so excited.  My wife was she was serious.  She was just like, you are never going to do this.  I'm like, I am so going to do this.  I'll come over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's have a cheese pulling party.  Maybe on New Year's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll make I'll make cheese.  Oh, in the studio.  Yeah, that's a good segment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And now as we approach New Year's in Ghana, Gina Trapani will join us to show us how to make cheese.  You're like, here's some salignin balls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's funny.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry for the.  I really think all Italians make cheese.  No, they go buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They have a cheese person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I used to make pasta till I realized you could just go buy it.  Ella is a cheese maker from Calgary.  That's cool.  You know what?  This is what Kickstarter is all about.  By the way, I should mention that a number of winners at the International Academy of  Television for the Web Awards were Kickstarter projects originally.  They raised the money for the financing for the films doing that, including there's a  steampunk show.  Oh, what's it called?  Film is a big thing on Kickstarter.  Yeah, everybody loves steampunk.  Oh, yeah, steampunk, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm going to give up one of my numbers right now.  Two of them.  Oh, boy, it's getting tight here.  You don't have to give them up.  You don't have to give them up.  I got it.  Here's the number.  This year, Kickstarter and we're just beginning of the year, so who knows things could change,  but it's on track to potentially collect a billion dollars.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought I was really thinking by now that it would be the Kickstarter bust would have

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  happened, but I guess it's down there under the under the stuff on the rundown.  If you want to look it up, I'm just amazed by that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Kickstarter, not Kickstarter itself, but like all of the various Kickstarter projects  put together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Kickstarter takes what, five percent?  Something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that's got five percent of five of a billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So what is that?  I don't know.  Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Am I doing math on demand?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can you do math?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gina, can you do math?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Looking at their best 2012, Backers pledged $606 per minute in 2012.  Crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the League of Steam, Adventures of the League of Steam was one of the Kickstarter.  You love that show?  My brother's best friend's show.  These guys raised 13 grand to do their show.  They actually were wearing these costumes.  They have the best costumes ever.  It's really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this is your brother's best friend's show, Liz?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, he won a number of awards.  They kept bringing him up on the stage.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah, I saw this.  League of Steam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did see this.  So that's really cool.  They built these crazy guns that shoot nets and, oh man, it's amazing.  The Adventures of the League of S-T-E-A-M.  What else?  So the Pebble's going to be shipping on the 23rd.  So you and I will get ours, Jeff, and we can put it right on eBay.  This one I think I'll open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This one I kind of want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I have to do a review.  I mean, that's why I got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It connects to your phone, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There was another one that we tried, an Italian design.  It was I'm Watch or I Am Watch.  That was the same idea.  It was just horrible.  Because a UI on a watch is going to be hard to implement well.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is tough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the Pebble is E Ink, which I think makes it kind of cool.  Gosh, they're actually, now that I look at it, there's a lot of stuff.  I was watching the...  At CES.  Yeah, at CES.  But again, it's Android and Samsung, and that's pretty much it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Couple of self-driving cars.  I was thinking that when HTTV came out, I kind of pooh-poohed it and said,  oh, come on, people are going to be programming.  People are going to buy this stuff.  And of course, we're an idiot.  I can't believe it, right?  What do you think about the 4K TVs?  Love them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Beautiful.  What's interesting is the stunning absence of the word 3D at CES.  For the last two years, there was nothing but 3D at CES.  And I guess the television manufacturers are retrenching.  I mean, you get it anyway, since most high-end TVs have it.  But I guess nobody's really demanding 3D TVs.  The next thing, which in a way is more realistic than 3D,  in fact, not a way, is more realistic than 3D, is 4K, they call it Ultra HD.  It's doubled resolution, both horizontally and vertically.  And there was even an 8K TV.  No way.  What's that going to do to bandwidth demands on cable...  Well, I asked.  I did a panel with a guy from Roku and a guy from Sharp  who were responsible for kind of delivering this content.  And they said, we're not worried.  I said, what's interesting is, and this is not unusual, I think,  because of Moore's Law, that silicon can advance at geometric paces.  So the TVs are getting higher resolution faster  than the demand or the content can keep up.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're still trapped with the telecoms.  I want to give a quick plug to Susan Crawford, the brilliant Susan Crawford,  who's an amazing law professor, was on ICANN,  and she wrote a book just out called Captive Audience  about the whole issue of us getting national broadband and national fiber  using the NBC-Universal Comcast merger as a stepping-off point.  And she went on about the profit margins for delivering broadband  are unbelievably high.  And cable systems, she says, now we're just harvesting.  They're not investing at all.  And Fios has stopped building.  It's done deals with Comcast.  I fear we're going to hit a wall here as a nation  where we do have all these great new applications,  and we are going to start hitting the wall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Lloyd Clark, who is director of a new product at Roku,  I said, you know, you've got to be worried, because Roku just got to 1080p.  It's all delivered.  Roku is one of those Internet devices that connects your TV to us,  among other things, Netflix.  And he said, no, we're not worried.  Netflix had a 4K demo,  and he said, between improved compression and improved bandwidth,  we don't think it's going to be a problem.  We think we will be able to deliver 4K eventually.  Wow.  Wow is right, because I tell you, it's like looking through a window.  It's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's hard to imagine. There were a lot of set-top boxes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's talk about those. I want to take a break.  But let's talk about that and more from CES.  Yeah, there were. Arcos and a lot of people.  Yeah, and not just Google TV stuff,  although there is some Google TV news as well.  But first, let's talk about my new scale, stamps.com.  This is a message to those of you who want to be postal pros.  It's a pro tip.  If you're an eBay seller, you've got to mail people stuff.  If you're an Amazon seller or Etsy,  if you are in a business where you send out invoices or mailings of any kind,  you probably don't want to go to the post office to buy postage.  Maybe you're using a postage meter.  There is a much better way.  Boy, this is the 21st century for postage.  It's called stamps.com.  It lets you print postage from your own computer and your own printer.  No special ink, no postage meter, no lease.  Just stamps.com.  It's fantastic because it also, because you're on a computer,  let's say you're an eBay seller, takes the buyer's information from the page.  You don't type it in.  It prints out the forms.  If it's an express mail or certified mail,  it will send an email to the buyer with the tracking information.  All of this automatically.  It's very fast, very easy, and the scale is a very nice feature.  I'm going to show you how you can get this scale for free,  this little five pound scale.  It's USB.  It plugs right into the back of the computer.  So you plop the letter, the package on there,  and the computer says, okay, this is how much postage you need.  Here's what you do.  You go to stamps.com right now, and you'll see it.  Well, wait a minute now.  You see the scale there, but that's the $80 deal.  I'm going to get you a better deal.  Click the microphone in the upper right-hand corner for the special twig offer.  Enter the offer code T-W-I-G.  That's all you need.  And that $80 offer turns into a $110 bonus offer.  You get $55 in postage free over a few months.  You get the free digital scale.  That's a $50 value.  All you do is pay shipping and handling.  I think it's four or five bucks.  You get a $5 supply kit and a four-week trial of stamps.com.  If you are doing a lot of mailing, this is going to be a lifesaver  and can even save you a lot of money.  Stamps.com, use the promo code twig, for $55 in free postage  and that beautiful scale.  It's so pretty.  It is pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wish I would have done that before we sent out all our Christmas cards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, it's actually such a good deal.  It might be even worth it just for your Christmas card list,  although I think it's really not intended for, you know, that kind of light mailing.  So let's talk about set top of boxes.  Arcos is going to do $150 Android, I'm sorry, not $150.  What is the price on that? Cheaper than that.  Android 4.1 box.  That means it will have apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. So this was really cool.  This was actually my favorite best of show for me from CES as far as set top boxes  because it's not Google TV.  It's actually Android 4.1.  So that means you get all the app ecosystem that comes with Android 4.1 system.  And it also has a built-in high definition camera so that if you want to do things like,  you know, hangouts with your family or whatever, you can do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Arcos has always been a low price leader with Android.  So the camera sits on top of the TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep. And it has a built-in game controller.  And the little round disks are supposed to emulate touch on a,  like if you had a tablet or a touch enabled phone.  And a full keyboard, QWERTY keyboard on this too.  Full QWERTY keyboard. I mean, it looks really, really good.  It's a 1.5 gigahertz multi-core processor, a gig of RAM.  You can expand the storage by adding an SD card.  You can hook up other stuff to it.  I mean, I think they've really done a really good job of kind of covering all the bases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How do you compare that with a Netgear Neo TV Prime, which looked good to me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I haven't looked at the Netgear as much.  I do have a Vizio CoStar right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just got one for review.  The Netgear?  The Vizio CoStar.  Oh, the Vizio CoStar.  That's Android, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is. It's Google TV.  And I did a review on All About Android, you know, several episodes back.  It's pretty good. It's a little sluggish.  The thing that I really didn't like about it was the fact that there's no apps.  The Google TV is really limited.  Software developers are not making apps for Google TV.  So to me, Arcos just kind of like skips that whole bubble of Google TV and just goes right for Android 4.1.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's kind of bad news for the Google TV team that a manufacturer decided to make a TV device  and not use the operating system that's meant for the TV.  But it's true.  I mean, there are so few Google TV specific apps.  And the ones that are there are just like, oh, classy fireplace.  And the things that you can get anywhere else, you know, YouTube, Netflix.  So actually, this is the thing that's most exciting to me about this is that it's full on Android and the camera as well.  Although it seems like there are a lot of Android apps that would just be weird on a TV.  My Android app would be really weird on a TV.  I'm gathering it's a tablet, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's why it has touch knobs.  So you would it would be like having a big tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it'd be like remote controlling a large tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly.  So it isn't a large tablet.  It's about the same resolution, actually.  It's less a resolution than the Nexus 10, about the same as the Nexus 7.  So yeah, so it'd just be a big tablet in your living room.  One hundred twenty nine bucks available next month, according to Arcos.  We'll certainly we'll get one to try.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My living room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. But there are, I should point out, have been for a while a bunch of USB sized sticks.  That's right.  With Android running.  Have you tried any of those?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I haven't. But this is basically taking that same concept to the next level.  Right. So it's giving you a lot more horsepower, the expandability of adding other devices and other things to it because it's got the ports in the back.  It's basically taking that same concept, which is a which is a mini, really mini system and saying, you know what, it doesn't have to be that small.  Let's go ahead and give you a camera, give you the things you want, give you a nice keyboard and and away you go.  So I'm going to get one as soon as they come out.  And I'll probably be selling the Vizio CoStar.  But we'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It will be interesting to see what happens with Roku, Apple TV and Google TV, because the one thing cord cutters want, they, of course, use these devices to watch on demand video.  But one thing cord cutters really want is live video.  Right. And now Apple TV is doing that with The Wall Street Journal.  I've just found out I didn't even know it.  Apparently, Roku doing the same.  And according to Vizio's CTO, Matt McCray, in an interview with GigaOM, Google TV will probably be streaming too soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it already does.  But I think what I got out of this article on GigaOM was they're basically taking the passthrough out.  So there's no more passthrough from your cable box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One thing I like about Google TV, which is it doesn't take up a new HDMI port.  It's on the same one.  It's just an overlay on top of your live television.  He says we're not going to do that anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So I mean, it's basically saying, you know, there's enough cord cutters out there that don't really need it.  I don't have it. My Vizio CoStar has the passthrough, but I don't use it because I don't have cable.  Interesting. Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're moving so fast in this. It's very interesting.  Inquisitor liked the Hisense Pulse saying it was the fastest Google TV on the market.  Hisense is another, I guess, Chinese company that was off in the South Hall.  And I looked at their stuff a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is really why it's too bad that the Google Q thing didn't work, because it's such a confusing field.  And it would be nice if there were a touchstone product that Google had out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there's such an opportunity here for someone to do it really, really well and be the clear leader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a big ass remote, I got to say, on this Hisense Pulse.  You get a full keyboard, you flip it over, you do get a trackpad. Another way to handle that touch.  Same as the Vizio CoStar. Very similar.  Yeah, although it looks a little bit bulkier.  It's almost the same size, I think. Just looking at the pictures you're showing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A little bigger than your hand.  Yeah, that's the same size as my remote. And the box is the same size.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  1080p, Google Chrome browser, HDMI in and out, USB, IR blaster, Wi-Fi, DLNA, three AAA batteries.  They're proclaiming it as the fastest Google TV on the market.  I don't know. I guess that's coming from Hisense.  LG announced seven models of Google TV built in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's more interesting to me. That's more interesting.  And was it LG or I guess it was Samsung where you have replaceable software and replaceable modules on the TV, which is a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they announced that last year.  Yeah, the idea being that people don't buy a whole new TV, but maybe they'd want new software firmware or upscalers or whatever as the silicon gets smarter.  LG will offer Google TV sets in two series, 42, 47, 50 and 55 inch sets.  And then they'll have the cinema screen in 47 and 55 inches.  No pricing or availability yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is built into the TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's built in. Yeah, they showed this also last year. They showed Google TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the way it's going to expand, I think, more quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. The only thing is, I mean, it's obsolete.  I mean, like we just said, look how fast this is moving and you buy one of these LG TVs and what happens when they decide not to update it.  Right.  That's why I like the additional. I mean, it's kind of a pain to have another box on your on your entertainment center.  But I actually like that because I know I can throw out that box and get the next box when it comes out.  I'm going to do that more often than I'm going to replace my TV. Right. Exactly. Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Asus cube is another Google TV. I didn't. Now I'm kicking myself. I went home too soon.  150 bucks launches in March. Same kind of big keyboard remote.  It's just another Google TV as far as I can tell. I'm not sure what's different except that it's more expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a little bigger. And it's got this sort of cubish like skin, you know, like the or the interface to it.  It has this is this cube that it it's it's kind of moves around and each face is a different category.  So I think that's why they called it physically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's it's eye candy. Well, the real question is, are they going to start putting higher end processors?  Because as you mentioned, the sluggishness of some of these things really gets in the way.  Yeah. And if you want it, I mean, I love the idea of having it be a true Android experience with a fast processor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, the reason they're able to do this so cheap is just that they put in a slower processor,  but a dedicated video processing chip so that you can do things like Netflix and it looks great and it's high def and everything.  But then you go out and you say, oh, I want to play a game or I want to do something, do some other app on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's like, man, what is going on? It's so slow. So I could play Angry Birds and my Roku, but it's not what I would prefer or want to do.  Right. Right. Now, RCA is going the other direction. They're built.  There's they're delivering a tablet with TV has two tuners on it. Yeah, I thought this was really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've they announced this tablet and it's got two TV tuners and it and it does.  It also streams TV. But I just I threw it in here because I wanted to get your opinion.  This panel's opinion on is this really something that people are interested in doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like this is using dialed, which has been around for a while.  And there have been other solutions like this. I think it's a small specialty market.  Nothing is. Yeah. Remember, I remember a couple of years ago there were all these ads on the Super Bowl and stuff for this.  Remember, the guy was shopping with his wife, but he got to watch TV. Right.  Similar technology never went anywhere. I can't remember the name of it. But Verizon was had that Verizon has Vcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they still have Vcast. Yeah. So it's got the dial TV.  And then I think it also has a the other tuner is the over the air tuner.  So theoretically, you could be sitting in the airport or in a taxicab or something and watching the game, watching the game from there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I just don't know uses 4G uses kind of a off board is it Metro PCS for it?  It's a it's not a it's not a major player. Right. That's right. It won't be everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Interesting. But I just don't know how many they'll sell Android cameras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Samsung had one full Android on the back. Regular point and shoot camera on the front.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Polaroid has one with interchangeable lenses. Yeah, I thought that was pretty cool because that's what people were complaining about with the Samsung one is if you know there's a point and shoot.  It's a point and shoot camera. Exactly. And people wanted something a little bit higher end.  And this is micro four thirds. This is the mirrorless very popular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I see my micro four thirds is a standard lens design.  So even if Polaroid only makes one, you can get micro four third lenses from a number of manufacturers.  Android for one. That's good. I'm glad we're seeing that every yes.  Yes. Yeah. For a while it was gingerbread still on some of these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not sure what's on the Samsung camera. I think it's for at least for oh yeah.  When it came out for $499.99 for the Galaxy camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  500 bucks. Yeah. Android for one jelly bean 4.8 inch LCD touchscreen quad core processor.  You know I was talking we did a triangulation with a guy from Nokia Hans Peter Brodmo.  And he's a camera buff photography buff but also kind of a R&D blue sky guy for Nokia.  And he says that really the future photography is is not in lenses.  It's in computation back end computation.  You see this with things like the light row camera where you take a picture.  But you get to focus on a variety of different planes.  He says computation is going to be huge.  And you see it already in kind of a small form with the Android even iPhone where you get you take a picture.  But you have all these programs the least of which Instagram filters but all sorts of other things you can do this stuff process afterwards.  So the idea of putting an operating system powerful processor in a camera I think is really intriguing.  Yeah I mean for me it's the sharing thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Especially now I'm just I just take a lot more pictures because my daughter so little and you know doing with my phone I get a low quality relatively low quality photo.  But I can automatically send it to Flickr right.  But if I take it with the nice DSLR I mean even if you have an I.F.I. it's still fiddly and you have to connect to the thing that you know.  Being able to take a good picture and then send it directly you know to Flickr from a good camera you know because it's got Android on it is appealing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah if we got to the point on it comes down to telecom companies once again even the shared data plans that have come out you have to pay for every device.  They still limit it too much.  It's like the days when the telephone company charged you for how many phones you had which was absurd.  That's the way it worked.  If you got to the point where you just said listen I'm going to have as many devices I want and yeah you're going to charge me if I use more data at that point I'd say OK because then I can have my Android camera and my refrigerator and my Android car and my Android this and my Android that and I'd be all happy.  But now the plans are just too gating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Valve Steam box.  See I'm thinking that games are actually the killer app for even something like Google TV.  That's why I want to Android because I want to play games and do TV right.  Yep.  And this the idea of the Steam box is it's basically using valves Steam platform which is a very powerful very popular gaming platform on PCs and making a small box roughly the cost of say a PlayStation 3 that sits in the living room and runs interestingly Linux not not Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes Steam introduced their Linux their client for Linux not too long ago they had a beta closed beta now they have an open beta you can actually go download it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And if you have Windows I think we're Mac you can also see it.  It's that kind of sit back experience with Steam and it's great.  Yeah the big screen they call it.  It's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And so this is really interesting that they are actually getting into hardware now.  It looks like they want to compete with the Xboxes and PS3s of the world.  And why not.  I mean they have a huge following on PC.  I'm seeing people now go back to PC away from consoles but there are there is this group that loves to be in the living room with a traditional controller.  And so there's been rumors floating around for forever that they're going to do a piece of hardware so people can play in their living rooms without having to do the PC thing and and now it looks like they're doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Valve is showing off piston which is one of they say many prototypes.  Look at that.  That's cool.  That's based on an actual gaming PC.  This company sells.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah that's really cool looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thousand dollars for the gaming look at the look at the back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah look at the back.  I was like oh yeah.  Is there a shiny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't see a back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm looking at the wrong article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A lot of ports.  Here's here's some more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's some more pictures.  Oh there you go.  Very pretty.  Oh four USB ports.  East Santa couple of East Santa ports.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then to like mini video.  What are those.  Is that the mini video for the Apple.  Yeah.  Same thing that you need a display port.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  E old ethernet port.  Couple of display ports.  E old ethernet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It really does look like it's a kind of a throwback.  That's the throwback port.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's when you need a stable connection kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it looks like they're shopping this around.  I mean this particular box we're looking at here.  Retails at a thousand dollars.  I don't think that that's that's not the price.  That's not what that's going to get.  Although there'll be a market for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The hard the hardcore PC gamer will say hey great I don't care.  But because I want to play my PC games in my living room on my big screen TV.  Maybe that's the high end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the high end.  Maybe that's the high end and they'll have something at like one ninety nine hopefully.  Well it's got to be PlayStation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think maybe not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One ninety nine two ninety nine.  Three ninety nine.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yep.  More ninety nine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We could go on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK let's take a break.  Come back with more.  There is lots more.  In fact I think we buried the lead.  You would agree Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh yeah we'll get there.  We had to geek out.  That's fine.  We had to gadget out.  We'll see you stuff but we come back.  We are.  Google wins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK.  But first a word from Ting.  Ting's the thing.  If you're an Android fan.  You got to find out about Ting.  It's a new mobile phone service from the folks at Two Cows who specialize.  I love this Elliot Noss of Two Cows.  He did.  They do hover dot com.  They specialize in taking industries that are just really suck and making them work  for people making them better.  He says this is there's a huge opportunity to take cell phone service which is universally  aided and make it work for people.  And you start off with you know integrity.  You know telling people there's there's what you're going to pay exactly.  No BS contract free.  No early termination fee.  You don't they don't bundle or give you ride along services.  In fact if you go to Ting.  I'm sorry twig.ting.com.  Ting.  You can see first of all we'll get you a twenty five dollar credit to get you started on your  first device.  But you can also see how it works.  Look at the plans.  Now this is just a serving suggestion but I'll give you an idea of how this is going  to save you money.  First of all it's great if you are a family or a business and you want multiple handsets  at six dollars per handset per month.  So let's say it's a you know say it's family for that's twenty four bucks.  That's your cost.  But then you'll add minutes.  Now you could start with zero of everything and just pay as you go.  Or you could say you know just kind of budget.  I'm going to use a thousand minutes shared two thousand text messages shared.  And let's make it three gigabytes of data shared and the total cost one hundred ten  dollars for the family of four a month for four people one hundred ten bucks a month.  And the best part is you don't use all of that.  They rebate you the difference you use more no penalties.  They just charge you the next level up.  You pay for just what you use.  You get credit on unused service.  There are no add on charges.  What do you get for free.  Voicemail picture and voice messaging three way calling caller ID.  But I know the one you're looking for and they have tethering and hot spots.  Included no additional charge no mysterious line items unlimited devices on any plan.  Just six bucks a month per handset.  And you'll like the online.  You know this is a service for geeks.  So you like the online control panel that lets you see exactly what's going on.  Great support great price and never any early termination for your contracts.  Go to twig.ting.com to save twenty five bucks on your first device.  If you want to see what the customer support looks like help.ting.com you'll see the forums help ticketing system video tutorials video startup guides and more.  You start by picking your device.  Of course they have lots and lots of devices for you including the note to including the S3.  It's good.  It's a good Android experience in Nexus.  Lots of good choices and LTE because it's riding on a sprint network.  Very good prices.  Very good service.  This is the there's the Optimus G which is really that's the Nexus for with LTE stuff like that.  Take a look twig.ting.com.  I won't show I won't show Jeff the price on the Galaxy Note 2.  We'll just pretend he didn't see that.  See that.  Moving right along.  So Google off the hook according to the FTC they are not a monopoly.  It's OK what they're doing with they don't favor their own results in search.  Some say this wasn't a victory for Google.  There are a few little caveats and requirements.  I think this is huge victory don't you Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's I think it's gigantic victory.  I think it's a really heartening victory that you know they spent a long time two years looking into supposed violations.  And in the end said Google had the right to put up direct content on its search results and said that there was no harm to consumers in this.  And that there's no harm to advertisers and that's the that's the part that people are actually more.  Yeah.  And Yelp Yelp.  Well and Yelp but Google said Yelp you don't want to be part of it.  They specifically there's a specific way now they agreed to so that if Yelp doesn't want to be scraped for for any reviews they don't have to be though.  I think it's suicidal Yelp but fine if that's what you want Yelp.  That's fine move to Belgium and Germany and France and Leicester should strike for you.  The other part of it was the basic patents.  That was really more about Motorola's era than Google's era as I understand it.  And Google said fine we're going to open up all the patents.  They've dropped some patent suits.  I only wish that were the beginning of a truce and patents.  I fear you know I'm told it's not.  But it was very clear statement saying to Google and the rest that Google was not was was helping consumers with what it does and that this was not antitrust.  It was not monopoly and I think it's a big big victory not just for Google but for the net and for innovation.  And part of the argument was things change so quickly.  And this is the big revelation from the Microsoft efforts before of course is that by the time they got around to finally finishing decrees on Microsoft Microsoft was already bottom of the heap again.  And and there's all kinds of changes in technology and Google saying you know there's all kinds of new markets here where we weren't even in them before.  And you know we're going to fight with everybody else.  And so I'm I'm very happy about this this agreement and I think it's what the only thing pissed me off was the Wall Street Journal continues its anti Google bias and acted as if they'd you know escaped and barely got off.  No the FTC was very clear in saying that Google was not monopolistic and was not violating antitrust in its actions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They also said Ron Wyden agreed that there is no barrier to entry to getting my search.  I don't know if that's true is it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well but part of the problem here is the search is yesterday's battle.  That's not what nobody cares.  Right.  So we've been saying that this show for two years ourselves since I started that.  Yeah so fine Microsoft when all this effort start being.  Okay what next you know fighting yesterday's battle is foolish where now Google says yeah yeah yeah we got search and yeah it's bringing in billions of dollars.  But what we're really concerned about now is mobile.  And that's where the company's headed what we're really concerned about now is relationships with people otherwise known as social and data about that and trying to figure out that stuff.  So search is is you know an old battle.  Now this is not to say that they couldn't get zapped in Europe and I could see Europe going two ways.  Europe could say well it's going to make us look bad or Europe could say well the Yanks won't get their own darn company.  We're going to show them which I fear may be the case.  We'll see what happens.  Interesting too that Google increased greatly in spending on lobbying.  It paid a lot of attention to this.  Every account said that they treated it very seriously and they were walking through the Justice Department.  They did not want to have a Microsoft like snotty attitude.  Schmidt went and paid homage a lot and sat down in conversations with them and they tried to work this out and explain to them the rationale of what they were doing and why they were doing it to benefit us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff do you think this was a misfire on FTC's part.  I mean do you think that they.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They should have done it in the first place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right I mean it almost feels like and of course I'm reading between the lines here it almost feels like someone got a burr under their saddle.  They heard something Google's doing such and such and they're like I can't believe it.  Let's go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think what happened is Microsoft Yelp and other companies and there's a pretty long laundry list of companies involved in this rattled the cage instead of FTC.  You got it.  We got to look into this.  In fact they were very unhappy with the result.  I mean you could also interpret as anti-competitive from those guys.  Although here's one thing that Google did do that they had to change.  When Yelp went to them at first it said we don't want Yelp reviews in the places listings.  That's your stuff.  We don't want to be there.  We want people to come to Yelp to find out what our Yelp reviews are.  Google said you could do that but you got to take Yelp out of all Google search results.  And that is kind of anti-competitive.  That's using a big stick saying well OK but then you can't find Yelp anywhere on the web.  And part of this decision was no and Google has added now this feature to take it out of places without taking it off of Google search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know they've done the same thing in news and so I think they'll do the same.  No, it's a really good question Aaron.  I think Leo's right.  Microsoft and company spent a lot of money, hired a lot of lobbyists, did a lot of advertising,  created a lot of fake trade organizations to go against Google in this case.  Pairssearch.org.  And so the FTC I guess had to look into it in one way or another.  And I thought it was going to go against Google just because that was the mood and that's kind of what Leibovitz was heading to.  But I really take my hat off to them that they I think delivered a very fair decree here.  Tim Wu from Columbia who was consulting with the FTC for a period during this process wrote a really good piece,  a couple of really good pieces talking about this and saying that no they didn't escape with their skin.  This was a good decision. It was a right decision.  And I think that's the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In fact it might have been a pretty surprisingly smart decision for them to understand that it wasn't about search anymore.  Yeah.  Because as you said that Microsoft prosecution took so long that it was kind of meaningless by the time it was done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the FTC wants this competition and we do have competition.  Again, the one area where we don't truly is advertising.  Yeah, I can go and find, well, you know, but even there there's all kinds of new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, there's Google, there's Facebook, there's I think there's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So even there there is. But Google has more power there than does anywhere else in terms of its market share.  It's not a search market share. It's an advertising market share that bears more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it really Google that dominant when you look at Bing and Yahoo and Facebook and Google that they're so much bigger than everybody else?  Is that true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The share they have of online advertising is gigantic.  But again there, there's new innovation. So there's new real time marketplaces for buying people as they go around the web.  They go around Google. There's mobile stuff coming up like crazy.  So that's another example where even though Google does have incredible power, it's by no means invincible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google also, and I think this is a positive result of this suit, said it's not going to use its patents to to stop competitors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this was yeah, I mean, this is one of the stipulations of the agreement.  So Google and Motorola said that they'd stop.  The stipulation was that they will cease seeking product bans for standards essential patent infringement and that they resolve those disputes in arbitration and not in court.  So it was part of this agreement, which is a good thing.  Right. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that's also the risk. That's also the so there's good outcomes to this.  In other words, I don't think the FTC did anything wrong.  They they they investigated and they got some concessions from Google that are good for good all around.  I think that this probably was something that needed to be done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, though, Google is the one who says they don't use patents offensively.  Yeah. But but this was for Google, Motorola.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was Motorola. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I was about Motorola. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Patents lawsuits by proxy.  What else? Where where should we?  You put so many stories in here, Aaron.  I don't know where to go next.  I don't know who's been who's been jamming our rundown with stories.  There's about a million things to talk about here.  This is crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you got you got Eric.  Let's give you a choice here.  Eric Schmidt in North Korea.  Brad fell talking about Google Plus as the long game.  Google creating free Wi-Fi in Chelsea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love that boy.  That's New York City.  Yeah, that's New York City. Yeah.  Why is this the next stage in the Google fiber rollout?  Is Google going to put Internet everywhere?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They did a press conference with Bloomberg.  But again, I was at an event last night with Susan Crawford's book,  Captive Audience.  Give it a plug.  And she warns not to not to get too happy about free Wi-Fi,  that what we really need, the only thing that's going to work is fiber to that.  Right. That's all that really matters.  But nonetheless, let's take it.  And I think it's a great thing.  But of course, that's the neighborhood in New York where Google is in Chelsea.  They're on 8,000.  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they're just being a good neighbor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're being a good neighbor.  And I forget the number of you know, 200,000 residents around.  And I don't know how good it will be in your house.  But what it also means is that Chelsea is Google's campus.  So if you're a Google out and around the same way you are in Mountain View,  you're going to you know, there's free Wi-Fi.  What I love when I go visit Mountain View is there's no restrictions.  There's no signing in.  There's no agreeing to anything.  You're just on the Wi-Fi.  Thank you very much, Google.  And that they've done the same thing in their in their Chelsea campus kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And what Brad's writing about is the brilliant long game of Google Plus is really just a special example of what others have written about,  which is that others have said, for instance, that Google is a Trojan horse on iOS.  And we've all observed that we're not using Apple apps on iOS anymore.  In many cases, using Google Maps, Google Calendar, Google Address Book and and not using the Apple applications.  And he points out, Brad points out that he lives in Gmail.  I do, too. We all do.  Google voices his phone number. Me, too.  Yep. He says Google Hangouts is my new calendar invite.  I haven't gotten to that point yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's why I break from this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't understand that at all, in fact, but that may be I don't invite anybody anything.  Anyway, communities has been big for us.  Jeff set up a twig community that is really the best community we've got, much better than our own communities.  They're really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I need to be even more often to because we had it.  It'd be nice if we use those communities to also get story ideas and things like that.  I always forget to put up the replay of the show and one of the users puts it up every week.  Thank you very much. It's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How is I guess I could just search for it in plus dot Google dot com.  I'm a member, so I'm probably not getting the same result as a normal person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go to communities and then search from there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go to communities first and then search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then you can search or you can see your communities and you can search.  Right. Right.  Yeah, I need to be more involved here as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We've got twenty eight hundred seventy one members.  That's great. That's great. Yeah, it really is.  And Jeff, you haven't set up any discussions, have you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Haven't because I don't know what I should do there because one sense it's nice to have one discussion.  Some people are coming after me saying we should set up different discussions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know the idea of discussions make it kind of look like an online forum where you have, you know,  I think we'd have to do that if we wanted story suggestions, for instance, you'd have a discussion group that says story suggestions.  You might even have a subgroup or a group that says story suggestions for the week of I don't know how you would do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think you want some standards across the network.  And Lisa had there as a moderator.  So I think that if if you know, if he came along and said, listen, this is that we ought to have this standard discussion in every twit show so that one of your producers comes in, knows where to look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think bears are going to do that. Maybe Glenn will do that.  We'll figure that out. I don't I don't you know, see, my initial reaction was that a thousand flowers bloom.  That let each host and each producer do whatever they want with their show and and and have it be organic.  I don't know if we need it. I don't I don't say we have what's the twit standard for discussion groups.  I don't think I think every show should do what they want to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's boss. Don't you? That's great.  Yeah, because different things work for different shows.  I mean, like, for example, for TNT, Reddit seems to be working pretty well where people can vote on stories and bring them up to the top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they're using a subreddit that works great. Yep.  In fact, I wanted to do that. And that's never got around to it.  Anyway, Brad, I think saying that the Google long game is brilliant.  I'm not sure brilliance the right word, but it's clear they are playing the long game and they are there and it seems to be working for them.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Nobody's giving them credit to think that there's actually something here and what they're sticking to it.  There was another piece in the Atlantic today that said, listen, Google kills the things that don't work.  Right. And ain't killing Google Plus.  And it's only growing. And I won't steal my number this time because I've run out of numbers.  But we get to the end of the show.  We're talking about how news sites are using Google Plus in surprisingly good ways.  I there's a lot there and I really enjoy doing it.  I did a post this last week, Amanda Palmer, who I'd like to have on the show, by the way.  Deal. Yes.  She's she's just great. I did. I did an economist event with her and she's wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I loved her blog post. It was just amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. And I wrote about that, too.  And it was fascinating to see what happened to the conversation.  So I put the same post just to see what happened on my blog, on Google Plus, on Medium, which is Ev's new new thing, and on Huffington Post.  And apart from suddenly getting spammed badly, 300 posts I had to take out with odd South Asian names say, yeah, yeah, pretty.  You know, this horribly it's about it's about a teenager suicide.  It's an awful thing to have to go through and see people so off off key.  But that discussion on 100 posts on on Google Plus was really good.  The discussion on Amanda's blog, by the way, is unbelievable.  Just just just she there's it's three parts now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She started with on Internet hatred and it was about bullying and a very powerful and about her experience.  And of course, about this sad story of the teenager who committed suicide after making a YouTube video about being bullied online.  It was just wrenching, gut wrenching.  Really, really is.  I couldn't watch the video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know I did.  And it was absolutely wrenching.  And somebody one person gave me hell in Google Plus that, you know, I've been waiting for the moment to write about that time.  When you see on Twitter, somebody discreet somebody else, then somebody else comes in on Twitter and says, fight, fight.  And it really has upset me.  And I was waiting for that moment to see it again, because I want to say we're making the Internet.  You know, we're getting the Internet that we build.  And is this the Internet you really want to build?  That's what you're doing every time you do that.  Every time you see you point to something and encourage it, you're going to get more of it.  And every time you don't discourage it, when you know something, somebody is giving an ad hominem attack to someone who doesn't has no need to suffer it, then you're also allowing it and encouraging it.  And it's time we've got to rethink the Internet we're building in the society that we're building here.  So I want to write about that, too.  She wanted to write about that because she had a bunch of controversy and how she did her last tour with musicians.  So she started to search on Amanda and hate because her own number.  What she found instead was this gut wrenching, horrible story of this teenager who just had fallen deeper and deeper into bullying in school after school after school.  And neither of us was trying to make any comparison of ourselves to that, not by any means.  But we were coming along trying to talk about it in this way.  And then, you know, we just saw this doorway to a society that we don't want in this world.  And it's up to us.  You find in England right now the government has arrested people for tweets because they're mean or nasty, for example, burning a poppy, protesting soldiers.  In France, you have a government minister who's coming after Twitter and saying that Twitter should cooperate with efforts to ban negative speech.  Glenn Rieralt wrote a great piece about this.  And I was at Glenn.  It was somebody else.  I agree very much that that's very dangerous for government to get into this.  That's government affecting speech.  And by the way, it's not government's role.  It's our role.  It's our society.  And if we don't do something about this, then we're going to keep on getting more of what of what we encourage in the infantile early stages of the net.  And I'll take full responsibility.  I've been involved in some nastiness.  I've said things.  I regret it now.  What I said in my post is it's like the when the substitute leaves the class and we all start doing spitballs.  That's what the like early on.  But it's not.  We've got it.  We've got to build the society of ours.  So sorry for my.  No, well said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's something that needs to be said.  And read Amanda Palmer's blog post.  Start at the first one and go through the three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's the name of your blog post about this, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We get the net and society we build.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  True.  It's true.  By the way, I got a lot of response on Medium, which is in his Ed Williams.  Interesting.  Really, really elegant, wonderful interface for putting stuff in.  You just you just put the stuff in there.  When you mark the word, you have five choices above easy to put a photo in that sizes automatically.  It's elegant and beautiful.  Has no comments yet.  They're going to add that.  I have hired my ex agent, Kate Lee, who's wonderful to be the head of content for it.  But but I got I just saw a lot.  Even though there's no comments, I saw a lot of people noticing it on Medium and coming across on Twitter, marketing it.  It's a beautiful platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you currently you have to request an invitation to post content there.  Oh, yeah, for a bit.  And you post and you post you post content as basically as an article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, if you go to scroll down, you'll see mine.  So it looks like I think on the right, no, not there anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's really, really kind of.  There it is.  Yeah, we get the net and society we build.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Beautiful, simple interface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's kind of doing a long form Tumblr, a Tumblr for words, maybe also higher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's going to be in charge of content.  He's trying to bring in, you know, quality content and things and try to raise it up.  A and then B because there's collections in there that that piece is in a kind of just like an image.  Oh, one of the restaurants that I contributed to with a chapter from my book.  And so so there's a clap, not in the individual pieces, but the idea of collecting things.

Transcript:  Oh, this is great.  That's quite nice.  He's making a magazine and as and as his want, he's getting all you guys to do the work.  Of course.  Philip Kaplan, Pud, who created the F company once told me he said the best kind of Internet companies,  one where everybody else does the content, you just sit there and collect the money.  True.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Best in terms of revenue.  You have the best for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Although I like this medium.  Well, maybe they'll maybe they'll let me write something for them.  I could not believe the use of hashtags at CES is so out of control.  You'd go to a booth and the first thing they'd say is tweet this tweet this use the hashtag Ford or whatever.  And it was like I would I would last about five minutes at the International Academy of Television on the Web Awards.  They had you know, you got to have a hashtag.  I felt like God, I'm you know, even Seinfeld has the hashtag retro.  It's got a I'm going to call it a retro tag.  Why don't we have a hashtag tweet here?  Because I think it's stupid.  That's why even Newsweek, its last issue of the year.  You know, the last print issue, the last time they had an issue in print hashed right in the front, the cover last print issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's out of control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is why I do a show on your network, Leo.  I'm not going to do that.  You and me, you and me, we're on the same same page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, well, tell me why I think it's stupid.  But why is it stupid?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I wouldn't have lasted five minutes to see.  Yes, if people are yelling tweet using this hashtag every single booth.  Why is it stupid?  Why is it stupid?  Well, because if you want to talk about something, you'll talk about it and you'll find it like it just feels so crazy, self-promotional.  It actually doesn't bother me on TV shows like when you have the watermark in the bottom.  I actually don't mind that.  It's like, OK, you know, I'll see what people are saying about this.  But yeah, Twitter doesn't need that.  People are already talking about Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, let you have the conversation you want with the hashtag you choose the hashtag of your choice.  I bring it up because the American Dialect Society has declared that 2012, the word of the year 2012 was hashtag beating out Yolo Fiscalcliff and Gangnam Style.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder if Chris Messina popped a bottle of champagne.  He invented the hashtag.  That is the term, didn't he?  And there was a baby named hashtag last year, right?  That poor kid.  No, no, not one of the Romney kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Look up Richard Gingras on Google+, G-I-N-G-R-A-S.  He's the head of Google News.  And you can see a couple of pictures down.  He burned a hashtag on the beach for New Year's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it the hashtag backlash?  That's a good fire of the hashtags.  That's a good hashtag.  Hashtag backlash.  I guess it's so damn self promotional.  Yeah, that it bothers me.  And it's your right is attempt to mold the conversation instead of letting people have their own thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, we all do some self promotion.  It just it feels like just let your audience talk about your product the way they want to talk about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  But it's a it's a hint.  Here's a helpful serving suggestion.  Use the hashtag twig.  See, you know, mostly it's because I have a constitutional aversion to marketing of any kind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't bother me if someone's trying to start a movement on Twitter and says, you know, you're spraying or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, right.  So we're square. That makes sense.  That's different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But yeah, that's a lot different than the CES booth.  Booth babe.  Were there booth babes?  Oh, yes.  Oh, this sounds just this sounds like my personal hell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. You should have seen some of these booth babes.  No, it's funny.  We got there.  I had to get there early on Tuesday at the show opens at 10.  But I had to get there at nine because we had to meet somebody.  And that's when all the women, the young, attractive, high heeled, short skirted, heavily made up of the work, heavily quaffed women arrive.  And it was I was watching.  And, you know, so these beautiful women all show up.  And then their coordinator, who's also an invariably another woman, an older high heeled, miniskirted, well quaffed, made up woman, gives them their uniforms.  The miniskirts hands them out.  So they all look the same. Right.  Because then now, you know, you're with Booth hashtag.  Fem bots.  Fem bots.  Yeah, they look like fem bots.  Totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's so retro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There was a time briefly when this was not done.  Right.  And now it's back big back in spades.  But same with Vegas.  Remember, Vegas was supposed to be a family place for a while.  Yeah.  And now we were staying at the Rio.  They've got a topless pool.  They've got go go dancers.  And you entered the door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The first time I went to Vegas and saw like a stripper like in the lobby of the hotel, which I was just like, Whoa, I was like, can we I want to buy her a sandwich and like wrap her in a blanket.  Can we get her a hero?  Is there like a meatball hero nearby?  Like, let's sit her down and like feed her and talk to her about her life choices.  Sorry.  No judgment.  I'm so it's not a judgment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It just doesn't it seem I don't know.  It's not what it's not the tech community that we wanted to build.  Is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No.  That's the problem.  The thing is, yeah, you have I always tell foreigners that you haven't seen how low America can go until you go to Vegas.  You know, it's sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And we see a lot of people visiting from Australia and Scandinavia and all over the world.  They come to the Brickhouse and invariably they go to Vegas.  It's like you can't come to America without visiting Vegas.  And for the first time, I met a couple visiting from overseas who I said, are you going to Vegas?  I said, No, we're going to Napa.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We host Japanese students occasionally.  Well, two or three a year.  We host for a week or so at a time.  And without all of them, without fail have been to Vegas.  They usually go to Vegas first and then they come to see us and they're like bored out of their mind.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But yeah, they think America.  I think they think America is Vegas.  And you know what?  It might be right.  That's the that's the depressing thing.  Let's hope not.  I can't wait to get out of there.  Every time I go there, it's like two days is all I could take this year.  But it's the only and the reason the CES is there probably because there's an infinite supply of booth babes, but also because as they say, it's the only place big enough.  And in fact, CES, despite everything I've said negative about it was bigger than ever this year.  One hundred fifty thousand people.  They had to expand to the Venetian as well as Las Vegas Convention Center, which itself is massive, massive.  I think we should take a break and come back with our tool tip and number.  Jeff still has before she loses his last one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, my God.  Why I stock them up.  I hoard.  It shouldn't be hard.  You know, it's weird.  It's week to week.  Sometimes it's easy as pie and sometimes there's just no numbers to be had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like that for tips to some weeks or yes, too many.  And then others, it's like I'm scrambling right before the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, there's one story I'd like to have.  OK, yeah.  OK, I'll give you each a chance to pick one story that we haven't mentioned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So so Target is going to match Amazon's prices now for online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, right.  They don't want to be they don't want to be Amazon's showroom anymore.  So I want you to go ahead and buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What does that do to Target?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's good for Target, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I think it is because then you then you don't leave the store.  Right. I mean, the longer they can keep people in the store buying their stuff, even if they have to give them a little bit of a discount, they're going to buy toilet paper and paper towels and all this other stuff.  Well, they're there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, the problem right now is that people go to Target and they say, show me your TVs.  Which one do you like? Thank you very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then they go buy it on Amazon showrooming on their Amazon thing, which is what I do in the bookstore.  But right now, there's an obvious impact on profitability.  And then second, and this is on TV, is there doing the report?  You know, you kind of know you know, the target has always given you two prices.  So there's the price on the shelf.  Your phone along as long as you make them look.  So now you got to go to this effort.  It's like going back to the days of haggling almost, except that, you know, Amazon is your haggle mate.  It just seems that the local retail in person retail is screwed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it is giving in, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it really is. I think it was a big story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the Amazon pick up boxes, right? That's another one.  That's interesting. I just saw my first one kind of in person where it was like a like Radio Shack or something where you could locker.  Is that what it's called? You can order stuff and they deliver it to the store.  You pick it up there. I was kind of like, oh, I felt a little sad.  I was like, oh, this is this is too bad for this real retailer.  Like they're really hoping I'll buy something while I'm here to pick up my stuff that I bought elsewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I go out.  I've worked in Manhattan for many, many, many, many, many, many, many years now.  And I used to go out when I was bored or angry and, you know, wander around and I would hit the store and the record store and the electronic store and gone.  There's no such thing as browsing in real life anymore. It's just not there.  So I don't know. I just found that I found a story to be a big deal about the impact of the Internet beyond robots, beyond replacing things, you know, jobs with computers.  It's about the impact of transparency, communication and data on an entire economy of retail.  I think that was a big moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, inevitably, if Target does it, it means all the other big retailers will have to follow suit.  So the way it works, if a customer buys a qualifying item, but I'm not sure what that means at Target and then finds an identical item for less in the following week's Target circular or within seven days on Amazon dot com,  Walmart dot com, Best Buy dot com and Toys R Us dot com, Target will match the price.  I think they can do that a little bit with impunity because it's kind of a pain in the ass.  Right. That's what I think, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, that's why stores offer the price matching thing so much, right?  Because nobody ever does it.  Makes you feel good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Makes you feel good.  It's a pure psychological thing.  I'm sure we had Dan Ariely on last week on triangulation from the author Predictably Irrational.  He is an economic psychologist, and I'm sure he would say the reason that you can do that is because nobody ever does it.  But psychologically, it gives you the feeling, oh, I know I'm getting a good price.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. You purchase something, bring it home, check the circular and then or check Amazon and then bring it back to Target and get refunded the difference.  Yes. Yeah, no one's going to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Spoken as a busy mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, that's not happening.  It's not happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You say, I know this is cheaper on Amazon and they look it up for you right then and there and they give you the other price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It doesn't.  The details are yet to come.  But that was.  But that was on ABC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So unless that unless they really lied that their teeth, they show the guy coming in.  He picks a camera and a something and a something, a toy and a something, and he marches up front and says he shows us, you know, he's checking his phone and says, I know I know what the real price is on Amazon.  He goes up front and says, we agree the price.  And they say, let me look him up.  They look him up.  They give him that price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that's the local television news making up their idea of what will happen.  I don't think that's how it's going to work.  Maybe he's network.  Oh, well, they're they're impeccable.  You agree with the verge that the Amazon is the only unstoppable monster in tech today.  I disagree.  You know, is the unstoppable monster?  Just ask Apple.  It's Samsung.  Yeah.  What is Apple's price now?  Dropped almost 200 points in the last two months.  Samsung announced its biggest earnings ever in 2012.  It's I was watching the CNBC Squawk Box.  Jim Kramer said Samsung is the new Apple.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Samsung is putting on its own operating system on phones next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tizen.  Actually, you know what it is?  And you'd be equipped to talk about this, Aaron.  It's Linux.  It's now, of course, Android's Linux with a Java Dalvik on top.  But this is not that this is just this is like Ubuntu's phone or Firefox's operating system.  Well, Ubuntu phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what I wanted to talk about.  Real quick, just on the Tizen thing.  I mean, that's HTML five.  That's what Tizen's all about.  So Tizen is running HTML five apps on the phone on top of a Linux operating system.  So that's true Linux.  Yeah, absolutely.  And that's that's really what I think Samsung is pushing and wants to push is, hey, just run HTML five.  Now we'll see if it goes anywhere.  Now, the real question is, are they doing this in addition to Android or is this a response to Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they would like to be out from under Google's thumb and want to do something different.  Yeah, exactly.  I think they're hedging their bets.  I think they're hedging their bets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they well and I think it helps them because they are not.  It gives them it gives Google less control is going to say it gives them more control.  It really doesn't.  It gives Google less control.  If everybody's writing HTML five apps, they can do whatever they want.  And Google doesn't have the purse strings.  I think Amazon makes so much money on Android and it costs them nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Whatever minute minimal restrictions Google places on what they do.  Right.  It's worth it.  I think so, too.  I think so, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But did you did you see this Ubuntu phone, though?  Yeah.  At CES, there's a video of it in the rundown.  They actually showed it last year as well, but closer to fruition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  This is actually the video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's actually pretty cool.  So Ubuntu has been running on tablets.  In fact, they run on Nexus seven.  Have been for a little while now, a few months.  I think it is.  And one of the native.  You can cut the audio.  We don't need the audio.  Just the video.  looks like Windows mobile.  It looks a little bit like Windows mobile.  They've got many different things.  They've got a lot of different things.  They've got a lot of different things.  They've got a lot of different things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They've got a lot of different things.  They've got a lot of different things.  I think Mark says this at the end of the video is I take the phone home, I dock it or put

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it on some sort of device and my phone changes.  The display goes over to my big screen and it becomes my Linux desktop from the same  device.  So you've got this mobile experience on the phone.  But then when you go back and you've got a big screen, then you've got the Ubuntu desktop  experience.  Now, he didn't show that, but he talks about that's what they want to do is they want to  take this so that you just have this one device.  You got a monitor at home.  You've got this phone on the road.  And when you get home, you lay the phone on a pad or something.  And all of a sudden, your Ubuntu desktop comes up.  All your data is there.  Everything's connected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't see that as compelling.  In fact, Asus and others have done that with the transformer and didn't take off.  But you know, and you could do that right now if you just got the right dock with almost  any Android phone.  But I do think this is actually a beautiful UI.  It is.  I actually have done a lot of good work.  This actually looks pretty darn good.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does.  It has the boxes and the big typography of Windows mobile.  But it does.  It looks quite nice, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's a Windows phone-ish, but it's very not Android or iPhone-ish.  Right.  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  hands around so much.  Yeah.  It's making me queasy.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought it was really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Aaron, what are the apps on there?  The Gmail app and the Facebook app.  Are those, those aren't Android apps.  They're HTML5?  What are they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think they are probably HTML5.  You're probably right.  Because I think that what they've done is they've taken, they've started to, Ubuntu  started to deploy these apps on the desktop as opposed to just running the web version,  for example.  Right.  And I think that they've basically taken that and put it into the phone.  So they're creating their own apps.  I'm sure they're all probably HTML5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's really quite beautiful.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought it was pretty interesting.  I was impressed.  I thought, I was like, oh yeah, we'll see like a really tiny desktop.  And then, you know, they started demoing it and I was like, wow, that actually looks  pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're going to be able to see it.  I'm going to put it on.  Yeah.  So, yeah, I think that's the key.  Yeah.  I think that's the key.  But it's pretty interesting.  And I think they've taken it to the next level.  So, yeah.  They've taken it to the next level.  You have to make deals with carriers.  or Samsung phone.  Right.  Right.  I'd probably use it right away.  Of course, now if you lose all your Android apps, maybe that's not an ideal situation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Should be able to run them side by side.  Should you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You've got enough space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Could you put Dalvik on here?  Yeah.  You could run, you could run both.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hmm.  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hmm.  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Very complicated.  Maybe with Bluestacks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe Bluestacks could do it.  So Bluestacks is that emulator that lets you put Android apps on a Windows phone and other  devices, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Windows desktop.  I've run it on my Windows desktop before.  I logged in and all my apps came up and I was playing Fruit Ninja on Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's an Android app player in effect.  Yeah.  So if you've got Bluestacks running on Ubuntu phone, hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Bluestacks is interesting.  I'm not sure what their end game is.  But they're definitely doing some interesting things, porting Android apps to other platforms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Anything else you want to talk about?  Firefox 18 ships today with a 25% faster, just in time JavaScript engine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wanted to mention quickly this Google Play Store hitting a 1 million apps that might  beat Apple.  So the Google Play store might beat the Apple app store to 1 million apps, which is crazy  because I mean, I realize we've been around for a while, we being like twig, but it just  seems like just yesterday we were talking about how there were just so few apps in the  Play Store and they really needed to beef those up.  And it's so different now.  And you know, I mean, I think these numbers are getting an app accepted into the iTunes  app store is Apple app store is a much different thing than submitting something to Google  Play.  And it's true.  You know, I was saying this on all about Android last night.  You know, anybody can kind of fire up that app inventor and make a fart app and upload  to Google Play and that counts as an app that's in the store.  Right.  So, you know, whereas every single Apple app is approved, still, it's pretty amazing that  the Play Store and the App Store have the same amount of apps.  I don't think that this is a number to measure anymore.  Not for these two, certainly for other operating systems at this point, but still incredible  to see how Android is caught up just with this one particular measure that was really  important a while back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The current rate will be June of this year that they'll reach a million apps.  I think it's pretty clear that you're going to say that the turning point, but where the  app, you know, right now, I would say Apple and Android, iOS and Android are our parody.  And the real question is, is it going to now start to flip in Android's favor?  And I think so.  I think by the end of this year, it will be twice as it not the number of apps, but just  everything.  It'll be selling twice as many phones twice as popular.  It's just it's Apple is going back to its niche role.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The problem is that that there's a snobbishness that exists, for example, among developers  and in media both.  So you see, you know, I love the guys at Circa, but they make an iPhone app and that's it.  I complained to somebody else last week, just an iPhone app.  PBS did a list of best news apps and they were almost all just for iPhone.  And I complained and they said, well, show us Android.  So that's the point.  The developers aren't going there.  The economists is driving me nuts because they don't have anything for an Android tablet.  You can't use it there.  Verizon drives me nuts because they haven't updated their applications for a jelly bean.  The attention still goes to iOS because the developer community is there and media executives  are there and that's what they have.  But the public is unquestionably going Android and that's where they've got to go.  But they're not there yet.  So there's a bad attitude.  And I think Google could do something here by pointing this stuff out.  Google should should be calling the economists and saying, hello, you want some help?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wouldn't I wouldn't bother.  They will.  They'll follow the money.  Exactly.  We saw the same exact thing.  Remember Apple?  You know, Apple has gone through this with the Macintosh and people who ended up developing  for the Macintosh were niche people who made beautiful apps, always better apps than on  Windows.  But but if but if you're the economist, you follow the money and you make Android apps.  And I think by the end of this year, you'll see that, Jeff, I don't think you're going  to.  There will still be the circus of the world.  There'll be the the iOS developers will be much like OS 10 developers.  There'll be niche.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's there's still there's still a strong perception, though, that iOS is where you  make the money.  I mean, I just I just switched from the iPhone to the Galaxy Nexus.  And it's like Timehop, Lyft, the magazine, Letterpress, like really great new apps start  on iOS still.  So I really I'm waiting to see the like cool indie new startup launch their their mobile  app first on Android.  Right.  We've seen that with like Ingress and Field Trip.  Those are Google funded projects.  We still have to see that third party developer launch on Android first with a lot of success  because Android's where they feel like they're going to get the money in the audience.  I'm waiting for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's going to happen this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just this is the year just around the corner.  There'll be a path.  There'll be an Instagram.  There'll be an app that and by the way, that accelerates it because as soon as there's  an app that's only on Android that everybody has to have, then then really there is no  really much resistance to buying Android at this point anymore.  I don't think I think more and more normal people are just saying, yeah, what's wrong  with I'm going to get an Android phone.  All right.  Now it's time to take a break and then we'll come back with tools, tips, numbers and more.  I love this Mark Cuban story.  Is that going to be your number?  I have two numbers.  So you should make that your number.  That's a good number.  I don't anything anything like that.  I love.  But first, hey, we got a new advertiser.  I want to tell you about LegalZoom.com.

Transcript:  Yeah, you can start a side business.  That's the way to do it.  Oh yeah.  I happen to be surrounded by lawyers at the moment because we're doing the adoption and  our will and a bunch of other stuff.  But you know, that's a great, that's a great option if you don't want to have an army of

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When you go in a room and there's three lawyers in there, I don't know about you, but my,  I start seeing the numbers floating in from my head as the clock ticks.  Yeah, exactly.  He's $215 an hour.  He's $400.  She's $500 an hour.  Oh my God.  Can we hurry this up?  And they're never in a hurry, are they?  You notice that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're never in a hurry to wrap this thing up.  Oh, let's get out of here early.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I said, you charged me more for calling it that.  Just call it a telephone call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's telephonic communication.  Yeah.  That, that, you know why they do that?  Cause it takes longer to say.  So they can bill for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They bill for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's three extra letters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A contract.  All I wanted to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We got to work on, I don't know why, maybe Jeff's using a different Skype now, but he's,  he's getting echo canceled.  So I, whenever I talk, you can't hear him.  No, that's, we can fix that.  No one knows how to fix that.  We'll fix that after the show.  Just, just make a note of that.  All right.  It's time for your tip of the week, Gina Tripani.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really simple tip this week.  A new little thingy in Gmail.  Gmail's compose window now has a label dropdown.  So you can add a label to a message before you send it, which sounds kind of crazy, but  actually if you, if you depend on labels and if you organize your stuff with labels, which  I absolutely do, it's a huge help because normally if I send a message that I want to  file, I got like a follow up label.  If I want to file that in the label, you send the message and then you have to label it  afterwards.  Now you just do it while you're composing the message, add your label and send.  And that's in both the, the new compose experience, which is the, the, the window that opens in  the lower right hand corner or just your regular vanilla compose window.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Very cool.  So, and once you get a reply to that, it stays, the labels persist, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So it's a conversation.  Yeah.  So, so it would be, that conversation would stay within that label.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Very good.  Your number of the week, Mr. Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm going to mention this one first because I think it's something interesting.  Adam Scherk, S-H-E-R-K at Adam Scherk.com put up some really amazing numbers to me looking  at the engagement per post and per site for a whole bunch of news sites on Google Plus.  So for example, average engagement per post, number one, mashable.  Average of 239 plus ones per post.  87 shares per post.  67 comments per post.  A total of 394, thus, interactions per post.  I just found these stats to be amazing and to see that those places that are trying to  make an effort on Google Plus and, and, and new ways to measure engagement.  And as somebody pointed out for in one of the comments on my post, it follows Mr. Ergen's  rules that you do something that is done for Google Plus.  You put a big picture up.  So I found that interesting, but more interesting to Leo and thus to the world, but I'm not  a real jock, but you got to, I watched Mark Cuban myself on Shark Tank, but Cuban gets  in trouble regularly for what he says online and got fined $50,000 for a tweet that complained  about officiating at a game.  And that's pretty amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The tweet was, was pretty innocuous too.  It's just kind of like, I mean, it was, it was criticism, but it was like, I'm sorry  that I haven't been able to, you know, that the referring isn't better and officiating  isn't better, right?  Like I failed at making it better.  It wasn't even like a really mean tweet, a $50,000 tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess it's just cigarette money for him, but it's still, it doesn't seem like you should  be able to be fine for a tweet.  It's a ridiculous industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess because he's an owner, they could do anything they want.  He said, I'm sorry, NBA fans.  I've tried for 13 years to fix the officiating in this league and I have failed miserably.  Any suggestions?  I need help.  That's because of course his team lost by three points to the New Orleans Hornets on  Saturday.  It's the officiating.  You have a tool Mr. Aaron Newton?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I can do one.  Actually, this was in the rundown here and I picked it up and I thought, you know what,  if I need to do one, this is going to be it because it's pretty cool.  It's Power Searching with Google.  I don't know.  Did you put this in Gina or who put this in?  Maybe it was Chad or somebody else.  Tell us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was there when I saw the rundown.  It looks really cool though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It does look cool.  I was wondering if you knew about this.  So if you just go to powersearchingwithgoogle.com, you will find some sessions.  It's basically courses in how to use Google search better.  And it's, I think it looks pretty, pretty cool.  I mean, if you want to sign up, if you want to figure out, they offered one in, you know,  power searching not too long ago and now they're doing one in advanced power searching.  So I guess this is really targeted towards researchers.  If you are a researcher and you're doing a project and you really need to get down and  dirty and get a lot of data and crunch through it and you want to use Google to do that,  then this is a course that you would really, really want to do.  But if not, they also offer the power searching course on demand so you can learn more about  how to get the most out of Google searches.  So check it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.  Do you think you really need a course in searching?  I mean, it's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, like my first reaction was that like, oh, if your product is so complicated that  you have to offer a course on how to use it, then there's something wrong.  But Google search really does have so many, you know, cool operators and hidden kind of  advanced techniques that you really can do a course.  I mean, I know at Lifehacker, our, our Google power searching tips, articles always sort  of like the traffic on them always went through the roof.  People love them and ate them up.  And it's funny, I sort of start using new advanced operators sort of one at a time,  you know, like, you know, sort of reading, seeing the whole cheat sheet once you don't  really digest them, but once you sort of start to get used to using them.  But I think it's a good idea to say, here's a problem.  Here's a researcher problem, the thing that they want to find.  And here are the search techniques you would use to get to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there are a lot of little things that people don't realize are there.  I mean, I just I guess I had I knew about it, but I forgot about the image search, the  image matching search you can do.  If you go to Google.com and then click image, there's a little drop down you can change  to search for similar images.  Right.  And it's such a cool little feature.  And I guess I heard about it and I was like, yeah, yeah.  And then I needed to use it and and I use it.  And I was like, oh, I'm going to use this every day now.  It's so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what I would love to do is do a weekly search challenge on the show.  Oh, that'd be kind of fun.  We give us give us a researcher search challenge.  Maybe the kind of maybe the audience can do that.  Maybe we should set it up in the in the Google plus community and ask for a search

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  challenge. There's have you guys seen this documentary, Catfish?  About this guy. Yeah.  Yeah. So there's a show now.  You turn it into a show on MTV.  And it's for people who are in these online relationships who go and meet the person  and find out that they're not at all who they represented themselves.  This show, like the majority of the show is the guy, the host showing people that if  you just take the person's profile picture, who you think you're in love with and drop  it into Google image search, you will find where the truth is, like, janked the photo  from right.  Make it look like it's them.  And it just makes me want to love that.  You know, these people are just so in love.  And it's been two years of, you know, Facebook message I am, you know, that they're so  invested in. It's like this guy just pops the image and he's like, yeah, no, actually,  this person lives in Texas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So he does that each each week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He does another. Yeah, each week it's another person who's in love with someone who  they've never met on Facebook or whatever.  And one of the first things he does is take the profile picture and put it in Google  Image Search, search by image to find similar other web pages where this same image  is shown up. You know, and it's almost always fake profiles.  It's almost always someone sad and old and fat and trolly troll looking, you know, who  like really wants to look like a model.  Sorry, everyone being sizist.  But yeah, so that's it.  It just makes me laugh. I'm like, oh, it's a course in Google on MTV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Aaron Newcomb is a regular on our Floss Weekly show.  That's why he's here. He came up to do that with.  Randall Schwartz, but he also has his own show, The Source Show.  Or I hesitate to say that you haven't put up an episode in a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, you have to. I'm waiting for you to start your maker show.  That would be a combined effort.  Will you be part of that?  I would love to be part of it. All right.  Once you get around to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I saw Make Magazine is advertising for hosts.  Yes. So I decided because we were talking for a while with them, but, you know, we  can't we can't let them down. We didn't.  We've been delaying and delaying.  So maybe we'll just have to do it without the help of Make Magazine.  And just build radios out of raspberry pies.  That's right. Like that.  I want to do it.  Yes, absolutely. Absolutely.  So forget The Source Show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Transcript:  And I am that on all the social networks.  So Facebook, Twitter, but especially Google+, because I get a lot of interaction.  That's where a lot of people were asking me, hey, are you going to mention your radio  that you're building because you mentioned it last time?  Are you going to mention it again?  And so I said, I'll just bring along what I've gotten.  Show it off.
