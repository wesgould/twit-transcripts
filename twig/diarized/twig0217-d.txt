Transcript:  This is Twig, This Week in Google,  the show that's all about Google, the cloud, Android,  mobile, social, Twitter, Facebook, privacy, publicness,  and any topic related to all of that.  I'm Gina Trapani and I'm standing in here for Leo,  who's off recharging his batteries  on an amazing European cruise.  Well, I am joined here by my amazing co-host,  Mr. Jeff Jarvis.  Hey, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jeff is the author of What Would Google Do?  and Public Parts and a professor of journalism  at City University of New York, my alma mater.  We've also got with us today as a guest on our panel,  Mr. Kevin Marks.  Hey, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hi there.  Nice to see you all again.  I've been away for a while.  I was in the UK for a couple of weeks  and then last weekend I was at XOXO.  So I've been not paying a lot of attention for a few weeks.  It's been good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's OK.  We missed you, Kevin.  Yeah, we have missed you.  Kevin, you're currently at Salesforce,  but you've been at Apple and Technorati  and you've basically worked everywhere in the Valley.  So you've always got all kinds of insights  into what's going on.  How was XOXO?  All of the reviews I've read of XO is that it was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it was very good again.  They managed to pull it off a second year running,  which is quite impressive.  And again, it was very good, focused conversations  about making things, about independence,  but also a very great set of people  and a great atmosphere where you could actually talk to them.  I had a lovely long chat with lots of people  who've made things and built them.  And you come away refreshed and inspired.  Andy Bauer's closing thing was say, OK, yeah,  you've all been inspired, but I'm not  going to let you do another one of these  unless you actually do make some things this year.  So you're on notice, which I thought was very good.  So I'm going to go and make some things now.  Stop hand waving as much.  Write some more code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that was what I heard a lot of people saying.  They came away feeling really inspired.  I'm so upset that it was the second year in a row  I had to miss it.  The first year was because the baby was born,  and the second year was because it was her birthday weekend.  So I'm hoping that they're not going  to schedule it for the weekend of the 19th next year.  All right, let's see.  Let's dive into some Google news.  It looks like Google's tightening up security  across all of its searches, even the ones you're not signed  into.  So it used to be, or in October 2011,  they launched the feature that if you're signed into Google  and you do a Google search, it's HTTPS, encrypted SSL.  But they're rolling out kind of quietly the HTTPS or SSL  across all searches, even if you're not signed into Google.  And kind of relatedly, they're also tightening up  security in Google Chrome.  They're increasing the restrictions and standards  they expect SSL certificates to meet for Chrome  to not show that little dreaded red page that maybe this  isn't a site to be trusted.  So Danny Sullivan over at Search Engine Land  was saying that this might be a response to the NSA leaks,  or this could be just Google doing  what it does, which is kind of raise the standards for security  across all of its properties, which it has really  set a good precedent.  It's been setting a good precedent over time.  Does this matter?  Do users notice this kind of thing?  It kind of screws up some of the stats  that you get about what people are searching for  because those searches are encrypted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a problem.  But I had breakfast this morning with Alan Rusberger,  the editor of The Guardian, and he was doing magnificent work  there.  My thought to him was that the NSA story  is going to shift from Washington more and more  to Silicon Valley.  And whether it's a telephone company, or a hardware company,  or Cisco, that is to say, or a consumer service  company like Google, I think there's  going to be a lot of calls for more information  and accountability from these companies.  They're going to have to try their best to protect us  from our government.  And so I'm betting if maybe this was always  on the plan for Google, but I'm betting it got sped up  because of the NSA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they'd always been very good at offering  encrypted searches.  And Matt said as much when we had Bushnayar on,  that it was listening to him that made them  think about that more.  And they've obviously stepped up this over time.  They've always had perfect forward-sequence  see for a while, which makes it very much harder  to intercept their stuff.  And they've been doing a lot of work  on actually tracking SSL certificates  and when they change as part of crawl  to make sure that people can't inject new certificates  into specific authorities, which is something  that has been an attack vector that's happened recently.  That was part of the recent defacement attacks  were using techniques like that.  So there's definitely a stepping up there.  And my sense from the people I know  who work in the security space is everyone's going through  and doing even more auditing and paranoia  than they have done previously because of all the threats  and allegations that have been going around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right, I mean, honestly, when I saw the story,  I was surprised when I didn't realize  that if you weren't signed into Google,  your searches weren't encrypted.  I had assumed that all of them were encrypted.  I mean, I'm pretty much almost always signed  into Google anyway.  So it didn't occur to me that if you weren't signed in,  that it is encrypted.  But now it is, I think, which is a good thing.  So it seems like this is a combination  of both a response to the NSA leaks,  but also just a kind of incremental security upgrade,  which I feel like Google is kind of always doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Gina, back to the point you raised.  So because it's encrypted, then the metadata  that you used to pass along with the search  isn't there anymore because it's not known,  or it's known in Google,  but Google's not gonna reveal it.  Is that what you're saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The referrers go away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The referrers and the search request go away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the search request was always part of the referrers.  That was how you used to get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, I saw it.  You saw the, okay, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because the previous page would then be  in Google.com, question mark, Q equals,  whatever you search for.  And that's now-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that harms media companies, I think, to an extent.  You're right that they can't,  but the problem is very few that I know of  actually targeted anything at that end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was-  WordPress did quite a lot with it at one point.  I'm not sure if they still did that.  They still did that.  They may have moved away from that.  But WordPress would look when you did that  and serve ads when it got one of those  and not when it didn't.  And that was their way of distinguishing  between the direct readers and the people  who got there through search.  And they used that as a way of doing their  incremental monetization.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  About.com, certainly used it because that was the basis  of their business.  I don't know what it does to that.  And Google also used that too.  Now, there was something about not encrypting ad.  And I don't understand what that meant  because Google definitely uses search requests  all over the web, obviously, for placement  of appropriate ads.  So I can't believe they're gonna

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They may still be using, yes.  So I think if you're, and this is where we need  to ask Danny probably, but I think they,  if you've, they still know that they referred you there  and therefore, and they then got a back channel  to ads that they've embedded that can respond to that.  So they can do-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, so is that kind of unfair advantage for Google  that they know what you searched for,  nobody else does, they can serve an ad,  but if I wanted to use the referrer  to serve a targeted ad, now I can't?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you can still do cookie tracking  and foreign cookie tracking.  So you can still do the kind of,  I can't really call them, but basically,  ads that follow you around the web.  That still works because if you're using an ad service,  that knows where you've been before  and what you've done before.  Right, well, that's-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's not quite the same as a search.  That's an ad service that does that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  apart from the publisher, right?  So if, yeah, if the cookie follow you around the web,  then you know that, but if the publisher does not,  is not part of that service,  the publisher now gets less data.  I think it's a really good point, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right, that publishers don't see the search terms  when they're encrypted, right?  So with privacy comes like invisibility to publishers  who can't, you know, customize their content as well.  Right, that not provided refer information  has gone up quite a bit, actually.  Danny's got a chart here and hit the search engine land post.  Wow, up to 73 point, almost 74% is search traffic  where the referrer isn't provided.  So it does sort of put publishers in a bad position,  but it's certainly a good thing for users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Didn't Google pull back on refers  like two months ago or something?  I think we had a story some time ago  about how they made a change  and I wonder if it was anticipating this.  I can't remember what the change was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ah, I'm not recalling, hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I don't wanna jump around the rundown,  but somewhere in here- Go for it.  Somewhere in here is a story about more efforts  to find out a little more, speculate a little more  about Google replacing cookies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, the Wall Street Journal reported  that ad companies are nervous.  They're nervous about the cookie getting replaced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is a similar issue,  that Google may have more information.  I mean, this is gonna get a little dicey  in terms of unfair advantage questions.  I think replacing the cookie with something better  is a good idea, but if that plus this  means that Google knows more about every search,  in a way, I've said to publishers  that what they should be asking for from Google  is not money in Europe, but is more data about their users  so they can serve them better.  And if now that data, for both reasons,  is not passed along, it's gonna be a little rough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, the cookies thing is partly this,  is that we have other ways of better and improved technology  for storing information at the client side now.  So a lot of people are moving away from cookies  because you can actually use HTML5 storage  and things like that, which now that means  that each site can do that and is up to a certain size,  but it's certainly bigger and less clunky  than using cookies was in the first place.  I suspect it may just be that that has become,  the browser footprint of that has got big enough  that forcing everything through the sort of narrow barrier  of cookies may no longer be true.  It's still true that science can store information  on your, on the site about you,  and as they know where you're coming from,  they can tell information about that.  So they can still broker information back and forth  between them, just the question of the mechanisms  that were there that just meant you had to include an ad  in a certain way and it would happen, mainly changing.  But then, there's a gigantic industry full of people  who are busy working out ways to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's time for Jeff's dumb question,  we should have a theme for that.  Cookies were invented to hold state on the state net.  So is state held now through HTML5?  How was it held?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can still hold it through cookies.  What you would normally do with cookies  is store a session ID and then you look up the user  in your database on the server side.  Say, oh, I recognize that session ID, that's this user.  So all you would be storing on the client side  would be some, you know, a page number.  What can be done is you can store actual data there  and then feed that straight back in  so you're not trying to store anything on the server.  So that was another way of technique for using cookies,  so there were limitations to how much you can store in that.  What's been added since are various HTML5  client-side storage things that let you store  something more database-shaped at the client side  and use that directly.  And people have started using that to do, you know,  I suppose the sort of the original route of this  was Google gears, if you remember that,  where that would help you do offline things.  And that's been going through  a bunch of different standards iterations.  There's a couple of different variants  of how you can do this now.  But broadly, you can store a reasonable size amount of data  at the client side, you know,  I think it's about five megs without the computer asking you,  which means that you can store some documents  and things like that rather than just like a few keywords.  So if you actually want to use it for storing keywords,  that's relatively straightforward and should be unobtrusive  and is actually less fragile than cookies, I'd say,  because when that exists,  it's usually in a more modern implementation  and there's more interop between browsers around that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do I get, I mean, cookies give me at least some level  of visibility into them and I can see the list of them.  I can kill cookies, I can kill cookies.  I mean, I can, you know, erase cookies, block cookies  and see cookies. Yes.  Is there that kind of visibility and transparency  in these other technologies?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, yeah, if you look in settings,  you'll be able to, maybe in advanced settings,  you can poke around and find that and say,  no, this site can do this, no, that site can't do that.  So the other...  But it's almost as a skill, you know,  understanding how to delete your cookies  is a fairly advanced skill and it's similar with this.  Okay.  You know, you're gonna have to teach a user how to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Last week, I think, Kevin, we talked about the new,  or the week before last, Leo was here.  It was the new Chrome apps that can now be resident  on the desktop and can have more access to your computer  and Leo was worried about the security issues of that.  Is there more moving onto the browser now?  Is this a trend?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is to some extent.  I mean, there's always a trade-off between, you know,  computational power and access to the machine.  So what's happened is that we've,  we're getting different sets of tools to do this  and different kinds of sandboxes,  but with a lot of the big exploits we've had  over the last few years have been  through the existing sandboxes,  through using Java, through using Flash,  through using, you know, other plugins  and exploiting flaws in those widely installed plugins  to take over the machine.  So what we're seeing now is rather than having that boundary  between the browser and the plugin,  is that the browser itself and the specification itself  is much more defining what you're able to do  and what you're not able to do.  And that's because those are both more standardized  and more open source implementations,  I mean, modular Java to some extent,  that means that we get to eventually have better security  and transparency around them.  And also, they're being designed learning  from the sandbox problems we had.  If you think about the difference between  the kind of sandboxing you get on Android or iOS  and the kind of sandboxing you get on the Mac or Windows,  there's, you know, as we build new platforms,  you get more ability to separate different bits  of the computer from each other.  It comes down to-  Let me ask a question.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, go ahead, go ahead, finish your thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it comes down to moving from effectively  a sort of C dispatch model where you're passing around  pointers into memory back and forth  with the assumption that the programs will share them well,  to a more API-like capability-based model  where you say, I would like to do X  and you get a bit of API you can call it does X.  And, you know, some of those Xs may still involve  direct access to the machine or bits of the machine  and memory and there may be a way to break out of those.  But in general, there's more isolation installation there  than there was in previous computer designs.  And there's more, and given the amount of grief we've had  with exploits and viruses and take a machine takeover  as malware over the past 20 years,  at the point where these things designed,  there's a lot more thought that's gone into them.  Certainly, you know.  Let me ask this question then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  So you, WebKit is open source, right?  Yes.  And are Chrome and Firefox built on top of an open source?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, Chrome, so Chrome forked off the, we're not.  Right, they forked WebKit.  The names are slightly fuzzy,  but basically Chrome forked off it's,  there's this place called WebCore,  which was the piece that they were actually both using.  And then WebKit was Apple's wrapper around that.  And Chromium was Chrome's wrapper around that.  And they forked that now, so there's less shared code  and there was less shared code over time,  but they're both still open source at that level.  And Firefox has a completely separate code base  that it has had for years that's open source too.  So there's, we now have at least, we have three at least,  and there are some others as well,  but three widespread independent open source invitations,  which is good for this.  Right, so here's my question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, if something's open source,  that's what gives us confidence  that the security can be audited  in terms of NSA and other bad guys.  Is there stuff that's built on top of,  more confidence, yes.  Is there stuff that's built on top of  that base on Chrome or on Firefox  that's more proprietary, harder to audit,  harder to get into then?  Or, you know, is that an area where I'm thinking NSA  it's easier to have exploits?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are pieces that are built on top of this  in all of the platforms,  because there are the bits that are the  proprietary runtimes and the platform specific runtimes,  as opposed to the shared code.  And then there's your boundary layers.  There's like cap station layers around this.  And there are places, yeah, there are bits of  the Chrome code that Google doesn't publish.  There's Safari code that isn't published.  I think Firefox does still publish all of their code.  And similarly, there are bits of iOS  and kind of bits of Android.  This is the discussion about Android  versus Google Play services,  which I think you had, you covered that a bit  a couple of weeks ago when someone was talking about that.  Yeah, we have discussed it, yeah.  But that is a distinction between code that Google  doesn't share and code that Google makes open source  anyone can use.  So where you can audit is, you know,  if you're looking to exploit,  you look for attack surfaces at all these places  and you look at the boundaries between them  and can you persuade this thing that you are  the other half, the other side of that boundary.  So there's lots of, you know,  the value of creating the API boundary  is that you then know what that attack surface is  and the possible drawback is you can then put something  else in between that pretends to be that thing  and simulate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  Someone on Twitter this week,  it was Kurt Henzel said something really,  made me really think, I thought it was really insightful.  He asked, is Chrome aiming to be Google's Play Services  on the PC?  So where Play Services is the kind of proprietary layer  on top of open source Android that provides,  you know, the hooks into Google's services  and Google's cloud services and of course,  there's the layer of closed source Google apps  like Maps and Gmail and Calendar and all that.  You know, is Chrome aspiring to be that  on your desktop computer?  Because, you know, like last week,  we talked about standalone apps,  Chrome apps that run on your desktop and that, you know,  show up on your taskbar, your desktop, you know,  that don't live necessarily inside a browser tab.  And I thought that was a pretty interesting comparison.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I think that's, you know,  that's always been there.  I wrote a blog post about this called  Two Faces of Android probably three years ago now,  which was about this distinction between the piece  that's open source and the piece that sits on top  and requires a biz dev deal.  And when it's a web service, it's very,  these days, the web services tend to require  some kind of biz dev deal to let you use them.  You may have some open variant of that.  You may be able to use it for a bit,  but if you actually want to use it seriously,  then you've got to make sure you've got an API key,  you've signed a TOS and you're open to revocation  after a few times.  And this is one of the challenges of this.  You know, one of the values of doing web services  in this way is that you can provide this,  you can couple things back and forth  and you have a fairly good idea who's calling you,  but the drawback is you then, you know,  it can be revoked for other reasons  than terms of service reasons,  or they can obviously change the terms of service on you  and stop you getting access to them,  which is something we've seen going back and forth  between Google and Facebook and Twitter  in various combinations and also various other apps  that suddenly get their permissions revoked  because they were threatened there.  And we saw it between Google and Apple  to some extent as well previously.  So there is, the challenge is,  what piece are you able to compile any code  and run against it,  and what piece are you able to isolate and separate?  And both of those, you know,  but both those double-edged swords.  If you can compile arbitrary code, that's great,  but that also means that you can do arbitrary things  to the computer and take it over.  If you can call services and have permission and revoke it,  that means you can shut down malware quickly,  but it also means you can shut down people  for business reasons.  So there's always a dance back and forth between the two.  And it is one of the themes of XOXO was independence.  And the weekend before I was in Brighton for IndieWebCamp UK,  and that's a group that is trying to say,  no, we wanna build a web that has this independence  and won't break if one of these large corporations  decides to revoke something.  And that's the challenge of,  can you build something that takes advantage  of those services, but will not break completely  if one of them shuts you down?  And that's, in some ways,  that's one of the more interesting technical conversations  that's going on at the moment,  is wanting to take advantage of the things  that Google or Facebook or Twitter or anyone,  Salesforce, anyone like this,  who has large numbers of services that they provide,  but not wanting to be so dependent on them  that they can shut down your entire business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, no, that's a huge challenge.  That's a huge challenge.  I mean, think about,  if you think about a web without Google on it,  if Google just disappeared today,  there's so many things that would not work  across the web.  And I'm not just talking about consumer products, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff particularly will be in trouble there,  as he's pulling his eggs in that basket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is why I find CyanogenMod or becoming a company,  Cyanogen Inc becoming a company, so interesting,  is I think that they're really reckoning with this.  They're this open source project, this mod,  this kind of hacker weekend thing,  and now they're in a position  where they're trying to get Google certification,  and they had to reckon with the,  really, because of CyanogenMod,  that's the only reason why I realized  that Gmail, Maps, and Calendar  were all closed source apps that ran on top of Android.  I didn't realize this,  but it came to the forefront when Google sent a C&D  to CyanogenMod back in the day, in like 2009,  and said, hey, you can't include the zip, right,  into your installer.  So it'll be really interesting to see how they handle that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But yeah, it's still in the line.  What does Google think of Cyanogen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, there was that one kind of public kerfuffle  back when they sent the C&D and said,  hey, you can't distribute Gmail and Maps  because they're closed source,  your users have to get them separately,  and I think that that kind of shook the community,  the CyanogenMod community at the time.  I think since then, things have gotten better between them,  and if I'm not mistaken,  Cyanogen Inc has actually hired a former VP  of business development from Google to work with it.  So they've got kind of someone who was on the inside  at one point, and they're working toward  getting Google certification right now.  So it's in their best interest  to have a good working relationship with Google.  And I think that, I see it as a good thing  for the Android ecosystem.  I mean, if Google was averse to someone forking Android  and making another build of it,  they wouldn't have made it open source to begin with.  Right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess it's the same relationship that Xiaomi has.  Yes. Right.  Or, you know, I guess in a sense, every...  Let me, all right, this dumb question's continued.  This is the dumb question show.  What Samsung does to Android, is that a fork,  or is that just a rough pile to top?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It depends which bit of Samsung you're talking about, right?  Because they've got several things going in parallel.  So when they do the, like, the skins on top of it,  that isn't really a fork,  but it's changing some of the libraries  and the presentation layers.  So there's extra work to link.  It's not the closed source layer, if you like.  There is also the Samsung OS project,  which is a fork of Android that I forgot the name of,  but they've been working on that for a while  and had developer conferences for that  and building phones that use that.  So that's another project where they are building devices  that don't have any with Google component on there.  So they wouldn't have the Google Play services blob on that.  And Amazon is clearly a fork.  Yeah, Amazon is...  I think, I'm not sure, yeah, that's a bit of an adventure.  Or is it just a build with lots of things erased?  It's a piece, it doesn't have the Google Play stuff, clearly.  No. Right.  So it doesn't, it's not Google certified, no.  What I don't know from, they just released Fire OS 3  and I haven't seen anyone say...  What makes a fork a fork versus just a modification?  That's a good question.  The, yes, a fork starts off as just like a separation of code  and the question is at some point,  it's like what constitutes a species.  At some point you can't make merges between them anymore  and then it counts as a fork, I think.  It's when they can no longer reproduce.  So if, once you...  They're DNA are different, yes.  The thing is, a fork is just saying,  I'm gonna make some modifications to this.  So at the base level on GitHub, there's a fork button  and you press that and it makes a copy of the thing  and you build it yourself.  And until you change anything, it's like a fork in name only  and then when you change something, it's a fork  and you can then send the changes back with a pull request  and then you can, the other person can decide  whether to take them or not.  The way Android has worked is that they don't take pull  requests from anyone, they just drop a new release  every so often.  And so your ability to, in effect, anyone who's trying  to keep up with Android is probably working with a fork  or they're on the special deal with Google  where they've got advanced access to that  and the release is going in.  But what happens is generally is that when they do,  when Google does a new code drop, the various people  who've got variations on that theme then have a sort  of giant merge fest until they've got it working again.  So what I don't know is what Amazon has,  what bit of Android Amazon Fire OS 3 is based on,  whether it's on 4.2 or 4.3.  I haven't seen anyone note that yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I didn't realize they were calling it Fire OS.  Is that actually what they're, so they're actually,  they're calling it Fire OS.  They're not saying, they're not calling it Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fire OS 3.0 Mojito is what they call it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Mojito?  Yes.  I had no idea.  Well, you know, I just updated my app  in the Amazon app store and on Amazon, it clearly says like,  these are apps for Android.  And it was funny because I was updating my app description  and I was like, oh, should I not mention Android?  Should I only refer to Kindle Fire?  So I was like, no, any Android device can get  the Amazon app store on it, right?  So it shouldn't, you know.  It's not the Kindle store.  Yeah.  So it's not the Kindle store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In order to maintain that, they need to make sure  that they are still compatible.  So there's, but the question will become, you know,  are you using Play Services?  If so, then you won't work their side of the fence.  Are you using some of these other bits and pieces?  You know, some of the compatibility libraries may fail.  So that's, it's like, you know, any development,  you're always linking against something.  It's a question of, is that piece there for you  to link against or is there a shim  that lets you pretend it's there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think Amazon's approach has been  that they're adding bits for their own stuff,  but they're not adding third party APIs,  particularly that I've noticed,  but I haven't actually looked at in great detail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, yeah, it's very possible that the Fire OS,  Mojito, is an untouched version  of the Android open source project  with a layer of Amazon stuff kind of built on top of it,  which you could argue is not a four  because they haven't changed, right?  But they're not merging poles back into,  they're not submitting, you know,  Kindle specific changes back to Google  and Google's not merging them.  And they're not even trying for Google certification.  They don't want the Play Store on there, right?  They just want the Amazon App Store, right?  So, cause it's an Amazon buying machine.  But you know, it is interesting that Google Play Services  really does kind of edge out app compatibility.  I hadn't really, it hadn't occurred to me  that if I hook into Google Play Services as a developer,  that makes my app incompatible with the Amazon App Store.  That's not that big a deal to me because frankly,  the revenue that I make from the Amazon App Store  is a fraction, a very small fraction  of what I make from the Play Store.  But yeah, that's interesting.  In fact, when I submitted my apps to Amazon App Store,  they have a suite of automated tests  that must fire up simulators or devices.  And it spit back a report that said,  okay, the Kindle fire this version, that version,  that version, that version, pass, pass, pass.  So they're clearly like running, you know,  some sort of tests, you know,  for the app against each one of their devices.  And I hadn't really thought about Play Services that way.  When Google says, hey, developers,  like hook into Play Services,  here are all the things that you can do.  They're also saying, hey, your app's only gonna work  on Google certified devices from here on out, right?  Because it won't be compatible  for devices that aren't Google certified.  So, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So so far, the value of Play Services  has mostly been accessed to Google specific stuff,  but one chunk of it is maps.  So if that's not there, you may get some other map stuff  and they got to shim the API out.  But yeah, the other bits are mostly store specific stuff  or that they've got an API for trying to get you to  do multiplayer games and high scores and things like that.  Oh, and Google Plus is the other piece, of course.  Yeah, so this sort of social API that's there in Google Plus.  So there's bits in there and they're adding drive,  they're adding other bits and pieces  where this gets more, you know,  you're able to take advantage of these things  if you sign into Google.  And the auth stuff is getting more significant  because that is, that's a valuable time saver  when you're using Android,  you don't have to type stuff on the gadget.  It'll just say, do you want to sign in?  And Google will say yes.  And you get this like smooth one click integration thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a huge user experience upgrade for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly, so that piece is definitely something  that makes a big difference to your app.  And it means you have to write a bunch of extra code  if you want to say, oh, and I'll let you sign in  with Facebook independently and that kind of stuff.  So there's a set of pieces there.  The other thing that comes with this is a lot of the things  that we think of as part of the Android experience,  which is, you know, Gmail and what you could talk called now,  Hangouts and Maps and big chunks of that experience  and sense of whichever Android I use,  this stuff is working.  The other, what do they call the messaging thing?  The Google Cloud messaging.  The Google Cloud messaging.  So the subtlety of that, of making it such  that when you dismiss an alert on one of your devices,  they get dismissed on the other.  All those letting you write that stuff server side  rather than client side polling and things like that,  which would take advantage of Google's cloud services,  but that means that that's tying you close to that  and basically the Google account attached to it  for that to work.  So there's this sort of set of things that mean  if you've got a Google account attached,  this has to happen.  So that's the piece that they've got there.  Amazon doesn't seem to have offered quite as much of that,  but I hadn't actually built my thing for Amazon yet.  So do they offer you login type stuff  for the fire and ability to access their pieces  when you do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a good question.  I'm not sure.  When you get a Kindle,  you sign in with your Amazon account.  Right.  So really where Amazon really has to compete  and really now Cyanogen as well is that layer, right?  Like you're signing in with your account  and services associated with those accounts  and they do have to offer hooks.  Of course, Google has a huge head start on this  because they've just been at this a lot longer  than anybody else.  And in a lot of ways that's their advantage.  But yeah, no, as far as I know, I'm not sure,  but honestly, I wouldn't build that  unless I was building a Kindle only app,  I wouldn't build that into my app  because it would limit the way that my app worked.  My app wouldn't work on Google devices,  which is the majority right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that would be the challenge is,  could you use something like OpenID Connect  and have that work across both of them?  Google has implemented that.  Don't think Amazon or Facebook have implemented that yet.  So that would be one challenge there.  The other thing about Amazon is that they've got,  I would counter this because the reason I was off  for two weeks was I was going to the UK with my son,  he's going to university in London  and he's doing English literature.  And so we've got a whole bunch of books to buy.  And my first reaction was great,  we'll buy them on the Kindle  and that'll save you carrying books around  and your notes will be digital and that'll be wonderful.  And then I realized Amazon UK and Amazon US  deliberately don't interoperate.  In fact-  Because of copyright issues, yes.  Because of, well, because of mechanical interpretations  of copyright issues.  I can buy physical books from either country  and deliver them to the other country and that's okay,  but I cannot do that with the digital books.  What you have to do is set up an Amazon account,  dedicate it to a particular country  and only log into your Kindle with that Amazon account.  And if you switch it, it deletes all your books  and your notes.  So I'm good, my weekend project is going to be working out  how to do this with two Google accounts  and two Amazon accounts on the same-  Oh God, two Google accounts alone will kill you.  On Nexus 7.  Well, no, two Google, we can have two accounts on here  because you can switch between them easily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, you're right.  Two Google accounts is a lot easier on the tablet  than it is in the damn, don't get me started,  than it is in the Chrome browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not going to do the Google apps for your domain thing  because I know that will not work for the universe.  I'm going to just do a Gmail one.  The, go ahead.  Oh, but that's the, oh, somebody says they figured it out,  put notes, please.  So what I'm going to end up doing is making a new Google  account that I then attach to a new UK Amazon account.  And then both myself and my son can log into our independent  tablets with that so that we can buy books and-  Another thing you can do, Kevin,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is that on the new version of the tablet software,  you can have two different users on the same device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, that's what I meant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're going to have one UK user.  So one has an accent and one doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly, yeah.  And you can do that with Chrome and you can do that with iOS,  not iOS, you can do that with Macintosh.  You just can't do it with iOS.  And you can't do it on most of the phones.  But he's got a Kindle, he's got one of these,  and we can work out how to do that.  I'm sure you can do it on the Kindle device.  So you're just going to have to pick one for that.  But as long as he's got access to both of them on this,  because the point is he's starting to mark up books this way  and take notes on it, and that's actually a very useful feature.  But the worry is that your notes are then stuck in an Amazon  cloud and he's trying to write an essay and the Amazon cloud  goes down, all his notes disappear.  Or if he accidentally switches to the wrong one and deletes them,  then bang, all the time he spent highlighting the book is gone.  And given that this is his degree,  it's more significant for him than it is for me.  Amazon, meanwhile,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bezos sat down with some tech journalists  and the thing they're showing off, have you seen this?  I didn't put it in the rundown, I just put it in the chat section  I haven't seen this.  So this is new, and Bezos gets all excited.  This is the way Bezos thinks about service, right?  So if you have a problem, and of course, if you have a problem,  then that's a problem itself.  But you hit Mayday, and I think at first you get a video,  but then you can get connected directly to a video chat  with a customer support person who can take over your tablet  if you give permission to do so  and can fix problems.  Which sounds good, it has the air of a human talking paperclip to me.  A little bit of clipping to this,  because how many problems do you really have with your tablet?  And if Kindle is so well controlled,  Bezos is talking about how this is a life-changing thing,  good to have service, good to have direct service, I'm all for that.  But I think that if tablets are designed the way they're supposed to be designed,  they're supposed to be the easy devices,  I don't have problems with my tablet.  I promise that I can't connect it to Verizon, can you fix that?  But...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, I saw my friend snarking about tablet,  but Bezos shipping tablets filled with tiny people who want to help you.  I hadn't connected that, this is it.  I mean, customer service on this level  is one way that Amazon can differentiate itself from Google, right?  So there's that.  But yeah, I agree.  I mean, how often...  I mean, hey, I would love...  You know what you should do, Kevin?  You should start screencasting software.  You should get your son set up with his books,  and then you should dial up one of these helpful Amazon customer service people  and ask them how they can ensure that your kid's notes are never going to get lost.  Because I have to tell you, I was an English major,  and I hauled around the old Norton anthologies on my back.  Oh, yeah.  So if I had had an e-reader, that would have been way, way better,  but I can't imagine losing all my notes and highlights.  The very thought gives me the willies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm a little worried for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have this slight problem that when I go to the Amazon,  it says which device you want to send your book to,  and this thing pops down that's like 35 days old.  Yeah, this is this drop down of every device that has things on it.  Every Android I've ever touched, you know.  Kevin's 15th Android phone, it says or something.  Yes, this is OK.  This is a working on the show problem.  But they do only let you have copies of the books on five of them.  And if one of them dies, it's the same as the iOS problem.  If my Android broke one of these, and we were able to get the books onto another one,  but that we've used our copy now on the broken one that we can't access anymore,  counts as a copy, which means if I try and look at a book with him,  I've used up another one, and suddenly we're getting close to the edge  of how many copies of Bear Walkie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't just kill an old device?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I haven't found out how to yet.  This is, as I say, this may be one of these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, just hit the Mayday button, Kevin, and ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hit the Mayday button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I have to find the Kindle Fire.  I've got an original Kindle Fire somewhere.  I have to find that. Maybe they're right on that.  But the other problem is I'm not sure which one is the old device,  because it's just called Kevin's Android Tabloid 43.  It's like, which one of these has which copy of which book?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why I never send a book to a device.  I only pull the book from the device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Pull it manually. That's probably smart.  That's probably really smart.  So let's zoom out a little bit to just sort of the big,  big business decisions Google's been making.  Last week, we talked about Calico, which is Google's new startup  that's going to attempt to lengthen the human lifespan.  And I was saying right here on the show that I thought it was great  that they had this long term vision.  If Google isn't going to make these kinds of investments  into the long term future, who is?  And I love this kind of like long thinking.  Over at Wired, Ryan Tate, I thought, made a really good point.  His piece is called Dear Google, Shouldn't You Worry About Your Own Health?  And Tate's point is, if Google can't invest the time and resources  to keep projects like Google Reader running, for example,  you know, what makes them think that they should invest in such long term things  like health and not I brought this up because I knew that it was going to make Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This was such a spacious, short sided, right in front of your nose argument.  Well, OK, if it's a variant of this, it's a variant of the argument  that Bill Gates made to Google when Google wants to bring connectivity to the world.  We'll solve water first. You can only do one thing.  Right. So this argument is don't save lives, save reader.  Come on. Come on.  What a ridiculous argument.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I agree. But, you know, Page himself is the one who said that Google's all about focus  and more wood behind fewer arrows and spring cleaning every few months,  shutting down projects left and right.  Right. I mean, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And as he said, I watched his talk to Zeitgeist, which I can never get invited to.  And but I'm not mad at you.  I'm only mad at Verizon.  But we'll get back to you.  And so he's you know, he said, yes, of course, it's insane.  Whenever I thought we were insane, I was insane to do a self-driving car.  And for that matter, I think this I think that Maps at first was a moonshot.  What all maps can do today is unbelievable.  We take it for granted.  It's like it can be a Louis C.K.  routine here now, but it's unbelievable maps to do.  And it's also has incredible value to the business.  And it tells Google where we live and where we work.  My own newspaper, what newspaper doesn't know that, but Google does.  So maps eventually becomes part of business.  That kind of thinking would have, you know, from from that publication,  what publications would have shut down Bell Labs 50 years ago?  What transistor? Who needs that?  We have we have what does that have to do with phones?  Phones are simple. They use switches that don't do that.  Unix wouldn't have had unix.  What are you wasting your time on that?  Can't you make my phone work?  Right. Right.  We we should thank God or Google.  What will Google do a joke that that this kind of  of research and long term thinking, as you said last week,  you know, this very long term thinking is going on.  And he's already proven that if something doesn't work, he will kill it.  He will get rid of it.  And I'm sorry you don't have Reader.  Cry Feedly. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it wasn't that we didn't work either.  I'm grumpy about Reader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's a fair argument because you're a bunch of other things.  Google, you know, nothing to keep Reader running. Right.  And it was like we're shutting Reader down because we're moving on.  It's not it's the past and it's not the future.  And I actually completely believe that because I don't use an RSS  reader myself and I believe that.  But you can you can see how you have you have Google,  you know, shutting down and concentrating on short term.  Well, I shouldn't say short term folks, but focusing their products,  but then making investments.  Now, Calco is a separate company, is a separate company, isn't it?  It's a separate company outside of Google.  So they're kind of investing in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And the same way that some of the power ones are.  You know, they've got a bunch of investments in those kinds of things.  So they have these long term things.  They tend to put independent companies  are probably precisely so they can isolate them in from this kind of speculation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The rule is very simple here.  Google makes more money the more we use the web.  OK, let's logically extend that.  And we live in a way to say when I was a spokesman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The longer we live, the more we use the web, the more money Google makes.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But that's actually a really  reputable argument.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Immortality is good for Google.  Right. It's the old argument.  If it's good for GM, it's good for America.  If it's good for Google, it's good for all of us.  That's basically our argument.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Our argument is like if they got a self-driving car,  you can surf the web while you're driving, which is which is good for Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And and yes, it is.  And it's also Google knows where you go.  Google knows where you go.  Google can use these things for its it's not to jump around,  but for its delivery service that they just launched today in Mountain View.  Self-driving cars can have a lot of impact on Google.  You know, that's just what I'm disappointed in.  I expect, you know, this kind of dorky thinking from the Wall Street Journal  or somewhere, but this is wired.  You think they'd have a more strategic view.  And and and you know, science comes along, innovation comes along,  you know, and then Google's talked about this.  They don't sit down and think ahead to the full business case use of something.  They're willing to explore and invest in it.  And again, I'm just glad they are.  And I'm glad Wired ain't running the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So here I was, I thought we had a couple of guys who were reckoning,  who were facing their mortality in a midlife crisis  and out of the goodness of their hearts, they want to extend people's lives  because they just like humanity.  But it turns out they just want us to surf the web longer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's great. You have pure greed to keep us alive longer.  That's right. We're going to be we're going to be hooked up to machines  and they won't let us die.  It's the opposite of the death panel.  Google's going to have the life panel.  Google's going to keep us alive, whether we like it or not, forever.  No suicide allowed in Google.  And did you see, by the way, there's a new island that popped up  in the latest earthquake right off Pakistan.  I'm thinking that's Larry Page's island that you talked about.  Google Island.  Let's put all the Google servers there and we can go there  and Google keep us alive forever.  We'll be hooked up to things and we'll be happy.  I swear I'll be happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We don't actually even need bodies.  You could just kind of put our brains in jars and we could just kind of  like live on the web, you know, through Google.  That's right. That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Aaron Levy had the best two takes on this.  His first one was Larry Page, why are one percent of our customers  churning out for a year? Business analyst. Death.  I see. You know what to do.  There you go.  And then his other one was Google, let you live forever.  Is that a little way of saying sorry about Google reader?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A little way. I'll keep you.  Well, we can't keep you here, but we'll keep you alive for a few more years.  You can experience the future of news discovery.  So speaking of companies or sites that Google has funded  or has been involved in, which makes which seems has a much more  clearer business sense to me anyway, is the constitute sites,  Constitute Project dot org.  This is this is a website which which has archived  every single constitution currently in force across the world  with ambitions to to make available every constitution  that's ever been enforced across the world throughout throughout history.  So this is pretty amazing.  I I actually didn't realize that it wasn't possible  to look up any country's constitution,  but apparently it was not until until this site came along.  So if you go to Constitute Project dot org, you can browse by country  or you can browse by by topic and you read any country's  any country's constitution.  And this was funded partially by Google Ideas,  which is kind of their Google's political think slash do tank, they call it.  But yeah, pretty, pretty, pretty neat site.  And this clearly aligns with Google's mission  of organizing all the world's information and our rights and principles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And let's not forget that Iceland.  Well, first, there were some old friends of mine, Iranian friends of mine,  who tried to create a wiki rewriting of the Iranian Constitution  way back in the day.  It was like a decade ago, which I thought was a great idea.  But Iceland, you know, to what extent did that  open source and opened up at least the writing of the Constitution,  which I think was it was a very cool thing.  And so now to see the best of breed in here and to see where  what what rights are protected and not,  you know, when we break down national barriers,  I think it's a nice thing to have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mm hmm. How about free speech in there, Jen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm just smiling because the United Kingdom isn't there, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, because because you have no constitution, you fools.  You need a First Amendment, especially now with GCHQ.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We do have Magna Carta, but  it's all and the 16th  Vaping Bill of Rights. But yes,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you need to move beyond the one dot out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  No, it's just the UK is not there.  I'm very well. I'm so short for Great Britain.  Hang on. Maybe the other problem is, what the hell do I search for to find my country?  There are a couple options.  United Kingdom, Great Britain, Northern Ireland is the is the is  will be the thing I would search for. But  I don't see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No constitution, because you have written constitution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did you guys experience any email delays yesterday in Gmail?  Did you go a few hours?  Yeah, me neither. I think I get a lot of email.  Honestly, I'd welcome a seven hour break from email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Whatever. However, that's that's what we email anyway.  It's like, OK, I'll look at this sometime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, this is the thing, right?  Email is not it's not I am it's not instantaneous.  It's asynchronous. But on Monday, Google said that less than 50 percent of Gmail's  user base, which to be fair, 50 percent is a lot of people.  People were seeing email slowdowns or messages weren't arriving in a timely fashion.  Again, I don't know what timely is on it.  When I send an email, I assume it has to sort of wend its way across the Internet  to arrive in someone's inbox.  But messages weren't arriving in timely fashion and some attachments, I guess,  weren't downloading.  But Google apologized.  Apparently, a couple of their networks had gone down at the same time,  which is sort of a rare, rare occurrence.  And and they said that the the on average, the average delivery delay was two point  six seconds. I mean, really, do we care about this?  Seventy one percent of messages were unaffected.  But it's just it's interesting that people have such talk about dependence,  right, on Google, have such dependence on Google.  It's like anything happens with Gmail.  A lot of people notice right away, but also this expectation that email would get  delivered, you know, instantaneously.  That is like the Louis C.K.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  routine when he makes fun of people who complain that they can't use their their  Kindles on the airplane was taking off.  He said, listen, you've got your butt attached to this huge machine and it's flying.  Isn't that enough?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Everything is amazing and no one is happy.  Jeff, it's true.  It's true.  It's like when you know, when the iPod launched, it was like, yeah, but it's not  it doesn't have expandable storage and it changed the world.  So what else what else do we have here?  Oh, so Google Glass. It's interesting.  Google Glass was a Google X project, right?  But part of me thinks I don't know, part of me thinks that maybe Google Glass is  going to be one of those spring cleaning projects someday.  But really, I mean, I don't I don't think we've come to that place.  I wouldn't be surprised if at some point I mean, we're I think we're still going  to see the glass. I think it's a really good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Larry said Larry said at the.  At the conference that I don't get invited to that he  thought that Google Glass was just super and just great.  So I'm very excited about Google Glass.  Well, but that's what he says today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, it turns out Glass isn't going to get released in Europe very soon anyway.  I mean, it sounds like we've been hearing rumors that, you know, there's going to be  a glass store and are probably be available to consumers here in the U.S.  next year. But in Europe, there are there are privacy concerns, which I'll let Jeff  know. But also, interestingly, that the voice recognition doesn't  the voice recognition on glass doesn't work as well on people with foreign accents.  They can fix that.  Yeah, they've got to be able to fix that.  They've got to be able to fix that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I want to know, Gina, is when you're home in Brooklyn,  how well Google Glass works versus when you're in California?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm sure I actually I'm yeah, I'm sure that when I'm in Brooklyn,  Glass would be a lot more useful because I'm actually asking about your accent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The glass will understand you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I was talking about sort of the denseness.  I mean, the need for directions and just spending a lot more time walking.  And yeah, my accent, that's right.  As soon as I'm around, my family glass is going to knock and recognize my OK.  Glass commands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Glass, yo, yo, yo, glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Five dollars. Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, excuse me, glass.  Excuse me.  It is not too much trouble glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the Canadian version, I'm sorry, glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sorry, glass. Tell me a boot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So let's see, what else do we have?  One last story and then we'll go on to the change log.  The Google Science Fair winners were announced.  Yeah, I will have to introduce myself.  These are the Google Science Fair teens faced down.  Flu viruses, energy crises in the winning Google Science Fair entries.  We love this smiling, smiling teenagers holding what looked to be Lego, Lego  trophies, great trophies, Lego trophies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, very, very, very, very, very cool trophies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, 17 year old winner of the Google Science Fair,  the young researcher, Eric Chen, he worked on accelerating the development  of new antiviral drugs that could save lives in the science fair.  Very, very cool. There's a few really cool stories of teenagers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's one one girl, I think one is one we have.  We showed a video on the show months ago where she has the human heat powered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. The flashlight that's powered by the heat of her hand.  Yeah, she was brilliant.  Very cool. Very, very cool.  All right. What do you say?  Should we break out the the horns?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Chad, you ready for the for the for the change?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look, the Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Loving it, loving it.  All right. We got a bunch of changes going on in Google, Google land this year.  Oh, this week, excuse me, this year,  YouTube announced a new commenting system powered by Google Plus.  It's going to feature threaded, ranked and private conversation.  So Google's trying to tackle the the commenting problem that YouTube has.  So this is going to be launching on channel discussion tabs this week,  and it'll roll out to all videos over the next few weeks and months.  So basically, the new system is going to try to is going to rank automatically,  rank comments and feature threaded and private conversations  based on a variety of factors.  So comments from the video creator, for example, will be ranked very highly.  The system will push comments from popular personalities on YouTube  and people in your Google Plus circles higher up in the comment chain.  So you'll see the stuff that's more relevant to you sooner.  As well as highly engaged discussion about the video.  So if you have a really active thread going on and just like before,  you'll be able to vote comments up or down and those votes will influence  ranking as well. This is going to be a huge.  I feel like this is going to be a huge shake up of the YouTube community.  Long, long. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I remember going to the YouTube person  in charge of comments in 2008 or so and saying, hey, social comments,  think about that. That would be a really good thing  instead of just sorting them by time. And he was like, oh, well,  I don't know how you could do that.  But yeah, yeah, yeah.  And part of it is just that they share volume of comments on YouTube  is so much bigger than anything else that they tend to throw their hands up.  But giving people I think the other part of this is it's giving more control  to the people who post the videos to be able to moderate their comments  rather than just like being drowned in complete flame  and ghastliness as soon as you post anything.  So I think that's that's important.  This is the sort of fits my sort of tumbling thing of tools for time  letting people have more control of the conversation  by giving them better tools to do it.  So I welcome this.  I'm looking forward to this improving the the nastiness  that is that is YouTube comments.  But the challenge is that because that culture is already in place,  it's going to take some real work to shift the culture.  That piece is very hard with any of these systems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So were you asking Chad to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, Chad, you're really active on YouTube.  You do show this week in YouTube.  I'm sure that this is that people on YouTube are going to freak out about this.  This is a huge change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, this is really exciting because also like like what I do is  whenever I make a video, I share it almost immediately on Google Plus.  And all of it always feels like I'm cheating either myself or the other fans  that there are comments all on that post that never see the light of day  on the other video.  And sometimes I even mention like, oh, in the next video on Google Plus,  someone someone commented and said this.  And and I always do feel like I'm cheating the the YouTube audience for not,  you know, maybe they feel like I'm not paying enough attention.  On top of that, a few weeks ago, Google deprecated the video responses on YouTube.  And this seems like this may be what they were teasing way back then  when they said, we're going to give you new ways to connect.  So so maybe this will even allow for a video comment.  That would be really cool.  I hope that would be cool.  Yeah, maybe, you know, maybe if you mentioned something, you can do something else.  That's pure speculation and just hopefulness.  But yeah, this is this is really neat for YouTube creators.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, I know that when YouTube sort of started to ask users to link  their Google Plus account, which requires real names to their YouTube account,  that there was a lot of backlash.  People a lot of people didn't didn't like that idea, right?  Because they didn't use their real names.  They want to just keep their YouTube handle.  And I think and Chad, correct me if I'm wrong.  I think that's still optional.  I don't think you have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  At the moment, they've been pushing it a lot more.  And in fact, it got to the point where it's every single time I went to YouTube  with a with a classic YouTube account that it would ask me every single time  I went to just YouTube dot com.  And so I ended up switching.  There's definitely still a little bit of of pain on my end there was.  But I think that I switched it.  You have the choice of either creating  especially if you want to keep that username, you have the choice of either  creating a page that you could add managers to a Google Plus page that you  could add managers to or using your profile.  And there's pluses and minuses to each of those.  And that's where the sort of pain comes in, is that I wanted managers to help  with the channel and so that I wouldn't have to give people my my Google password,  which is now my Yahoo or my Gmail password.  It controls everything. Right.  But then also, I don't want to I don't really need a page for myself  because I'm already myself on a different on on Google Plus.  So there is a little bit of confusion there.  So that's why there's an OMG chat on Google Plus.  And there's also a Chad Johnson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Plus, I wonder if with this change,  if you post a video to both to YouTube and Google Plus, if those comment threads  will mirror like if someone makes a comment on Google Plus, will that also show up  on YouTube? They have to be separate threads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What I'm hoping and based off of the off of the screenshot is that if you share it  on Google Plus, it will have whatever you enter into the text box as a comment.  So if you say, well, you know, like if I if I post on my channel and I say,  you know, I made a vlog and I had a great time with such and such and such and such,  that will show up as a comment.  And then anything anyone that anyone who comments on top of that post will show up  underneath as the replies, which is sort of what this image is suggesting.  Yeah, Google Plus. Right.  So so there's the via Google Plus, which would be whatever you write in your  descriptor, and then these replies are the replies to the post.  And of course, it's not going to strip it.  It'll strip out the embedded video, which shows up on on the Google Plus page.  Right. So that's how I imagine it to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, that's really cool.  So you have everybody commenting on the same content.  And so everyone gets to see everybody else's comments.  You're not going to have the problem that you have where you're like, oh,  for Google Plus, somebody said this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly. No, no, no, not quite because you can have private comments.  You can set it up so that the Google Plus comments are just to a circle.  It's especially that's the other whatever the other thing is called.  That isn't a circle that that you have to community.  Yes, you could you can you can still have  four comments, but the ones you see will be the ones that you want.  The the the circles or communities that your members are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes. So so imagine you say you send it to your family circle and you say, you know,  this is this is the the local sheriff department talking about this thing.  And then you you could just trash that sheriff.  You could make fun of him.  And only your circle of family, if they go to the page,  could see those comments because that's all you shared it with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. So look at this idiot.  Yeah. And then not everybody will see that.  Got it. Got it. I like it.  I'm excited about it.  I'm excited about it as a non as a non YouTube user.  I assume that this is going to be just a big change for the for the community  and culture there. And I think I expect that people will be upset about it  when it happens. But I think it'll make the ones are going to be most upset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are the trolls and I think and so I think that's kind of OK.  I also the fact that you can use Google Plus comments now on YouTube and also  Google Plus, the other thing when I when I shared this on Google Plus, I said,  I really would like to be able to put this on my blog  and have the comments there work across both, which would be great.  And Bradley Horowitz, for I put his name in it.  Bradley Horowitz, the head of Google Plus, responded.  Interesting idea. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  that's always it seems like that's always Bradley's response.  And then we get it. We get a good a few months down.  Yeah. Yeah. A few months in.  All right. So keep an eye on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If only if only  so moving along with the change log, Google's got a new flat logo.  Everybody's getting flat, new flat logo and an app launcher style.  Now, that's going to be official and it's rolling out over the next few weeks.  So I actually I'm not seeing this in my logged in Chrome,  but I opened up an incognito window and just went to Google dot com and saw this.  So basically, here's a change.  The black bar that used to run atop all of Google's properties that's going away.  And this redesign, the black bar has been replaced with a new menu.  It kind of sits next to the share and account information.  It looks like the grid of boxes, which is like the same, which is the same  button, which launches apps in Chrome.  Yeah, there we go. Thanks, Chad.  Right there. Yeah.  Yeah. Yeah. So so they're kind of unifying this.  This is how you get to the rest of the rest of Google.  And I have to say, I'm not I'm not sad to see that black that black bar go.  So you'll see see the black bar  leave your Google dot com home page and other Google properties over the next  over the next few weeks.  Gmail for Android got a little update today or last couple of days.  It's actually I think it was today or yesterday.  Just a little redesign updates with the  leaner conversation view and improve multi select.  So it's much easier to select multiple  conversations and see and see that you're going to perform a batch action across  many, many conversations.  You tap on the user icon in order to do that.  Also, if your account sync is off, you'll get a big notification at the top of the  page at the Chad showing off right now telling you that account sync is off and  you should turn it on in order to get get new messages.  Google Wallet makes its iOS debut, and this is without NFC support.  So the payment payments app is now available for devices.  And with it, you can transfer money to friends.  You can store you can track loyalty card activity and nearby offers.  Tap to pay doesn't work on devices because they don't support NFC,  but you can do basically everything else that an Android user can do on iOS now.  And if you lose your phone or tablet,  you can disable the Google Wallet app remotely on the Google Wallet website.  Also on iOS, Google Translate for iOS adds handwriting support and a new UI.  The new UI is just redesigned for iOS 7.  And now, just like you can do with Google,  you can input characters via handwriting.  So you can tap tap the handwriting button and write.  My handwriting.  It's a slow input method, but it works and is now available on iOS.  Can you type journey's characters?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I could get it right, though.  You've got it can't be too too fiddly.  And it looks like we have we have a we have a late entry.  Oh, thanks, Jeff.  Google starts supporting Google Plus hashtags in search queries.  Look at this.  So you can search on Google, regular Google dot com search.  You can search for a hashtag.  So like Emmys and it will return.  So now does this return web pages with the hashtag in them or or with the word?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know whether that's or is it or well,  Google Plus, when you ask for a hashtag, it doesn't just give you the hashtag.  It gives you, I think, things that it knows are relevant, things that he knows are

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  relevant. Right. Right.  So that makes a lot of that makes a lot of sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, of course, ideally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This should include Twitter feed, but of course, that that marriage would asunder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, unfortunately, it should.  You're right.  And actually, somebody would do well to make it.  And this would be a very simple Chrome extension to make is to embed in an I  frame or some such a Twitter search for that hashtag as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the answer to the question is if I search for a hashtag, I mean, for example,  the second result is just the plain old site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Right.  It looks like it's not in the normal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's only in the cards over on the side.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If I search for hash XOXO first, which was the hashtag for XOXO,  it finds everything but G plus, which is kind of fun.  So it finds Instagram photos for that tag.  It finds it on app dot net.  It finds them in Tantex site  because he's he's in the web.  It finds it finds the hashtag on Tumblr, but it doesn't put it to Twitter.  Oh, no, it points to the account, the XOXO account on Twitter, not the hashtag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, interesting.  So that was the knowledge area on the right side, like the Emmys example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Emmys, the Emmys, they know what yet  clearly XOXO first isn't in this way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on here, folks.  So this is I did the wrong version of the search.  OK, so now I'm seeing a constantly updated feed of  things from Google Plus.  So this is going to get what you don't get that I get that by the box.  We're seeing the right. I do it.  Oh, but it's a flat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I said, OK, yeah, so it's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'll get it updated.  But my point is this. My point is this.  This is going to be controversial with those who say the Google user monopoly,  like  this soon to be former president of Microsoft just said this week.  And those who say Google can't use its page to promote itself, of course,  as if the New York Times uses its page to promote Washington Post, it doesn't.  But but that'll be interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's just scrolling old ones.  And such for Emmys is like seven hours ago, four hours ago, seven hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, nobody but it may be relevant.  It's not time. I don't think it's time based.  It's more than one scroll.  Why are they scrolling? That's a good question.  I think maybe just to show me that I can scroll because there's a scroll bar there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hmm.  I first heard it is clearly not everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is clearly chosen  by some algorithm.  Of course, Google Plus always shows by an algorithm idiot.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. But the content on the side, that right column does not appear for every  hashtag, so it appears for Emmys and I tried individual shows.  Right.  But like XOXO Fest, which is a pretty popular hashtag on Twitter,  probably not as much on Google Plus, doesn't have that right hand column.  Hmm.  Right. Even the hashtag XOXO Fest on App.net shows up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sorry, I'm laughing because I've got this one here that is probably  what they say. This is for you, Emmys Ellison.  And then they have a rotten e-cars full of swearing.  So this is a wonderful example of Google  inserting the hashtag Emmys, even though it is somebody whose name is Emmy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, the cat hashtag is pretty awesome.  I feel like Sarah Lane is going to love this.  Oh, that's all I got.  That's all I got for the changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sorry, Chad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I found another one.  I don't know if she's seen this report,  but I found it when I clicked on Chrome on iOS 7, which maybe this happened two  weeks ago and I didn't notice, but they've got a new thing that says  reduce data usage. Have you seen this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, the Chrome compression.  Yeah. Yeah.  What's it called? It's got a name.  It's got kind of a clever name.  It's Google's proxy for Chrome traffic  that will compress it for you and will reduce Internet traffic.  That's been around for a while.  So had you you launched Chrome on iOS and it prompted you about it?  Or you just saw it in the settings?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it was a little bit of a problem for me about it.  And I mean, this is partly because I haven't touched iOS in two and a half weeks  because I found that the Nexus 7 was fine.  So I hadn't actually picked up the tablets.  And there may have just been me catching up on a very old setting,  but I hadn't seen that before.  Well, that was a new one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  This has been out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Actually, it looks like it looks like there was an article on on TechCrunch  that Google Google expands Chrome data compression feature on iOS.  Right. Right.  And it'll it'll it'll it'll encrypt it as well.  Google's begun expanding access to its Chrome data compression feature to more users,  especially specifically those on iOS devices.  But yeah, so they announced this feature quite some time ago, but it looks like  OK, they're just rolling out notifications about its iOS availability to more users.  So that's what you're seeing, Kevin.  You're getting that you were getting the notification about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What what else?  There's some Facebook news, there's some Twitter news.  Do you guys want to pick?  Should we pick a story?  Should we talk about the IPO?  Should we talk about?  I don't know. I'll give you my favorite Twitter story.  All right. Yeah, yeah. Go for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A guy tries to get on an easy jet flight that's delayed.  They're being mean to a passenger.  So he tweets a complaint about easy jet and they come and tell him he can't get on the plane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, they stopped him from getting on the plane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Then then he revealed that he's a lawyer and they made him get on the plane.  It's one of the greatest Twitter fails I've ever seen.  Can you imagine that they just come to say you can't say those things like that, sir?  You can't get on this plane then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wow, that's amazing.  So it wasn't a promoted tweet like the jet blue or was it Jeff Blue or I think it was.  It was just some guy in line.  That's all he was doing.  Some guy in line complaining about them being.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. They're being mean to a passenger.  So he said something they told me couldn't get on.  I love that story. I think it's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What you say matters indeed.  You know, we talked about Magic Rex.  We came speaking on Twitter.  We talked about the at Magic Rex Twitter experiment.  I think it was a few episodes ago.  And it turns out that, oh, yeah, it was British Airways.  Thank you, Zach, from the chat room.  It was British Airways, the guy complaining about British Airways  handling his bag that got promoted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it says easy jet here.  No, no, no, that was a different story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's trying to get a different story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, it's a time.  So we talked about Magic Rex a few few episodes ago, and that's the Twitter  experiment where if you follow, you'll get you'll get direct messages  of recommendations of people to follow and links that got tweeted and news that got tweeted.  So it turns out that Google this was a Twitter experiment.  This is an official Twitter experiment.  I think maybe it got built during one of their hack days.  But they're actually building this into the regular Twitter experience.  They're going to start rolling out notifications, mobile notifications  of people who you should follow, people who your friends are following.  So this is this is pretty cool.  I'm I'm excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If they can make it easy to follow, that would be good,  because the way it works at the moment is it sends you a DM  and then you've got to like click on the link and I know hit the three people  to tell us who followed it and then hit follow.  So if they can tune the UX.  But I find it useful.  I find it quite handy for finding people who are suddenly  like bursting in the news or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, it's I've really enjoyed it, but I agree the DM isn't the best user  experience, but this is Twitter for Android and Twitter for iPhone users  will receive these recommendations via push notification.  So I imagine if they do it well, particularly on Android,  if they use the rich you'll be able to just follow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think no, no more push notifications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, you can change your settings and you can say don't send me these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, let's hope.  I like push notifications, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  if you go into your notification settings, there's a recommendations toggle.  You can toggle it off and you won't get you won't get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the problem with getting the other problem with getting a new tablet  or a new phone is having to do is whack a mole to find all the notifications  and sounds.  Yeah, sounds that drive me crazy.  I think I've got them all then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, no, it's true.  It's true. I spend a good amount of time.  I feel like I calibrate the settings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know if maybe it's not.  Let's see if it's got has it gone out yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not there is notifications in the Twitter app settings.  The only way you can stop it is to like pull down on the vacation and say  Android shut this app up for me, would you?  Because that was this is the problem, you know, because I've got my own app  that does notifications, so I want to turn off the ones from Twitter  that are much less useful than the ones I use. Right. Right.  Because it essentially is ones that don't actually expand to show you  the whole tweet and collapse to say four people said blah and type things,  which is just annoying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. Right. At least they stack them.  Yeah, no, I'm not seeing it either.  It's possible that the update just hasn't gone out yet.  If you if you do prefer the DM, you can just keep following magic.  I know that'll keep working the way that it does.  Let's see.  Facebook launches advanced AI effort to find meaning in your posts.  This is interesting to me because of because my work work on.  Kevin's laughing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just love that headline.  Good luck.  I really don't Facebook post. I can't find me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Find meaning in your post.  Well, so this is this is kind of interesting and it's related to Google  and that there's so there's a new research group inside Facebook  that's working on building sort of AI into into Facebook  so that it can analyze post to Facebook and recognize people and places  and objects a lot, how knowledge gaps works on Google  and try to get a sense of, you know, do do things like sentiment analysis  and figure out what has happened to people, what they're talking about,  how they feel about it.  And of course, probably with the end of boosting their their ad targeting.  I mean, you know, obviously Facebook has a lot of technology  that tries to get the newsfeed to be more relevant  and, you know, ranks newsfeed items by importance by user.  But this is more of like identifying what people are referring to.  You know, when you say Java, are they talking about the coding language or or?  Oh, this is more like this intermediation and stuff.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  And they've got they've got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't mean this intermediation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's the word I mean?  Two things that seem alike, but you find out which one's which.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is a big this is a big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a big question. Thank you.  The big question. There we go. Yeah.  Because it needs Google when I have you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's OK.  So I'm I've been reading Clive Thompson's new book.  Have you seen have you read this yet? Have you seen this?  No, I haven't. What's this?  What's it called?  It's called Smarter Than You Think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm waiting for him to get in trouble for being optimistic about the net.  Yes. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And no, but it's wonderful.  It's it's it's it's very good because, you know, Clive always writes really well.  And this is like a yes.  A big part of his is wonderful long form things stuck to him in the form of a book.  But one of the things he talks about in it is  how we discover knowledge and information  and how we actually use each other as repositories for information.  So you can ask a question like that and get a response back from people.  And he says that the way that the Google is working is trying to be more like that  than it is like a classic  going looking at something in the library and going through an automated process.  And he says we're very good at adapting to the knowledge that somebody else knows.  And so he says, if you got married couples,  they will each specialize in remembering one kind of thing.  So my wife will remember where we're supposed to be going at the weekend.  And I'll remember how to fix computers or something.  And we will know that each of us will not bother  learning the other thing because we can ask the other about that.  And he says that that effect is what we're starting to see with  with Google search, with Wikipedia, with  bothering to remember phone numbers, things like that.  It's not that the machines are making us stupid or less rigorous.  It's just that we're fairly good at optimizing the use of our brains for things  and relying on other people and other devices for the bits that  we don't need to do.  And so that that that was a that was a pressing argument.  And exactly what you just did there was exactly the kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pardon me here. Get your drinks ready, folks. Get your cups ready.  It's it's the same thing that Gutenberg did.  But that before books and before the mass production of books,  you had to have things like rhymes to remember things.  Yes, because there was no way to write it down easily.  Paper was not as expensive.  And then we had books to remember things.  And it's that's so. Yeah, we have Google.  I know I do think that there are there are skills that you learn  as to how you remember things that young people today will  will have different devices to remember things that are different from what mine  are, you know, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So he talks about that.  He talks about Socrates and Fedris and that stuff that as well.  He also found a great tool,  which I will make a tool later that is part of the Kindle  that is called Daily Review.  And what it will do is you go to it and it'll it'll give you  10 highlights from a book you read a month ago  to remind you what that book was about.  And it'll adjust the spacing of these to try and encourage you  to remember more from the book.  So it's using it's trying to give you more of that classic recall thing.  Because part of part of this is that we're very good at recalling things  that sort of the general gist of things.  And over time, we the specifics decay.  But you can you can counteract that by having  by rereading and reviewing, which was the point of a commonplace book.  So this is a way of turning or you could just Google it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you know, I really like the Daily Review.  But like I love Timehop for this reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Timehop and ThinkUp has a feature where it says like,  this is what you were thinking about or talking about two or three years ago  on this day. It's this sort of I haven't asked for it.  I haven't said like, oh, what, you know,  I really like those sort of nostalgia apps, those apps,  those reminder apps of information that I thought about before,  because you get this long term perspective of like, oh,  this is the trajectory of my thoughts on this thing or like this is  I was wrestling with that.  It sort of makes these connections.  And and I and I just remember a lot more like my memory is terrible.  But when I get reminded of stuff and I like that Daily Review  and I should look at it more often for Kindle Highlights,  because I'm like, oh, yeah, that book was so good.  And I can connect that piece of information I consumed, you know,  two years ago to something that's going on in my life right now.  And I tend not to quit to look to look up those things.  It's push versus pull. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, yeah, so where we go with that disambiguation.  Oh, so the thing that Facebook has is that they do have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're also going to memory loss, Kevin, which is that's OK.  I don't I don't need these to remind me what I was thinking two years ago, Gina.  I need it for two minutes ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Clearly, we all do.  There was an awkward pause, like, wait, what are we talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where's the back button?  That's what we need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The back button.  Well, he has yet.  I'm sorry. I'm raving about this book because I'm halfway through it.  Here's has the life logging thing as well.  The fascinating effects of that  where you wear a little camera that takes a photograph every 30 seconds.  And at the end of the day, you go back through it and you go, oh,  I had a chat with Jeff and Gina today.  I don't remember that.  And then then it helps you sort of re consolidate it a bit.  So anyway, so the point for Facebook is that they already have in the graph stuff,  they already have a sort of their own version of what are all the things  in the world that people talk about.  So I suspect this A.A.  stuff, A.I. stuff that they're doing is similar to what Google has been doing  with whatever that thing that they call the cyborg gods is  to try and make to make sense of what you know what you're talking about.  But they've they've got the ability and they've been doing this for a while.  They've already when you start mentioning something, it'll go,  you know, it'll auto complete it.  You can click it if it's the right one.  So they wouldn't make the I'm talking to some of my friend called Emmy.  I'm talking about the Emmys thing.  Mistake unless I actually hit return on the wrong wrong  auto complete there in Facebook.  But but they but if if people can't be able to do that,  if you or if people aren't trying to do like the equivalent of an act,  shout out to somebody, this is going to be one of those things  that starts getting interesting when it starts.  It's going to be like face recognition, photo tagging.  Suddenly you'll find it'll start telling you all these people  are mentioning you who are actually like subtweeting you  and trying to snark about you without you realizing what they're saying.  So that's going to add an extra dimension of trickiness to this game of  how do we how do we grumble about somebody without them  realizing grumbling about them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. So people will be will be trying their best to to escape  Google or Facebook's algorithm for figuring out who they're talking about.  But actually, Facebook does it right.  Subtweeting on Facebook won't be possible, right?  Because if their algorithm is good enough, they'll know who you're talking about.  If you have an auto filled the link, the link name.  Ah, um, the last time you guys went, what's my Yahoo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I only use it.  I don't even think of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I use it as the example of the silliness,  the stupidity of early visions of personalization,  of having to fill out a form to get something you want  and how we should be actually just be able to see people.  And there it is. It's just got a new form.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Pretty. It did.  It did. Yahoo has resurrected my Yahoo.  And it looks a lot like my Yahoo.  I mean, it looks like a bunch of widgets that you put on a page,  but maybe redesigned a little better.  That's the old my Yahoo.  And there's the new my Yahoo.  It actually kind of that that that weather car, that weather widget  on the upper left hand corner looks a lot like Google now.  Now that I'm looking at it. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, it didn't ask me to log in.  That's the first time I've been to Yahoo in like three years.  It hasn't asked me to log in.  They've actually remembered that I'm that I have an account and I'm logged in.  That is actually a huge change.  No, you see, you remember this, right?  They used to expire your cookie in like a week or something.  And you see, it expired my account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It expired my whole account in a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, you have to log in. Is it once a year?  That's yeah. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you didn't use it, they killed.  That was the problem.  They killed accounts of mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that was my home.  They would kill email accounts. Yeah.  They used to be awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Marissa would never do that, I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They launched that that launched that service  where you could actually request a username that you couldn't get.  And then if they killed the account of the person with the username,  then you could get it.  But then you would start getting email to this, you know, other person.  The account expired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That story is actually pretty scary.  It's what people predicted you could see.  But the story on the rundown that you put there, I think.  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  Under it. It's it's the one guy talked about everything.  He could learn about someone whose old male is coming to him.  And it's a lot. It's a lot.  I don't see how you fix that. Right.  It's it's it's namespace.  And once the name has been used, how do you you can't create a blockade?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. And say only only deliver mail.  You know, I have that problem anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I get all these gmos from other Kevin Marks's around the world  because I want Kevin Marks's Gmail.  So I'm not sure that's but yeah, they just made it worse.  This isn't personalized in any way I can recognize.  It's give me the weather in Minneapolis.  Why do I care?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, have you have you logged in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kevin, it wants to make you feel cocky that you're in much better weather right now.  That's why it's a very California thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's pretty nice in Minneapolis.  Seventy three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's giving me San Diego weather.  So it actually did did no location.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I went there and I'm you know, I'm logged in, but it's decided I'm in Minneapolis.  And it's telling me stuff about American sports that I have no idea what they even stand for.  What's NCAA NCAA?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's college basketball.  Even I know that, Kevin, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even even I do, Kevin.  OK, it is like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I like the I like the image.  I don't know, Chad, you may have dropped this in the rundown.  A bunch of people on Twitter were saying, if Marissa Meyer retweets me,  I will, you know, stop making fun of Yahoo's new logo in public.  And she retweeted them.  And Marissa Meyer retweets this.  I will make Yahoo's home page my home page.  And she retweeted it.  So if you go to Marissa Meyer's Twitter, she retweeted a bunch of things that people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was like, that's that's really good for her.  That's really funny. Really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is like Google now that has no idea who I am, basically,  which I suppose is fair enough, as I haven't actually touched Yahoo in five years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have a relationship.  That's why the original vision of giving you it is the mix, right?  My newspaper doesn't know where I live or work.  It feeds me the same content.  Even today, it doesn't give me my county versus counties five.  Well, it's ridiculous. They target ads.  They don't target content.  So we should have learned this lesson from Yahoo years ago.  The problem for Yahoo at the time, of course, was that it had to be explicit.  The instruction to it.  And we all filled it out and never never went back to it.  If sites just operated this way by implicitly gaining  information about us like Google does because we have so much relationship with them,  then then the Yahoo structure is fine.  But it's all is wrong about it is the form to fill it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Agreed, agreed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I mean, the question is how you feed it used information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  T.V. is to give me enough reasons to use you like Google,  then you're going to learn a lot about me.  That's right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. And that's that's really that's what Meyer has to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I suppose the thing that Yahoo has done previously is they've let you log in with Google and with Facebook.  So potentially that would mean that they could if they could do an OO thing and get some more info and feed it into this.  So that that that would that would make a bit more sense.  So, you know, certainly in the past, Yahoo has spent a chunk of time trying to make some of this ID integration stuff work.  So maybe it's because I've got a really old account that I basically keep because it's my flick along in.  I'm just getting not much of anything because I'm not getting enough info.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I actually use Flickr quite a bit, mostly to share just photos with my with my family, because I the baby, that's really the only time I should log into my Yahoo Mail because I don't want to lose my account.  So you referenced this earlier, Jeff, a bomber calls Google a monopoly.  I sort of love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Control. Yeah, that authority should control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But, you know, I got to tell you, I read the article.  I don't say this is on the verge.  I don't see the part and I don't see the quote where he says that authority should control.  I think that he said that he said, I do believe that Google's practices are worthy of discussion with competition authority.  We've certainly discussed them with competition authority.  So I guess I guess that implies he thinks that they should control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they force they do this all the time.  They've got a whole bunch of front organisations that go up and lobby, you know, Congress to say Google is a terrible monopoly and should be regulated and cookies should be banned and do not track should exist and whatever they feel like.  Oh, they should.  It's a terrible thing to sue people for certain kinds of patents and other kinds of patents, depending on whether you're the kind Microsoft is suing Google over or not.  You know, there's a whole pile of sketchy crap that the Microsoft get up to in this arena.  And, you know, Google will have to have their share of doing slightly annoying things, too.  But Microsoft have a real track record of being complete dicks about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, of course, of course.  But what I thought was interesting is that Bomber was sort of self congratulating Microsoft for being the only people who are trying to compete with with Google.  So I asked my analyst how Microsoft can attack Google's dominance in search and advertising.  Bomber explained we're the only guys in the world trying with the search and then you know much about China and Russia, then does he?  He does. He does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To show you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Very good point.  But should we be worried that no one's trying to build search engines anymore?  I mean, has Google basically just buttoned up?  Do people not care about search anymore because Google's buttoned it up and now it's all about social?  Well, I think search is ready for the other.  Yeah, you think search is different kinds of search that goes back to the Clive Thompson point of,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you know, what category of things that you can find on Google and there's another category of things that you would look somewhere else for.  And that's what we're starting to see.  So we people there's a kind of question you would ask Twitter that you wouldn't ask Google as a kind of question you would ask for squarely.  And when you're asking Twitter, you're not really asking Twitter, you're asking the people that are following you on Twitter, people who are following you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. But I got to say, I run see with Google Reader, I was like, I don't really use an RSS reader anymore.  I do easily a dozen web searches a day on Google and I switch to DuckDuckGo for a while.  But DuckDuckGo was I think it was Bing on the back end or it was other search engines kind of on the back end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, so you've come back.  Have you followed the white children?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, honestly, with my I do a lot of my searching on my Android device and that Google search bar is sort of a fix to your home screen.  And it's not easy to change to another search engine unless you're running Cyanogen mod, interestingly.  But, you know, between now and, you know, a lot.  Yes, a lot of my searches are Google powered.  I had changed my my search shortcut to DuckDuckGo, but I sometimes will switch over to Google or type in the Google.  You know, bang away. Could you try?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, look, Google's good at search.  I know that breaking news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was ashamed of you for doubting God, Google.  And now you have returned to the police.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I like choice. I like competition.  And it did occur to me reading this bomber quote like, you know, there really isn't another U.S.  company attempting to attempting search the way that I mean, Microsoft is trying to do search with Bing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Real competition would be good. The problem is that Microsoft is trying to catch up to Google and to really rethink search in some fundamental ways.  I think we're due for that. And Google, which loves to give us relevance and has added in things that are personal, I think it's important.  They've certainly they've certainly advanced search by by quietly by many leaps.  But there's probably some great inspiration out there, some really bright, you know, Larry Page of the next generation to rethink it again and cause competition, which would be a wonderful thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. The new the new page rank, the page rank of the new new generation.  It's not I mean, Facebook had something with graph search, but that's still not like that.  Graph search still feels like I'm asking my friends versus I'm going to the library.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm trying to find your friends. I mean, that's that's the point of graph search.  You say I want to find like, you know, people I know in a certain country or whatever, things like it's it's it's finding something that you would then go and look at something else for something else of that.  But there's there's there's places where you would say, OK, I want to I want to search Yelp or I want to search Foursquare because I want to go out for dinner.  I don't trust Google's reviews yet. And Google is trying to fix that.  But you pick one of those over that.  And then there are the much more subtle things where you're saying, OK, no, actually, I do want to talk to a subset of people.  I don't want to talk to the entire universe.  And to some extent, that is the difference between Foursquare and Yelp.  Yelp is like, OK, give me a bunch of opinions I don't care about about about places near me.  And Foursquare is give me a list of people I know and where they've eaten recently and and justify that.  So I think part of what we'll get is is is that the thing that Foursquare does beautifully is the it tells you why it's recommending that place.  It gives you anything underneath that says your friend, your friend Jeff went there and he thinks that the knishes are really good.  So if I'm in New York or something like that, that would be handy.  Or it says, you know, your friend Fred went there and you're like, well, Fred, I he always eats crap.  I don't want to go take his recommendations.  Or it says it gives you like a little bit of justification for why it's in the search results.  Whereas Google doesn't really do that. It'll give you like a list of things.  You're like, well, OK, that's kind of what I was thinking. But, you know, why would I care?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's true. It's true. And it's extremely powerful.  If I go to a restaurant and I see the five of my friends have been there, I'm much more likely to go there than a place that hasn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's absolutely true. Yeah, yeah, that's very Foursquare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that's Foursquare. Yeah. But I think I think about the things I search for.  So, you know, I code my day job and I'm not doing doing the shows.  And, you know, I often I'm on Stack Overflow all the time.  I'm Googling errors. I'm looking up code or whatever.  I never go to Stack Overflow and search Stack Overflow.  I always Google it and Stack Overflow just has great Google.  And it's often stack that comes up.  And I'm like, oh, yeah, I recognize that stack.  That's definitely going to be what I need.  So I'm still kind of and I guess this is kind of the equivalent of typing, you know,  Facebook into the Google search box in order to get to Facebook.  It doesn't really make sense.  But it is Google really is kind of this initial gateway into all the different places.  I mean, I love Foursquare. I love Yelp. I love Stack.  I search the PHP documentation all the time, you know, or the Java doc or the Android doc.  But I never I don't I don't know those URLs off the top.  I just I search from Google and go from there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So you say about one of the things that that I lost when they killed  Rita was that Rita had that search bar that would search all the things you'd subscribe to,  which was really, really nice.  It was like constrain the search to things that you've already gone by in your feed.  And I found that really handy.  That is very powerful. And that's a piece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're back to the reader morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, but the point is search over history.  Search over my history.  It's a bunch of stuff that I've read over the last seven years.  And I vaguely remember reading a thing.  It's like I was saying about the Amazon thing.  I vaguely remember reading a thing about that.  Give me some give me some direction here, because if I search the entire web, I won't find it.  But I want to constrain the set of things that I've seen and Google throwing away  the list of stuff that I've seen in that particular space is is sure sighted  that rather than saying, OK, how do we expand that experience to a bunch of other people  rather than just this?  That's that's what that that's what they're missing.  And I think Facebook and Twitter having those longitudinal histories of stuff  we've looked at will be will be have a better chance of that unless you can really get  all of us using using plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's it's it's it's a close equivalent to Amazon, you know, deleting  your son's notes and highlights from from all his books because of the account.  The account makes up and it's similar to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, OK. You know, I've exported them, whatever.  But I don't know. I don't think when I exported it, I got all the articles I'd read.  Right. Right.  I just got the, you know, where is that?  You like to share data base with that database was there.  It was searchable and it was actually really useful.  Yeah, because they had the database of all the blog posts that I'd read ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yep. So are there any other other stories that we should hit before we move on to our

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  good job? I think you got us through really good stuff.  Without the. Well, I do have to I do have to mention one thing, of course.  Yes. It's still not connected.  63 days after the Nexus seven was announced,  16 days after it went on sale, it's still not connected.  But because from Verizon, they're not saying crapola.  I've gone to the FCC, as you know, last week, Verizon.  Oh, I guess it's the news since last week, Verizon did answer me and say,  oh, we have to certify. But I still say that's not openness.  That's not just putting the device on the way you can do all across Europe.  So I responded to the FCC.  I'm going to keep up for the FCC on this.  I remain enraged.  People keep on saying to me, why don't you just take the SIM out of your  pixel and then go take the store and get those in there?  Because it's a matter of principle. I'm fighting for you people.  I'm fighting. This is this is this is the nerd answer, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We I think this is like Episode three, where you where you talk about something.  And you said, Gene, are you bothered by this?  I was like, no, because I'll be able to find a technical workaround, right?  Which is a really short sighted view.  So for them to say, hey, man, just take out the SIM, use the T-mobile.  What's the big deal? Right.  You're this is this is the flaw.  This is a matter of principle. You're fighting the good fight.  So has Verizon given a date, an estimated date or they just say soon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I know what's going to happen. I really don't understand their endgame.  I really honestly don't, because at some point they're going to have to approve this.  It's obviously certified.  If they if they don't, then that that kills the notion of openness  because it operates all around the world, including its competitors, AT&T, T-Mobile.  That's why there should be no certification.  What we need here is a clarification from the FCC of the rules  because certification and openness don't match.  If it's open, that means you can take any device that's been certified by the FCC  that works on networks and put a SIM in it and it should work automatically  the way it does on AT&T, T-Mobile and all across Europe and the rest of the world.  And so it's the FCC rules are going to have to be clarified,  to say, no, Verizon, this is what openness means.  O-P-E-N, right?  It's like Bill Clinton talking about the definition of is.  They got to figure this out.  So I just want to give the update here.  I'm going to continue fighting the good fight people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thank you, Jeff. Thank you, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're welcome. We appreciate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think we may have a word from

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Kevin. I didn't mean to cut you off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it just reminded me because having done the trip to the UK for two weeks  and spending a lot of time moving SIMs around, that was the experience.  There is fascinating because you can get a SIM for, you know,  that like they're at the counter in the convenience store.  You can recharge them anywhere.  You can you can buy cigarettes or chocolate.  You can get a new SIM for a different provider.  Similarly, anywhere there.  All the phones are presumably presumed to be unlocked.  If they aren't unlocked, the official phone shop will say  there's a guy in the ground, the corner, just go and talk to him  and he will download a hack from the net and exploit your phone  and lock it for you.  But they actually are pushing really hard to censor the net.  And even the Guardian published sort of, you know,  some rotten survey by a  by a filtering company that says 50 percent of  it's terrible.  Almost 50 percent of Wi-Fi things aren't filtered.  It's like, Jesus Christ, 50 percent of them are filtered.  That's horrific.  And I did I did find that there is this sort of strange culture of  no, we must like censor the net to protect the British public from it.  And I did find that, you know, when I was using Wi-Fi places,  some of them were blocking SSH and IRC and things and real VPNs.  Yeah. So there is there is there is a you know,  so they have an openness on one layer and then they have this sort of  weird, like, as you say, lacking a First Amendment censorship thing on there.  Yes, exactly.  And certain certain sites do not show up at all.  If you if you go to that's that's appalling.  If you go to Pirate Bay in the UK, then you get a  I'm sorry, we've been told by the government  you can't see this page on many of the ISPs.  And the GCHQ is coming after you right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You stay there, sir.  They'll be there soon.  So they're going to blow up your machine.  Oh, speaking of which, speaking of which,  Chad, would you mind just going to my Google Plus feed  and look for the photo of Alan Rusberger there?  Rusberger spoke in New York last week,  and this is the editor of The Guardian.  And as you remember, folks,  the GCHQ, the NSA of the UK, how's that for a lot of initials,  came in and destroyed Guardian laptops,  even though Rusberger said straight out this data from Edward Snowden is elsewhere.  It's at the New York Times.  It's at the New York Times.  It's in Brazil.  This is really rather absurd, but they destroyed it.  So Rusberger was a great woman.  He brought along a little I think was probably a there it is.  So this was all the best dressed editors where there is a piece of the computer.  And it's amazing up close.  You can see the grill marks going over and over and over again.  They went berserk to destroy it.  Absolutely berserk. Wow.  That's what was left of the Guardian computer.  That piece is like destroyed computers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is that did he make it a lapel clip or is he just holding it up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, he was joking.  We were joking that he ought to.  Yes. So he put it there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's a badge of honor.  He should be wearing it like he should be wearing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That'd be some good jewelry right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow. There is.  That's the more the more stern Alan.  Yes, I'm calling Alan Rusberger.  Go ahead and put his name in there, Chad.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was prompting the name tag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's to the sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, so so I think we have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We might have a word from our sponsor via Leo, disembodied Leo from from vacation.

Transcript:  Hey, everybody, sorry, I couldn't be here for Twig, but I am here for the ad.  How about that?  Gina, you're doing a great job.  You're beautiful, kid.  Don't ever change this show.  Brought to you by our friends at hover.com.  Actually, I love coming back to talk about hover because I first of all,  Elliott Noss and his crew at two cows are great guys, great people.  And one of the things that they're really about is taking businesses,  industries and making them work better.  And, you know, solutions, companies that are just are broken,  like the cell phone industry with Ting and the domain name registration industry  with hover.com hover is the best domain  name registrar of all.  I use it all the time now.  When I when I first started using hover, I use their concierge service,  got all my domains moved over.  Couldn't have been easier.  In fact, I highly recommend that.  Now they offer besides easy, simple to use domain name registration,  very, very nice domain management tools, friction free purchases.  They also offer Google Apps.  So this is kind of cool now for your your business  or even from, you know, your family or for your group.  Google Apps, Google Apps offers a full Google Apps here.  And you can set it all up through hover.com.  So get a domain name that'll be your Google app domain.  You have this. You can try it for 30 days free.  You'll get Google Mail, Google Calendar, Google Drive, Google Docs, the whole package.  You could use it on an existing domain.  They can help you do that. But, you know,  because have the Laporte family Google app domain, you know, Laporte family  or whatever.  I wish I had thought of this, actually, before I sent the kids off to college.  You get 25 gigs of storage, of course, on Gmail.  And it's easy to collaborate with file sharing and chatting.  Google, maybe not.  We talked about this the other day, not the easiest company to get a hold of for support.  But this is what's great about it.  You'll get the outstanding support of hover,  the no hold support of hover best in the industry and Google Apps.  So it's a great combination.  I want you to try hover. So here's the deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thank you, Leo. Right on.  So let's wrap it up with our tip, tool and number of the week.  I guess I guess I'll get started.  Google has made Quick Office for Android and iOS free for everyone.  So in the Google Play Store or the iTunes Store, you can download Quick Office,  which means that you'll be able to edit Microsoft Office documents and spreadsheets  and presentations on the go without paying a dime.  But the tip is if you download Quick Office for Android or iOS right now,  between today, the 25th, September 25th or tomorrow, the 26th,  and you sign in with into your Google account through Quick Office,  you will get 10 gigabytes of free Google Drive space for two years.  So grab the app. It's Quick Office.  You can search for it in the Play Store or the App Store.  Download it onto your device. Sign in with it.  And for the account that you sign in with, your Google account you sign in with,  you'll get 10 gigabytes of a free Google Drive space, which is a nice, nice little upgrade.  That offer is only good today and tomorrow by September 26th.  So so you can get on that now.  A little little extra space never hurt anyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Quick Office is a pretty good app.  Yeah. Why don't you think it's on a Chrome app yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's a good question.  That's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I have docs, but if you could bring some of this functionality  and the ability to easily edit word docs and such that Quick Office has  to a Chrome app that interoperates with your with your drive, that'd be cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I don't know why all these features aren't just built into Drive.  Right. Like I use a drive app on Android.  Yes. Right.  And why they wouldn't just build it into Drive to begin with.  So I don't know. I don't know.  I don't know what this this promotion is kind of about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe they change the strategy.  This was meant to be a premium sell up to to apps, people, and such.  Maybe maybe now that it's free, they will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, maybe.  But you get the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They will eventually merge these.  But the thing is that Microsoft documents are such a rat's  nest of legacy nonsense that it's very, very hard to make sense of this.  And merging those code bases would probably take a really long time.  So having alternative solutions may make more sense.  Right. Yeah, they're there.  The Microsoft guys have trouble keeping this stuff straight.  And they have the source code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Docs does.  Drive does work well.  I was I was in a best buy store.  Drive does a fairly good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But yeah, it's still like do server side rendering rather than translating  to something you can edit half the time.  But you can you can usually read something. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was in a Best Buy store the other night.  And there was a couple there asking about the Chromebook for the guy.  And the guy, the Best Buy blue shirt is up on the thing.  And you store anything here?  He said, no, you can't store anything.  So I step in like Marshall McLuhan in the Woody Allen movie and say, no,  actually, you can store this is I do a sales pitch for the  Chromebook there for 10 minutes and tell them just to use drive.  And they said, oh, yeah, we like drive. It's fine.  So I said, then you'll love it. Get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  School should hire you.  We need a blue shirt.  You can just sell it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gina, from your lips.  The very we're going to get a new dean at the school.  You don't know what's going to happen.  I don't know what's going to happen.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, Jeff, you're your number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, I'm going to give you a different one than I thought.  So we talked about the time cover story last week by Harry McCracken and Company.  And so he put up a blog post of 10 things you didn't know about Google.  And I'm sure to give you the first one because it's the number of the week.  We're going to do Google's phone number.  Page told him that when Google started  on University Avenue with about 30 employees, they accidentally put their phone  number up on the Web.  This this reminds me of May Day on Amazon.  So we have 30 people and I'm quoting now from Page.  And we already had millions of users.  We accidentally published our phone number on our website.  Our phone number was just unusable.  We had to get a new one then because people just started calling us.  There's only 30 of us.  We couldn't even answer the phone for millions of people.  We could run a website.  I think that shows you how it shows you the incredible multiplication  factors you get with technology.  You can easily run a website for millions of people, the small group,  which you can't run a phone number with that many people.  So that's the number of the week.  Google's phone number.  I like it. I like it.  That's a really good point.  Who got the number next when they abandoned it?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I must admit, I did watch the internship on the flight over  and laughed out loud at the fact that the idea that one of their problem  where they're just was answering the phone for complaints for Google.  Yes. Yes.  That was the funniest thing in the movie, which is like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  the impression that there are support people all there  ready to answer your questions about Chrome and.  Oh, very cool.  All right, Kevin, your your thing, your tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I have two things.  One, there was like a follow up from the previous thing,  which just reminded me.  So there's a tweet which I think I just threw in there,  which is just amusing me because it was a Nick Escherora,  who's the chief business officer for Google, tweeting out, help,  I need to remove the contact lock on my phone.  I don't have a UK credit card.  I can't find a T-Mobile store.  It's like I found three on Google, but maybe, you know,  maybe his his concept was bad enough.  He couldn't use search Google Maps.  So that was it.  But the sort of slightly more serious link from that is the  Open Rights Group link, which is blocked.org.uk,  which is where you report  your the wrong things being blocked on your mobile phone.  So if you are in the UK  and you try and do something and you find it's not working,  go there and report it so that the Open Rights Group  can collate them and stop even more stupid censorship being imposed.  And I haven't seen Noter.  So I was so this is so the other thing was this is this is my  standing up and publishing my stuff from XOXO.  So Noter Live is a very, very hacky tool that I wrote  to do the kind of live tweeting that I do.  And I wrote it as one of the new webcom hacks.  And I used it quite a lot of XOXO.  And the it's it's what it does is it's very, very simple.  You log in with Twitter, you put in a hashtag.  Yeah, it's not going to look great unless you actually zoom in a bit.  You put in that put in the hashtag and name of the person  and then you just keep typing the tweets and hitting return  and it posts them in that in that format.  And then there's a change speaker button that lets you type in  someone else's Twitter and look that up.  And the idea of this is it means that I can do the kind of live  tweeting that I do more quickly.  But also the hope is that over time it will  gain the ability to collate those tweets into something that I can post  to a blog post or something else rather than just disappearing into Twitter  and only be able to get them out when I do the download my tweets thing.  So that was that's my little tool there.  And the sources up on GitHub and if people want to help  help try it out or send me bug reports or patches,  I'm very happy to get them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Very cool. And you use Node.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I use Node for it, yeah.  Node is very good for these these like quick and dirty little web things.  Node and Heroku together make a good combination.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yep. Yep. Very cool.  I have starred your repository.  Awesome. Well, thank you very much, Kevin, for joining us today.  It was it was I was a little nervous about about filling Leo's giant shoes,  the Dr. Evil chair, but it was really good to have you on the show,  have a familiar face who's been on the show.  Do you have anything else that you want to plug?  What's going on with television or Salesforce or anything else you want to tell us about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not a lot directly.  I mean, the the interesting thing about television is that  the reason I was the other reason that I like Clive's book  was he mentions television a couple of times, which is very nice.  So I did I did see Deb over the weekend and we keep saying  we should start this again.  But at the moment, we we we're still in hiatus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Cool. Cool. Well, thank you so much for joining us today.  And Jeff, thank you so much.  It was a lot of fun, as usual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was wonderful. Great work, Gina.  You kept things going at pace and we covered a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thank you. Yeah, we did.  Yeah. Barring the Skype technical difficulties was a lot a lot of fun.  I still I don't feel like I totally filled the big chair, but but we made it.  I hope Leo's having a really, really good vacation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I want people to know just that in the chat room,  there was a period in the beginning where Kevin and I talked a lot,  which we normally do a lot, but we really talked a lot.  Gina Skype went down. That's why.  So we were quite smooth at keeping going.  We do that very well.  But that was that was a point where we were trying to vamp.  Thank you very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thank you for doing that.  You know, you sound like you were totally sly.  And you sounded like Drown Robots.  I couldn't understand anything.  And I hung up and then we were reconnecting on Skype.  So thank you for for filling that in, you guys.  And yeah, no, they weren't.  And Jeff, we're not we're not, you know, blocking me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think we've been known to do it, but that time it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, thank you so much.  We do this week in Google every Wednesday at 1 p.m.  Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern.  I don't know UTC off the top, but thank you guys.  We'll be back next week.
