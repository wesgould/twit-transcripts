Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm full of ice cream sandwich.  I can't wait to talk about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, Gina was on last night during the announcement from Hong Kong with our All About Android  team.  So I watched.  We'll have lots to say about that, of course.  Also here, Jeff Jarvis, the author of a brand new book called Public Parts.  Also what would Google do?  And a journalism professor at the City University of New York.  His blog is buzzmachine.com.  By the time, you know, if you keep writing books like this, Jeff, we're just not going  to have any time for a show.  It's fine.  I think I'll quit.  I'll just have to do your CV for the first hour.  Great to see you again.  I missed you guys.  Same back.  Also joining us, Mr. Peter Rojas from gdgt.com or gadget.com.  Hey, thanks for having me on.  Who is, of course, like us, watching carefully to see.  First of all, let me ask about the Galaxy Nexus.  Of course, the announcement was yesterday.  Two announcements, really.  The big one was ice cream sandwich.  It was really Google's announcement.  But it's going to sit on a Google Experience phone from Samsung.  They're calling the Galaxy Nexus.  But they left out so much.  Where can I get it?  When can I get it?  And how much is it going to cost?  So do you know those details, Peter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they haven't announced it.  We do know that Verizon is going to carry it in the U.S.  OK, that was not a rumor.  That's true.  That's true, yes.  And they're actually going to be two different versions of the phone.  There's going to be an HSPA Plus version and an LTE version.  That would be AT&T, right?  Yeah, though it might not be.  It could be T-Mobile.  It could be T-Mobile, though they might not have a carrier partner for HSPA Plus in the  U.S.  It could be just...  Unlocked, yeah.  So we'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google's certainly done that before, unlocked phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and then they've also had...  With the Nexus S, they originally put it out with a GSM version and then ended up doing  a WiMAX version with Sprint a few months later.  So what they have available next month might not be the only thing they have available  early next year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But Google, we think, will not be selling it.  I noticed that when I went to google.com, what was it?  Nexus, I think, they asked for my name and my email address so that they could let me  know.  Yeah.  So that made me feel like, oh, maybe they'll sell it, but they won't, will they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think they actually probably will.  Really?  But if they have Verizon as a carrier partner, they might have an exclusive on it initially.  version, you have to wait until the HSPA Plus one comes out.  Another thing is the LTE version is going to be slightly thicker than the HSPA Plus  version.  Is that for antenna reasons?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Probably battery life.  Ah.  Yeah, that's a big problem with 4G and all the 4G phones, battery life just terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's getting better though.  I mean, the first few phones that came out earlier this year was really bad, like the  Thunderbolt.  Yeah.  The Bionic, and it's actually, you know, it's better.  It's not amazing, but it is getting a lot better.  Well, they're bigger phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Bionic's huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's huge in that I think they're also just getting better at optimizing the OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I noticed that my Galaxy 2S, it turns off 4G pretty regularly.  I mean, you know, you turn it on and it'll, you know, if it's sleeping, if it's not,  you're not doing data, it will turn it off.  It turns it off as much as it can.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I mean, 3G was the same thing.  The first 3G phones were battery hogs.  Right.  It just takes them a little while to get the hang of it.  I guess you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right.  Well, we're watching the video right now.  It's got, it's fast.  It's a dual core.  We think TIO map processor running at 1.2 gigahertz.  We believe one, correct me any time I say anything wrong, Peter, or anything else.  One gigabyte of RAM.  Unclear.  They've never mentioned SD card in this.  And that makes me a little nervous.  Unclear whether there's an SD card on it.  We'll have a nice curvy swoopy doopy shape.  The best thing, the thing that actually sells me more than anything is 1280 by 800 screen.  But a big one.  It's not, it's what is it?  Four and a half, four and three quarters inches.  Right?  It's huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a 4.65 inch.  Okay.  Yeah.  It's big.  Yeah.  And you know, the funny thing about it is I actually, I think that that is a more comfortable  screen size than people realize.  You know, there are other, I mean, the Galaxy S2 came out with, some of them came out with  a 4.5 inch screen and it works pretty well.  Right.  I find.  It really comes down to just the heft of the phone itself.  Really not as much the size of the screen.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's funny.  You don't, because the, I have the, also have the Sprint Galaxy S2 and because it's so thin,  it's not, you don't go, oh, this thing is huge.  You feel like it's kind of light and thin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the Dell, whatchamacallit was five.  The streak is too big.  I looked at the streak.  It looks like one of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It looks like a Hershey bar they sell at Costco.  You know, it looks just oversized a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  But you know what?  Samsung doing a phone called the Note, the Galaxy Note, which has a five inch screen  and they, it's a much smaller, you know, it's, it's much smaller than the Dell streak, the  five inch streak.  So, you know, even a five inch screen, I think that might be like where you break the bank,  so to speak.  But even that, I mean, if you can make the casing small enough and make the phone itself  thin enough, I think people will use a four and a half, five inch screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do have to say that when I, you know, and I'm becoming more of an iPhone fan, the new  4S has features that make me willing to give up Android.  The notification system is better.  Finally, voice dictation everywhere, which I used a lot on Android and actually it's  better.  I hate to say it.  It's more accurate than Android.  The better camera.  But the screen is so tiny.  I know it's high res, but it's so tainty that I kind of go back and forth Galaxy S2, iPhone,  Galaxy S2, iPhone.  And now, you know, my poor old LG GX, G2X, it's just too small.  It's a, that's a, that's a, I think a four inch screen is just too small now.  I don't want to use it anymore.  So I guess we are getting used to bigger screens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And you know, the nice thing about the Galaxy Nexus is that it, you know, uses, it has larger  screen and the higher resolution.  And high res.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not retina display high res, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I don't know.  I mean, it's, it's basically this a marketing term, right?  It's not like some scientific.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no.  But it is, but it is, I can't remember what the dot pitch is, but it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it was like 330, you know, or something like that.  Pixels per inch.  So I guess it's close.  I think somebody put it in the chat room is 319.  So it's close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  And I tell you at that size, but 1280 by, I mean, listen, 1280 by 720.  That's a computer monitor.  That's amazing.  I know.  Isn't that crazy?  Yeah.  So that's pretty desirable.  So you notice I'm focusing on hardware because we're going to get to ice cream sandwich in  a second, but just focusing on the hardware on this, on this Nexus Prime.  It looks like a pretty good phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nexus Prime would be a better name, wouldn't it?  Yeah, it would be a better.  Oh, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Galaxy Nexus.  They didn't use the prime word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So hard to say Galaxy first.  I just want to say Nexus first.  It really is.  The Nexus one and the Nexus S is just, uh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's a, it's a weird thing.  I mean, Samsung is really touchy now, but this stuff, especially given that this phone  was in the pipeline before they, you know, Google announced they were buying Motorola.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I'm sure this is probably the last non-Motorola Google experience phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's possible.  We don't know for sure, but I think that Samsung wanted to kind of put their imprint on the  phone with the name.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the Galaxy is the Samsung line and Nexus is the right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They kind of split the difference, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they're getting ready to fork.  They're getting ready to fork.  But it does, it actually looks a lot like the Galaxy S2, even to the textured back,  the camera, it's just bigger.  It's like a bigger one.  Now these button, okay, now we can talk about ice cream sandwich.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Let's do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I wanted to get the hardware out of the way so we didn't give it short shrift.  There are lots of great phone hard, you know, the new Razr coming out soon, which is pretty  sweet.  I think the Galaxy S2, I think the iPhone 4S is a good and interesting thing.  And of course, there'll be an iPhone 5 probably, you know, mid next year.  So we're it's heating up, really heating up.  I have to say, and I'll just I'll just throw it out there and you guys can shoot me down.  Little disappointed by ice cream sandwich.  I don't think it to me, it didn't feel like a solid response to what Apple's done with  iOS 5.  What was it missing, Leo?  Really?  Yeah.  Well, the big, okay, a couple of things.  I think the aesthetics of honeycomb, I've always been disappointed with.  It's an ugly ass system.  And it's not just me that feels this way.  They would be selling more tablets if it looked good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would agree with you there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I said it was it was a stopgap.  It was it was an emergency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I understand.  But I don't think ice cream sandwich has fixed enough of those oddball aesthetic things.  You know, I think there's still a lot of UI cruft.  It doesn't feel as refined to me.  And the fact that they spent how long 10 minutes talking about the font tells me tells me they  may they may be feeling a little self conscious about design.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, they definitely are.  It was a very design centric presentation.  Yeah.  Which I which was telling.  But I have to say, I agree with you about honeycomb.  I don't think honeycomb is very is necessarily good.  The hall.  I think it's the hologram theme, a holographic theme.  It looks sort of robotic.  And you know, I thought the same thing that spending all that time in a tight face and  leading off with a tight face seems so strange.  But then as I look through the apps and notice the typeface throughout, I thought, oh, this  does feel a lot more human despite the name.  It seems less robotic to me.  Despite the name of the font.  Yeah.  Despite the name of the type.  It makes a big difference.  I changed the font.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I changed the font on my Galaxy S2.  There's a little app that you can download other fonts and it does make a difference.  You know, there is something to be said for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's I hate to say it's Gutenberg time.  But you know, the first font was a scribal font and everything we do is old wine, new  casks.  We keep imitating things that worked in other forms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and Steve Jobs say that really it all started for him when he took a calligraphy  class.  I mean, yeah, yeah, he did.  Maybe fonts are that important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think it's actually if you look at one of the reasons why say Symbian looks so  dated is because they were using a font that same Nokia Sans font for so long.  Right.  And, you know, it gave people sort of a sense that the OS itself was out of date, which  it was, but it kind of reinforced, you know, that sense that it was behind the times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I will defer judgment on the UI and on the fit and finish until I get one in my hands,  of course.  But it just I was hoping it would be more of a departure from honeycomb.  It feels honeycomby to me.  Yeah, it was missing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, what else was missing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I really hoped they'd have a response to Siri.  Maybe this is too soon for them to get that out.  You know, I think I was and I am still a huge fan of Android's voice control.  I think it's really good.  I think it does a great job.  I think it, you know, it's it's it's impressive.  And then I use Siri.  And this is this happens all the time with Apple.  They take something that's 90 percent of the way there and they get that last 10 percent.  Yes.  And it makes a huge difference.  Yes.  And it's one of the reasons that I'm maybe considering even shifting back to an iPhone  is that dictation is so good and Siri is so responsive.  And I really I believe that Google has this technology.  I believe they could do this or they're very close to.  And I've you know, I've talked to their their speech recognition scientists that, you  know, the guy runs it came from nuance.  They have the capability.  And I think, by the way, I notice tell me if I'm wrong, it feels like Google voice  transcriptions have gotten better and better and better.  Right. They used to be just like what?  And now they actually are kind of close to the message.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they have gotten better.  Yeah. But that was definitely my impression this year.  It was like, oh, this is right.  That last 10 percent.  Just like you said. So so Google releases stuff early when it's not perfect.  Right. And Apple goes late.  But they bring it to that finish.  So so one of the features about ice cream sandwich that I thought was really cool is  is face unlock. Right. In theory.  In theory, I saw two demos right during the announcement yesterday.  It didn't work. And, you know, he cracked some joke about the makeup being more.  And then I saw Andy Rubin pull it out at the Asia Deconference and say, oh, check out  face unlock. And it didn't work the first time he tried it.  It defaulted to the you know, to the to the other lock screens.  Now, let me try it again.  And also kind of watching that circle go around your face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. When you watch the video, you can tell that's going to take three seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm not going to wait three seconds to unlock my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I'm just not going to hold my theory on that is they needed to find some safe  use for facial recognition to get us used to the concept.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a good theory. Oh, interesting.  That's interesting. It's creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Line. It's although we've had facial recognition in desks and laptops for years.  I mean, literally, but who uses it?  Nobody, because it doesn't work.  Oh, that's true, too.  So, I mean, I, you know, I think the pattern is really easy.  Whoop, whoop, and I'm in and it's fast.  And the face recognition, if I have to go, OK, look at me. Yeah.  And then maybe it works, maybe it doesn't.  Even if it works 80 percent of the time, that means one time in four.  I have to do it over what I would find.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Isn't it even true?  I mean, how many face time calls have you made on an Apple phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For a few non zero one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I thought it was going to be a big deal.  You can see the world from both ends and yada yada yada.  And I was wrong.  And I, you know, maybe we will come to that.  But somehow we're just not using these to picture ourselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, in fact, you're right.  There's a face time test that I now apply.  In fact, when I look at every new Apple feature, I say, is this another face time?  Demos good. Sounds cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, ah, no, right.  And then no one uses it.  And face unlock could could definitely be that right.  Panoramic panoramic photos and time lapse video, I thought was really cool.  The text response when refusing calls also really cool.  Those are kind of my three.  Let's go through this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So panorama, I mean, Motorola has been doing this in their phone for a while.  Of course, there are plenty of panorama apps as well.  So that's nice.  You know, I think much more important than that in the camera is how fast it is.  Yes, Apple was touting this.  Apparently this I don't know.  Maybe, Peter, you can explain more.  Is this hardware is getting faster or they're really paying attention to these apps?  But it's very clear if you're going to replace.  And I think that these phones are point and shoot cameras.  Then the time to camera and the time to picture and the time between pictures.  Very important.  This is even faster than the iPhone 4S, at least based on a video that I saw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's it's becoming a huge point of differentiation for, you know, companies.  And so, you know, HGC has made a really big emphasis on having a great camera  in their latest phones, or the HGC Amaze and the HGC Sensation.  Both have really emphasized the quality of the camera  and how fast you can take photos with it.  And, you know, the Amaze, for example, has dedicated photo and camcorder buttons,  which is pretty interesting.  And so, you know, it's really, really important.  I think that, you know, at the high end, having something that offers  not just good quality photos, so just having, you know, having a good sensor,  you actually have to have, you know, something with really fast shutter speed  and reduce that lag and let people get that shot instantaneously.  It's one of my complaints actually about Motorola's phones is that  the cameras are really slow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't believe you stuck with that bionic.  That's the worst camera I've ever seen.  No, I mean, I have like six phones on my desk, Leo.  So but but do you agree?  I mean, the bionic is like three seconds to picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you know what? All of them are like that.  I don't know what it is about about the Motorola, how the software is interacting  with the hardware or whatever, but they're all very slow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think a new standard has been set.  And based on the video  that I saw, I wish I could remember who shot it.  This this Nexus Galaxy Nexus could be the fastest of the bunch.  Now, this is the time lapse feature.  This is the video that they showed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is cool.  And I'm sure there are apps that do this, right.  But it's still cool.  And the fact is that people people are going to use the features  that are built baked into the phone more than go find, you know, download the app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know why I think this doesn't pass a face time test,  because in order to do time lapse, people are going to realize you need a tripod.  Yeah.  Who has a phone tripod?  This guy was using a very fancy slider mechanism.  We've used it. I know about it.  It does great. But who has this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You need one of those gorilla clip things for phones, right?  Yeah. Some people have it, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. But isn't it sometimes that you know, stuff has features  just to help sell it, even if yes.  Yeah, definitely.  It's like FaceTime is a perfect example, right?  Like people are having the iPad, having a camera in the first place,  which everyone was like, oh, I can't wait until the iPad to as a camera.  And then like two months later, everyone's like, well, I never use the camera  in my iPad, too.  And it's one of the things where it's like it makes you want to buy something.  Who knows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a good there's nobody uses the camera in the iPad, too.  It is so bad.  And you need to be a word for that.  It's like, wow, where? Wow. Where?  I like it. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Now there are tumble blogs of pictures of people taking pictures  with their tablets because it looks that awkward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, we had a photo walk in Vegas and somebody did take a picture  with his tablet.  So the panorama is nice software.  But again, this is not so different from a software that's already  available on Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And how about the little stuff?  How about the little improvements?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you said the third thing you said, which I really agree is cool,  is that respond with a call by swiping it with a message like go away from me.  You creep. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm driving. You know, you know, someone calls you and just you refuse the call.  I'm saying, hey, I'm on the road. Call you later.  Is that where?  I don't think so. I think that that's I think that's again, hard to say,  because I haven't used it yet, but that seems like just a good.  I think that's something I'm definitely going to use.  And just the general phone makeover, that phone app makeover where visual  voicemail is integrated into your call log and you can see the text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got excited about that when I first saw it.  And then I then I thought about workflow.  You you're I mean, I'm sure that they have a separate visual voicemail app.  But how often do you go to a person's contact  to listen to the voicemail from that person?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, so you you see when you missed a call from someone, right?  So I'm going to say I'm going to get a notification missed call from Leo.  I often will tap that and then I wind up in my call log.  And then from there, I can hit, you know, play.  But although I don't know, you know, I'm not sure if this is how it works.  I haven't seen it yet. I haven't used it yet. But I when I first saw that, I thought,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  oh, that's really cool. Now, this is also very cool.  This is the can't talk right now. Go away.  But this data usage, they spent a long time on the graph.  That also has been available in some version, some flavors of Android already.  Nerd bait, nerd bait. Yeah.  Grass, you guys said that last night.  Love graphs.  Love graphs.  They have a very Windows phone seven ish people hub.  That I thought was kind of interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, wait, everyone wants to look at pictures of their friends, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the way, they're saying the galaxy has two settings call.  What was it? Settings has has  ignored messages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you have that already on your phone. You should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that a touch whiz?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I it seems to me that it's a Samsung.  It's a Samsung thing. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I even wonder about about the norm of that.  I've been I've been lamenting recently that I really want to bring back the busy signal.  Wouldn't that be nice?  Exactly. And just say I'm not available right now.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can sort of say I'm not, you know, yeah, Google Voice.  Yeah, I use that all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's kind of sad. And so the norm is, you know,  you know, I think you and I are the same way as I'm rude.  And I sometimes some people have to try me three times on email before I say, OK, OK,  I'll deal with it now.  And so now this is another expectation that we're going to have to.  You didn't pick up my call and you didn't swipe me either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think Android five now with busy signal.  Yeah, I love it.  And a long curly wire.  You know, my wife wants a curly wire because she says the cordless phone  keeps getting lost.  She says, just give me a phone on the wall in the kitchen with a long curly wire.  They don't know where the phone is.  She's got a point.  Bring back long, curly wires.  All right. So what else?  What else? We've got Roboto.  Oh, at near field communications, a.k.a. Beam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is a FaceTime  as far as I'm concerned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Android Beam with the Galaxy Nexus.  If you know somebody else with the Galaxy Nexus, you can put your phones back to back.  The beast with two backs and transfer what you're doing.  That's never going to happen.  I'm sorry, I don't let my phone touch anybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's demoed nicely, but that that that is the definition of while we're and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And I do like the idea.  And I think that I use bump occasionally, which is, you know,  where you bump the phones together and it's Android as well as iPhone.  But occasionally for like once.  So no, actually, I have to try it.  No, I have used it when you know, OK, here's a really good use for this.  Somebody's got some, like, say, takes a great picture and you want it.  Bump is great. You can load the picture in your bump.  If you've got bump on your phone and you bump it.  I used it a food camp to give somebody an application.  So they're occasionally where you want to get something off of your phone  and get it onto their phone.  That's not a bad way to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I used it once at food camp.  That's all I'm going to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, all right. You're right.  And this is the. Yeah, all right.  Yeah, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, it's funny. This one time at food camp.  I used bump. I used bump.  At food camp this one time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If the world was food camp, we'd all be bumping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the problem.  There are not enough geeks in the world.  I'm sorry. Go ahead, Joshua.  I'm Peter. I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. I was just going to say, you know, remember WebOS had this  where you were able to tap to share between, you know, a touchpad  and a Palm Free and that was sort of touted as a really big feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I remember a comdex.  This is how long ago this is, where IBM had things that they put in their shoes.  And then when you shake hands, the connection would be made.  And from your shoe to the other guy's shoe, your contact information would go.  So you'd shake hands and collect people's smells along the way.  So this is something that business people, I think, want.  It's a way to exchange information friction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Does this mean that they run out of possible features for phones?  Yes. They're just trying to make up crap.  So make sure. Well, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think, though, that there are some seminal features.  I think Siri is a breakthrough.  And I think the response to Siri is what we have to watch Google with carefully.  Mike Elgin said something very interesting, though, when he saw Siri, he said,  Apple, as always, pioneered it.  But watch out, because Google is in a better position to capitalize on it  because they know so much more about you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They have more more about you and they have more voice samples.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, and that that's true, too.  They could they could, in theory, do a better job.  So I don't think that that race is over.  But I think the race has begun.  And I'm very interested to see Google get into this race.  They say voice typing watch text instantly appear as you speak with voice input.  I don't I don't know if I don't know what I I don't know if that's good or not.  I don't know what that is.  Both both existing Android voice commands and and Siri  and the dictation built into iPhone wait till you're done.  Then they send it to the server and they get it back.  This is this is like right away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they're trying to make it more real time.  Potentially good if it's as accurate.  Yeah, that was funny.  There was a mistake in when they were demoing it.  Oh, there was. Oh, there you go.  Yeah. So I mean, you know, it's noisy.  I mean, I think, you know, the real breakthrough with Siri, right,  is that it tries to use more natural language for this stuff  that you don't have to think about commands.  And also the fact that it's just baked more deeply into the OS  so that it hooks into all, you know, more of Apple services  and apps and stuff like that.  And, you know, I think that Google or whomever,  I mean, obviously Microsoft has done a lot of voice stuff  with Windows Phone as well.  That's right.  You know, these guys can catch up.  It's more about, you know, how are you thinking about the product  and how it integrates with the rest of the US and really about  not just to be about voice commands or about transcription,  but really about that natural language, you know,  trying to understand what it is you're saying.  And I think that's really the thing that Apple has done really well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there's the error right at the front.  The first word map.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, he said he said like, hey, man, and it came out map.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then it says Yahoo at the bottom.  Yeah, what's that?  He went like, yeah, or yeah.  They had several demo fails.  It was really funny because he kind of had some like,  and it picked up his Yahoo. Yahoo.  Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, it's my favorite thing in the world not to correct  typing and dictation errors and just send it and let the chips fall where they may.  If you get an incomprehensible message from me, guys, you'll know why.  Go ahead. I'm sorry, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, sorry.  So a question I ask you every five devices that come out.  Developer check here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Better platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  4.0 came out, right? SDK is out already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the SDK is out.  You looked at it.  I did. I downloaded it this morning.  I wanted to see what my my app would look like.  And I mean, you know, the great thing about Android is that, you know,  there's all this talk about what how many, you know, true tablet apps  is Android have versus for the iPad.  But the reality is, is that the way the Android SDK is designed,  you design for every different screen size.  So apps, you know, apps are built relative, right?  So apps just fill.  So my app completely works.  It doesn't take advantage of the of the things that honey  cone and ice cream sandwich offer, like the action bar and fragments  and things like that. But it completely works, which is which is nice.  I'm much as a developer, I'm much more motivated to start optimizing for  the big screen, you know, the ice cream sandwich, honeycomb,  action bar and fragments.  I got much more motivated to build that stuff into my app, which my my app  has kind of the old school, you know,  you know, the action bar, you know, that you have to do kind of by hand.  But now that's all built into the SDK.  So I'm definitely going to be upgrading my app.  Also, widgets, you can resize now and they scroll, which is really nice,  because before, you know, as a developer, you have to be like, well,  let me make the small version of my widget and the big version of my widget  and let the user decide.  So that's super nice.  But, yeah, I'm excited.  I'm excited about diving in much more excited about diving into ICS  development than I was honeycomb development.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cool. Yeah, that's good.  What is what are fragments?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fragments. It's like it's kind of relative  rendering of your app screen.  So if you have a big screen, you can do, say, like a like like a split view,  you know, like a left side with a list of items.  Then you tap on it and you can see, you know, details on the right side.  Like think about Gmail.  You have your list of messages.  You can tap on a message and see the conversation on the other side.  If you flip the tablet portrait or if you're on a small screen,  you only see one fragment, whereas if you have a big screen,  then you can see two fragments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that helps you to build screens that are are screen size variable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly, exactly.  That you can you can build those for lower versions of Android,  but you have to do it by hand.  And the way that fragments work is that they can talk to one another.  One fragment knows if you've tapped on something in the other  and and they resize to different screens gracefully.  And it's you know, you can share code more easily.  It's just just much easier and nicer for developers.  That is neat. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's essentially a view region.  It's a view. Yeah.  Multiple views on the screen.  And but they but they are objects that can communicate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They can communicate to one another. Exactly.  They can send messages to one another.  They're aware of each other state.  They can render depending on, you know, what's going on in the others.  And the action bar is pretty cool, too.  Like if you saw in the Gmail demo,  if you select multiple messages in the action bar,  which is the area across the top of the screen, it would say like three,  three messages, four messages, five messages selected.  And then the buttons would change based on, you know,  what you could do with those messages.  Like, I want to delete all these. I want to archive all these.  So it's like the action bars kind of like can also be aware  of what's happening in different views and change and become more  contextually relevant. That's cool.  Yeah. Which is really I mean, it's really nice when you use Gmail and Calendar  and Maps and I guess music and G plus are going to be updated for this, too.  You really on a honeycomb tablet.  I have the Galaxy tab. You really do see it's very it's nice.  But apps have to be written to take advantage of those capabilities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's going to be up to Google to set the standard  with their reference apps, basically.  Exactly. Exactly.  Andy Rubin says it's filled with butter.  We want everything to be as smooth as butter.  He said the software includes all kinds of other features.  We I guess there's so much in there we didn't see at all  from being able to control music from the lock screen like that  to allowing developers to tap the phone's graphics processor,  processor for image intensive tasks.  You know what I like, actually, Google's looking at the third party apps  and taking the best of each and incorporating it.  You know, one of the responses I have is, well, I could do that.  I could do that. I could do that.  But putting it in the US, it makes it much better.  And I and there's underlying stuff like fragments and action bars,  which give it whole new capabilities. That's exciting.  All right. Maybe OK, I'm going to I'm feeling better about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've kind of convinced you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was going to get one anyway, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was really tempted by the forest as well, the iPhone forest.  And I was I was wondering how I was going to break it to the Twig audience  that when my contract is up in January, I might get.  An iPhone for us. Your timing is excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But by January, it'll be a little more clear, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it will. It will be more clear.  I mean, the iPhone thing for me is like it's the last jobs phone.  And I'm also just doing some iOS development.  And I realized that I just I had a developer send me a pull request  on my iOS app, and it was like pull down to search.  And I was like, I that's what you do in iOS to search.  Like I was realized that I was completely unaware of the iOS conventions.  So part of it is just like, I feel like out of touch. Yeah.  But ice cream sandwich kind of swayed my my decision.  So I don't know. I think by January, you're right.  It will be more obvious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Scoble Scoble, of course, said that immediately afterwards,  this is the thing that may have him drop the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, as you know, I dropped the iPhone for Android a long time ago  because I like the openness.  I liked there were there were things that like the notifications  were just light years ahead, but Apple's caught up.  And in fact, in some ways, Apple's notification system is, I think, better.  Really? Oh, yeah.  Their dictation is better now.  That was another area.  I do miss I knew to miss the ability to put desktop,  live desktops, widgets on the screen to be able to customize the desktop.  I miss that.  But of course, that is an area where you could really, you know,  people can really mess their phone up good.  So maybe that's why Apple doesn't allow you to do it.  Peter, are are you  you use all kinds of phones, so you don't have an allegiance to anyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I tend to use an Android phone as my primary phone.  Actually, I wrote something on Gadget last week about why I wasn't buying an iPhone for us.  Oh, I do remember that.  Oh, yeah. Yeah.  And I listed like a bunch of reasons.  This was pre ice cream sandwich.  So I wasn't taking into account like what would be in 4.0.  I was talking about why, you know, I use Android now.  And I talk about Gmail and, you know, if you use Gmail,  you're not going to get a better Gmail experience.  No, that's true. You know,  little things like I like to use SwiftKey for my keyboard.  And I just cannot get into the keyboard on iPhone.  That was actually the biggest sticking point for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I hate it that you can't change it.  That's a terrible keyboard for crying out loud.  It's always in caps.  Apple, everybody in the world knows that you leave it in lowercase.  And then when you press the shift, it goes into caps as a way of telling the user,  you're in caps now.  It's just it's little things like that.  I thought Apple cared about stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And they're just, you know, there are like lots of little things like that.  And again, like, you know, we talked about screen size earlier,  but 3.5 inches. I actually think that  the market has kind of spoken in terms of, you know, I think there are very few people.  I think that people go, you know, the iPhone is a great, you know, great device.  And I understand why people buy it and a lot of reasons to use it.  But I think that consumers have shown a general preference  more around four inch screens.  In terms of what they're buying, like when they have a choice to buy Android phones,  they're tend to, you know, they can buy 3.5 inch Android phones and 3.7 inch Android phones.  You know, but they're tending to buy four and four point three inch Android phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You ask a great question, which we're going to get to in just a moment  about the Razer, which some people are saying will be the,  you know, the Verizon phone to get at least until the Nexus Galaxy Nexus comes out.  Yeah, I was at that event yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, let's talk about that in just a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There were other events, you know,  but we're going to take a break.  It's great to have you.  Peter Rojas from Gadget.com, GDGT.com.  Jeff Jarvis, of course, and Gina Trapani are our regulars on the show.  I'm frozen.  But you're frozen in a kind of pensive.  I need to fix that during this.  Pensive is the word.  I know, a little sad that you have.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We want to give Gina a hug right now.  It's a melancholy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a melancholy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Cow eyes.  OK, OK.  All right, all right, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a meme waiting to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The cow eyed meme.  I'd like to talk to you about GoToMeeting.  GoToMeeting.com, ladies and gentlemen.  So excited.  From Citrix, the folks who do, of course, all that remote access stuff.  And GoToMeeting takes remote access and adds it to your Android phone and your iPhone,  as well as your iPad, of course, your desktop computer.  So now, yes, on your Android phone, you can take a meeting with GoToMeeting.  And of course, that HD faces.  If you've got your laptop there, you can see the video.  I mean, just there's so many nice, so many nice things about GoToMeeting from Citrix.  I want you to try it.  And I really want you to try the Android app.  So here's the deal.  First, go to the website.  GoToMeeting.com.  Click the Try It Free button off for Code Twig.  And put, you know, actually, I guess this is if you want to hold a meeting.  Put that on your desktop or your laptop that you'll hold the meeting from.  Do it on one with a camera, too, so you can see the HD faces,  because it's really cool to see people's faces.  But then, also, once you've got the account, set it up on your Android mobile device.  And don't forget to tell the people who attend your meetings that they can use an Android,  an iPhone, or an iPad, as well as their laptops or desktops.

Really cool.  Give it a try.  GoToMeeting.com.  Use the offer code twig.  Twig.  So, Motorola is not yet a part of Google, Peter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I mean, this is a transaction that is going to take a long time to close,  and they have to get regulatory approval and all that stuff.  And yet Eric Schmidt was there, right?  It was weird because he was there, but he didn't get up and speak.  He's actually, I mean, he has spoken at other phone launches before and gotten up,  but, you know, he was there.  I was about 15 feet away from him.  He was sitting there in the front row with a gigantic security guard sitting right behind him.  And security detail.  A huge beefy guy with the Bluetooth headset.  And I kept waiting for the moment where they were going to be like,  and now we have Eric Schmidt to come up and talk about ice cream sandwich or something like that.  And he never got up.  And then as soon as they finished the announcements, he bolted.  He was gone.  And, you know, it wasn't entirely clear why he was there.  In fact, they actually didn't talk about Google very much at the Motorola event.  And, you know, the Razor doesn't have ice cream sandwich when it launches.  We'll get it sometime early next year.  But it was just a really, it was just this sort of weird, like,  we kept waiting for them to talk about Google, but they didn't at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They could have at least done it at Sullivan's.  And in our audience tonight, we've got Eric Schmidt.  Eric Schmidt, stand up and take a bow or something.  Acknowledge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I kept thinking, like, is it really him?  And then I saw the security guard.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that actually raises a good question.  How long before we start seeing ICS on Android phones?  Are they going to do upgrades?  Are they going to, is the Galaxy 2S going to be upgraded?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So supposedly every phone that runs Gingerbread now can be upgrade, is upgradeable.  But it's always the same thing.  It's always the same thing.  It's whether the carriers and the manufacturers, you know, get it together.  You know, Google's been really pushing for manufacturers to commit to at least 18 months of upgrades.  That's what they said at I.O., right?  Yeah.  And so I think we'll probably start to see the first upgrades for like Q1 of next year.  It's kind of like, you know, with Gingerbread, it took three to six months.  But, you know, most phones, not most phones, but, you know, most of the phones that people bought,  you know, or like earlier this year or even later last year have tended to get those upgrades.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's interesting now how there's a certain commonality.  All these phones have a certain thing.  They're very thin.  They've got big screens.  This one's got a nice feature.  Kevlar in the back and Gorilla Glass in the front.  So you could use it for body armor.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not a bullet.  I could use that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I played with it.  I mean, the Kevlar, the texture on the back feels pretty good.  You know, I still think that I'm not a huge fan of Motorola's industrial design language.  No, me neither.  It just feels like things could have been a little more holistic or seamless, I guess,  in terms of how they were thinking about things.  But, you know, it's super thin.  It's kind of impressive how thin it is.  And the other thing that really impressed me about it was or surprised me about it that didn't impress me about it  was that there isn't a removable battery, which is, you know, somewhat uncommon with Android phones.  You tend to see most have replaceable removable batteries.  But with this, it's not not an option.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that raises a question.  Is the prime?  I'm sorry.  Does the Galaxy Nexus have a removable battery?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you can remove the case on the back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's kind of a requirement with Android.  I feel like this is the anti-Android.  I love you, Android.  It's just that my life has been so much better since I got an extra battery.  I just want to say.  Which says a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can be negative.  You can be positive.  This is not the fanboy show.  This is where we honestly talk about our warts and all.  There are no flawless products in the world.  And we can say negative things about anything.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's true.  I feel pretty strongly about wanting a removable battery.  I agree.  In my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I could tell you right now, the first thing I ordered with my iPhone, by the way, iOS 5 has much worse battery life.  Really?  Yeah.  Is a big old Mophie case.  A mofo case that has died out the battery life.  My 4 has actually been okay.  The 4 is pretty good.  The 4 was the best of the bunch.  It bested any Android phone, I think.  But not with iOS 5.  And I'll be curious if you put iOS 5 on it.  If you notice deteriorated battery life warts if it's the 4S.  I suspect it's iOS 5.  Right, Peter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People are saying that.  Ryan Block was complaining about this where he put iOS 5 on his iPad and I think on his iPhone.  And just in standby mode, the battery was dying.  I have an iPad 2 and I haven't noticed that problem with the battery life.  And it sounds like it's maybe 5 or 10% of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a theory that it's the my friends thing.  That's just always looking for friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ah, find my friends.  Find my friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Always looking.  And there are Android apps that will do that.  They'll just kill you with battery life like that.  If you turn on the GPS feature on Evernote, for instance.  And by the way, it's not just find my friends, but the reminder also is watching where you are.  Because reminders, you could set a reminder on the iPhone that says, if I'm at the grocery store, let me know to buy milk.  And that's a cool feature.  But of course, those things are, you know, the GPS on Evernote is constantly looking where you are.  That's going to deplete the battery life.  Yeah.  So maybe that's all it is.  It's just if you turn off those features.  We'll have to test.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's possible.  And you know, in my experience, it always takes an update to fully optimize.  So it doesn't matter.  Apple, Android, whoever, usually the first out the gate version, you know, the release version, it still needs some optimization in terms of battery life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I'm with you, Gina.  The first thing I buy is I buy another battery.  And then what I like to buy is a USB charger so I can keep that battery charging.  Yes.  I have to get up in the middle of the night and put a new battery in.  Right.  Which I've also done, I admit.  You need to sleep better.  It's 2 a.m.  I better change the battery.  Better change the battery.  Well, see, OK, so, you know, we had I had children, you had to change their diapers.  Now I get up in the middle of night and I change, you know, my I rearrange plugs, get all my things, chargers evened out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Heat up some more milk for your Android tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You've got to have a new battery.  And so that's what I do in the middle of the night.  Just the old habits die hard, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My mom just just started carrying a cell phone like pretty pretty regularly.  She's she's been kind of slow to adopt technology, but has figured out that I'm more likely to text her than call her.  But we had this funny conversation where she was like, the battery keeps running out.  And I said, well, when you know, how often do you plug it in?  She's like, well, maybe like once a week.  I mean, I have to do this every night.  And I was like, Mom, yeah, you're going to have to do it every night.  She's like, this is just the thing that you do.  My God. You know, she was like a ball.  You know what the what was involved in like using a cell phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love that picture of you and your mom and your wife on the beach.  I saw that on Facebook.  Very, very.  No, I think you're right.  Normal people are shocked, shocked that you have to plug it in every night.  I hear that all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Life. This is what you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. I have a beautiful gadget charging station in my home.  So I have one on my desk.  Right. So you get in, you empty your pockets, you plug them all in.  And that's why in the middle of the night, I get up and I.  So wireless power is going to be so awesome. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. When's that happening?  Well, you can there's you can get actually phones with the wireless chart,  the inductive charging backs now.  Yeah, but you have to put those big ass bags on them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, yeah, but they'll get smaller over time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's just, you know, we're the very, very early days of it.  I agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was the thing about the pre that I liked so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And that was a good thing about the pre. Right.  So it can be done. It'll get there.  I think Verizon is actually like mandating it as an option for a lot of the obviously not for Apple.  But for charging shelf into our when we did our mud room, as soon as you get in the garage,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  there's a closet there and the shelf. Nothing but plugs across.  Brilliant. Brilliant. That's handy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like that. And I get all kinds of mileage out of charging station hacks.  I find your clips, you know, like to the side of my desk that the wire doesn't fall off.  I like that. Yeah. On the cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I I'm glad that everything's moving to these micro USB,  because at least you don't have to have different chargers anymore.  You know, I have in my desk in the other office, I have six US micro USB things and I just plug in stuff as I get there.  OK, have we covered everything you want to say about ice cream sandwich?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think ultimately the thing that I want the most from ice cream sandwich is just a really stable OS that never crashes, that never stutters.  I want the keyboard to know, you know, to not screw up. I don't want to have to hit the backspace key very much.  I just want it to work really, really well.  I never want to have to think about lag or get that the forced close pop up.  So that's that I think is really what everyone wants. Not not these wow features.  So fingers crossed that ice cream sandwich gets closer to that.  I completely agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Although I have to say that sometimes it's the hardware, this LG GXG2X random reboots.  I went to the Galaxy S2. That's been really stable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, that's why I stick with the Nexus line, because it's like this is you know, Google worked with these people like this is how it's supposed to be.  You know, this is their vision of how it's supposed to be.  So that's why I am tempted. I am tempted by the by the Galaxy Nexus, even not to force myself to get the name right.  So but you're right. Sometimes it is hardware. It's true.  But you know, these these Nexus phones kind of are supposed to set the bar of what the experience is supposed to be.  Although I agree with Peter. Peter makes a great point is that you know, your first first release, it's going to be a little you know, you really do want to kind of wait to the first update.  So I'm hoping around January when my contract is up, things will be things will be stable as stable as they're going to be with ICS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you know, maybe you should consider a Windows phone because Steve Ballmer says you don't have to be.  Oh, you are a computer scientist. Never mind.  You don't have to be a computer scientist, says Mr. Ballmer to use a Windows phone, but you do to use an Android phone.  So that's why Gina likes it so much. Are you a computer scientist?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, Jeff. Which one of us are you pointing at? Neither one of you. Neither one of you.  I have a master's in English. Master's in English.  Yeah, no, Ballmer. Ballmer is totally unqualified to talk about technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you can write really well. He says, I just can't get excited about Android phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it would be weird if he said the opposite though, right?  Like, you know, I'm super excited. I just won't use them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And of course, his track record with picking phones has been horrible.  You know, he said the iPhone is going to be a flop. It's too expensive. Nobody will ever want it.  Not the guy to listen to. You know, I am going to I am withholding judgment until I see the new Nokia, the C-Ray with the mango on there.  That might be a that might be a good phone. I'm starting to think that the big three are going to be the iPhone 4S, the Galaxy Prime and a mango C-Ray phone.  Nexus. What did I say? Galaxy Prime? The Galaxy Prime.  The C-Ray Prime. C-Ray Prime. Have you seen a C-Ray? Do you know anything about the C-Ray at any time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it looks a lot like the N9. It's the N9, yeah.  Yeah, it's similar. I mean, from what I've heard from both Microsoft and Nokia that this is really just going to be like the first thing.  It's not, you know, what we'll see like the really great Windows phones from Nokia next year.  Oh, too late. Yeah, no, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The world will have decided by then Nokia. Yeah, I want to hurry that up a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's be worse. You could be a rim. Oh, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that was terrible. So last week rims out for what? Three days globally.  Or as one one gadget blog put it on all the planets.  And so their their response this week is, well, we're going to give you a hundred dollars worth of software.  And if you're a corporation, we'll give you some free tech support. It is just getting worse and worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm starting to feel bad for him. I listen to Radio Canada on CBC on Sirius all the time because they have good programs and they're covering rim like it's really a story because they have to because it's like a national requirement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is so sad. It's a Canadian company in Waterloo.  It's my first smartphone. Probably all of our first smartphones are BlackBerry's, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I had a Trio. Trio. Trio. I love my Trio. Trio 600.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I had a Palms. I probably had a Trio. Yeah.  And then the Trio, but the Trio became Windows Phone. That's right. That was awful. Yeah, that was the stopgap. Oh, my God. That was awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, rim is I mean, not to get on a crazy tangent, but that company, those two, the co-CEOs should be fired.  I mean, these guys are in complete denial. Whatever they were able to to lead the company to success before, they're clearly not able to take it to where it needs to go now.  And they're executing way too slowly. The products are not exciting.  And I think they still they completely overvalued their core asset, which is the sold like basically how well, you know, BlackBerry's do email. Right.  And the security stuff. And I think that they found that like that, you know, consumers are valuing those things differently and that even the enterprise customer and their enterprise customers are, you know, able to find get kind of get parity from other products. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And and what I think that they did not count on was that the the the employee would start choosing the handset, not the employer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that's what really bright for them. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's kind of an IBM Microsoft thing, too. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, even Apple, you know, Apple started sneaking into enterprise because employees brought them in. Yes.  And I think that's really what happened is employees said, no, I'm not using that crappy phone. I'm using an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's like, you know, you were able to get a quality exchange experience on an iPhone or on an Android phone.  That was critical when that happened. Yeah.  Though, you know, I mean, I still know people that work at companies and that use BlackBerry because their company won't support their their CIO.  Well, doesn't think that Android or iPhone is secure enough yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I believe one of those companies is the United States government, which is probably single handedly keeping Rimala entirely possible.  Yeah. Let's see. All right. I'm going to take a break. We'll come back.  We're to talk about the music store. We can talk a little about YouTube, too.  There's actually quite a bit to talk about. This drives me crazy.  Those poor kids. I don't know the Facebook thing in England. Right.  You know what I'm talking about? There's two kids who didn't commit.  I mean, all they did was they they they incited on their Facebook page.  They said, yeah, let's have a riot. By the way, the riot didn't happen. Yep.  People who stole TVs got six months. These two guys. Four years.  Four years in jail for going on Facebook and saying, hey, let's have a riot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, what the I have a different attitude toward free speech over there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they do, don't they? This is UK. Yeah, they do.  Yeah. They cut sentences for three people convicted of handling stolen goods.  But the guys who made their status update party. That's it.  You're you're out of here. Wow.  It was they said it was utterly shocking and wholly inexcusable.  Wow. All right, we're going to take a break.  I want to just like it was kind of stunning.  So good to have Jeff Jarvis here from the Buzz Machine.  Buzz Machine dot com is new book Public Parts. I'm reading it.  Loving it. It's a it's really it's a manifesto, isn't it?  It tries to be for living in public, making the case for something that Jeff and I do anyway.  Mm hmm. Without a choice.  Love it. If you haven't read it yet, get it. Get it. Amazon dot com.  Of course, Gina Trapani from SmarterWear dot org and our good friend Peter Rojas from GDGT.  He calls it Gadget dot com. Yeah, simpler that way. It is, isn't it?  Before we go on, though, I do want to talk a little bit about our friends at Ford.  They're back, baby. In fact, we're going to have a barbecue soon.  We have a couple of Ford barbecues and I'll give you the dates and everything.  We're going to have I think we can allow 50 people.  So we'll have like some lottery system and we'll be during the show on Sunday.  We'll have a barbecue. You have all the we'll have these great Ford cars.  You'll be able to come and see the cars have some have some ribs.  Watch Twitter. Ritos. Ritos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Should we have should we have some Chipotle at the barbecue?  I think you should have your own competitive. Yes.  Twit. Potley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Trit Ritos. Trit Ritos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  With good guacamole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. I'm going to get Gina's mom's. Is it your mom or your recipe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a yeah, no, not my mom. My mom's got got the Italian down.  That's right. My wife is opinionated about Mexican.  So it'll be no. In fact, you should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You should always have an opinion about guacamole. Yeah.  Always. It's key. Salsa and guacamole. It's key.  But before we go on with that, let's talk a little about Ford.  For now, actually, I'm sure Ford would love to get Peter Rojas to start covering Ford vehicles as consumer electronics devices, because that's really how they're starting to think about it.  It's pretty amazing. They just added Wi-Fi.  So, you know, if you've got the available sync in my Ford Touch in your car and a lot of them do, I do in mine, you've got a USB slot.  The edge that I rented in San Diego had two USB slots.  You take one of those slots, you put one of those three G cards in there, and now the car itself has a Wi-Fi access spot with with WAP and everything.  And it now you everybody in the car has access to the Internet via Wi-Fi through the Ford.  I mean, it's just little things like that. They've got apps now.  I just I love the attention to detail.  For instance, this is something I used in San Diego.  They, you know, on the my Ford Touch, you could set cruise control.  But instead of just saying, oh, whatever that is now, remember that you actually can do it by the speed.  You can set it to sixty five miles an hour and leave it there or in my case, seventy eight miles an hour because I'm a scoff law.  It's just great. The performance and the engines now, these new electric cars.  I'm waiting. I'm waiting for that focus that you got to try.  The new focus has that has that Wi-Fi built in and really amazing.  Even the gasoline engines so efficient.  Ford is taking technology seriously. You can find out more at Ford dot com slash technology for dot com slash technology.  Just take a look at all the amazing little features that add up to a great automotive experience and really got to try this thing with my car.  I had to laugh at Siri because half the things Siri does I've been doing in my car, you know, set the temperature for seventy two degrees.  What's the traffic like ahead? Where's a gas station? All this I could tell my car with Ford Sink.  It's amazing for dot com slash technology.  We thank them for their support and stay tuned for news about the barbecue coming up.  It's going to be a lot of fun. All right. What else?  What else is in the news here?  It's really consumed by ice cream sandwich.  But there are a few other things we could talk about. Google is now turning on SSL on all searches.  That started today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, by default, if you're signed in. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is something that probably I don't care if somebody spies on my search results.  However, I think it's kind of it's setting it's saying it's making a statement.  That's really more. Yes. That all web traffic should be encrypted going forward, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. SSL as the default versus above and beyond, you know, not just for credit card numbers anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. I think our systems are fast enough. That's not a not a burden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it comes at the same time that Google started their Good to Know page, which is about privacy and about all that.  I think you're trying to be much harder now.  I spoke at Google last week and I didn't even know it was privacy week.  But they're trying to put out core principles and trying to be more protective, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is, I think, very nicely done. It is. And I'm going to start this Good to Know page. It's google.com slash good to know, I think.  Yeah. I'm going to start referring listeners on the radio show because that's who look, you guys all know all this stuff.  You know, use a unique password, use a long password and so forth.  And it's a really nice English language, not a highly engineering way of describing a lot of the things that are really good.  Like this is a tip I've been using for a long time. Use a line from a song, film or play and use the the letters.  I do this all the time. It's a really great way to to protect yourself.  And just this is it makes it accessible and easy. So, yeah, good for good on Google.  I think you're right. I think for whatever reason, maybe it's because they're sensitive after the FTC investigations or whatever,  for whatever reason, Google's fighting the good fight.  I think it's because they're engineers and they know what's right and they want everybody to do it.  Yeah. That's what I'm doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's probably a little bit of all of it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt.  So what do we know about the Google Music Store?  We've been using Google Music in beta for some time. Still private beta, right?  You have to get an invite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I believe so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I actually, but I think it's very similar to Amazon with one big exception.  You can't buy anything.  Yeah. So Google needs to have a store and the rumors are all things.  He says it's coming soon and coming soon with a twist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did Facebook do them a favor there that now you can buy through Amazon, you can buy through iTunes.  And now with Facebook, too, as a social means of discovery leading to purchase,  they're kind of foolish to leave Google out now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I think the music industry has wanted to balance iTunes dominance for some time.  Exactly.  So at All Things D, Andy Rubin, who said quite a few things on stage with Walt Mossberg,  by the way, Kara Swisher, who was supposed to be on stage for this Asian All Things D,  had a little ischemic incident, she said, and we wish you the best, Kara, because we love you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Scary, but she's blogging like mad from the hospital room at Hong Kong.  Thank goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You cannot shut Kara Swisher up.  No, you cannot.  She got her voice back.  Love that about her.  Anyway, so she says, make sure when you're on a long flight, walk around and drink linear fluids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love that she blamed the two big dudes sitting next to her. That was awesome.  I can just see that. I can just see that. Anyway.  I can see Kara sitting down and being, hello, ladies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So she's not on stage, but Walt is, and Andy Rubin joined him, and he confirmed for the first time  that there will be a Google Music store, and I think we're close, he said.  He says Google will have a little twist, it will have a little Google in it. Whatever that means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought the twist, I don't know, I thought it was a reference to Double Twist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh.  Oh, I didn't see that. I thought he was just trying to say it'd be something funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. I mean, I'm just reading between the lines. I don't know if there's anything to that,  but Double Twist is sort of the client of choice for managing your media if you're an Android user.  I actually love Double Twist.  I mean, you can imagine Double Twist combined with Google Music streaming, combined with an MP3 store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google Double Twist also has Wi-Fi syncing, which of course Apple's touting.  Finally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I have no inside information, I don't know.  Oh, I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I like where you're going with that.  Good rumor. Let's start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe you just started it, Peter.  Google, what's Double Twist?  We didn't think of that either. Let's buy them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If I'm wrong, I don't want to get blamed for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ryan thought of that.  It says we won't just be selling 99 cent tracks. What does that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're selling albums.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, nobody's just selling 99 cent tracks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe they're going to do a Spotify competitor.  I don't know. It's tough because when they launched the Google Music Locker thing,  they did that without licenses and they kind of pissed off the label,  so I'm not sure they're going to be able to pull something like that off.  But that is kind of the holy grail, right? It's something that combines the locker with the streaming with the store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He says they don't get us. Media companies don't get what we're up to.  He compared it to how Apple changed and evolved.  He says Google is evolving as well. It's in the very, very early phases of adding consumer products to our portfolio.  The media industry didn't see us as that. They saw us as a search company.  No, actually we saw you as an advertising company.  It is interesting. Perhaps, I don't know, a lot of question marks from that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wonder if it'll be a Facebook, Spotify type thing where you're on Google Plus  and you can see what other people are listening to, see what your friends are listening to,  and perhaps stream friends tracks somehow. That's interesting.  I mean, the Android market has a Books tab, a Movies tab, and an Apps tab.  It's missing a Music tab. Although, I don't know, maybe this would be completely separate from the Android market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wild rumors. What if they're going to partner...  The Skype deal went through. Skype is now wholly owned by Microsoft.  So the founders of Skype are just kind of wandering around.  They started a new service. Remember, they started RDO.  They now have VDO, which is a Netflix competitor.  I love Don Draper just kind of sitting there looking.  Doing what he does.  Thinking. He's coming up with a tagline, any moment now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Looking dashing and thoughtful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like the greatest web page. I just want to leave that up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who doesn't want to look at Jon Hamm?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Kind of the mean version of Gina's face being frozen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But everyone's probably scratches his palm and looks around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's coming up with brilliant thoughts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's thinking things.  And the ash never falls.  And the ash never falls. And I can't click anything.  Oh wait a minute, I can log in.  So I'm really wondering if maybe something like that.  Maybe they're talking movies, TV shows, as well as music.  And I love the idea of maybe they're talking about a streaming service.  That'd be cool.  Just a thought. We're going to start rumors.  We don't know what they're doing.  I like the double-twist rumor.  I love that. I think that's the one we're going to go with.  We'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He said a twist. He said with a twist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And he started it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And now we know what Jon Hamm was thinking this whole time.  I'm sorry, but you can't have this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  UK only.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can't handle the video.  UK only. Oh well.  I'm just going to leave that on my screen. I like it.  He's thinking.  Moving along here. Let's see what else.  You see anything else you really want to talk about here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I should.  With the full disclosure that I am a nano, micro, mini, tiny investor in it.  Bill Gross, Uber Media started Chime In.  Oh yeah. Yeah, they have a new site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  C-H-I-M-E dot I-N.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which I think the best way to describe it is that you can kind of...  I'm probably not supposed to describe it this way, but I will anyway.  It's much richer tweets that can still feed Twitter.  And still feed eventually Google Plus and Facebook and so on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So he made noise for a while about making a Twitter competitor.  And Twitter kind of slapped him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He says this is not. This will feed both ways.  But what this allows, they're pitching this as an interest network  so that you can filter better and find your interests better  rather than just following people wholesale.  So when Scobel writes about technology, you can find that part of Scobel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And they're smart. They got Trey Ratcliffe.  They probably chased him down.  Who's breaking up there?  I think it's me.  Who's that?  All right, I'm going to sign in here real quickly.  I think it is you, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, it's not. I think it might be Gina. I just turned her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it? Sorry about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Doesn't matter.  It's your razor burn. That's why I got it in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, somebody already has Leo Laporte.  Oh, well, man, it says that we've reserved it.  I'm sure it's for you.  Authorize it.  Oh, you know what they do? They reserve it because it's my Twitter handle.  So I sign it through my Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what they did. They can't really do the same thing,  but they can reserve it so you can have it supported here.  Yeah. Anyway, I think this is going to be interesting.  It is. And companies can come in and create their own pages.  And you can create a page there where you can sell all the advertising  yourself, but if you don't sell it, Chyman will sell it and they split the revenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I like Bill. He always has a business model.  Leave it to Bill. He's got a business model.  He's not going to let that, leave that low hanging fruit line there.  What do you think about Chris Poole, Moot, who he said anonymity is important.  Of course, Moot runs 4chan.  Yeah.  And anonymity has given rise to, well, some of the most ill behaved people on the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And he puts down Facebook, but then he uses Facebook authentication for his new service  and says that it does improve things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, Canvas, his new thing.  It does filter out trolls and spammers, but he does make a good point.  We all have multiple identities as part of being human.  It's good to have options and have multiple identities.  Facebook and Google, he says, do identity wrong?  Twitter does it better and I want to think about what the world would be if we did it right.  Okay. I'm not sure I'd ask Moot.  Facebook power users have left Twitter, says Sean Parker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sean Parker saying that? Investor for president?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What a shock. He says Twitter or Google+.  I thought it was weird.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are there any numbers to back that up?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  In fact, Twitter, Dick Costolo announced at Web 2.0 that Twitter now has 250 million tweets a day  and that because of the iPhone Twitter integration in the new 4S that they had tripled the number of signups in the last few weeks  and that this is, I thought, the most interesting.  50% of their 100 million users are on every day now.  So that was one of the things people thought about Twitter.  Well, there are a lot of accounts, but how much do people really use it?  50% every day.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is a really high number of active users.  No kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's extremely high.  And I think a lot of it is the mainstreaming of Twitter because you see now, I'm shocked, almost every TV show has a hashtag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Every TV show hashtag and news people all have their Twitter handle up.  Reality shows, it always seems like there's a hashtag or even people watching live and taking questions.  Well, I mean, even some of the Glee stars do this, right?  Like, OK.  I'm doing a drinking game.  Sorry. Drink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we already did Chipotle.  We might as well get Glee in there.  Now you can really be toasted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  By the way, there was an interesting Reuters article, I think is in the list via Huffington Post, of a study they did of backing up on Occupy Wall Street hashtag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You started it with F Washington, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I didn't start it, but it was actually, they were separated at birth.  It was the first English language use of it, they said, was just F you Washington and Occupy Wall Street together.  I remember that tweet.  Yep.  Somebody did.  But it's really fascinating to see how it spread and where it spread.  New York has really spread it really rapidly.  And I love that kind of analysis now of where that goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you think Occupy Wall Street is our Arab Spring?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They've got to be abusing an awful lot into it.  You know, the problem is that...  Well, not it isn't yet.  Well, no, I think what it is, it is overarching expression of anger.  And people are frustrated that it has no clear goal, but that's the point of the hashtag.  A hashtag has no owner.  It has no creed.  We put into it what we want to put into it.  And now I think that the movement, which is a hashtag movement, has to figure out where it's headed.  I don't think it has to have a set of goals.  I think that'd be a mistake.  I think it needs to basically have a tweet.  It needs to have a line.  One of my colleagues at CUNY said it should be level playing field.  But, you know, whatever it is, kind of this is what we want in a society.  And we're not there.  But right now it's this kind of...  You know, now it's the object of fun.  Last night, John Oliver on...  I don't know if you can find it quickly.  It was just brilliant on Daily Show.  Went and mocked the human microphone.  He mocked.  He mocked.  The human.  The human.  Microphone.  Microphone.  And it was just absolutely brilliant.  And, you know, Howard Stern sent down his guys to interview the people who were there.  And asked one of them, why are you here?  Ummm...  You know, and so there's serious anger.  There's serious issues.  There's serious stuff.  And God bless these people for starting it.  But I almost feel like it's going to move off the street and back onto Twitter for a  real discussion.  Really?  Interesting.  Somebody says it's very meta.  It is meta.  It's somebody in the community that's going to be like, oh, I'm going to be a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's somebody in the chat room said that basically.  It's a...

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The hashtag revolt.  It's easy.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I mean, let's face it.  That's a very easy way to protest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just use a hashtag.  Yeah, it is.  The proof.  I did it over wine.  Yeah.  I went down there on Monday.  I was in New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it was cool to see that the place on Foursquare was the hashtag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, there was a hashtag.  And it was a hashtag.  I like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was very clear how to talk about it.  Yeah.  Interesting.  That's clever.  Yeah.  Somebody's smarts doing all of this.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Social media's smart.  Just to let you guys know, it looks like Sergey and Vick are on stage at Web 2.0.  Yeah.  They're done.  They just finished.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The chat room is telling me about it.  I'm like, oh, they're done.  I'm like, oh, they're done.  They're done.  I'm like, oh, they're done.  I'm like, oh, they're done.  I'm like, oh, they're done.  I'm like, oh, they're done.  I'm like, oh, they're done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I saw it and I saw it and I didn't know.  I didn't want to send everybody there.  Well, they're done anyways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Watch it later.  Don't watch it now.  Dennis Crowley, this is Web 2.0 Summit.  Dennis Crowley talking says that maybe Foursquare won't be doing check-ins too much going forward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Have you guys used the new, any of you used?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love it.  I love it.  So the new, that radar feature?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's nice when you turn it on.  It lets you know not only if people that you are following are nearby, but also things  on your lists to do.  And so I've joined a lot of lists because I don't want to miss the best ice cream in  Southern California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or the best guacamole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But is it great in your battery, constantly checking?  Is it checking you in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you know, baby, I bought the biggest, I practically carry a car battery with me.  I don't care.  I want all those features.  I don't care.  Battery life, shmattery life.  I'm sure it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But what does this do for you, Gina?  I mean, is it going to be telling the world where you are all the time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it watches where I am.  So Crowley was saying that Foursquare's biggest challenge is getting sort of curious users,  turning them into active users, right?  Because when you go someplace, you have to launch the app.  You have to remember to take out your phone, launch the app and check in.  So going into passivity, right?  Where the app just monitors where you are and then lets you know if your friends are nearby or whatever.  I have to say, I love seeing Leo in my nearby list.  You know where I am.  I know.  I love that.  It was really neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I checked in everywhere.  I do every, I always check in.  I love doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's cool.  But I don't, I don't know.  I still feel weird about having an app, you know, map my, you know, unless it's my tracks and I'm saying I'm going for a run,  track where I am, not only the battery issue, but just kind of the, I know, I know I'm going to have to get a privacy,  a public is talking to about, about this.  You're frozen, Gina.  And he's frozen too.  I know, but then again, Skype doesn't like me.  I think as soon as I started getting, talking about creepy privacy thing, Skype just...  This is a great shot though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You look so cute.  It is.  It is.  So cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've done worse, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have to say we are living a terrible time and I blame you, Peter Rojas, for all of this because everywhere you go,  including San Diego, like the San Diego Zoo, there's giraffes mating over there and everybody's going like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Looking at their phone.  Yeah, you know, it's funny because I was a really, you know, I had a smartphone in like 2003 and I remember doing email and being on the web and like watching video on my phone and stuff like that.  And people were like, what's wrong with you?  You know what?  In a few years, you're all going to be doing that.  I am future you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they all are.  Yeah.  It's amazing how people are buried in screens nowadays.  All right, we're going to get Gina back and we're going to take a break.  And when we come back, we're going to get our tool tip and number of the week.  But first, a tip for you, Netflix.com.  That's it.  If you're not, I don't even know why we have to do ads for these guys.  They decided not to split off the quickster thing, but forget the DVD.  Do the seven dollar ninety nine cent a month thing.  It is the best deal in video.  Yeah, people say to me, well, they don't have everything, but they got so much.  Who cares?  I don't even plan ahead.  I go home at night.  I fire up Netflix.  I just got the Western Digital Live.  That's got it.  Apple TV's got it.  Google TV's got it.  I'm updating that boxy box has it.  Many Blu Ray players, most TVs, of course, your iPad, your iPhone, your Android phone.  They all have Netflix.  That means with streaming, you watch stuff anytime you want.  And what?  Look at all the great stuff they've got.  Walking Dead.  You go back and watch last season before you watch this season.  Thirty Rock, The Office, Parks and Rec, Mad Men.  Great documentaries.  I am a big fan of the documentaries, most of which you don't get to see.  And so this is just it's it's it's impulse watching.  It's all the kids stays in the picture.  What a great movie that is.  There's just so much great stuff here.  Would you give it a try?  Free.  No cost.  Just go to Netflix dot com slash twit.  If you decide to keep it, it's seven.  The art of makeup effects.  Wow, that looks good.  Seven dollars, ninety nine cents a month.  Netflix dot com slash twit.  And if you already have it, do me a favor.  Just, you know, throw open the window and shout it out.  Tell everybody in your neighborhood.  Netflix dot com slash twit.  All right.  Gina Trapani has our tool of the week.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Tip of the week is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm the tool.  You're the tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you haven't logged into Google Docs and looked at presentations in a while.  I love it.  I love it.  I love it.  Yeah, do so.  Google rolled out a bunch of improvements.  Live collaborations.  You can watch.  You can build a presentation with your coworkers and watch character by character real time  typing.  Very wave like.  Very regular Google Docs like right now.  You can do animations and charts and tables and you can do transitions between slides.  You know, I can't stand PowerPoint and I started to use keynote a little bit more.  But I have to say now with this upgrade and you'll get a little prompt when you logged  into Google Docs and go to presentations to to to enable the new presentation editor.  This looks really nice.  So I'm not sure.  I'm actually not sure.  Presentations has offline.  This is my only worry about doing presentations in Google Docs is that you're going to get  to, you know, in front of the room at the podium and that you're going to lose your  connection.  Right.  So I think that's kind of the last the last thing here.  But yeah, log into Google Docs and check out the new presentation editor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's pretty cool.  It is very cool.  I really like it a lot.  I was so impressed.  And by the way, I love how the Google Docs team or the presentation team is using this  new blogger template, the dynamic template.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Isn't it so cool?  It is beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is.  I spent I spent more time, I think, switching between the layouts for this blogger template  than actually reading the post.  This is really, really neat.  I really like the magazine version.  There's but there's on the Docs blog, there's a little switcher you can check out.  I guess these are new blogger templates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  And in fact, you could turn it on.  I have a blogger.  Actually, it was it was a blogger account I set up to show off Google Waves integration  with blogger.  And so I know I never use it.  But now you've got all these I turn it on in the dynamic templates.  It makes me want to use it for my blog.  Yeah.  Yeah, me too.  It's incredible.  You could do Flipkart magazine.  I mean, they've really they're very Ajax.  They're really quite beautiful.  There's the Flipkart.  Here's the magazine.  This is all the same blog, the same blog content, just different CSS styles that they apply  to it.  Mosaic, timeslide, which is kind of cool.  So I'm actually kind of tempted to use this for my blog.  It's pretty impressive.  Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I had a panic as it wasn't in the list, but it's on my screen.  Thank goodness.  Well, when we had three days of no Blackberry in the world, one unintended consequences was  that traffic accidents in Abu Dhabi went down by 40 percent.  No.  And in Dubai, went down by 20 percent.  Oh, my goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is kind of interesting.  You think it's a bunch of people been typing all this time?  Yeah.  Oh, my goodness.  Wow.  Peter, I don't want to leave you out of this.  If there's any anything you any tool or tip or something having to do with Google or this  cloud that you'd like to share with us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now I'm under pressure.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, we didn't prepare you for this.  And I apologize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I just installed the new Dolphin browser on my phone.  Isn't it great?  The Dolphin browser HD.  Yeah.  It's really nice.  Yeah.  Really, really nice.  I've been using it for quite some time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's free.  Yeah.  There are actually a number of, I use Xscope as well.  There are a number of good browsers, alternatives.  That's one thing that, didn't Ice Cream Sandwich, wasn't it supposed to have Chrome or that  was the wrong?  It has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  It syncs your bookmarks to the desktop.  So I use Dolphin.  I love Dolphin mostly because you can install a LastPass extension in it.  Yes.  Which is super useful because I never remember passwords at this point.  LastPass does them.  But now that the default browser in ICS syncs bookmarks to desktop Chrome, that's huge.  So that's kind of nice.  But Dolphin is really, is really cool.  I switched over ever since Eileen and the crew at AA convinced me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So we're now all in agreement that that is the browser to use.  Everybody, AA agrees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Overwhelmingly so.  Overwhelming agreement.  At least our audience.  I like Xscope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Have you tried Xscope?  I've tried Xscope.  Yeah, I've used both.  Dolphin, you still prefer Dolphin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I just installed Dolphin HD today.  So I got to give it a few days.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I'm stalling a little bit because I don't have my Galaxy S2 with me.  And that has this cool program that I really wanted to show you that's a heads up display for Android.  Now, the program is free.  They want you to buy a or they encourage you to buy a little thing to put it on your dashboard.  But what it does is a virtual, it's an augmented reality display that you use when you're driving.  And it tells you how far away the car is from you.  It warns you.  It beeps if you get too close.  It's actually watching what's going on outside as you drive.  And I wanted to show it to you.  It's called I on Road, but I can't.  So all I can say is download.  It's the letter I.  On road.com.  I guess it really couldn't show you because you have to.  You're going to get into an accident watching this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's why you need to get that.  That's why they really encourage you to get the stand because that looks dangerous as hell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is crazy.  This is GPS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It uses the camera and GPS and motion detection.  It does image recognition.  It sees the car.  It tells you how fast the car in front of you is going.  How many you know if you have it gives you do you have you know see the green there that's sufficient distance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This thing close.  It sounds like your wife shrieking.  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I don't think this is so here.  Let me play.  I guess I can play the video.  This is actually probably better because I couldn't really demonstrate this in my car.  Could I?  It's free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The audio is not so good on your.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not very loud, is it?  We will just talk about it.  But so they the thing is free.  But as I said, that what they really is a come on for getting a clamp so that you don't in fact hold this up as you're driving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, this is a commercial for a clamp and a USB, you know, right.  A charger, a car charger.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you know, and I most many people may have these already.  I'm sure Peter Rojas has 15 of them in his gadget drawer.  But this this is really I just think this is a very interesting application of what smartphones can do.  And it's a heads up display.  So and and and let's hope it'll keep you out of accidents.  It will literally I just think it's kind of cool that you know how far ahead of you that car is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you can't have a self driving car, I guess this is the best next best thing.  This is amazing.  It looks really neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I on road and it really is nice to have on a bigger display like the Galaxy.  It's got to be illegal as hell.  No, you know why?  The chat room, the chat room, the chat room, holy cow, the chat room got it right.  He said no, because it keeps you from texting.  So that's why it's safer.  Isn't that amazing?  Anyway, I just thought that was really cool.  And it'll tell you if you're drifting out of the lane and all that stuff, too.  I on road free.  Try it to give us your impression.  If you get an accident, it's not my fault.  I just one of the things I liked about it is that it's an example of how there's so much innovation on this platform.  Happening some very interesting things that people are using.  Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you've enjoyed this show.  I love doing it every week.  I look forward to it.  I missed it last week.
