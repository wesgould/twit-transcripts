Transcript:  It's time for Twig this week at Google. Kevin Marks will join us to dissect the whole privacy policy issue with iOS apps.  We'll also talk about why Google might be setting up an antenna farm in Omaha. It's all coming up next on Twig.  The bandwidth for this week in Google is provided by Cashfly.  This is Twig This Week in Google, recorded February 15, 2012, the Leatherbound Sky Mall.  This Week in Google is brought to you by Ford, featuring the EcoBoost engine with turbocharger and direct injection.  Look for EcoBoost on the 2012 Ford Explorer and Edge, and the 2013 Escape, and of course at Ford.com slash technology.  It's time for Twig This Week in Google, and a great panel as always because we've got our regulars, Gina Tripani from SmarterWear.org and ThinkUpApp,  and Jeff Jarvis, professor of journalism at the City University of New York, the author of What Would Google Do? His Newest Public Parts, and of course he blogs at BuzzMachine.com.  And we add to the mix the great giant brain of Kevin Marks, who is at Tummelvision.tv. Look at it. You can even see it's giant. It's a giant brain.  This is the big brain show. I've always said that. Thanks for joining us, Kevin.  I'll try.  You actually...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The oranges behind you are apples.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oranges.  Welcome to California.  Once again, Kevin is killing us by broadcasting from out of doors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  With birds chirping and like, you know, trees swaying in the wind behind him. It's very inspirational people. We should all go outside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Was it Grapes of Wrath? I can't remember, but this is how my parents got me to move from Rhode Island to California.  They said, and I think this was, they ripped it off from Grapes of Wrath, you'll be able to go outside and pluck an orange from the tree.  I can do that.  You can do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was the avocado tree that got me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The avocados. Yeah.  Yeah, the avocado trees. That was crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I haven't got an avocado tree to live yet. I've got to try getting the one I planted died, so...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh. Well, you need two, I think. They have to pollinate.  Ah.  That's why. And, of course, the best is Meyer Lemons. Just, you should have an entire...  Yes, Meyer Lemons. They're wonderful.  Orchard of Meyer Lemons. Sorry, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can, I just came back from Montreal.  Oh, God.  I was covered with salt on the streets. It's a wonderful city, but the salt was as thick as snow, and I slipped and fell in it and just became like this white ghost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tis a bad time to go to Montreal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's life in the winter here. So, Kevin, put a screen up behind you next time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kevin actually asked to join us because he had worked on Google content. When you were at Google, Kevin is currently at Salesforce.  And in between, he was at BT doing their Ribbit product. But before that, not so long ago, you were at Google working on profiles and various open...  Open social.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Social, yes.  But part of that was Google Contacts. So, I was, yeah, I'm very interested in the whole address book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The privacy thing. And that thing, I'll tell you, has just gone crazy even since we talked last week.  It all started when a hacker discovered by using MIT proxy. He was looking at the traffic coming out of Path, discovered that Path was uploading the entire contact database from his phone, doing it with HTTPS.  So, it was encrypted as it was going up. At the time, there was quite a furor arose.  I personally, on this show, I think last week said, what did you think they were doing since there have been articles written saying, well, they could have hashed it.  And it's true. They could have hashed addresses and then compared them with a hash on their own on their own side, thereby protecting privacy.  We've also learned that Path not only uploaded them, but kept them for some time.  Dave Morin issued a mea culpa and said, we're not changed Path.  They upgraded it and said, we're not going to do it anymore and we're not going to keep it anymore.  And we're going to give you a nice big warning.  Instagram, you know, what you feel like is a whole bunch of other programs immediately scuttled for cover because, of course, it's, as I had presumed, a widespread practice.  Instagram immediately, without saying much, changed their upload to warn you ahead of time.  And now a long article. Twitter.  Well, we've now found out that Twitter keeps it for 18 months on the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Foursquare did it right in the first place.  They've always put a warning up and they only keep it while they're doing the check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wouldn't doing it right, though, Kevin, be hashing it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Friends, you know, the question is, you know, what are you afraid of?  This comes down to is what are you actually afraid of?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and that was my response when somebody tweeted.  Well, you know, they read the Ryan Tate article on Gawker.  Dave Morin lied.  And I said, well, what are you worried about?  They have your stuff.  Where's the harm?  Are you think there's a I just are you saying are you asserting the path is selling your email address or information?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you read Arrington's big dog's belly post about this?  Well, and we can go on because M.G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Siegler and Arrington wrote about it, both of them, by the way, principles and tech crunch, which is a path investor.  And then that got all heated up because then fake Steve Jobs, Dan Lyons wrote an article saying something about M.G.  being a yapping dog ankle biter, I think, particularly vicious ankle biters.  I think is what he said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And this is such a weak and tech.  Oh, I mean, it really made me go.  I'm so glad I just I do twig and I'm not in that the game of.  Well, anyway, sorry.  I mean, I agree, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In fact, my my Twitter Twitter response was, you know, my tweeted response was something like there's some irony in and M.G.  bemoaning the state of tech journalism.  Fine.  Get out of it.  I've been doing this since 1978 without any of these problems.  If you don't like it, go leave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But to go back to the question of what's the harm?  And we talked about this last week.  I think this is less a discussion about privacy and more a question of permission versus forgiveness.  Right. So my so I don't feel like there's any harm in one of these companies having a copy of my address book per se.  I felt betrayed that these apps were doing this without letting me know.  So for me, this is more about a really actually, I think it was it was incredible progress.  I mean, the community policed itself.  You know, there was this expose.  This is what's going on.  The app doesn't let you know it was a violation of Apple's terms, which say an app should let a user know when personal data is being transmitted.  And then all these other apps said, oh, you know what?  We shouldn't be doing this this way.  Oops. Yeah, we're going to we're going to use HTTPS.  We're going to hash and we're going to in the in the user flow, let you know.  And I think another big point for me that came out of this, because my first reaction was, well, this is Apple's fault.  IOS is insecure.  I agree.  I agree.  It has this great permissions model where when you install an app, it asks you, you know, Android's permissions model is better than Apple's.  But it became really clear that asking for permission on installation isn't good enough.  I mean, I still have this experience where I'm like installing Pandora and I'm like, why do they need my address book?  It's a music app.  I think it's come through that this that these permissions have to be the user should be prompted within the flow each time.  Hey, I'm trying to find my friends.  Can I scan my address book?  And I think that that's really I think you're right, Gina, but isn't that a fairly recent skill?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google Plus, we talked about this a few months ago when Google Plus started is that is and then Facebook was doing the same thing where you shift to asking at the moment of sharing.  Yeah, is I think a fairly recent standard that's actually more recent than these services setting this up.  So I think I think Leo's right.  Well, how else do we do it?  You're right that it wasn't open and transparent enough.  But I also think that this is something we're learning.  It's the whole industry's beta.  That is true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We all are learning.  But it is a really good question.  I mean, this is this is the Zuckerberg approach, right?  It's like push the boundaries, do stuff that you're not really sure how users are going to react.  And then if there's an uproar, apologize afterwards.  This was, you know, that the permissions asking permission versus, you know, asking for forgiveness approach.  And I really admire companies that I mean, we're in a whole new era of data and mobility and connectivity.  And these are these are things that we are learning.  We're all we are all learning.  But it is difficult for me to not feel a little bit betrayed.  Like, hey, you know, I love Foursquare and they're doing this or, you know, Twitter's doing this.  You know, in the end, Facebook is was the verge did a great story.  And they were like, Facebook is the white knight in all of this.  Their social graph is all API based.  They don't have to use your address book because they already know your social graph is.  Yeah, I'm not sure I bought that they're the white knight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're the white knight only because they already have all that information.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the reason why these little apps are doing this is because they have to compete with Facebook.  Right. These little apps are doing this because they need they need really by the white knight thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Go ahead, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, so I mean, there's a bunch of things about this.  One is that the basic problem is that email addresses and phone numbers are insecure anyway.  They're bearer tokens.  If you have one, you can you can contact someone and then you have to install countermeasures to fight them off.  You know, my my home phone number never gets any real phone calls anymore.  Just gets robots ringing me up to annoy me.  Right. And the but the model the model has changed over time.  You know, there's there's this shocking book that gets shipped to my door that has a phone number everywhere in town once a year.  And the address.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And in fact, you have to pay.  I was incensed when many years ago I wanted an unlisted number and found out you had to pay monthly not to be in that book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the model of paying for privacy.  Yeah. That was summer suggesting is where where where this might head that you pay to get out of certain things, which I think is ridiculous.  But but it's a model we've used.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that because that norm has changed because those phones were attached to buildings.  They're not in your pocket.  And so as we move to mobile phones, the norm changed.  We don't publish all the mobile phone numbers.  We hand them around and construct our own address books and share them.  We don't have a centralized registry.  You know, that norm changed almost invisibly, but it actually makes sense to us.  The other norm is the is the personal versus business contact information.  The part of the point of a business card is you're handing out a separate contact thing that isn't your home, that isn't your your personal phone number.  It was a it was a corporate facade to have business conversations that are partitioned away from personal conversations.  And that's also being broken down by by the mobile phone as well, because suddenly you're probably handing out your cell phone instead.  And so that sort of the norms are in transition here.  So people don't pay much attention to it until it comes back and bites them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And, you know, I might quibble a little bit with your word betrayed.  I think it's a little bit strong because I don't think that there was any ill intent to see these companies.  OK, I think what it was is that you felt I don't know what the word is now misled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I wasn't informed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I think it was, you know, surprised.  You don't want to be surprised.  It's a holiday in a bad way.  Right. With with with good intent.  They want to offer a service.  They didn't think about it.  They kept the dresses around.  They didn't think far enough.  And when it came out, you said, Whoa, shouldn't you guys have thought so you were disappointed?  I would argue as much as anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was disappointed, but I have to tell you, I think that any any ethical developer is going to stop and think when there's when it when it involves transmitting someone a user's address book over the wire.  I mean, Mark R.  Man, who created the insta paper, who's cranky and I agree with him with everything.  But he he wrote this post.  He said when I was developing insta paper, I was very surprised at how much access Apple gave me to the address book by default.  And I felt kind of dirty when I implemented the fine friends feature, which, you know, just does it lets you know and get and I, you know, I grabbed the addresses and I discard them immediately and I get out of there as fast as I can, because I feel kind of weird being in there and doing that.  And I mean, as a developer, I think I would feel the same way.  I would I would expect some level of creepy feeling about that.  But, you know, I think Dave was like, oh, you know, all the apps do this.  This is what we need to have a competitive advantage as an upstart social network to compete against the likes of Facebook and Twitter.  We need to do this.  You know, finding friends is really important.  We have to have people come back to this app.  So we're just going to do it.  Even if, you know, we're just we're that whole thing about how it might be a little creepy.  We're just not going to, you know, and that feels that's what I that's what I felt disappointed in.  I don't think that it should be.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think if somebody says, oops, we didn't think of that, you're right.  Get it. We shouldn't have done that.  Then you say, hey, think better next time.  Yeah, I mean, this is justifying the behavior.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. I mean, I think the system worked because it was discovered path immediately, as Mike Harrington said, laid on his back and stuck his belly up and said, I'm sorry.  Fixed it.  And as a result, a lot of apps who didn't really do much of a mea culpa quietly fixed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it was great to see the community police itself in this way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it all worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It worked. But the risk here is sorry, Jane, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the risk here is I hold my hands the European.  I'm not going to do it again, folks.  But these are Vivian Redding's regulations and a hundred some pages.  And in there, one of them is that a company is required to gather the minimum data and keep it for the minimum amount of time necessary for a specific business task.  And again, as with all these things, that sounds good.  But in that case, you know, the New York Times couldn't gather information on your travel content behavior and the hope they're going to get advertisers in the future.  And there's there's something to having data that teaches a company something that they don't yet know they're going to learn.  Now, if it's my own addresses, OK, that's that's different.  But I think we've got to be careful of restricting knowledge so much that it's just presumed to be bad.  It's a stranger danger comes to data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Aren't we moving, Kevin, into the big data era where companies see this huge amount of value in data mining?  And so there is incentive, there's strong incentive now for companies to do this.  But I do think that it's important that we have a permissions based system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. And well, that's what the difference is that, you know, things have actually got better.  The previous model was give me your login.  Right. It used to be when you signed up for Facebook or anything else, give us your login, give us your username and password for Google.  And we'll go and log in as you and get the stuff out.  Give us your username and password for Yahoo and Microsoft and whatever Maccom.  And we'll get the stuff out that way.  And that was horribly broken and very dangerous.  That meant they could actually completely masquerade as you.  And we fixed that by inventing a wolf so that you can now explicitly give an app permission to get a certain set of things and other things.  But at the time we were implementing it, what we were competing with was that model.  So to begin with, the default permissions were you can get everything you could have got through that, through having the password.  You can get the whole address book.  You could act as you can have a separate API to send email address, email and so on.  But you wanted to make sure it was actually competitive because they actually want the user's email address and potentially they wanted the your friends email addresses to Facebook.  Facebook bought Octogen, which is the company that wrote all the scrapers that did this, because this was a big part of how Facebook built up their graph.  How interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So there's yeah, but there's and Gmail gathers everyone you ever email and puts it in a list.  And that's the database that you have access to.  And that was an issue when we first synced iPhones with with Google contacts, because suddenly anyone you'd ever emailed appeared in your iPhone.  Everyone would cross about it because they didn't want that set.  They wanted a different subset.  And then they deleted them all from their iPhone and then they want to complete.  Stop working Gmail.  So there's there's there is an awkward complexity about this.  And yet I work for Salesforce.  So big chunk of what Salesforce does is contact management, keeping track of the people you're selling to your customers and stuff like that.  We have a site called data dot com, which is a business directory that is like the phone book.  You can look at people's current contact information in it.  You can update it and move stuff in and out of that.  And there's APIs and models for doing that as well.  So there are there's a whole set of things that work in different domains.  But the tricky thing is, is when people feel like that.  That's something done without their knowledge.  That's that's the hard part of it.  But the other part is that these things exist in this awkward space that's in between us.  Me having Leo's phone number is one of me having a scale was phone number doesn't matter because he's on the web anyway.  But me having someone who keeps the secrets phone number is useful to me.  But a problem. Do you see the dead mouse and Skrillex thing at the Grammys?  Yeah, this is a great story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So dead mouse and Skrillex, who are both well known dubstep DJs, dead mouse and friends, by the way, wore a T-shirt to the Grammys with Skrillex's phone number on it.  And in the tagline, you mad, bro.  I think this was somehow a Twitter attribute to Skrillex.  Skrillex did, in fact, win the Grammy for best remix.  Skrillex tried to turn off turn on call forwarding.  So and I guess didn't successfully do so.  He tried to forward it. I gathered it to dead mouse.  In any event, if you call the phone number, it's right now a full voicemail box and no chance of leaving a message yourself.  But that and dead mouse said, no, I thought I thought about all of this.  I knew exactly what I was doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. What was the point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. You know, maybe I don't take Skrillex.  Yeah. Yeah. It was just it was it was a couple of guys.  You know, this was guys, too.  Talos napping, I guess is the phrase I should use.  And then so Skrillex tries to call forward it to dead mouse.  Dead mouse call forwards it back to Skrillex.  They're like, it's all a good fun.  My my son asked me once to give out his cell phone number on my Twitter feed.  Just he said, well, do you think people text me?  I said, yeah, yeah, they will.  And so he said, well, do it. I said, well, no.  And so I did. And his phone started vibrating and vibrated so much,  it just fell off the table and continue to do that.  He would clear it and it would do it all again.  And so finally, I don't know.  I don't think he ever changed his phone number.  I think it just we just went away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But unfortunately, your listeners have memories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  God knows. I get calls all the time. I'll get a call.  If I ask for a call, I'll get I'll get 20 calls right now on this cell phone number.  He's not asking. He's not asking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gina, can I ask? I'm just curious.  So you're setting a standard here, right?  So the obvious standard, the first layer of being asked is when you sign into the service  and says we're going to ask for this stuff and people say, OK, and they want the service.  Right. So they don't pay attention.  So then I think you're saying is at the moment you choose to use that function of of saying, OK,  I want to know who I know is in here, then I should tell you right that I'm going to upload your address  and I'm going to keep it for an amount of time. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or say we're going to scan your address book, but we don't keep this data.  That's one of the pops.  Whichever it does.  But it has to tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it should tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The next question I would have is, do you presume some proportion of people won't read this?  So let's say that they do keep it for 18 months because they do think it's a service and you did agree to it.  But they presume you kind of didn't know that in six months.  They say, hey, you know, we still have your addresses.  You know, where do you think the standard ought to go?  So there is some practice like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, if you some of the location services will remind you that Google Attitude does send you an email every so often saying,  by the way, we've still got you.  Yeah, I like that.  That Google does.  Yeah, I think the the service, the Yahoo service, the fire eagle.  Thank you.  Yes.  Yes.  Sorry, Tom Goats.  The late lamented fire eagle.  That established a whole bunch of good precedents around that, around how you should handle location well.  And part of it was we'll notify you every so often that who's got it and where.  And the issue with one of the things that's possible with the OAuth model is because it's not a password,  because it's actually a token that is bound to the application, you can know when that application last accessed your information.  And some of the services show this.  Some of them don't.  Facebook, I think, will show you when the app last used that stuff.  I'm not sure that the Google and Twitter give you as much of a good readout of when they touched it.  But that's actually really, really useful to know.  It'd be really nice if there was like a developer dashboard that said,  here's the API calls that they made to get your information and what they were looking at and when.  So you could say, oh, they're reading my direct messages.  I wasn't expecting them to do that.  And that would be a nice, geeky thing for us to look at and those of us who care about it.  But it's still great for the developers too.  So they wouldn't have to sniff the HTTPS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think Apple now is asking for more explicit.  This is a part of their app store on the desktop.  They're going to ask for more explicit permissions when you first write the application.  It's actually part of the SDK.  You have to check the boxes, let Apple know.  Apple will let you know.  Now, the interesting thing, and I do blame Apple a little bit for this, is that it was against Apple's TOS.  Apple does, for instance, warn you with locations, but they never warned anybody.  Great posting from Dustin Curtis on his blog.  He says, I did a quick survey of 15 popular iOS apps.  Thirteen of them told me they have contacts database with millions of records.  One company's database has Mark Zuckerberg's cell phone number, Larry Ellison's home phone number, and Bill Gates' cell phone number.  So those apps are changing.  Apple today essentially acknowledged your point, Lisa, by saying from now on we are going to require this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's good.  Did they just release a statement today?  Because it's been amazing that there's been no peace out of them.  Yeah, they're doing their measure twice thing.  It took them a bit.  So good. I'm really glad to hear that.  So a couple of things.  First, I don't think for a standard, just find your friends on the social network function.  As far as I'm concerned, you shouldn't have to store my data.  Scan my address book once.  Let me know who's in at that moment in time.  And then in a month or two, inside the app, prompt me, say, hey, a few more of your friends might be here.  You know, check again.  Yes or no.  Yes.  If you have a feature that you do need to store the data, then yeah, I think saying, you know, hey, we store this on our servers for six months.  Like, we'll check with you then.  Someone in the chat room brought up a really good point, which is that Windows Vista suffered from the, you know, too many permissions.  Right.  I mean, it was so difficult to use Vista.  Right.  And I don't think it should be that that bad.  I mean, there's a good way to implement permissions in a bad way.  But in terms of address book access, absolutely should have been built into the SDK, into iOS.  And I'm really glad to hear that Apple's doing that.  And to the point of, you know, Apple's review process, having been through it myself, Apple will reject your app if the if the curve of the rounded corner on your icon isn't correct.  Right.  So the fact that they that knowing that and that they didn't test these apps to see what data that they were sending over the wire.  I think they knew, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They knew.  You think that they knew?  I think they were complicit.  I think that that's really the revelation here is that is, and I presume this last week and it's been confirmed now that it's a widespread practice.  It's considered normal behavior.  Apple perfectly well knew it and didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But with the subscriptions model, they're so protective of user data, how they want to be the only ones who have your email address.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that that's because they want to cut off the business for the for the subscription.  That's different. Yeah, that's a different thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that Apple, I'm not going to blame them.  Maybe they fell prey to the same thing that Dave Moran and others did, which is as a moving target.  And mores are not clear and perhaps they just didn't, you know, they assumed that this would be understood and OK.  I don't know.  I'm not going to I'm not going to ascribe.  I don't know what their intent is, but I bet you anything that they know.  Of course they knew.  I think there's a transition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, there's a there's a transition in permission models and talking about Vista is and Mac OS permissions is a good point.  You know, the classic computer thing is that you run a program on computer.  It can touch anything on the disk in memory anywhere, any code, install anything anywhere.  And that is something that is changing.  And then you have instead you have effectively what we call capability based security.  You say this app wants to be able to do X, Y and Z.  And the you know, the Facebook permissions model gives you know, calls those out for you.  The Android install model calls us out and is built around this capability security model that says this app wants to be able to do X, Y, Z and W.  And if it changes with an update, it says you've got to manually agree to this again.  That's right.  And it'll tell you what I like that.  And the other part of that is that that provides some insulation.  I think part of the reason that the address book is accessible on the the IOS is that they don't have a share this service the way they do on Android.  You know, Android, there's a share this service that any app can then hook into and be be able to share things on IOS.  Each app is effectively doing that themselves.  So they have to call the email browser and it's much more like a sort of classic Mac OS issue of OK, I'm going to call this thing now.  Now I do access the address book to do this.  And so they just brought that worldview with them.  I'm not sure they actually bumped into this particular issue, but that was that was just a natural way of doing it.  I suspect the similar thing that went on with with PATH and Co was that their primary model was probably you know, PATH used to make you sign up with Facebook.  I think they changed that.  But their primary model was we will use Facebook and Twitter as the distributed contact store.  And that once you've got permission there, you're able to go back and read it and get that again.  So when they built the email thing, they made it behave the same way.  They probably put a wrapper around the do I know this interesting and then implemented that with the email.  I think that's very right.  Then the answer was, oh, well, we need to have a copy of this to check it again later because we do want to pull this every couple of weeks and suggest new friends to people.  So I suspect is one of those like we have this worldview that's based on this new model.  We'll model the old. Yes, I think that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a danger here.  The VISTA thing that you bring up, I think is really important, is that we are going to get thanks to regulation a lot more demands for opt in.  And so we're going to go tick crazy.  We're going to be told to tick off constantly because some some lawyer and some legal compliance with regulation is going to say that no, no, no, it's not good enough just to tell you.  You have to acknowledge.  And so it's that crap.  Every time I go into Starbucks and I've got to say, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I won't do bad things.  And just watch.  Just take me to the Wi Fi.  Right.  Even that upsets me.  We're going to we're going to have tick madness hit us constantly go into sites and sharing data and all kinds of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's an interesting blog post Kevin put in the chat on another way to possibly solve this.  This comes from a book that O'Reilly is going to publish called Building Web Reputation Systems by Randy Farmer and Bryce Glass.  He said they say that the problem is this, you know, consent dialogue fatigue.  So they suggest because you are being asked to make a trust decision that reputation might help solve this.  Kevin, would you explain what they propose?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So this was this kind of discussion we had it inside the workshop a couple of years ago maybe.  And the issue is you get these permission dialogues and the default reaction was just say yes to them because it's in the way.  OK, OK, OK. Yes.  I remember it reminds you back in the day when you used Photoshop.  You had to say OK.  Three times to save a file.  Right.  And I watched my graphic designer friends go bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.  Before the dialogue would finish drawing.  And so when it said something else like the disk is full, they don't really say bang, bang, bang and then run away and save because you get habituated into that.  And that was the problem with the original Facebook permissions model is this that wants wants to do stuff to you.  OK.  And it's it's it's in the way.  That was pretty much it.  Everybody checked everything.  And then they realized that, you know, every quiz app shouldn't really be able to do everything.  So they made the permissions more granular.  And so you can judge by the length of that dialogue whether it's being ridiculous or not.  But you still basically go, yeah, whatever.  So the point of this was this idea was when that dialogue comes up, you don't really have many basis of trusting whether that's reasonable or not.  You haven't seen the app yet.  You don't know what's going on, but it could show you your friends who've already installed it as a queue.  That was something that some people suggest.  So you can say, oh, right.  Gina's already using this.  It's probably a good thing that that's reasonable.  But the second piece that was that Randy suggested was was that the cake is a lie bit, which is if somebody uninstalls it, you ask them why and they can say it didn't do what it said.  It tricked me.  It's you know, the classic one was was you sign up for some Twitter app and it tweets on your behalf without telling you.  That was the you know, that was the sort of evil viral thing that they did.  Facebook had some worse ones where it would start using your face in adverts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Still does that, by the way.  We had Scoble on on Sunday and asked him, you know, because I get an ad, a sponsored post for a book that has Scoble's recommendation on it.  And I said, Robert, did you know they were doing that?  He said, I had no idea because you would never see it because it only shows up in your friends streams.  So they still do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, they do that now if you've liked the book.  So that they will express that endorsement, whereas before they would just fish random friends out of your friend list and say, your friend likes this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's only marginally better.  I mean, they're basically using Robert Scoble as an endorser, unpaid endorser for a product, which I think is appalling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, he would do that for any product anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well, Robert, but I think about myself and I hope to God that's not happening to me and I have no way of knowing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, you only know when somebody else shows it to you.  That's true.  So anyway, the point of this was that if you can post, you know, if in that permissioned dialogue, it said Jeff Jarvis uninstalled this app because it did something nasty with his data, that's actually really useful.  And it's particularly useful if it's somebody you know, because then you know how to weigh that trust.  If it's just a random review from a random stranger, that's less useful.  But, you know, we all have friends who do read EULA's and pay attention to this stuff and go, actually, you know, this is trying to do this thing that is bad.  And if that shows up in that dialogue, that helps give you a basis for that.  And iOS does something a bit like this.  When you uninstall an app on iOS, it asks you to review it, but it doesn't use this sort of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They actually stopped doing that.  You know why?  All the reviews were negative.  Because if you think about it, it's self-selecting for people who hate apps.  So they stopped it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But yeah, but you know, the other suggestion on this was that when it pops up that dialogue says it wants to answer your address book, the developer should put a reason in there.  Yeah, why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it wants your address book so it can find your friends.  And then if it's something funny, something else, then the second mechanism would be it said this and it did something else.  And that would act as the warning.  Now it does, you know, that way you get a distributed trust mechanism and you don't have to rely on somebody publishing it and making a fuss just because it's an app that all the journalists use it suddenly appears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think Google has a real opportunity here, as they have done with Latitude, to be a leader.  I like that reputation system and maybe they could implement that.  But I just think this is an opportunity for Google or Apple or somebody to be a leader and say, look, this is how we're going to do it from now on.  What you said you worked on contacts.  Was there anything going on with Google about protecting that data?  Was it treated at the time?  Because this was a year or so ago as something to be protected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's something.  Yeah, there was there was always an API for it.  And the permissions model for the API changed a bit over time.  So it was scrapable.  It wasn't directly scrapable.  You had to have initially to be people scraping it by using the user's login.  Right.  And then there was a G data API.  And now there's G data and portable contacts and some some other bits and pieces of the API there with a bit more generality.  And now you can now you can request a specific group where the group is either a contact group or a would you call it?  I was saying buzz G plus group.  It's a bit confusing because there are now three I think there are three kinds of groups in your context now.  But yeah, but the other thing that struck me is something we talked about would be when the app asked permission, you could say which subset of contacts you give it because that would make a lot of sense.  But the the the U.S. testing at the time was that was exactly what Jeff said.  Every time you give someone a choice in that dollar box, they get annoyed and exit it instead.  And so if you if you started putting check boxes in there, people would would know to click OK.  And as we were at the time trying to stop people asking for username and password as a shortcut to that, we had to make sure that dialogue was less annoying than asking for username and password.  Otherwise, I keep bad thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Gene is on the right point is that coming up with some standards for behavior so that when you get an Apple app, you have faith that it's going to operate a certain way means that you don't have to go through that every time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, it's interesting there like that, like Apple's approval process, I think makes people feel really safe.  It implies that they're doing that.  It implies that they're doing that.  So I found that so interesting that the community had to police itself and had to get Apple to change.  You know what I mean? So it's just like you can't trust you can't trust even Apple stringent approval process to catch everything.  I mean, I think it's great that Google is responding to this and that this happened because some lone hacker like started to run this proxy and just sniff what was going across the wire.  It's amazing.  But it kind of goes back to that.  Like, I mean, of course, I'm coming from the perspective of open source and people say, oh, well, you know, open source apps are inherently insecure.  And but it's this idea that like everybody has to keep an eye on.  Everyone has to review peer review, I guess is the point here is more effective than.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. And it's both for regulation, too.  If we don't do that, then we give the regulators the ammunition to come up with measures that no one's going to like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're going to take a break. Kevin Marx is here.  Gina Trapani, Jeff Jarvis.  I guess we could put the coda on this that, yes, it was a terrible thing.  It's been fixed now.  Let's hope that it brings awareness to every application.  And I would love to see both Google with Android and Apple with iOS implement OS wide strategies that work, that don't give you a click fatigue.  And some are used.  Are you now saying it's terrible?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You didn't say that a week ago.  No, no, I'm just I'm just trying to summarize giving Gina her do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank you.  You know, I guess it is terrible in the sense that I am the steward of other people's contact information, my contact list.  So as steward, I have a responsibility to protect that information.  And so for PATH or anybody else to trick me into giving them that information without full disclosure is is really to put me in jeopardy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's turning into dead mouse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Turning me into dead mouse.  I mean, I know I have Steve Martin's private phone numbers and email address in my contact list.  And I know he doesn't want anybody to have that.  And I feel a responsibility to protect that.  So in that sense, Dave Moran, shame on you because he did.  He didn't steal it from me, but he tricked me into giving it to him.  And so that is an issue.  I agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I think one of the issues is I think this is something David Boyd said, and I think Jeff has said this before.  The issue is not necessarily should they have this data is is what do they do with it?  It's not inside of trading is illegal.  You're allowed to have the information, you're not allowed to act on it.  And that's gathering versus use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but then somebody in the chat room has given a counter example, which I also think if you leave your door open and somebody walks into your house and looks around and then leaves is still an infringement.  Even if they didn't steal anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bad analogy.  Okay.  All right.  I would say I think Kevin's Kevin's right.  It is hard.  It is a difficult thing.  I'm not in the chat room.  I'm not being hostile here, but I think it's hard to come up with one in real life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's how people I think people do feel.  Some people, maybe Gina, feel trespassed upon in the same way you would if somebody walked into your home.  Is that not an accurate?  There's a sense of compartment violation of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You just crossed the line.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that sense is an apt analogy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But as a PR move, it was bad.  Period.  Yeah.  That's the way it turned out.  So I think that we're becoming hypersensitive to some of this stuff and some of the data that people have, you know, can be innocent and is not ill used.  The real problem, I think here, the risk that you were put out was if there was an insecurity.  I think we all agreed that we didn't.  No one thought that they were going to do anything bad with the data.  They were going to sell it.  That's the behavior thing that Kevin's talking about.  And I agree.  So that's not where the risk is.  They did something that violated us in some real way.  The risk was instead our data was somewhere.  We had you're right.  We were responsible for it.  It was then somewhere we didn't necessarily know that.  And if there was a security breach, it would have been lost from a place we didn't even know we had data.  Right.  That's where the problem is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And we carry around in our pockets and give all sorts of people access to all of this information at all times.  I mean, it's all in there.  And so who's at fault?  You know, maybe I shouldn't have added Steve's phone number and email to my contact list.  Maybe I should have written it somewhere and put it in a safe.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And typed it in manually when you wanted to call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Typed it in manually.  I should have memorized it and forgotten the key.  I don't know.  Carry around a phone book with you.  Men are from Google.  Plus, women are from Pinterest with a great picture of Molly Ringwald.  And what's the other guy?  Anthony Michael Hall.  I love that.  We'll talk about it.  This is an article in Time magazine.  But first, let's talk about Ford and the new EcoBoost engines.  I got to drive an EcoBoost when I was shopping for my Mustang a couple of years ago in the SHO.  This is really a sweet engine design that, you know, sometimes technology can solve a problem.  The problem, people want great gas mileage.  They need great gas mileage.  Governments require great gas mileage.  But people also want great pickup.  They want speed.  They want power.  How do you make the two match?  And this is where Ford's just done some really interesting work with their EcoBoost engines.  They took a conventional gasoline engine and enhanced it to make fuel efficiency standards and to give you the kind of oomph and pickup that you want.  They call it the EcoBoost engine.  You'll see it in the 2012 Explorer and Edge, the 2013 Escape.  It's been in the SHO for a while.  It combines two technologies, direct injection and twin turbocharging.  Turbocharging.  So the direct injection gives you a cooler, denser charge that generates more power per drop of fuel because it's cooler and it's denser.  And then instead of using one big, large turbo, and maybe you've driven a turbo engine before and you've seen that hesitation, it's got two small engine-curved turbochargers.  They spool up more quickly, so there's no hesitation.  It's very responsive.  And what the turbocharger does, it takes energy from the engine's exhaust, rotates those turbine wheels, compresses the, pressurizes the incoming air, and it gives you a lot more power per liter.  It's all in the EcoBoost engine.  It's kind of an amazing thing and just one of thousands of technological innovations coming out of the blue oval out of Ford.  I want you to check it out at ford.com slash technology.  Or better yet, go to your Ford dealer and drive an EcoBoost engine.  The 2013 Escape, which comes in 2012, has a 1.6 and a 2 liter EcoBoost.  And the 2012 Explorer and Edge have the 2 liter.  With a 2 liter EcoBoost engine, you get an EPA estimate of 28 highway miles per gallon, which is amazing for a vehicle of that size.  They're truly fantastic.  And they do not hesitate.  You hit that pedal on.  Ford.  But don't do that.  Ford.com slash technology.  We thank them for their support of this week in Google.  Keith Wagstaff writing in Time magazine.  Talking about the fact that we talked a little bit about last week that 90 percent percent 97 percent of Pinterest's Facebook fans are women.  And according to stats, Google Plus is heavily male.  We don't know exactly.  Maybe maybe a similar number.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My favorite line in the story is if Pinterest is a stylish woman browsing through home decor magazines, Google Plus is the software engineer staring at a stark white screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you can be both.  I bet you.  Yeah.  Well, I do.  I do my Pinterest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are two no surprise here.  There.  And this was this had to happen there.  I haven't gone to them yet.  I just saw a tweet on them.  There are now two porn versions of Pinterest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, I was this is what I was wondering.  And this is there would be more men on Pinterest if they had a oh, yeah, hot category.  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've joined last week.  We see Mitt Romney's fake.  No, it's really done brilliantly done.  Oh crap.  I'm going to find it.  A picture of the starter.  You have fake me.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Fake Mitt Romney.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got we should we should talk about the Romney Romney now has the same the Santorum Google problem as he does.  He's been Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I haven't done a search, but I'm not sure I want to.  But you probably know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, interestingly, Pinterest in the UK is majority men.  So this is just just just women.  Well, that's that proves which kind of you know, no, I think it proves the the the the stereotype of British men is what it does, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sock soccer is no football.  Aha.  Call cricket a sport.  Aha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm trying to pull up.  I don't know.  Is Pinterest down?  Because I'm not getting any.  I'm having interest to actually.  Yeah, we broke Pinterest.  That doesn't seem right.  Oh, you just brought men to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All these men broke it.  I'm not like, what is this thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gosh, there are pictures.  Take me to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's it's down.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gentleman is up.  That's what I use.  It's not a porn site.  It's a mint of manly things.  It's Pinterest for men.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it the same company?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So somebody cloned the UI.  Somebody cloned it.  It's total clone.  I don't care.  I like it because it's like manly things like Marine Sergeant Rocky Sickman returns home.  Ford F650 truck Jeep.  The douchebag ski carrier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like this one from Sean Connery.  I must ask you a question, but I'm shaving it for later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo, Leo, shouldn't you do just a just a gadget and geek peterist?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That would be a great idea.  I mean, we're going to clone it.  Twitter, Twitter, Twitter, Twitter, Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is the code open source or these these clones are just people just building the whole new?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Know the UI is all new.  Just Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.  I don't think you could really copyright it.  I mean, Tumblr did it first, right.  It's not I don't think you can really say this interface is is unique.  Google makes a next gen personal communications device and is testing it in employees homes.  I want it now.  I want it to.  It's rumored to be a Sonos like device.  We thought we talked about last week.  We thought it was going to be released this week.  They didn't do anything.  In fact, I was really pissed off.  That thing we talked about last week that Google TV put on Facebook, but not on Google  Plus was like an updated YouTube app for for the Google TV and which I, by the way,  tried to download like a million times and it said, sorry, we're networked down or something.  I couldn't faked out, faked out, faked out.  So this is called the Android at home Tungsten hub.  That's what they called it at Google I.O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there's there's two things, right.  There's the Android at home control your refrigerator remotely thing.  And then there's this like streaming music device.  I think it's the same thing.  You think it's the same thing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they asked for two different permissions for testing is what the story said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK.  So I think Gina's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe some different things.  Hmm.  So and the other bigger story is that they're building a testing lab for hardware.  Google going into the hardware business.  Are they trying to be Apple?  What's what's happening here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I hate it that these companies are so jealous of the other guys.  They're all copying each other and just like do what you do.  Be yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, the better bits approved now.  So they are a hardware company, right?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it's not closed yet, but it's approved by the EU.  So I think that was the last the Motorola deal for the last hurdle for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the Department of Justice approved it.  So I think who else is there anyone else they have to get it by?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  China.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The last bastion of intellectual property protection.  So yeah, the DOJ today approved Google's twelve and a half million billion, sorry,  billion dollar bid to buy Motorola Mobility.  So it says two days ago and you did two days ago.  So Monday's blessings mean Google just needs to clear regular hurdles in China, Taiwan  and Israel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good luck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't know that China had any approval over mergers.  Geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google's relationship with China's ruling party has been on shaky ground.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why?  I don't understand.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Can't you just buy a company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought it was a done deal, but I guess not.  If I went out and bought revision three and I have to get China to say it was OK.  I assume that the hardware testing lab was totally about Motorola.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You think so?  Do you think they're going to do a phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I figured.  Well, a phone and some sort of set top box, right?  A Google TV, a Moto Google TV.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  of this when we need to?  I wouldn't want to.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't want to.  I don't want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not going to.  I'm not going to.  I'm not going to.  I'm not going to.  I'm not going to.  I'm not going to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not going to.  I'm not going to.  And do it at Google and just say, never mind, you guys can make some stuff and we'll sell  parts of this when we need to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Judging by the quality of the Motorola phones, I think they should take it from Motorola.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It would be interesting to see how they handle it because that will make you feel really  nervous if they don't keep Motorola maybe a little separate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  John Gruber had a great post on his Daring Fire blog and blog.  Answering the question, is Apple a software company or a hardware company?  He said, well, arguably software, but really it's a design company.  And it's the entire thing.  He quotes Alan Kay, as Steve Jobs did, who said, if you really care about the software,  you have to make the hardware.  And I think you could make the case that if you really wanted to make the best Android  phone, we know now, if you really want to make the best Android phone, you better make  it yourself if you have some sort of...  Because there's such variety and there's so much crap out there.  Although Samsung is quickly rising to the top, I would say.  They made the last Nexus, the Galaxy Nexus, the Galaxy S2, they made this Note.  I think they seem to be the winner of all of them.  HTC, I thought, but not anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  HTC were doing pretty well, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is Apple going to be able to stop Samsung cold on its track with all its suits?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, they're suing now to keep the Galaxy Nexus out of the US.  Can you believe that?  Yep.  Ridiculous.  They've sued in Germany, Australia.  And at first we thought, oh, this is kind of a covert action that's eventually going  to hit at Google and hit at Android, but they're going to go after HTC and LG and Samsung.  But now I think it really has a lot to do with the fact that Samsung is starting...  I mean, they've sold a lot of these Notes.  I think that they're starting to be a little worried, perhaps.  And somebody thought that maybe the lawsuits were all about the fact that the next iPad  is going to look a little bit like this, which would be very funny, wouldn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Then they'll see that Samsung was stealing their design again, like they did last time.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Samsung said, well, you want to see that, we've got to see your iPad 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In the chat room, I don't know if this is a joke or not.  The chat room was talking, a couple of people said Apple wants to sue Kodak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They are suing Kodak.  They asked permission because Kodak is in Chapter 11.  They asked permission to the court.  Hey, can we sue these guys too?  They're on the floor, but let's kick them.  Dog belly.  Good Lord.  They're in Chapter 11 and you want to sue them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, this is...  And let's note, shall we note that Kodak, 120 years later, has stopped making cameras.  Right.  They're not even in that business now.  They're in the printer business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well it's clear Apple wants to make it crystal clear to anybody who would have any question  that they will be highly aggressive in defending their intellectual property.  If there were any doubt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the only good news was the Eola lawsuit was...  That's a good one too, yeah.  That was...  And it's only taken 10 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they file these lawsuits mostly in East Texas?  East Texas, yeah.  Because it turns...  This is kind of one of those bogus, I think one of those bogus things, but they believe  that juries in East Texas are more pro-IP rights holders than others.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not just that.  It's also that that particular jurisdiction doesn't have many cases so they can come to  court more quickly.  And so that was one of the original reasons.  Whereas if you try and do it in New York, there's a whole bunch of criminal stuff that  gets in front of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that takes place.  There's a story...  Yeah, they just kill them in Texas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I think you could find a not so busy court in a lot of places, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was a story I read a couple years ago.  There's a building there.  Yes.  Office after office after office after office.  It's just nothing but...  Dummy offices.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a great This American Life on this.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, that was it.  That's right.  They went and they searched.  And they're all basically owned by Nathan Mirvold.  There's a handful of people who basically they make this their business.  So a jury in Texas gave... proved a lie to the thought that they might somehow be nicer.  They said that those Eola's patents, which really would have... had they won this case,  and I think they won once before, didn't they?  Would have really changed everything.  They claimed that they invented...  Interactivity.  Interactivity, yes.  That's a good way to put it.  It was really about plugins.  And they've already had...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So many jobs against Microsoft and the settlement.  So they got a patent in 1998.  Now think of it...  This had been in 1998.  It was a very long time ago.  It was a very long time ago.  It was a very long time ago.  It was a very long time ago.  It was a very long time ago.  It was a very long time ago.  It was a very long time ago.  It was a very long time ago.  So they got a patent in 1998.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now think if this had been invented by 1998 or not.  Describing a system that allows a user of a browser program on a computer connected  to an open distributed hypermedia system to access and execute an embedded program object.  Had that been invented before 1998?  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Hypercard plugin.  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then they had a patent that allowed fully interactive embedded applications through  the use of plugins.  They brought people like Vint Cerf of Google and Tim Berners-Lee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Tim Berners-Lee I think was him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pei Yuan Wei.  They went down to Little Town in East Texas and they testified.  And the jury said, you know, those are some smart guys.  They say they invented this first.  We believe them.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that was of a piece with the SOPA thing.  I think the difference is now between now and when these were heard before was that  we now have substantial layman experience of this stuff.  So when you start using the browser and you say, well, there's this embedded thing, and  they go, well, that is pretty obvious.  Yeah.  I use stuff like that all the time.  They think they own that.  And I think it was the same with the SOPA stuff.  You want to change the internet to do what?  The experience of this used to be some arcane technical argument that a bunch of us had  because we were the nerdy ones.  Whereas now that internet experience is so mainstream that you can rely on a jury to  be much more reasonable about it than you would have been able to 10 years ago where  it was very technical and arcane seeming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Some talk, quite a bit of talk this past week over Google launching Google Drive or G Drive  eventually.  Maybe even speculation that Google might buy Dropbox.  Google Docs offers, I don't know if it's widely known, if you watch this show, you know it,  free storage for any kind of file.  You can upload any kind of file to Google Docs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it doesn't have the Dropbox's interface, which is like that it's just like another  folder on your computer.  I mean, the Dropbox experience is so great.  It's such a great product.  I use it with to do text.  I mean, it would be a great purchase for Google, although I get worried when small great companies  get acquired because you worry that they're just going to get abandoned.  But if G Drive, if Drive, I guess is what they're just going to call it, just straight  up Drive has that same Dropbox kind of experience for cheaper, that would be fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There are lots of companies now doing Dropbox like things.  I've used Spider Oak, SharePoint.  Sugar Sync.  Sugar Sync.  Was it Wazoo or something?  Wala.  Wala.  So there's a ton of people doing this.  For some reason, Dropbox has all the traction.  And maybe you can address this, Gina, because one of the reasons it has so much traction  is because programs like to do text have it kind of built in.  Is there API so much better or was it the adoption rate or what was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The API is just great.  And truthfully, I chose it for to do text because it was just a product that I've been  using for a long time and people know the name and the API is awesome.  for iOS and Android and JavaScript, the PHP, basically any language you want to build in.  It's super, it's just super easy.  And yeah, I've heard of these other products.  I just, I just one of those things like I started using Dropbox and just loved it and  never, I never moved from it.  Do these other products have that similar thing where you download this client on your  computer and it just creates another folder?  Same deal.  Same deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The reason I use actually not quite as no, you know, not all of them do that.  You have a Dropbox, you know, like a watch folder, but they're all sync in some way.  But you specify folders and they're automatically synced as opposed to separate folder, a Dropbox  folder.  But I started looking at these other guys when the issue of Dropbox knowing your encryption  keys came up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And so I thought, well, I'm not that I'm hiding anything.  I don't have anything on there that I really care about, but I thought, well, maybe I should  investigate these that allow you to own your own keys, that kind of thing.  Right.  Right.  But you're right.  Frankly, it's hard to move away from because every app on the iPhone, Android phone and  iPad, they all support Dropbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It just got momentum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's got momentum.  Yep.  recognition than, say, Spider Oak.  They're still going to face that issue with people just keep using Dropbox.  So they're going to have to buy it, I think.  Google is seeking approval for an antenna farm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They will know everything.  They will listen to everything.  I'm so scared.  I'm freaked out.  I'm freaked out.  Plus, it's in Iowa.  That's the best part of that one.  It's in the middle.  Is it a satellite dish farm?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because the presumption is that this is them going into the cable business.  They'll get TV signals, but nobody knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think they're building their own nuclear deterrent fleet.  It's next to Omaha, which isn't Omaha where the Strategic Air Command is based.  And Warren Buffett.  And Warren Buffett.  Put the two together.  The Oracle.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you've got Warren Buffett and you've got missiles and you've got satellites.  They're building, in their application, they said the company wants satellite receiving

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  stations to receive C-band and KU-band signals to provide, now this is interesting, to provide  analog and digital audio data and video services.  It sounds like they want to get in the cable business.  These are the, these are the, these are the, these are the things that they're going to  do.  These are the, the KU and C-band are the big dishes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Here's an alternative theory.  They could be, this could be a wide spaces play.  This could be them testing out, being able to send signals a long way in the old TV bands.  Right.  Or just get it to reach.  I'd have to look at the exact frequencies and sort of, but that, no.  One of the, the point of the wide spaces was to reuse the old television spectrum because  everyone's got cable now so that you could use that as a, as a super wifi.  If you want to do that and you want to go a long way, you're going to need a big antenna  at the sending end so you can have a small antenna at the receiving end.  I just love these conspiracies.  So that may be part of it too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're based on the notion that Apple and Google have so much cash in the bank that  they could just, you know, unilaterally say, hey, guess what?  We're in the cable business or guess what?  We own Hollywood.  Or we own Greece.  We own Greece.  They're, Apple's bigger than Sweden.  So let's buy it.  So it's just, I think a lot of this is just like, well, they got so much money.  Who knows what they could do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I once said to Nick Denton when he had his prior company, moreover, I was on the board  of that one.  And I said, Nick, you know, one of the best things you did before the crash was raise  a lot of money.  He said, no, it was one of the worst things I did because it allowed the then CEO to go  down all kinds of routes that that person shouldn't have gone down.  Not good to have money.  No, it actually isn't.  Yep.  Causes distraction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's distracting.  What do we do with our hundred billion dollars in the bank?  Street view.  They added, they added airports.  Oh, I guess that's Google Maps.  But then they added that we had it at CES.  Now Google Street View.  And then they went into stores, right?  Now they're going cave diving in Japan.  Google Street View is adding caves.  They sent several photography crews to shoot long exposures of caves in Japan.  And you can, I guess you can, let's, shall we, shall we, you want to go in?  Shall we go for a ride?  These are just images from street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is example of not having enough to do.  Yeah, too much money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We were just, we were just saying something about too much money.  What are we going to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, let's just take pictures of caves.  Next thing they're going to do a Google Street View of my nose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think this is someone, someone's really crafty 20% time project.  It's like, I know, how can I get to go cave diving in Japan?  I'll take the camera with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, that's it.  That's probably what it is.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They did a nice one where they put, they put the camera on bicycles and cycle paths.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One thing attacked by the sun again.  Oops.  Oh, I like it.  He's got a halo.  Do any of you have the new Google bar yet?  Is it just me that doesn't have the new Google bar?  Well, they got rid of it, didn't they?  What?  I never had it.  I'm just asking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They got rid of the red bar and they're sticking with the black bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, so they just skipped me on the update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The dropdown over the logo isn't there.  They put the dropdown back on the more at the end of the black bar.  Are you not seeing that, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  Let me go to Google Plus again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, go to Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right.  And then the more dropdown, that's what I'm supposed to have, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is the new bar?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what I have.  Yeah.  And so they took the dropdown from, remember it used to be, you'd have to click on the  Google logo and the dropdown.  Right.  Now it's just here.  They removed that.  Yeah.  There's more and there's even more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Even more?  What do I get then?  Oh, I get this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So they really obscure things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  So really what's happened is they took long enough to get me the new Google bar that they  went back to the old bar because nobody liked the new Google bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They said they had a meeting.  They said, Leo wouldn't like this.  We shouldn't do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He'll complain.  It'll be a problem.  And so they changed it.  I didn't even notice.  What if they had a Google bar update and nobody came?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Truthfully, I didn't notice either.  When I saw the story, I had to go check it.  Isn't that funny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I hadn't really noticed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  I don't think it's not caring.  It's just, you know, it's a small piece of luck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One more story then we're going to get to our tool, our number and our tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, Pinterest is back up.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just in case you're worried about that.  It's a online pin board of wonderful things.  All right.  Well, like I know, Mitt Romney's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pinterest.com slash fake Mitt Romney slash pins.  Is it going to, am I going to be sorry?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  It's not X rated, right?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's not X rated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's only got 534 followers.  His favorite things are.  He's got pet accessories.  Every week, Anne and I invite a few friends over for what we call triple baccarat night.  We serve cocktails in the baccarat glassware, play a few hands of low stakes baccarat and  hire our friend Bert Baccarat to play American standards.  This is pretty funny.  Now see, this is a new use for Pinterest.  I hadn't really thought about it.  I like.  I like fake.  Oh, the dog.  The dog carrier is funny.  Oh, let's go back here.  So these are pet accessories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, you know, the whole dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I found this in the Sky Mall catalog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The wild expensive wine.  Do you guys like sangria?  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm a big proponent of putting your dogs on a raw diet.  So much healthier.  Propelings.  These things are great for your girl.  You know what I'd like to know is how does he get the cut?  Because the comments are humorous as well.  So Stephanie says Mittens, what are you doing flying commercial and reading Sky Mall?  Is the jet in the shop?  Mitt response.  Oh, Muffy, twice a year, American Airlines sends me a special compilation bound in leather.  There's so many great inventions in there.  It's got to be.  Oh, well, anyway, I'm sorry.  I got distracted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The roof of your car easily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  New app for Google TV, which rolled out, which I can't get.  Did you get it yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did not.  I didn't either.  Well, I didn't try it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I tried and it said, I can't update right now.  But apparently YouTube has made, according to this article in All Things D by Peter Kafka,  a small but important change in the way it deals with content owners.  It's now insisting on the ability to play all videos from content partners on all platforms,  including mobile phones and connected TVs.  I've run into this frequently where you'll be on your mobile phone and it'll say the  content provider has requested it not play on mobile, which is bizarre in the extreme.  It is weird.  Yeah.  So apparently they're not going to allow that anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Does that mean they're going to stop embed blocking as well?  Because that's the other thing.  Some things are not embeddable.  Right.  You only play them from the site.  Is that part of the change or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It does not say that.  It says there will be, it says on all platforms, including mobile phones and connected TVs.  It says all platforms.  So maybe that would be great if they could force embedding as well.  Big Hollywood studios or TV networks also have carve outs that won't get changed.  But this is the problem with YouTube.  You got it, whatever they say, because it's so important to be on YouTube.  We get our videos pulled down so routinely that I don't even want to be on YouTube.  But what are we going to do?  What are you going to do?  Anything else?  There's still many, many stories that we didn't get to, but I think we should get to, we're  running out of time.  So I think we should get to our.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can I mention just one quick thing?  Yes, please do.  The Google Solve for X project.  Love it.  Which is wonderful.  A guy named Omri, and I forget his last name, Amir Dori, mispronounced the name horribly.  Go look it up.  He basically did a compiler.  He did a demonstration of what will happen when we have a compiler for DNA.  Right.  And it's really quite wonderful.  It's mind-blowing.  We're going to get him on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He actually is a fan.  He was in the studio with his son.  I didn't even notice.  Because I, you know, this is kind of like Ted Talks that Google does.  It's called WeSolve4X.com.  And Omri's right here.  Synthetic Life Toolkits, if you want to follow that.  And we will, we're going to try to get him on to a triangulation, I think, probably sometimes.  Oh, wow.  Okay, good.  Yeah, it's very cool.  It looks really interesting.  And I think that's the way we were talking about this same site earlier, because there's  also a talk here about spray-on antennas that would change everything, so, which we can't  figure out.  Is it a hoax?  What?  No, I've seen that before.  It doesn't seem possible, but this guy says...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The same as spray-on, the notion of spray-on solar cells.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  So you could spray on a wall and a cell site could be the wall.  And they're much more efficient because they're nanocapacitors.  I don't know.  We're going to try to get the guy on our ham nation, because these guys, if anything, know  a lot about antennas.  But that's enough of that.  Enough about that.  Let's get our Tip of the Week from Ms. Jean Tripani.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tip of the Week this week is a Google image search tip.  It only works in Chrome.  It's really cool, though, and you kind of have to, you have to try it to see what I'm  talking about.  So if you go to images.google.com in Chrome and you search for images, say you search  for exotic fruit, you get results back.  Say you see something that you want to see an image that you want to know more about.  You click and drag it to the top of the page.  There'll be a little drop area that'll say drop image here.  You drop the image there, then it runs a search by image.  So it'll tell you what the image is and give you just regular search results about it.  So if you ever get an image back in search results and you're like, who is that or what  is that?  Just click and drag up near the search box and it'll run another search based on that  image.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Didn't they do that before where you could just drag an image from your desktop over?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, right.  So you could do it from your desktop and now you can do it from the search results itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if you drag a picture of Leo the Port, will it tell you Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's a good question.  Let me do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They don't face recognition, but they will give you another image.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If they find that image, they'll give you the caption for it, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is a picture of me.  Oops.  Drop image here.  And then what does it do?  It says, yeah, best guess for this image, Le Port.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's doing face recognition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it will show you the pages that contain that matching image.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think it's doing face recognition.  I think it's using that, looking at the page that has that image.  I think if you take a picture of someone non-famous, it won't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, non-famous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's got to be somewhat fair that it's got to have images like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So all of these are captioned with my name in some way or the other.  So of course it's going to...  No, see, it didn't find anything here.  So it's not that smart.  Interesting.  Isn't that interesting?  Yeah, it is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because there are sometimes when you do an image search and you got that one weird image,  you're like, what the heck is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I searched for similar images and now it's a bunch of people waving with their hands.  It's a jazz hands search.  And guitars.  Yeah, everybody should do a jazz hands search.  Fun with Google image search, ladies and gentlemen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is fun.  I'm actually using DuckDuckGo.  I've stuck with it since it changed last week for my regular web search, but I use Google  still for images, maps.  And so this was helpful.  DuckDuckGo just hit their first day, 1 million searches.  It's pretty good.  There have been a few searches where I have missed Google and I've had to adjust my search  terms and I missed one box.  But I'm sticking with it for just a little bit longer to see if I can truly not use Google  search on a regular basis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You saw that Google is now blocking Scroogle, saying it's over-searching.  They think it's a bot.  This worries me that search services that use Google and massage it perhaps to make  it anonymous are going to get this kind of treatment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hate to be the Google defender, but at some point you can say you're using our service  and taking it away from our revenue whole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's basically what Scroogle does.  It strips out the ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But DuckDuckGo uses a few different services.  You could argue that it generates signals from lots of different engines, kind of in  the same way that Google generates signals from web pages or social search.  But I do see where you're coming from, Jeff, at the point at which it's like, hey, you're  just showing our search results without...  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Scroogle, I think, is a clear case of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can even say we're scraping Google.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We'll think just changing it to a browser plugin instead.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Everybody would be happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff, your number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  I'm going to do it.  My friends, you were all so wonderful last week with the Economist debate.  Yes.  Did we win?  Well, it's not over yet.  That's the point.  We took it from 37% in moments to 70% by the time we were off the air.  Well, it slipped, folks.  It went to 72, and now it's back to 69.  So, my friends, Economist.com is a debater debate, and you know the side that I'm on  is in favor of the motion, and I'm not trying to push this.  So, the funny thing was, my bet and war in this case, Andrew Keene, did try to game...  I would have done this if he didn't do it first, but he did it first on Twitter.  He tried to game it and try to get people to do this, and so I thought, well, hell, I'll  do it, and I just have more friends than he does because I'm more public and because Leo  Leporte knows me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, Jeff, you're winning 69 to 31.  What is exactly you would like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want 75%.  I want to kill him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't want merely to injure him.  No, I want to kill him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to destroy him.  And in the second of the three statements, I gave credit to all of you wonderful twiggers  at the end for doing this with some amusement.  So, I thank you for that.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Everybody should vote.  Vote yes.  Early vote often.  These two in favor of the motion.  And even if you voted for Andrew, you can change your vote, which would make Jeff even  happier.  Oh, that would.  That would.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That would hurt him more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thermonuclear war.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  God, you're worse than Steve Jobs.  Holy cow.  Holy cow.  And did you want to do the Angry Birds number as well?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just because music is missed.  Given that we've got Angry Birds behind Kevin Marks, they've been battling it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, I was thinking as a Howard Stern fan, I thought Mary Anne from Brooklyn was  on the phone.  But that's the reference only that Howard Stern fans will get.  And that Fred was hitting the button in the in Twitch Studio.  So, Angry Birds, now that it's on Facebook, they're saying their goal is to get one billion  players.  One billion.  Which is, you know, if you go to Clay Shirky's cognitive surplus, think of all the wonderful  things that we could do for society if we weren't doing this.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How can we embed the world's problems into Angry Birds?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They should be doing some sort of calculation, some sort of solving of something.  We're killing them.  Tell me if I've done this before.  Have I talked about Locale before on this show, the Android app Locale?  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  It's not a diet.  It's Locale with an E at the end of it.  This is something that the iPhone does not do.  This is actually a good example of how I think a more liberal permissions structure benefits  folks on the iPhone.  This is a program.  Well, I'll show you.  I'll set it up.  It's a free download.  L-O-C-A-L-E.  We're getting over the shoulder shy here in a second.  Yeah, there's a little issue here with our Wi-Fi.

Transcript:  One second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hurrying.  So, the idea is you can add situations.  I'm going to title this work because I'm going to make this be a geographic situation.  But the situation can be a battery level, a contact name, a location, orientation or  time.  I'll use location.  It'll look up where I am.  There we go.  I can say here I can narrow it down or I can increase.  I can narrow the radius or I can increase the radius of the thing down to 100 meters.  I'm going to make it 100 meters.  I am at work.  Now I can have some settings.  One of these is fantastic and I'd love to see this in to-do text.  Astrid, which is a to-do manager.  Well, if you have a list, for instance, I could say I could have an Astrid list that  is stuff I have to do when I'm at work.  I can add that and then I can say every hour notify me while I'm at work that I should  do this list.  So now whenever I'm at work, I've got this to do.  I can have other settings as well.  Brightness, ringtone.  So I can have a different ringtone for home, work, driving around, screen, timeout, volume,  wallpaper and Wi-Fi.  I'd love to see more settings in here but these are the ones that are exposed to the  developer.  The most useful one is the Astrid.  But for instance, you could say, hey, when I'm at work, I really, and I do do this, I  want the ringtone to be silent so that the phone doesn't ring while I'm on the air.  So you can add these settings.  You can have multiple locations.  You have a default location, which is if you are not anywhere in particular.  So if, for instance, you do change the ringtone to silent, as soon as you leave work, you  can have the ringtone be something like the well-tempered clavier.  And then so that would be the default ringtone except when you are at places where another  ringtone is specified.  You could have different, you know, you could turn off Wi-Fi but turn on Bluetooth as you  get in the car, things like that.  So this is a really great little program.  It's called Locale and I find it very useful.  It also supports something else I've talked about before called Scribble, which is, I  mentioned this, I think, on a previous show.  Scribble is that little app that lets me turn my sleep behavior, change my sleep behavior  whenever the phone is tilted.  It just says keep the screen on as long as Leo's handling the phone.  As soon as he puts it down, turn it off.  So Scribble is a handy little hack that was, that came up with, somebody came up with it  at a Google hack event.  You can also have Scribble settings modified by Locale so that, for instance, when I'm  driving, I turn off Scribble because sometimes the phone's, you know, tilted like this and  I don't want it, I do want the screen to go out.  So just very handy.  I'd love to see more applications for that.  And I don't think there's an analog for iOS, anything like that.  I think it's just very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's similar to Tasker for Android.  Tasker, same thing, exactly.  Yeah, but it looks, the interface looks a little nicer on Locale, I have to say, because  Tasker is kind of a maze of settings.  That's exactly the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love Tasker, same exact idea, but yeah, it's kind of overwhelming because Tasker can  do so much more.  So maybe that's what happened with Locale is they decided that they shouldn't make it  so complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the thing that I was worried about with these apps is like running an app like that  in the background that's constantly checking my location and changing settings, does that  drain the battery?  I mean, you're the one with six batteries, so I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I keep a battery at all times, believe me.  So yeah, you're absolutely right.  I mean, that's the real risk on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you can have it set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a new Locale, there's a new beta Locale that is more, that yes, is I think much better  with battery.  And I actually haven't noticed a lot of battery life lost.  You can tell when Locale is active because it does put something in the notification.  That's a good question.  Anytime you keep the GPS on, you've got a problem, but also Locale can turn off the GPS.  I think if you do use Locale, you should really set it up to maximize battery life, turn off  stuff and use it that way.  And I think the net will be a positive.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that's Locale.  You probably mentioned that all about Android, Eileen.  We talked about Tasker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tasker is cool too.  We haven't done Locale quite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I have both and I actually choose to use Locale more than I...  Locale looks nicer.  Fiddly, yeah.  Yeah, a lot of little...

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And it works great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's nice to have it.  So I have it set, for instance, when I go to the store, it pulls up my shopping list.  Yeah, that's sweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So cool.  That's really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Siri is supposed to do that, but Siri never...  That's diddly for me.  I'm frustrated because Siri is so great when it works that when it doesn't work, it's very frustrating.
