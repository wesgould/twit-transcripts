I can snap his hat like that.  Ow!  That hurt!  I'm going to take that off now, Jeff, just so you can breathe.  Also joining us, okay, so Jeff Jarvis is here.  He's from Boston.  But oh, and look, that's very nice of you.  Matt Cutts is also here.  He's got his special hat on.  I don't know what that is.  Looks like a corn shirt.  Oh, okay.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's actually a devil's.  It's a unicorn.  Devil horn.  It's a unicorn horn.  There you go.  Perfect.  Matt from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You are mythological, Matt.  Yes.  He fights the Google spam and has been on the show many times before.  And of course, Gina Trapani, who is the queen of the show and has her fez.  And she is wearing it now very happily.  Hello, everybody.  And thanks to Eileen, our producer.  We have Chipotle for all.  So I'm just going to...  Aren't you happy?  I wish I could just push this right down the food tube to you.  This is a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Has someone made the food tube yet?  What's with that?  Gina, you're the programmer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You're supposed to write it.  I don't know.  It's a hard work thing.  Why can't we push burritos over the wire?  Now I have to ask a question of the Chipotle experts.  So I believe this is what they call a burrito bowl.  Do you open it this way or that way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that way.  That way.  It's just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, foil on top.  It's now a tossed burrito bowl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a pineapple upside down burrito.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I mean, that's a legitimate question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Where are the bean juice?  You know, it's going to get all over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The bean juice in the avocado and the guacamole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, the guacamole is in a separate vial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, good. That's good.  And I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I shouldn't be eating this because, frankly, they don't advertise on this show.  Oh, they don't.  Real reason for us to support them in any way, shape or form.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I went through a competitive burrito place today.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Competitive burrito place are us.  So today, the 100th episode.  You know, I don't usually celebrate 100s because, frankly,  this show is going to go to the thousands.  We know that.  Of course, none of us will be here for it except maybe the young Gina Tripani.  Oh, yeah.  The kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I figure we only have to do 99 more sets of 100  before I hit my 10,000 hours and I'm actually good at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, that's good.  Well, you know, Gina wrote a great article.  I was just very flattered that you would even do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, you know, considering that I had no idea what I was doing when we started this,  I had to write up a little something.  I really learned a lot during the show.  And I so appreciate, Leo, you having me, you know,  inviting me into the Twit family and giving me a chance to blather live on screen,  which no one else has done before.  It was a big risk. I really appreciate it.  I've learned so much from both of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I was, you know, to be honest, when we talked about doing this show,  there were only the really it was it started, frankly, with.  How could we do a show with Gina?  What can we do that would get get Gina to be on our network?  And then I actually was I don't know, was it just Gina?  It might have been what can we do to get Gina and Jeff together on our network?  Because I wanted both of you.  So let's be honest here, really.  It is it is my great privilege to have you two on.  I want to say the both of you.  But to have Gina Trapani write an article on this is smarterware.org  lessons from 99 weeks of twig.  And I agree with all of these, actually, I'm kind of glad you codified these  because I knew them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's second nature to you, Leo, you don't  you've been doing it for so long that you don't even  you don't even realize how good you are.  No, that's not true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You have. But but but you say things like a live show is a better show.  You're right. Definitely.  And I don't know.  I didn't remember you accidentally saying blowjob, but, you know,  it is more fun, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's really fun.  And thanks to all the people who are in the chat room who come  and talk to us while we while we talk.  It's really cool to have an audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think that's actually the challenge that I want to take on in the new studio.  By the way, wait until you see it.  We've just started moving stuff in and it's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I saw your picture that you posted in the serary, but retweeted it.  It looks amazing. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, I we're it's like I'm kind of blown away at this point.  I didn't expect this.  But one of the things that I really want to focus on is how to get live  interaction upgraded, because we have this great chat room.  And it's wonderful.  But I'd love to have more interaction.  So that's one of the things I really want to deal with.  And we actually have some ideas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, one thing I've always wanted to try first.  I want to say something to like, you know, I want to I want to say thank you  to both of you for including me and my long winded blather in on the show.  I cannot tell you I'm a faker.  I'm a poser here by chance.  Oh, yeah. I am so no, no, no, it's true.  I don't know crap. You guys actually know stuff.  But I absolutely love being here.  And, you know, I tell people all the time that not only is  is Gina incredibly generous and brilliant and wonderful,  but the great thing about you, Leo, is that you have  the happy broadcast voice, but you are as nice as your voice.  And that says a lot.  And I can't tell you folks out there that the privilege it is  to be with these guys each week, it really truly is the highlight of my week.  I love doing it. It killed me not to be here last week.  And, you know, just being around Leo and watching Leo is amazing.  The best testament that I have is that even with my king sized ego,  when people have recognized me on the street in in Munich  and in California and in New York and all over.  And I'll think, oh, did you see me on TV?  Did you read my book? No, I see you on Twig.  Lovely. Say hi to Leo.  The power of Leo report is absolutely incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's true. First time I get recognized, too, is Twig.  And nothing to do with life hacker or books or anything.  It was Twig. It's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That is kind of amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, Leo, I also want to salute you because you really are  remaking all of media.  You are remaking and proving the Internet can be can support  the kinds of work you do.  And so I know I know I join with all Twiggers, Twitters  and other alliterative science to come.  That, you know, this is a tribute to you that you can make this work.  And thank you for including me.  And I know Gina believes the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I didn't believe any of it until I saw the new studio.  Now I'm starting to think maybe there is this thing does have some legs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe you've got something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Maybe there is something going on that I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, you know, on Leo on that, I've been trying to push broadcast people for years.  I could imagine a wall of Twiggers, right?  With with their chat or something going on underneath.  It gives you the chance to be kind of a maestro calling on people from video screens.  That's what I want to do. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We're really we have the technology now.  We didn't, you know, really, this is this is this little room that we're in.  And you've both been here, Matt, you've been here, too, right?  You kind of know how how tiny it is.  Oh, where did where did Mac go?  Did I push a button? Did I do something wrong?  Go ahead, man. I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Sorry if I'm a little loud. Yeah.  No, I screwed something up here.  No, I hadn't gotten to see the cottage, but I watched over on, I think, Giga  on the video of the new studio.  And it looks really amazing. Yeah, we're excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So but but the point being that this room was really kind of  never intended to do all the things we're doing in the new place.  So let us do this.  I have I and I want to thank Tony and Eileen, Tony Wang, who edits this show  and puts it out and Eileen Rivera, who produces the show.  They made a little video.  Would you guys like to just watch a little teeny weeny video?  Yes. Yeah.  I don't know what's on here. I haven't seen it.  They didn't warn me.  But they did. They did make it.  So I have to play it.  That's not the one.  OK, I looked at the wrong one.  For real, a blooper reel.  Yeah, really. Oh, twit 100, twig 100.  I see. OK, I see.  I played the wrong one.  It's OK, because I don't know if we have audio either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So as always, a lot of Eileen fixed you.  Yes, she fixed me.  I do that ever since you do that one of me once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Eileen fixed me. Let's see what happens here.  This is Twig, a brand new show this week in Google.  I'm Leo Laporte.  I couldn't be happier at the panel we've assembled for this first show.  We're just going to have the kind of core members, but in time, we'll we'll add  others, you know, on an ad hoc basis.  Matt Cutcher. First, let me introduce Gina Tripani.  Some of you know from Twit and of course, the founder of Lifehacker.  She's at SmarterWear.org and one of the smartest people I know.  Also, a developer who's written add on.  She has a great Gmail add on, better Gmail.  In fact, you have several Gmail add ons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep, yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So she knows Google and I presume is going to talk about Wave at some point,  because I want to know more about that.  Oh, yes. Also with us, a  both both Gina and and Jeff are authors, but Jeff's newest book is is kind of  apropos. What would Google do?  Jeff Jarvis, Buzz Machine.com.  So glad to have you on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Honored to be here, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I didn't realize you were audio the first time.  Not just Google the software, but Google the company, Google the trends, the stories.  And I hope we can get some tips as well from from Gina, especially on  using Google better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Who even puts a phone in the breast pocket?  Are there phones are for pockets at best.  I'll be on my own with myself and the entire drinking public.  I'd like to, you know,  congratulate you on the hundredth episode of this weekend.  Gin, a hundredth episode of this weekend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Grapes. Oh, it's me and Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I got small penis jokes, ignite airport meltdown.  And it goes blank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There you go. Congratulations to Leo, Gina and Jeff and the rest of the twig team on  one hundred episodes.  Gosh, you guys don't look a day over 99.  That's Mitch Wagner.  Still looking forward to catching you guys every week to hear the latest news about  Google Facebook.  He listens on a boombox.  Glee Chipotle and how to pronounce Gina's last name, which, by the way,  she married a congressman who was recently in the news would be Gina Weiner.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Thank you. Bye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So glad I'm recording this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, you're just a feat of engineering right here.  I mean, not to be a total Google fan girl.  I mean, I am already.  Sometimes I feel bad about being so far up one company's butt.  But but you know, this is a pretty good butt to be up because this is really amazing.  I mean, this is like a show title of engineering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have to tell you, I felt a little insensitive of you to have an 100th episode  without myself or Matt Cutts on it.  Are you invited, Matt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And greetings, Leo, Jeff and Gina.  And congratulations on your hundredth episode.  I've been impressed with how you guys have kept the topics fresh all this time.  But also how you've overcome your competition this month in Blackwell.  Who could forget this fortnight and cool this lunar cycle and being  which had a ton of marketing power behind it this weekend in Yandex,  this harvest season in Blacko, this Julian calendar and Wolfram Alpha,  which you all remember, got tons of press coverage and this CPU cycle  and Duck Duck Go, which actually does have pretty cool keyboard shortcuts.  Anyways, congratulations and keep a great thing going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And pretty. Oh, it's kind of like a condom for Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It does work on Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's a Chrome extent.  You know, I really didn't plan to say that, and I'm kind of regretting what I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Leah, it's Chris, your old pal.  I just want to congratulate you on your thousandth show this week in Google.  I mean, I remember when I was this week in Alta Vista and this week in Gopher.  This week in Gopher was it was before its time, really.  And so I want to congratulate you for that.  And congratulations for this week in Yahoo, which became, you know,  this week in Google and has been like that.  I'm assuming you're looking to the future, though,  and thinking of this week in Blacko or whatever that one is.  Or the math one with Mathematica in it.  So be well.  And I hope you have a thousand more shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  From four hours ago, Google Android, a little bit open source,  quote, sort of like a partial circumcision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Congratulations, Leo, Gina and Jeff on the hundredth tweak this week in Glee.  I always enjoy the show. I was this week.  I'm occasionally lucky enough to join you on it.  But if not, I'll be starting along with it playing through my headphones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, Leo, Gina and Jeff.  Happy 100th episode of This Week in Google.  Without which a couple of you told me wouldn't be able to do any other shows  on the network. You carry the rest of us on your backs.  And for that, thank you.  And also the great content.  You cover things like Chipotle and Glee.  All right. Facebook. Yeah.  And and Google. No, thank you so much for doing a great show.  Thanks for letting me host a couple of times.  Here's to a hundred more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Tom, Eric. That's the bow. Oh, dear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, my goodness.  I shouldn't be. There's Chipotle everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love why I love Twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I had no idea you guys were dancing that all time behind me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, we love so cool.  Eileen, thank you so much for putting that together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Didn't she do a great job? And Tony Wang, too.  Thank you. Really, really very grateful.  That was really fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the Bona and Purdy and Mitch. Oh, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So Kevin Mark's writing, I don't I'm trying to think is he is it?  I think it's a mobile bike repair company that he runs now.  I don't know.  Maybe Salesforce didn't work out and he's moved on.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The chat room says he was in a tram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  A tram of what? I mean, there's a bunch of that's the strangest thing I've ever seen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How California to be have more bikes than people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Anyway, it's fun.  I mean, this thank you, Eileen, for doing that.  Thank you, Eileen.  And she brought me more Chipotle because now that we've cleaned up the last spill,  I think it's time to get more Chipotle on the floor.  Wow, Matt, thanks for putting up with that.  And when you see.  I love Twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So as long as the love fest is going on, I just want to say thank you so much for doing it.  I think I discovered Twig around episode four or five,  and I think I have probably exercised to every single episode of Twig.  Like you guys just keep the company.  So and there's literally a group of people who fight spam manually,  like literally above me, and they installed a projector.  So every Wednesday, they could spam fight while they watched Twig.  So it's just you guys provide such an awesome, amazing service and everybody loves it.  So thanks very much.  I'm not sure I want to know that that that that the Googlers are watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hi, Googlers.  I guarantee they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I've been up in the office when they get the projector going.  And they'll watch the first 15 minutes and then they'll be spam fighting as they're  listening and watching.  And it's a lot of fun.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And of course, to our great audience, because we have a wonderful audience.  This show is Tom Merritt.  It wasn't far off when he said this show does support the network.  It's one of the one of the handfuls of shows that really make a lot of money.  And so I shouldn't have said that.  Now I have to pay these guys.  And well, we'll get you some burritos, Leo, and burritos.  No, it's it's it's been a very successful show out of the box.  And I to that, I credit not merely the subject matter, but really more.  Gina and Jeff, because I think it's a very successful show.  And Jeff, because one of the things we've learned doing these shows is it's not so  much the subject matter.  It's the people who do the shows that make the shows work.  And and you guys have full of deep thoughts and funny and it's just great.  So thank you all for being here.  Thank you for watching everybody at home.  And now we'll get to the news.  Group hug. Group hug.  We love you.  Google is now at one billion uniques a month.  I can't think there's no other website anywhere near that one billion.  Did you celebrate that, Matt?  Was there was there a cake?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Not really. So we tend not to worry as much about what the metrics companies say,  because different metric companies will say different things at different times.  But in the early days, we would have a little crayon graph and we would actually  draw the traffic.  And then when people came to visit, like when Al Gore came to visit, he would sign  on the day that he came to visit.  So good. I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Did I know it was on a whiteboard or he put it on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was almost like butcher paper.  It's like 48 inches and scrolled a long way.  And it's still somewhere around the Googleplex hidden.  I don't know exactly where it is.  I think the infinite scroll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, the obvious joke here is that is the Gore sign.  You're welcome. But I won't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I this is what I created the Internet for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, that billion is only just to the Google dot com domains.  Right. And if you if you're watching YouTube videos elsewhere,  if you're seeing adsense elsewhere, none of that counts. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I guess not. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And there's analytics, there's Google toolbar, there's Google public DNS.  So there is a lot of data that that flows through.  But what I loved about the crayon graph is we kept having to scale it down  by a factor of 10 over and over again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Should have made it logarithmic in the first place.  You wouldn't have had to worry about that.  But who knew?  So this is this is from Comscore, which I think is absolutely considered  a reliable source, I think. I don't I don't know.  But over the past year, according to Comscore, Google's unique visitors  have increased 8.4 percent to just over one billion a month.  That is number one.  Microsoft, number two, with nine hundred five million unique visitors.  They were up 15 percent.  Now, this where does that come from?  I don't think I think I presume it's well, I don't know.  I presume it's Microsoft dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I don't go to Microsoft sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If you OK, this is why they have such a big number.  If you install Windows and you never change the defaults,  your homepage is Microsoft dot com.  And I would guess that 90 percent of Windows users, maybe not that high.  But it's a large number of Windows users.  There's that's when they open their Internet Explorer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, look, there's Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Facebook up 30 percent, but still only 714 million uniques.  Wait a minute.  Seven hundred fourteen million uniques a month.  Facebook, Facebook. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they have not updated their you your their member numbers since 500 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But we now know it's well over 700.  It would have to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that doesn't visitors wouldn't necessarily be members.  Who visits Facebook?  I think now more than you think because of fan pages and that kind of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh. Oh, well, that's interesting.  OK, I'd love to know that Yahoo.  And by the way, we were this week in Yahoo for many years.  Six hundred eighty nine million up 10 percent up up up 10 percent.  Comscore Internet is growing.  Yeah, that's for sure.  So this is not the way analytics works or quantcast works.  This is a global measurement panel.  Yeah. So it's a little weird.  Nielsen ratings. Yeah.  But it's two million users.  It's a large it's a very large sample site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See, Google does know these numbers.  And I like the early days of Google when they shared numbers  like how many sites and how many users should know exactly right.  Of course they do.  And I never understood.  I'm not going to make Matt answer this question, but never understood why they  stopped. I think the transparency about that was great.  And I wish they'd continue with that.  You know, at some point, Facebook updates its stats to some level.  Well, all the sites do to some some extent.  YouTube tells us how many minutes of video we're on every nanosecond.  But I wish that Google would give us kind of this  because it knows the scale of the Internet better than anybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that scary?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's exactly why I'm sure it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It would be a little scary because everyone would know that Google  is the only one who really has that number.  And it's going to be an astronomical number.  It's bigger than a billion.  It's bigger than a billion.  Sorry to say creep, Jeff, but it might, you know, I don't know.  Just a guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, I think you hit the nail on the head, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, and I think that I think Marissa Meyer has released  at least a couple stats.  One was that we get over a billion searches a day, which, you know,  that's a pretty nice big number to reveal.  And then I think she had said something like we get over a billion users  each week coming to Google.  So, you know, it depends on how you count people, whether you count by cookies  or whether you try to do some other methodology.  But, you know, if you think about it, a large fraction of the Internet  likes to search on Google.  So that's not a huge surprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, but Unix is this is kind of a special number.  For instance, we say 714 million Unix.  That means in just for people who don't know, I'm sure everybody does.  But that's individuals.  That's like me plus seven hundred thirteen million nine hundred  and ninety nine thousand nine hundred and ninety nine other people.  I mean, it's it's individual.  So when you say 714 million for Facebook or a billion for Google, I mean,  how many Internet users are there total?  Not a few billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So to the usual number, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So that means half of everybody who has access to the Internet  uses Google at least once a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That doesn't surprise me. That's the creep.  Oh, not at all. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And it's not creepy. It's just merely that it's I think.  My guess is you're absolutely right, Gina.  And it's not so much even just creepiness. It's.  Google rightly, I think, doesn't want people to think about  how much power they wield because because that's scary to people.  Why are you laughing? Right side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm laughing because on the bright side, if anybody doesn't like Google,  there's no lock in. Right.  It you can leave any any time you want.  You can go to Bing, you can go to Blacko, you can go to DuckDuckGo  or any other sites mentioned in that promo.  So the only reason people come back to Google is if we have good results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Is there really a website search engine DuckDuckGo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. In fact, yes, they made a big deal this week about how they don't do  personalization because there was a book called The Filter Bubble.  And they're saying you won't get the filter bubble when you're at DuckDuckGo.  You know, I support that it's actually a one person search engine.  It's one guy, Gabriel Weinberg.  And, you know, I love it when people try different search engines  and see what works for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So how should I test this?  I guess I'll do it.  Gina Trapani. Yeah, we'll do this.  We'll do the ego search, but we won't do me.  We'll do Gina. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm afraid that my my dabbling in the porn websites back in a day  is going to be revealed at DuckDuckGo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, look, I like this.  They've got the Wikipedia.  They've got the picture.  They've got an interesting ad.  Find Gina Trapani.  Locate Gina Trapani one minute to search public records.  Now, I don't like that.  Oh, goody. I mean, what?  You know, OK, yeah, you don't track me,  but then you have an ad for somebody who does.  That's good.  Yeah, official site.  That's kind of interesting. The badge here.  Lifehacker. They knew that. Work smart at fast company.  Twitter. SmarterWear.  This is pretty canonical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not too bad. I mean, it lists my name site,  which is kind of my official site first.  And that's and I think Wikipedia is also a really good first result as well.  These are good results for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But would you rather they had SmarterWear than GinaTrapani.org?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, I want I want my name site, GinaTrapani.org for sure.  And then I mean, I'd want SmarterWear next because I write on that more.  I haven't I haven't done any stuff at Fast Company in a while or Lifehacker, really.  But for the most part, these are pretty good results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Kind of like this. If you misspell my name, it says it gives the Leo LaPorte results  and says, did you mean Leo LaPorte? So that's Googley.  Then it's got the Wikipedia entry official site, TechTV, people from Sonoma County.  Search Leo for free and find email address.  That's PeopleSmart. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wonder how they determine this official site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I think it's Wikipedia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  OK, OK, OK.  Because Wikipedia will often have the phrase that says official site or official  home page. So my guess is, is Gabriel's just sort of mining Wikipedia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So how would you you make a really good point, Matt, which is there's no barrier.  Well, there is a barrier to entry, but there's no barrier to changing.  To exit. To exit. Yeah. Right.  That's kind of interesting, though, that one guy could compete with Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, he does. Historically, he also used Yahoo!  Boss and Bing as sort of fallbacks or, you know, extra stuff.  So it wasn't, you know, 100 percent entirely his corpus.  But, you know, it is the case that think about Bleco.  That's something like 27 people, you know, and they're able to crawl several billion documents.  So, you know, the web is out there for people who want to index it  and try to make a better search engine.  And I'm personally glad that people haven't given up on trying to do better than Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Really? You feel like that that challenge is good for Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Competition's good. It keeps us on our toes.  Nobody wants to be complacent.  So, you know, DuckDuckGo takes a little more of a privacy centric.  So we won't personalize and we'll anonymize our logs, you know,  and and Bleco is more towards slash tags.  So they're going to remove all the spam by hand and that sort of thing.  And, you know, everybody's got a different philosophy and and let users  pick what they like the best.  And then if if something starts to thrive, then, you know, that's good for everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, then you'll be really happy about this story.  Bing grabs a market share from Google.  Compete and I don't compete.  I don't actually pay much attention to compared to, say, quantcast or comscore,  because as last time I checked, they were very much  relying on the on the tool and ask toolbar. Right.  They found that Google has lost close to 16 percent of its market share.  No, I don't.  I don't buy this.  And Microsoft grew by 75 percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, plus last I checked, Google was was in the 60s, the mid 60s in the U.S. anyway.  And that says that was down from like 70 year.  Yeah. 33 in here. Yeah.  So one of those is wrong. I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm trying to remember, but at least last time I checked, compete, it was not using.  I mean, the analytics were based on a toolbar.  I can't. Was it the ask toolbar?  I can't remember. Couldn't be the ask toolbar anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But normally metrics sort of break down into three broad genres.  One is consumer panels.  So people install software to watch them.  And sometimes those users aren't quite as savvy because they'll do things like  when the sweepstakes, if you install this software to watch you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's comscore. That's how comscore works. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. And then there's often people who who buy ISP traffic.  So they actually watch where people go according to the ISP's.  And then the third type is looking at where people land in terms of refer stats.  So stat counter and net applications, those kind of people look at,  you know, install something like Google Analytics and then see how often people  show up via Bing or Google or Blacko or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Here's a here's somebody aggregated.  Comscore said Google market share grew.  Yahoo held steady, Bing held steady, Ask dropped.  Compete said Google dropped, Bing dropped, Yahoo grew, Ask dropped, AOL held steady.  Hitwise says,  well, I don't know if it's growth or not, but Google's 67 percent being 13.8.  So actually, it looks like based on  on the aggregate, the comps that to compete is kind of not is out of the  out of the range of the rest of them.  So that seems like a little bit of a strange result.  Yeah, you don't have to say anything, Matt, you can just nod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It depends. It depends on what you, you know, yes, there's lies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You don't need to say anything.  You don't need to say anything.  I'm sorry, Eileen.  Well, I don't know why they're hearing a ringing sound.  I'm not hearing. Are you hearing a ringing sound?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm getting a little bit of a high pitched.  You are. Yeah.  Do you guys hear it? Or not right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, well, we'll we'll fix that post.  I get that in my head all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's tonight is there something in the studio?  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now I know why I'm hearing voices in my head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They're you. That's us. That's why we're talking.  There is we should say that we have changed the the studio operation preparatory.  It's as John Salinina, our studio engineer, says  the beginning of the end, we've started to tear pieces and bits out of  the cottage to put them in the new place.  And the audio, the normally very high quality audio system we use from Tello.  Is not here anymore.  And so you may get a little more noise and weirdness.  I think that would only be on the live stream.  I think our audio is fine on the on the downloads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When when do we start producing from over there?  Hell of a no. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm assuming that things will go horribly wrong.  And Gina, you're a programmer.  That's a safe bet, right? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And for failure. Yes. Yes.  Expect failure and then you'll be surprised when there isn't happily surprised.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I'm saying roughly a month.  I think our first show will probably be either July 17th or 24th from there.  Because our first I want to make our first show be this week in tech, the big shoe.  Not that this isn't a big show.  No, it's the granddaddy. Yeah.  And so I think and it also it happens to work well with our schedule.  I can walk. I have an hour between shows.  I can walk down and we can do that.  But whether it'll be the it could even be the 10th.  Hey, hey, who knows?  It could be the it could be the third. I don't know.  So it'll be the third, the 10th, the 17th, the 24th or sometime in September.  The problem is, you know, we've got everything. Everything's over there.  And we've got 30 cameras and we've got all the lights and  we're building the camera mounts.  Those aren't quite done yet, but those will be happening pretty fast.  But then you have to kind of set them up and see if it works.  And I'm just assuming that it will not work.  It's like a program, right, Gina?  You write the code, then you run it and then you debug.  And we're we we don't know how much debugging will be involved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, that is always the X factor, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We're assuming.  Well, and this is the case where we're, in fact,  writing the entire program before running it even once.  It's kind of a mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's talk about building small modules and unit tests around them.  Unit testing, unit testing for your studio setup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Is there anything is there anything like unit testing and analog hardware?  I guess there is.  That's why we took the audio out of here,  because we want to get it over there and get it set up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So I guess it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Google to America.  This is O'Malek's headline.  Get online.  Love the gig a bit in Kansas City.  I think didn't they didn't Google recently announced  that not only do it in Kansas City, they're going to do it.  Where else was it next door? Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, Kansas City, Kansas and then Kansas City, Missouri, I think.  Yeah, that's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Poor old Topeka.  Too bad.  Friday morning.  Domain Name Wire, which is a blog that monitors domain name  registrations, reported that Google has registered more than 100 domains  like Alaska, get online, get Alaska online, get online Alaska.  For other states to Alabama, Colorado, North Dakota, South Dakota, Arkansas,  Arizona and so on, it even grabbed Get America Online.com.  Might have been a little mistake there.  I don't know if they'll be able to use that one  or if they want to use that one, to be honest.  What is going on? Matt Cutts, do you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This one I don't know about.  I have no idea whether somebody's planning fiber related stuff.  I'm doing a little who is action on my own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's kind of interesting idea that maybe Google might be.  I would I would lobby for this.  I lobbied for when the 700 megahertz spectrum was available.  I want to Google to buy it and kind of do open mobile access.  I would love to see Google get in the Internet provider game  and really stick it to these companies like Comcast and Time Warner  and all the other ones who are just doing such a lousy job.  There's one problem, you know, what's the horizon?  Horizon. Why is that a problem?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because that's the that's the devil's deal.  I mean, not not to beat up on Google, but that's the devil's deal is that  I think Google was going to be the highest quality voice for the open Internet.  But it has to do business with evil telcos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Because Verizon, well, they did that that rise in AT&T,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  but they did that Internet, Shmitter, that deal. Right.  Back to that.  You know, I saw Yochai Binkler in  at Paris and he got all upset.  He was finally going to get his iPhone on Verizon.  And then the deal was done.  So now he has an Android. Oh, interesting.  I mean, sorry, he's going to get an Android and got an iPhone instead.  Really? Yeah.  So I think that's that's the problem is, yes, I Google was was to my mind  the best hope for the neutral Internet because it could provide  that kind of competition.  The next fear, you know, the next thing Google has fought for,  which will help us is is white space becoming, as they say, Wi-Fi on steroids.  That would be exactly what you're saying.  That'd be great. That would create competition, competition.  And I think we'll solve this.  But I've heard rumors, rumblings.  People say it wouldn't happen, but the Congress is going to go after that  and stop the white space.  And I'm going to sell that bandwidth instead of making it a license.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's a shame. That would be that's too bad.  That would be a crime. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it seems like a lot of the time you've got, you know,  something like Chrome was really useful because it showed how much better  a web browsing experience could be.  And now you see things like Firefox releasing faster  and IE9 is a lot more standards compliant and and, you know,  browsers as a whole are a lot faster.  So one way you could view the Kansas City fiber deployment is just trying out  some of these ideas to make, you know, to test whether it is possible  to deploy for less improvement by example. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it was one town in California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Isn't there a town in California?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  In fact, it's our Internet service provider, SonicNet, that's doing it.  Yeah, it's Sebastopol, where we're oddly enough, O'Reilly and Foo Camp are.  Coincidence, I don't know.  But they're going to it's not a lot of homes.  It's several hundred homes are going to wire for gigabit.  Sonic is actually, I think, doing the Google running the Google  back end in Kansas as well.  So they have a lot of experience with gigabit  installs, and they're actually we use a number of Internet service providers  here for bandwidth. We have four or five bandwidth providers.  But going into the new place, we're going to we've got to.  I love this. The 35 megabit pipe from SonicNet.  So I'm pretty excited that we couldn't get fiber.  There's no fiber in there, but we but it's the fastest.  Yeah, it's just, you know, it's Petaluma for crying out loud.  We're lucky it's not chicken Internet.  But at least we got copper.  We got copper in there. Oh, we don't.  Oh, let me tell you, because we wanted to have you.  We want to have two providers for redundancy.  So we wanted to have cable modems in here from Comcast.  And it turns out that the building is so old, it's not wired for cable.  In order to get cable in there, we've got to go through the hairdressing salon

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  next door and they don't want us to do it.  No, no, no, those Comcast people are messy.  They leave footprints in the hall.  I don't know. Why wouldn't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, didn't Sebastian Polen decide not to do free Wi-Fi  because people were worried it might cause cancer or something like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, that's right. Oh, that's so California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They'd radiate our heads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, we're very Earth.  Sebastopol is where the hippies have went.  When they left Santa Cruz, they all went to Sebastopol.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Led by Tim. Yeah, by Tim.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Tim is a hippie. I love you, Tim.  And credit to Google for doing this.  As you know, Google keeps a database of malware sites,  and you can check the database in your Webmaster Tools,  but they'll also put a warning up if there's malware on a site.  First of all, I'm going to make a culpa here.  Our site was hacked.  I think it was just our chat page.  We have...  And I don't know all the details yet because our system admins are working on it,  but the way we learned is a number of our chatters said,  hey, I'm getting a Google, a warning in Chrome that this site has malware on it.  And at first I said, that's got to be a false positive,  because remember, there was a false positive incident some months ago.  And I said, our site would never be hacked.  First of all, there ain't nothing on there.  Well, it turns out there was a line injected into our jQuery library  on one of the three servers that runs the chat,  and Bear found it, Bear removed it,  and we were looking at trying to figure out how it got stuck in there.  But thank you, Google.  They're doing the same thing with out of date WordPress installs.  Apparently, there are 47 million WordPress deployments out there,  and many of them running old versions.  You know about this, old versions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Very old.  In fact, the WordPress guys were really nice.  They made an API where you could check which versions were insecure versus the latest.  And unfortunately, the reason why a lot of...  Well, of course, WordPress is updated for security, for features,  but if you look at the older versions of WordPress,  pretty much every single one of them is insecure.  So at first we were like, well, we don't want to pick on WordPress.  You guys do a fantastic job in general.  And they were actually saying they only want to support  the last two or three versions of WordPress, so they want people to upgrade.  So if you remember, a little while ago, I said there are people right above me  who listen and watch Twig while I work.  Actually, it was one of those guys that made this message.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, a word to them. Thank you.  I actually run WordPress.  Part of the reason I still run WordPress instead of Squarespace  is on my personal blog, it's because exactly this reason.  And I have to say, you log into WordPress and almost it seems like every week  there's a security update. Yeah.  I'm actually that speaks to your blog post and you and you and  Mitch were having a little back and forth on this, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We were. We were. I loved it. Why not?  Tumblr. Tumblr. Yeah. Tumblr is a really cool  blogging kind of social social network.  And so my blog was going kind of fallow.  I wasn't writing as much. WordPress was out of date.  My plugins were out of date.  I wanted to do things that I couldn't and I, you know, I need to spend time hacking.  So I kind of had this moment.  I was like, I'm just going to switch to something that's super easy  so I can just write.  And I and I looked at Tumblr to do it.  And I really I kind of realize that there's this, you know,  there's a difference between social networks and publishing tools.  And Tumblr really kind of straddles that fence.  But, you know, it's not easy to import your your existing content at Tumblr,  which is something that's really important to me.  I mean, I've been blogging for 10 years and different sites,  and I have forgotten more than I know.  Like I use Google is like my is my memory now.  Like I Google stuff and I find posts that I wrote on Lifehacker in 2006.  You know, I was like, oh, yeah, I remember I did know how to do that.  And this is how to do it.  So so archiving and permalinks is really important to me.  And so I decided not not not to use Tumblr.  You know, it's hard. I use WordPress and, you know, the updating is an issue.  And I've had to do a kind of, you know, I'm a programmer.  So, of course, I want everything to be exactly what I want.  So, of course, I was, you know, inside WordPress hacking.  It's, you know, the PHP innards.  And really, I might I might just evaluate Squarespace.  It sounds like Squarespace is kind of gives you that the luxury of being hosted  and not having to deal with updates, but also is a true logging tool  and that there's permalinks and import and export.  And you can kind of retain your permalinks over time.  I just want to be able to have my own domain and move my content,  you know, from provider to provider system to system without.  I am with you 100 percent, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's why I still run a word.  That's the other reason I still run a word plus blog is I got scared from Twitter,  from Twitter. I had pounce.  I had all these sites where I'd been putting content up.  And my last blog was on Vox, which I loved.  What a great platform Vox was.  Yeah. But then they went away.  And so I had to export everything that was it's run by the six apart people,  the movable type people, and they decided not to do it anymore.  And that was a wake up call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the thing. I just I think I've come this place where it's like social networks  like Facebook and Twitter and Tumblr and Vox to some degree are like really good  ways to share content and get it to your friends instantly and immediately.  But I don't know that they're the best place to park content that you want to keep,  you know, and then you want to refer to, you know, like, are you doing this for now  or for later? So I tweet stuff all the time.  Throw away stuff that, you know, I know is going to kind of fall away into  into Twitter's archives.  I mean, I'm working on think up, obviously, to sort of combat this problem.  But that's not a solution for everyone.  But if I want to write down an idea and articulate an idea,  that's important that I'm going to want to refer to back to later,  which I do all the time with my archives over the past 10 years of blogging.  I'm going to put it on my blog.  So I just kind of buckle down and decided to get my blog to a place  where I want it to be and just, you know, put in the work to future proof  my work, because that's it's my work.  And I feel like what you the things you put out on the Internet,  you know, things that you write and things that you say, like,  that's who you are online.  And that's that's just important to me.  And I don't trust that.  I don't trust a social network that doesn't treat your content the same way.  I agree to put it there.  But, you know, Mitch's argument was who was a really good one,  which is the social networks gave you the audience instantly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's where the people are. So you do quick.  And so I exactly this is a 2007.  I had this epiphany and I still use Tumblr.  I have a Tumblr blog. You do, too, Gina.  Yeah, I do. I do. But it's for it's for ephemera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's for hey, look at this cute thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't consider anything that I put on Tumblr to be permanent.  I realize that at any moment it could go away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's this is not nothing against Tumblr specifically.  It's just in general, right.  Any kind of hosted hosted service that doesn't have easy import and export  that you can't, you know, use Google's terms, liberate, you know,  liberate your data from. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Fitz was Fitz was at Foo Camp and he's just effective.  I think they bought a brick, an eight by eight brick  with the data liberation front logo on it.  I love that guy. Isn't that awesome? Yeah.  So that's exactly the right attitude.  Nevertheless, there is something to hosting your own content.  Now, let's be honest.  You could screw up a lot.  You're more likely to screw up your own.  Maybe not you, Gina.  Me, I'm much more likely to screw up my database and lose everything  on a server that I'm running.  Definitely. And Tumblr is right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But, you know, like a service like Squarespace, from what I understand,  a WordPress dot com, there's a host of services, but you can map your domain  to them, you can import your data and then you can export your data.  It's sort of like I use Gmail, right.  But I I know that I can.  But I use Gmail for my domain.  So my email address is never going to change.  I could I could switch providers and get my mail out of Gmail and move  if I wanted to.  And that's that's kind of how I evaluate a service, whether or not it's  it's worth using.  Can I can I move in the future if I wanted to or needed to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Isn't this the model where Backupify is been going  that that it just becomes a way to back up all your stuff someplace?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I love Backupify and I'm and I'm using it.  I was you know, I started using it when they were free  and they said it'll be free forever.  So I back up everything through Backupify.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But and I love Backupify.  I use it, too.  But it really seems like you want the convenience of the cloud.  But you really want to be able to get your own data easily and not just like  make it possible to export your data, but like, right.  Have a have a copy by default.  So if some things are down, you're not in not host.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, right, right.  I mean, Matt, you're that you're the search search engine guy.  So I've been blogging for years and years, and I've got thousands  of thousands of posts with permalinks on Lifehacker and on my on my personal site.  And over time, I like to build an idea.  So I'll have kind of a little bit of an idea.  And then a year later, write about it and link back.  You do the same on your blog.  And, you know, I don't write for SEO, but I do.  I think that a post kind of becomes more important over time  as it ages and more conversations kind of surround it.  And that permalink and having that sort of that that time  kind of in the index and out on the Internet really, you know,  make something become something more than it is.  And that can never really happen with a tweet or with a Facebook status update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What about this compromise?  Because this is the compromise I ended up using.  So I host my own blog, but I use JS Kit Echo or you could use discuss.  I use a and this scares me a little bit hosted commenting system.  So the hosts, the comments are on their system, but they have  they're pulling from Twitter, Facebook.  They use Facebook Connect, Twitter.  It's easier for me.  I don't have to know all those technologies, although they're not that hard to implement  so that I have now my canonical post, which I own permalink permanent  and then a very social  commenting system, which pulls from everywhere, not just from my own blog.  Is that a good compromise?  Maybe Mitch might accept that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think that interplay between publishing content in a place,  but then also broadcasting out these pieces, which which make sharing really easy  is really the compromise.  And, you know, Tumblr does that really well.  You can write a long blog post on Tumblr and then it gets shared instantly.  And it kind of removes that step of having to do the broadcasting part.  I just I just don't want to keep my keep my stuff there until they have an export tool.  And I heard from a Tumblr engineer, they're building one.  And I feel bad picking on Tumblr.  I just happen to be sort of evaluating it as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They're the big guy right now.  I mean, they're rapidly doing really well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Didn't we see some report that there's more, what, page views than WordPress?  They're getting close. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Matt, you had something to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, just talking about client side comments.  You know, it's it's really tricky because comments are a bear.  I usually pre-moderate mine to keep spam out and to keep out, you know,  griefers and stuff like that.  And it's a real hassle if you have to approve every single comment yourself.  So I would prefer to go with, you know, the discuss or the or the  JS echo kind of stuff.  But since it runs on the client, you know, in JavaScript,  that's really hard for search engines to index.  And we're making progress.  We're not there yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But of course, you index some of the sources for it.  So you index Twitter and you index Facebook.  Oh, do you? What?  Actually, you probably don't index Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, we do get fan pages, so we don't get, you know, everything from Facebook.  But, you know, if a page is publicly visible, if it's not roboted out,  then we can crawl it.  So if you make your your Facebook page public, then it's possible.  We might see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I do make my Facebook page public, but not all my commenters do, obviously.  Like probably the majority don't.  Yeah, we're going to take a break.  This is actually a good time to do a Squarespace ad.  What do you think?  Just a coinkied ink.  But but it does raise an interesting issue.  If you are doing a website,  it makes sense if you're going to do a website to  do something that's robust, that you control the content on.  But at the same time, you kind of want to do a website that's easy,  because if you have to spend a lot of time maintaining it, that's a pain.  Squarespace actually, I think, does kind of cut down the middle perfectly on this.  First of all, it's hosted.  So, in fact, what you get with Squarespace.com is hosting  plus a content management system that's always up to date  because it's they're keeping it up to date.  It's their data.  You know, it's their database of the code.  So that's a nice thing.  In fact, they're about to go to Squarespace six.  And when that happens, it'll happen automatically.  You won't have to do anything about it.  But they give you full control of your data.  And this I think they were smart.  They were wise to understand that this is an issue for all of us.  So they have blog import and I should say export.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That keeps this is important.  This is what I was.  This is this would be like the Gmail of blogs, right?  This is what you have.  You have to be able to get data and get data out easily.  You're never trapped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And the the permalinks are preserved images, tags, text authors, even comments.  And they actually have a very nice commenting system are fully preserved.  All SEO is preserved.  Search is preserved.  That that means, you know, your Google index isn't going to change.  So I guess I mean, Matt, I'll defer to you if that's not the case.  But I think this is really a great solution for people who want the best of both worlds.  Hosting plus hosted software.  And boy, do they have some great tools, the iPhone, iPad app, the templates that aren't  templated, that just every site looks gorgeous.  Very easy posting from the web page as well.  Incredible stats information, integration of social media.  That's as simple as point and click.  They do the SEO automatically.  They do all the Google approved things like site maps to make it, you know, completely  scooglable.  I just I think Squarespace has it down.  Now, here's the deal.  You could try it free.  Everybody could do this.  Just go to squarespace.com.  Click the big green button.  You don't need a credit card or anything.  Just the name of your site, a password and your email address.  And you're there.  You're you're doing it for 15 days free.  You have full access to the entire Squarespace tool set, including the import export.  Then if you decide to sign up, here's the pricing and you know, you can get it monthly,  but the longer you sign up for the lower the price and as little as $10 a month.  And if you use the offer code twig six, when you sign up to WIG, the number six, all one  word, when you sign up 30% off for the first three months.  So you get a really good discount for you to try it out.  I just think Squarespace is fantastic and I want you to give it a try.  Squarespace.com use the offer code twig six if you decide to buy.  I think they've they've nailed it.  It's kind of it's halfway between Tumblr and your and your own blog.  Yeah.  And I think that's kind of that's kind of what you want.  Well, not everybody, obviously, but some people, that's what they want.  So what did you so you decided Gina just to keep your own blog, your host, your own blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And, you know, I had already invested so much time in the theme and the plugins that I  decided to stick with WordPress and just, you know, just suck it up and update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What are you using?  Expression or WordPress?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  WordPress.org.  Yeah.  My own, my own host.  I want, you know, this is the update thing is a problem.  It's something that keeps me awake.  I'm building ThinkUp.  That's an installable PHP app.  It's got updates, you know, and it's, it's, it stinks.  It's just kind of the way of, you know, the way it is that there are updates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  First thing, first thing I asked our sys admins when they said that the, there, there  there had been a hack on the site was, is it my fault?  They said, no, Leo, we actually isolated your WordPress.  So it has no access to any other server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cause you have a smart sys admin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I said that was a good idea, but I do, I check every day, but you know, sometimes  it'll be a couple of days and a lot of those WordPress upgrades are like critical  security flaw.  They're widely known.  It's easy to Google to find a WordPress blog.  I mean, you can see what, as you said, Matt, they've got an API to see what version it  is.  So you can really easily see whether you're, you know, if you're looking for, uh,  easily violatable blogs, you can find them.  Hey, let's talk about the filter bubble.  You haven't been here, Matt, since we, uh, talked about it.  You should know that Gina and Jeff and I both have completely dismissed the  notion of a filter bubble.  We like search personalization.  Um, what's your, I mean, and this is, you're, you're fairly involved, I would  guess in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  It was funny because, uh, Eli gave a talk at Ted about his book.  Eli Pariser.  Who wrote this book?  Right.  And it's called the filter bubble and it is an interesting read.  So if you're interested in search, you might enjoy it quite a bit.  Um, but it was frustrating because he gave the talk before the book was available.  So we had to only go by the talk and he was saying things like there's 57  different personalization factors.  And that sounded like kind of a random semi legitimate number.  Um, and I think Jeff had said before on an earlier show, like you've never had as  much choice as you have with the internet right now.  And I sort of feel like that's the case.  Um, I I'm sensitive to the example of like, if you only click on links that  your liberal friends share on Facebook, then you eventually only start to see  liberal type stuff, but certainly at Google, we do actually have algorithms  that think about diversity.  And so for example, you might limit or cap the number of results you see from  one site so that you see more results from other places.  So, uh, you know, even Google news, when it started, one of the big advantages  was to surface not only, you know, Reuters or AP, but Pravda or Zenois, you know,  so we wanted to bring in a diversity of viewpoints.  Um, so it's possible that personalization can have some minor effect, but overall  it's usually a much, uh, greater when it's really helping the relevance.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the more I thought about it, Leo, the more I think that that perspective is,  um, with the same as Nick Carr and Andrew Keene and folks like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's the Neo-Luddites we'll call them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's authoritarian.  They, they want authority.  The irony is that, that I, I think we're finally freed from having just Bill  Keller tell us what happened in the world today by the internet and they want to go  back to that.  Right.  So even, even Paris are almost says that Google should take responsibility for  deciding what we get to, to give us more.  And I want the opposite.  I, I don't want that at all.  I got in pockets of, of trouble or praise for questioning the, the article as the  atomic unit of news.  I loved that.  I didn't think it was a big deal at all, but some people got really mad about it.  And as I thought about it, I watch out warning Gutenberg alert.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Boop, boop, boop, boop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Um, I love the phrase Gutenberg parenthesis by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly.  And I think what's happened is that, is that we had a way to, as I've said before,  cognate the world and put it into boxes and know the beginning and the end and  know there was authority and know who did it.  And the scarcity was comforting.  It put a border around the world and the internet gives us abundance and abundance  is unsettling and it changes how we view the world.  So I think this, this whole filter bubble debate is part of the same thing.  It's saying that, Oh, we can get anything from anywhere now.  And where I'll take help in filtering that, which is what Matt's saying.  Uh, I think others say, no, no, no, no, I don't want, uh, algorithms to help  because that seems inhuman.  I want, you know, professional editors to help still.  And it's really an authoritarian, um, somewhat elitist view, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, and, and what I thought was really interesting is I was sort of having a  discussion with people on hacker news about it.  And one guy said, I don't want the best results for me.  I want the best results period.  I just want the unfiltered results, the, you know, the monolithic.  And the fact is, you know, results for someone in China who speaks Chinese are  going to be different than German speaking users is going to be different than an  expert.  And so I thought that was, you know, there is no one ideal, objectively  true, correct set of results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's always exactly.  That's exactly the prejudice of mass media.  Right.  That's that, that, that, that precisely brings it out.  Right.  This illusion, this illusion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That, that you could have the canonical search result.  Right.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And the beauty of it is that if you go down to the bottom of the search results  page, if your results have been personalized, there will be a link that says view  customizations, you can click on it and it will tell you why they were customized.  And then it'll have a link to run the search again without personalization.  And a few people are like, well, why'd you put it at the bottom of the search  results?  And the answer is we started at the top and really no one cared or ever clicked  on that link.  And so if it doesn't earn its click-through, then things would tend to be lower on  the page.  But if we haven't personalized a set of search results, then there's no view  customizations link down at the bottom of the page.  That's cool.  I didn't, I didn't know it either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought it was so neat when you compared that with, with doing it in a  cognito.  Of course now Leo, your porn results are going to come up.  Actually they did.  I was searching as you might've noticed for gay rights, but the reason I was

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  searching for gay rights.  Oh boy.  What a smooth transition boss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is why you are gay.  This is why you are the master.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Segway.  I actually use Google search results for my segways.  How about that?  How many people could say that?  First of all, this is a gay rights month, right?  Is that right?  Pride month, baby.  GBLT month.  Yes.  And, but I'm bummed because-  GBLT, GLBT, which is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  GLBT, generally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Gotcha.  Sometimes I prefer bisexuality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I just-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you have the right to do that Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't use-  Leo, I like lesbians better myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What is the full, what is the long, there's a long acronym that  includes questioning and all of that stuff.  The GBLT, QSTZ, ZEWE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a long one.  Usually Q is pretty umbrella, you know, for allies and-  Q.  We'll use Q.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So the reason I searched for it is cause you're supposed to get a  rainbow on the results.  And I think that once again, because I've turned on, see, I  have the voice search turned on that I've turned on the labs.  Do you get this?  See, there's supposed to be a rain, according to Google, the Google  operating system blog, when you search for gay, do you get this?  You get a rainbow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If I do it in Safari, I get it.  And if I do it in Chrome, I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, Chrome turned it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you just search for gay, I think it works for Stonewall.  Yeah.  I just think that's really neat.  It's, it's basically, it's like a doodle.  Except for the people who ask for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  For search results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I just think that's really cool.  It's a nice touch.  Has that, has that happened before?  Has Google done that before where they would change the result, the  search interface based on the result?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We have in some instances.  So sometimes for Easter, we make the Google at the bottom be little Easter  eggs, but I remember for, for some of the Christmas holidays, so Kwanzaa  and Christmas will actually have like little, you know, Christmas trees or  lights down the right hand side.  And I think we might, I don't remember if we did a Festivus one.  Illuminate pole or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  This one was more subtle.  This is a couple of years ago.  If you searched for gay, you'd get a rainbow, which every website used to have.  I used to have these on my websites.  These, these gray rainbow gradient bars.  Yes.  That kind of looks like just a Google branding.  It's very subtle that you wouldn't, you wouldn't necessarily notice that, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that, that's the thing about pride month is that there isn't like one day that's  pride day, like there are pride celebrations on different weekends throughout the month.  So like, it's not like Google could do a doodle on a given day.  I mean, I guess they could, but this is, it seems like this seemed like  an interesting way to do the doodle.  It's like, you're asking for information about this thing and it's a celebratory  month, so this is kind of a neat little subtle thing to do versus doing one big  doodle on the last Sunday of the month or something.  That's neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So, so, uh, uh, street view has been banned in Bangalore.  Soon we're going to call it blur galore.  That's a story.  Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I think the argument here is there are sensitive places, but  they're always sensitive.  They're just photos.  It just, it's, it's, it's  in all these cases, ask the analog question.  Can you go take a picture of this thing on your own and put it up?  Yes.  The scale of different shore.  Same with face face recognition.  Can you go and take a picture of somebody and put it online and somebody  will recognize who that is?  Yes.  So when we automate it, what makes it so evil?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We even have an acronym or at least I have one at Google that's Tenagi, which  is this is not a Google issue, right?  Because people could stand on the street and take the pictures.  So, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's good.  I like it.  Tenaki.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anything, anything Google does becomes a Google issue and it  spreads out in other ways.  I saw, um, Oh crap.  I'm going to forget his name.  Now.  I just, I just gave a talk on the way up here at that, at Pitney Bowes.  I'm in postal mode.  Really?  Pitney Bowes.  They're still in business.  I did this postal thing last week.  I did, I did Pitney Bowes today and the guy following me is, Oh, I'm so embarrassed.  I can't remember his name.  Wrote the, uh, the book about forgetting.  A long German name anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You forgot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I forgot.  Cause I forget.  That's exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We know it's not Habermas.  You wouldn't forget him.  No, I wouldn't get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Um, anyway, or Gutenberg.  Uh, so, um, the way he put it was interesting to me.  He showed, uh, the first home pixelated in Germany.  And he said that that was an extension of PII.  That PII was personally, and that Bible information wasn't any longer, just your  name or your social security number that people were considering the view of their  home to be personally identifiable information.  Oh, please.  I get what he was saying.  And that, and that, yes, logically that was their extension of the view, but  it's a wrong view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Is it the issue that, uh, Google makes money on it?  I mean, it's not, it can't be a privacy issue.  Cause if you look at the back of my head, when I'm walking down the street, I mean,  it's a public, so it can't be a privacy issue.  It has to be something like it's, it's a commercial enterprise using.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I hear that all the time in Germany.  There's a lot of that.  And they make money on me.  Right.  Well, so does a newspaper selling you to advertisers.  Right.  Uh, and I think there's, there's anti-Americanism in here too, not to seem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, I'm sure that's the case.  It's jingoistic, but yeah, we deserve it.  We've earned it.  We come by it, honestly.  Uh, anyway, so don't, uh, I guess they suspended the street view cars.  They're not, I finally saw a street view car driving down the road.  Cool.  Is it your first time?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's weird.  You're so close to the Bay area.  Yeah.  I mean, you're in the Bay area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You'd think they'd be everywhere all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I feel like this is, this is the kind of, it's a cassette deck problem, right?  It's like, you used to be able to like pop a cassette, the tape in and hit record,  record songs off of the radio.  And it wasn't a big deal until file sharing became really easy.  It's like the technology to distribute images.  You know, people could take pictures of her house all the time, but you didn't know.  Well, that makes sense.  But now Google does it and you can see that they are.  And it makes, and the tech makes it really easy to do this thing that everybody  could always do before, but just was a lot of work.  And now suddenly it's kind of an issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That makes a lot of sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it seems more just like, I know people took pictures of my house before,  but I didn't know.  But now I see it was in their SD card and their camera someplace else.  You didn't see it, right?  So it didn't it didn't bother you.  You just were, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It didn't matter. It works both ways to what I interviewed Philip Kaplan.  Pud, you know, he was saying that that we got weirded out.  It's the opposite of that is with our photos and Flickr,  that we got weirded out when there was one creepy guy in the little tiny photo box  who saw our photos. Right.  But once it was everybody, who cares?  But millions of people see in our photos as far as the opposite of that.  It's kind of right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The creepy guy in the photo booth. I forgot him. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Should Skype worry that we talked about this RTC thing  a couple of weeks ago that Google had kind of was starting to do  Web RTC open source software in the Chrome browser for video conferencing.  What's wrong with that?  Thinks it's a good idea.  Skype cowers in fear, according to Engadget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Microsoft, AKA Microsoft, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Maybe they should.  When is that? When are we going to see that? I don't know.  Not long after releasing Web RTC audio and video chat software as open source,  which was as we mentioned a few weeks ago, Google started putting it in Chrome.  The company's planning for Web RTC to be a front runner for video conferencing  and online chatting.  And because it's royalty free, Mozilla, Opera.  I guess everybody but I are encouraged to include it in their browsers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love this. I love building out the browser platform.  I mean, more and more, I realize, I mean, Google says they're about the web.  I mean, they're really about making the browser the platform.  And what I like about that is that it's like here's Chrome, which is an awesome browser.  But because we're working with standards, we're working with open standards and we're using open source software.  Every other browser can also use this technology.  So, you know, you're free to go to another browser.  It's kind of the same this this like here's our choice.  You can make other choices.  And this is the difference between native apps. Right.  And browser apps. I'm starting to call them browser apps more because they're like that.  Browser based. Right.  And it just makes a lot of sense for Google because Chrome is an incredible platform.  But it also gives everyone else a chance to compete.  And so I'm all for open standards, open video and audio standards built into the browser.  That's great for everybody. Not only Chrome OS.  I mean, this isn't like Google's just doing this for Chrome OS.  Every other browser can use this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Will there be a Tripani dot Gina in your future?  ICANN has announced that starting next year, you can use any word as a top level domain.  They call them generic TLDs or GTLDs.  But I don't think Gina or I will be registering them anytime soon because it's not cheap.  And the application process is quite elaborate.  We're talking around, I think, one hundred eighty five thousand dollars.  So the only people there's a good article on geek dot com explaining the process, which is quite involved.  In fact, they had to do a flow chart. Good God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm fine with bureaucracy, but not one hundred and eighty five thousand dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I think the idea is that it's not open to everybody.  It's open to HP, Apple, Google, companies like that.  I it seems a little confusing to me to be in a world where you're told, OK,  now I want you to go to FT dot Murdoch or something like that.  I don't know. It just what's wrong with dot com?  Are we really that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And as if those companies don't have enough money to just buy the dot com domain that they want anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  HP's got HP. They use HP as an example a lot.  So I guess HP will be buying dot HP drivers dot HP.  I guess I don't know. I just see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It feels spammy. It does.  Right. And it feels as if, you know, so now there's another damn race and somebody with more money than I have is going to get that Jarvis and have it forever.  And, you know, I'm all for opening things up, but if you're going to open up, really open it up or don't.  And this halfway of only opening up for rich people is is very on Internet, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I agree 100 percent. It just bugs the hell out of me.  Now, if I had one hundred eighty five thousand dollars, if I found it under a seat cushion, would I register dot Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think so. But, boss, you know, should you register dot twit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, if it were twelve dollars, I would do it.  Yeah, but I can't.  I'm one hundred eighty five thousand dollars.  I think what I could do with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ten thousand dollars would you do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, no. Five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I might. All right. That's a lot of money, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know it is. Well, got to buy a lot of bricks for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I have to sell a lot of bricks for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I think Google's official position is probably going to be that we'll make sure that whatever URL you use or whatever TLD you use, we know how to crawl it.  And that makes perfect sense.  You know, if you've got that film or that movie, you want to make sure that that can be returned.  Does it make your life harder, Matt?  Well, there will be people who have to rewrite some code, I'm sure.  The only concern that I really have is if you if you have a domain name like dot bank, right, there's a chance for consumer confusion there.  Do you go to Citibank dot com or city dot bank or just dot bank or, you know, bank dot com or something like that?  So I think it will be fine.  In fact, it will probably make people search more because they won't know.  Do I go to Burger King dot com or dot.  That's a terrible idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it makes URLs less useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes. And it's a greedy.  I think it's a greedy ploy by I can to get because think about this.  You don't want a bad guy to register dot bank.  So so does that mean that Bank of America or somebody else has to spend for them, I guess,  one hundred eighty five thousand is no big deal.  But think of all the TLDs.  I mean, is HP going to register dot HP sucks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, what happens when BP registers dot Earth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. I think now you now we've hit the nail on.  This is a terrible idea.  It's a it's it's it's got to be motivated by pure greed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I can also try the devil's advocate position, which is, you know, there might be some TLDs  that could be known and trusted.  Like if you knew that bank really was, you know, for reputable banks or if you knew the dot  xxx really was only for porn or something like that, then you'd know where to find your banks  or you'd know where to find your porn or something like that.  And it is true that you see a lot of really weirdly named dot coms because they couldn't get any real domain name.  So those would be the points.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But you could resolve that just as the phone company does by adding new area codes.  You could add a dot C O T, you know, and then that gives you an infinite, you know, a whole  another equal set of domain names.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know. There ought to be a dot movie instead of, you know, whatever.  Well, I can't set it up. Not right.  Not universal. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes, because that's that's the other thing.  If you're universal or Sony, you're going to run for this in a hope to own dot movie and hold out everybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And nobody else can do it.  It becomes a restraint. This is, you know, in the great abundant Internet, this is where the scarcity is.  And the irony is we just went to IPV six and we have abundance of numbers again and we have a scarcity of names.  And the irony is by opening up more names in a limited way like this, it only makes the scarcity worse.  Because with dot com, you have to fit in it somehow.  And there's virtually no limit of dot com names.  But if you can go in and buy dot bank and limit it to two banks, that's not created a new layer of scarcity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right. I'm going to go out on a limb here and that say that this will never happen,  that they're going to somebody's going to somebody's going to wake up and smell the coffee because this is a bad idea.  Four Square, 10 million users.  Pretty good. I got the Swimmy's badge the other day by checking into the beach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Forbidden visual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Every time I get the only tweet I allow for square to do is a badge tweet.  I don't allow it to do a tweet on a mayor ship or a God forbid, a check in.  So a badge is once every two months or three months.  But invariably I have four or five people saying, I'm unfollowing you, Four Square spammer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm happy. Come on, I got a badge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Is four is four square. It's not.  There's no value to four square.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's fun. I do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Do you all do it? I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've done it less. I got to admit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've signed up, but I haven't I haven't really gotten into it.  And it was strange because I went skydiving this weekend and the people went there and then they were like,  how do I check in to show that I skydived?  And I was like, you know, just just skydive.  Just no, no, no, no, no. You want the badge?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You want the wind in my hair badge?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There needs to be a record.  Four Square needs to say that you went.  I don't believe you went skydiving.  Four Square needs to validate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's actually the fun thing about four square.  I mean, people are at 30,000 feet about to jump out of an airplane and they're creating a new  first four square location at that GPS saying 30,000 feet about to jump out of an airplane.  3D. I'm the mayor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you guys check into Facebook places?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No. Good God, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Latitude, I have I allow latitude to automatically check me in because that's nice.  It just does it.  I like latitude, actually, I use latitude, but that one's completely automatic.  First four squares get it. The gaming component, by the way,  four square pointed out that there is an actual mayor who's a mayor.  The mayor of New York City is the mayor of City Hall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nice. I went to City Hall and I'm trying to remember, did I?  I don't think I saw Bloomberg as the mayor.  I don't know. Maybe he had been.  I thought it was maybe I'm wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's where Bloomberg's CTO, Rachel Stern, who's a wonderful, wonderful young woman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I follow her on Twitter. I did not know that she was his CTO.  I just follow her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She's that now. Yeah. Yeah.  She's said Rachel's just just I'm a big fan of hers and she's great.  So I'm sure that she had a little something to do with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, let me look because I have the I have the infographic here.  This is actually a cool infographic showing  how Facebook grew from zero to 10 million users in just a couple of years.  Four Square.  Four Square. What did I say?  Facebook, Four Square. Yeah.  This is interesting. Happiness.  So happy, the happier you are, the bluer you are, which is wrong.  And the unhappier you are, the redder you are.  And so this in Manhattan looks like people downtown are more happy than people on the Upper East Side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That makes sense. Is this sentiment analysis of the shout outs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, of shouts. Yes. Oh, nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Isn't that cool? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It says six to one ratio of yeas to uggs globally.  Here's some life moments.  And here it is. The actual mayor, real world mayors enthroned on Four Square  at Mike Bloomberg, mayor of City Hall, New York City.  Isn't that awesome? Sweet.  Rachel Stern probably gets the credit for that.  This is kind of a nice infographic.  They did. There it is. One. Staten Island.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just red or? Yeah.  Oh, no. Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Now, there's not that many.  Is that Staten Island right here down here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, like bottom left. There's hardly anybody checking in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You got a problem with that?  There's four happy people and five unhappy.  Half of it's a dump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That might be Ellis Island.  Oh, is that Ellis Island?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  All right. In London, not a lot of happiness in London.  That's the this is the London Eye right there, I think is the blue part.  Hong Kong, only the people on the coast.  Yeah. Isn't that funny?  I just think that's hysterical.  Where people go, apparel, banks, convenience and home and retail  are the most popular chains.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is what Dennis has been wanting to do is to is to now finally start  feeding back the data.  You know, Google's Google's great value is that it takes what we do  and gives it back to us by adding value along the way.  And this is where Four Square can start to prove some value to us.  I mean, it can it can tell you as an individual  how often you've nicked in for that coffee.  It can tell us as a, you know, kind of country and group of friends  what we're doing.  And that's when it starts to gain some added value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's actually why I love latitude, because I love love the graph  on the dashboard saying you only spend, you know,  eleven hours a day at work or something.  Actually, it's kind of embarrassing.  I don't spend much time at work at all.  Oh, no, no, I don't.  You're just productive. That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We all see how present you are.  You're on all the time, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm not, though. It's kind of interesting.  I'll pull up my dashboard and show you.  But anyway, before we do that, I'm going to take a break  and we are going to get your tool.  No, I have a tool.  You have a tip and you have a number.  And Matt has something to for us, I believe.  Coming up in just a bit before we do that, we do want to mention  our good friends at Netflix.  I don't even know why I do an ad for Netflix.  It's like Kohl's to Newcastle.  Show of hands, how many of you are not yet Netflix members? Nobody.  Zero. Oh, you.  OK, would you please do this? Go to Netflix.  See, I found one Netflix dot com slash twit and sign up for Netflix.  Now, here's the deal. Forget that DVD by mail thing.  Yeah, that's cool.  But the watch instantly, you never have to think ahead anymore.  You just go home, you fire up your PlayStation 3, your Xbox 360,  your Nintendo Wii, your Roku box, your Blu Ray player.  A lot of TVs now have Netflix on them.  Your Apple, your iPhone and your iPad and many Android phones now.  And you just go there and the being badabum, you're watching a movie.  I love Netflix and it's seven ninety nine a month for the streaming  only subscription. Now, that is a great deal.  Try everything, the whole thing, the whole thing free Netflix dot com slash twit.  And and if you decide you want it, you don't have to do anything.  Well, they'll know. They'll know it's us.  Hard Day's Night. Love that scary movie.  Love that. No, I don't.  Hackers, one of the worst movies about hacking ever made.  Angelina Jolie.  Oh, we're watching it.  Look at that.  Look how instantly you can just watch a movie, even just on an impulse.  And now Mad Men coming soon to Netflix,  along with Glee Netflix dot com slash twit.  Look, the movie is about to start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Should we just watch Hackers for a while?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, maybe not. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, I forgot. Angelina Jolie. Popular.  Yes. Yes. Yes, I forgot.  I asked Kara Swisher what her favorite movie was.  We were talking about salt.  She says salt. Angelina Jolie.  What more do you need to know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, basically the tour at Taurus, too.  That was just like, watch Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp do things like fine.  That's fine.  Really? I haven't seen that yet. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'll have to watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  First, just the visual feast. A visual feast.  Yes.  Both of them. Another side of Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We thought it was all just Glee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We could do our special crushes edition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Gina's crushes next on a very special This Week in Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Weeds starts this weekend that tells you something about mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I love Weeds and I love her.  Yeah, she's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Sons of Anarchy. Anybody watch that?  No. What's that all about?  So it is on Netflix and I watched the first two seasons.  And then after that, you have to do Amazon On Demand or something.  Is it British?  It's it's no, it's FX or something.  It's about a motorcycle gang.  It's really, really good.  Oh, so Sons of Anarchy.  You surprise me constantly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're climbing mountains, you're jumping out of planes,  you're in a motorcycle gangs.  You just don't look the part, my friend.  He's amazing, isn't he?  He's got me.  Is this how you get your your aggression out?  Because I just talked about you this morning at Pitney Bowes.  I tell the story about you and buying the scale on Blippi and all that  and talk about how you're surprisingly one of the nicest guys on earth.  When you have the most right to be a cynical ass and you're not.  So now I guess I'm in this picture.  Is this how you get your aggression out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I can neither confirm nor deny.  So you have a motorcycle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't.  I can see you on a Harley, a big fat hog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Maybe a little Vespa scooter or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So here's my here's my latitude dashboard.  Twenty four thousand two hundred seventy nine miles travel.  But this is the one that's embarrassing.  Twenty hours a week average at work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's because it's lying to you, Leo.  You're there all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Google Latitude never lies.  Oh, it does have the wrong address, though.  Maybe.  I've only spent half my time next door, apparently.  Time at home. There's my home address. Never mind.  Time spent out.  Twenty seven hours a week.  I'm out of the house. It's cool.  I just think it's cool.  It's cool. I love it.  And and it does that all automatically.  And and for all I know, it's sending it to the CIA, which is great.  It saves me time on explaining where I've been.  No, it doesn't. I know it doesn't.  Of course not. It wouldn't never.  You have nothing to hide.  I know. I know. I know.  So let's do Matt's Google Word of the Day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Excellent. My word of the day is agglutinative.  What?  So I've never heard of this word before, but I was reading the official Google  blog and they were talking about how they added support for five new Indic  languages. Wow.  So Bengali, Tamil, Telugu.  And they mentioned the word agglutinative, which evidently means, you know,  when you add extra sort of words, it means sticky.  So you're sort of adding things on the end to sort of say the tense or the number  or something like that. So agglutinative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So that's good.  It's like from the root gluten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like like German.  Yeah, you stick a whole bunch of words together or Russian, those kinds of  languages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This term was introduced by Wilhelm von Humboldt in 1836 to classify languages  from a morphological point of view.  That's really good. Agglutinative.  Very thank you.  We should do that more often, Matt, the word of the day.  Yeah, I like it.  I want to do the phrase.  I smell a calendar coming on.  Yeah, I want to do the phrase of the day because I love that.  And it wasn't yours, but you did quote the Gutenberg parenthesis.  And I didn't I mentioned it, but I didn't I didn't define it, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's from a bunch of researchers at the University of Southern Denmark.  And they argue that before Gutenberg, we were very much about process  and flow and everything got remixed as it was passed around.  And then in the 500 years dominated by text,  everything was set down and permanent and serial and beginning to end  in everything. And now we're coming back out on the other side of the parenthesis.  We're going back to flow and remix and things are being malleable and plastic.  And that's what's blowing our minds.  That's why people object to things like algorithms instead of editors  and to not having things in a finite form like an article.  And so the parenthesis becomes a wonderful way, I think, to explain  the different ways we're now cognating the world  based on how media is changing around us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I gather that the notion of parenthesis is that  began with Gutenberg, but it's ending now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes. Yeah. You know, here's an interesting little factoid.  There's a bright young guy named Noah.  Crap. Now I forget another name.  Noah, Noah, where your last name is, who worked with people at Reed College  on on a paper.  And he said they tried to analyze the most important patent.  Noah Pepper. Thank you, Noah Pepper.  Patents of recent years, and they did it by just looking at citations  within patents. Right. So it was a closed universe.  And he said that the most important patent was the inkjet printer.  Because apparently it was a new thing that says  we're going to physically place matter exactly where we want it.  Wow. Right.  And so that's what leads to things like 3D printers and distributed  manufacturing and all kinds of other things. Right.  But it also struck me what's interesting is not only does the Gutenberg  age of text start to come to not a close, but it comes to the next phase.  But similarly, the whole technology of impressing ink on paper  physically is also going to go away. Yes.  We had 500 years of it.  Probably no invention in the history of mankind has had this kind of staying  power and this kind of impact.  And it led to so much else.  But we're now going to do that same process by all kinds of other ways.  Xerography, inkjet, screens, E-ink, all these other ways.  And physically impressing ink on paper starts to die with it, which I find,  pardon me, I'm geeking out right now, but I find that interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, in fact, I think that the measure of what you just said is true is how  how much letter set letterpress printing has become a hipster.  Yes, artifact that it's instead of being, oh, yeah, that's how you print.  It's always in this school.  In fact, I think it's dig has letterpress business cards,  a real thick stock and they're in there to feel them.  It's the ultimate hipster artifact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But printing press, I got so upset.  I missed a Kickstarter project where they're they're they're bringing back  out of an archive, a type foundry.  That operates not unlike the way Gutenberg did.  You have the flat thing at the bottom with a letter impressed on it.  And then you put it into a mold and you pour the metal in.  And that becomes the font.  That's cool. And they're reopening.  And if you gave enough money, if you have seventy five dollars,  you get a headline out of a Ludlow machine.  Wow. I desperately want. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But anyway, geeking, geeking out as always.  Gina Trippani, our tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tip of the week. Forget ink on paper.  You can now copy and paste images on your clipboard.  So an image that's on your clipboard into Gmail, which is cool.  So if you want to attach attach an image,  you don't have to open the file box and all that stuff.  So you have that rich, rich text enabled.  I usually deal with plain text.  So rich text has to be enabled.  And it's really good for sending screenshots.  If you do a command control, command shift four to get a screenshot  onto your clipboard and the Mac, you can just control V into Gmail on Chrome.  And I think the shortcut is like all print screen on Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Same deal. So all of this seems to be motivated by the Chromebook.  Don't you think that this is like the more we put into the browser capabilities?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Although there's not a whole lot of I don't know if there's a situation  where you would have an image on your clipboard on the I guess you don't have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Do you have a clipboard even? I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There is definitely a clipboard.  I don't know. I guess you could select an image in a web page and get it on your clipboard.  Yeah, it makes sense. But yeah, I think this is just all about sort of, you know,  the whole the whole objection to web apps was, well, you know, you can't deal with  the files the way you can a native app.  And I think this is just about breaking down those those walls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  By the way, Lifehacker has a new book by somebody you might know.  Gina Turpani and Adam Pesch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The new edition of the Lifehacker book is out.  Yeah, Lifehackerbook.com just came out this week.  Adam did the revisions and I did the tech edit.  So I got to I got to, you know, edit him again, which I'm sure he loved.  And the book is out. It's available on on Amazon and it'll be in bookstore.  So check it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm I'm kicking myself now because I have the first one.  And I should have had you autograph that when you were here.  Oh, yeah. I'm kicking myself.  Well, you have to come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We've got the new one on its way to you, Leo. Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But I want I like the first one is like great.  First editions are more valuable.  Yeah, it's just more valuable.  Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I found this interesting.  Yeah, Google said to the FCC that voice communication  is now the tail wagging the dog and the numbers they gave.  I loved in 1997.  I'm going to throw out a lot of numbers here,  but I'll make it as cogent as I can.  In 1997, there were 54000 terabytes of voice data and 3.3  thousand terabytes of 54 versus 3.3 terabytes of Internet.  Right. Jump to 2015  where voice data off the Internet,  non VIP is 26000 terabytes, half of what it used to be in 97.  All right.  I.P. VoIP.  That is 23000 terabytes,  so the two of them add up to the voice that you had in 97.  That's what's happening.  But Internet, the money is that's 26000, 23000.  Internet is 19 million terabytes of data.  And there's in the TechCrunch post,  there's a big circle that shows the Internet and little dots that show voice  and and the FCC and regulation are paying more attention to voice  when the Internet is now one hundred sixty thousand, one hundred sixty times,  rather, one hundred sixty times that of the voice network.  So that's my number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  My tool of the week comes from Denmark  via the great Google Maps Mania blog.  And apparently, I guess this makes sense that when you  I just think of the Blues Brothers and Carrie Fisher's hair salon,  Curl Up and Die.  Apparently, when you when you start a hair salon, you pretty much  you have to have a pun in the name to prove this.  A Danish website, I won't cut my hair.  What I find interesting is they use the OpenStreetMaps database  to map the data onto Google Maps.  And now you can find every punny hair salon.  There is in the in the whole in the whole world,  just by clicking on these little these aren't that all that's that's magnificent.  Dollar cuts, hair media, so this is great.  Plus art of hair hair.  Silly, isn't it?  But I do kind of like it that they were using the Google Maps  with the OpenMaps database, OpenStreetMaps database.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When I was a columnist on the San Francisco Examiner, low many years ago,  so many years ago, it used to be a real newspaper.  Yeah. My one of my proudest projects,  one of my stupidest, proudest product projects is that I went down Alcimino Real  like that and I cataloged every fast food place  along the whole road along.  That's a long list.  It was it was it was quite a project.  No Google Maps at the time.  And I got in trouble because I made fun of this one place.  Their name was Kish Me Quick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There are other guys.  Yeah. But they're venerable.  Still there, I promise you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is where we have to have a key anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Now we have Glee. Right.  Hey, Matt, by the way, I don't know if this is yours cutting up.  That's good.  That could be yours right there.  Matt Cutts, thank you so much for being here.  He is, of course, the guy in charge of keeping spam out of our search results.  God bless him. God's work does God's work.  And he's just like he's like he's glowing like the sun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like the it's like the heavens are sucking it back.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's going up the up up above.  The rapture would, of course, start at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He's going to be up there soon.  Actually, it's one floor up. It's the next.  Anyway, thank you, Matt, for being here.  We really appreciate it. Google spam fighter.  He's at Matt Cutts on the Twitter.  Gina Tripani, of course, is  beloved of all, especially for her great choice in headwear.  Yes, at Gina Tripani, you'll find her at SmarterWear.org.  And of course, think of app dot com.  Jeff Jarvis is the author of What the Heck Would Google Do?  His fine book available in better bookstores everywhere.  And I would switch to him if I could.  There we go. What's this? Oh, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a it's a book cover. It's here. It's here.  Oh, it's the it's the galleys.  But that's the I like the cover. I've not shown it anywhere.
