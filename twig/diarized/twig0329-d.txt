We're gonna have some fun today because we've got an interesting guest from the Google, but first  from the Googleplex, Jeff Jarvis. On location. Professor of Journalism at the City University  of New York. Author, blogger at Buzz Machine. What are you doing at Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's just some news folks are here having some meetings and there was a meeting yesterday  about AMP, which is, which we'll talk about with Richard Gingras, but it's, you know, I'm a big  believer in where that heads and some other stuff. So it's been great. You know, I always,  I'm amazed being on this campus. It's always amazing.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh man, I'm jealous. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, you're in Massive View. I thought you were in New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'm in Mountain View. I'm down the road from you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's got a self-driving camera right behind him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I really wish I'd been picked up by a self-driving car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wouldn't that be cool? That's Kevin Marks, the posh accent of Kevin Marks.  Joining us, former Googler from his desk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I'm joining you from a desk at Mozilla today because the social web working group is  meeting here. And so I'm here for that. And we are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is Katharina Borkert there yet? Katharina Borkert?  She's someone you must meet. She's starting at Mozilla very soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I haven't met her yet. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's wonderful. Actually, a couple of Mozilla  stories in the lineup. But I'll mention those in a second. But first, we should also say,  we are awaiting the appearance of Richard Gingras, who is a storied Google executive  now currently in charge of their news operation, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  News and social, yep. Yep.  And there was a real force behind the app, so that's what we'll talk to him about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He also, he was at Salon. He was at Public Broadcasting. He was at Apple.  He's been all over, part of eWorld at Apple. He also set up At Home, which was the first cable  modem network in the mid-90s. He's vice president of programming and editor-in-chief.  He's been doing a lot of things. So Richard Gingras will be our guest as soon as we can  figure out how to get the systems working. But as long as we're talking, actually,  before we get into that, look what I got. Google Cardboard.  Oh, those are so cool. Yeah. So Verizon is giving these out  for free at the Verizon store to customers, I guess. They're Star Wars Google Cardboard VR viewers.  And they have four of them. We got all four of them thanks to Jason Clanthus,  he says known at Verizon. I don't know if that's good or bad. So this is a Stormtrooper.  This one's a R2 unit. We got a BB-8. And who is this? Kyle Weeks? What is this? Kyle Wren?  Some character that's going to be in the new movie. So the drumbeat continues for Star Wars  marketing. It's insane. Yeah. Everywhere you go, you can't get away from it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And cardboard. I got another cardboard yesterday and saw some really neat 360 stuff on cardboard.  Just saw some more demos just now. It's phenomenal. Did we talk about this? Lowe's  home improvement has a cardboard vending machine. Wow. Cardboard's cheap if you just get the paper

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  version. I mean, New York Times is handing it out in its Sunday paper. I think, I don't know,  what do you think? Is this a gimmick or is this the beginning of the immersive video  leading into virtual reality movement? Is this all coming on strong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are people I've heard who are just insistent that this is big, this is important,  it matters, it's going to be the future of how we get into the web. They've got to solve the  puke problem, which is real. I find myself disoriented. But to be able to be in immersive  environments and do things, yeah, they're insisting in places like this and it's important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You agree, Kevin? Well, I mean, to some extent, I mean,  this thing has been the next big thing since like the mid-80s. Yeah, that's true, right? We've been

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  heralding it for a long time. It's becoming more practical now and

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  there are bits of it there. But yeah, the puke problem is real and there's a bunch of hard  parts to that. Part of that is how you actually judge depth, because you don't just judge it with  parallax, you also judge it by moving your head like that to decide what's what and see what moves.  And you can't always do that with these VR things. Certainly, you can't do it with the  static set, most of the satellite shot stuff, though I think the 16 camera thing will let you  do a little bit of that. Yeah, for $60,000.  Yeah, but that's the point. If you just shoot with a single lens thing or a grid of six,  you don't get enough overlap to let you do that and watch things move in front of each other.  Whereas if you shoot with 16, so they're basically the spacing of your eyes and as you rotate,  you can move between them. You can do a bit more of that. So I'm optimistic that will help a bit,  but it's, yeah, as you say, it's an expensive thing to shoot with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The thing I learned talking to people here is that the sound sync is an issue that when you're  hearing the sound from the wrong place, it's part of what throws you off, throws your brain off.  And one example of a woman named Angela Hilda is really great stuff. She was one of the early  people to use Skype on TV news and now she's doing immersive videos. And she said, for example,  if you're in a scene where you're underwater, what you have to have is the sound of the water  sloshing has to be above you. If it's below you, in your sense of where it is, you're very confused.  So you really need 3D sound as well, or else you get all messed up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can do that bin orally, but yeah, but the other thing is that you've got very tight  latency requirements on it. And that is going to be a problem for Android because Android

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  has not got good audio latency. Although I have to say, that's one of the empowering things that  means this Google Cardboard can be so cheap is that we all have smartphones. We have the $1,000  hardware that empowers you. It's really amazing what the empowerment of the smartphone from drones  to cardboard, having a supercomputer in your pocket seems to be a very valuable thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  To have that high DPI phone. Yes, it does.  Because when it's here with a lens in front of it, then actually having that many pixels  is worth doing. Normally, we're wasting pixels with these because you can't see them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I see Mr. Gingras is joining us. So we're going to take a little break when we come back. Richard  Gingras will be here. He is an executive at Google. There he is calling from the Googleplex.  We're going to make sure the sound's working and everything while we take a little commercial  break. We'll talk about AMP. Kevin Marks really was excited about talking a little more about AMP,  Google's news and social initiatives as well. From a guy who has been involved in this since 1979,  when he helped KCET begin its teletext initiative. Wow. There's a memory.  Our show today brought to you by Lynda.com, the online learning platform with over 3,000  on-demand video courses in every area you're interested in. Business, technology, creative  skills. Lynda is for problem solvers, for the curious, for people who want to make things happen.  It's for everything. And the nice thing about Lynda, you pay once, one flat rate, you get access  to all of the courses. You don't have to declare a major at Lynda.com. You can dabble and dibble and  be a dilettante and then also learn for work. I'm a photographer. I love photography. I want to  get better at it. If you're interested in the same, Photoshop CC Essential Training,  one of their courses, Photoshop for Photographers, the 2015 Creative Cloud Updates, another one,  advanced courses on performance tuning your Canon digital SLR and Lightroom Insider Training,  series like Photo Tools Weekly, Burt Monroy's amazing Pixel Playground. Boy, if you're going  to learn Photoshop, learn it from Burt Monroy. The DIY photographer shows you how to take everyday  household items and turn them into the tools you need to get better photos. It's just great.  You can stream them on demand. You can even download them and watch them on the go, take notes.  And of course, with written transcripts of every course, it's easy to find exactly the part you  want. So if you are a dabbler, you can just read, look at a little bit. If you're a completist,  you watch beginning to end, I like to do that. You can do that too. Lynda.com. Here's what we're  going to do 10 days free, just like a real member.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Richard Jinger is my friend and co-conspirator from Doing Important Things. He's in charge  of Google News and News at Google in all kinds of ways. Richard has been talking for a long time  about the idea of containerized news. That led to a discussion with the last two news guys around  how the relationship of news could change. Then Richard came back to Mountain View after one of  them and saw Dave Bespris, senior VP engineering here. Kismet occurred because Google, as you know,  cares very much about a faster web, a better web, an open web. Out came accelerated mobile pages.  Richard is a key driving force behind that. I'm very excited about this. I think it makes a huge  difference in how we are going to interact via links with content and news. I also think in  markets that are still mobile and 3G that it's going to be gigantic in terms of not only speeding  up their experience but reducing their data costs immensely. Richard quotes a  piece that said that their web pages can be 2 to 10 megabytes for maybe 80k of actual content.  This is going to make a big difference. Richard is the driving force that made this happen. I'm  delighted about it and I got to see him here. That's why he's joining the show. Richard,  why don't you do a better job than I can about explaining AMP and what makes it what it is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sure. Well, great. I'm very delighted to be here with you guys today.  So, yeah, let's talk about that a bit. I mean, I sort of look at it from a few base observations  about what's going on on the web today. And one, as we know, is unfortunately over the years with  the advance of technology, we've managed to use that technology in ways that, yes, may be an effort  to make content experiences more compelling, but for the most part it's actually made web  pages very, very slow. And I think we see that every day. It's even more pronounced on mobile  where bandwidth might be constrained and frankly where you're paying for that bandwidth.  So that's an issue. We also see on the web today that frankly advertising experiences have gotten  far more annoying and far less compelling. And these factors too, I think, have led to serious  concerns about the state of the web. And when you look at those two factors of speed and the whole  annoying experience with many ads, it has had a number of very, very challenging after effects.  One, generally, if you look at the use of the mobile web in developing countries where data  plans are more constrained, if you ask them their definition of the internet, they won't include the  world wide web. They'll include social networks. They'll maybe even include YouTube, but they won't  include the world wide web. And part of that is because it's slow. But among the other effects,  for instance, with the situation with ads, we're seeing a stark rise in ads and the use of the  ad blocking and a rise in the use of quick views and reader views which strip out the business  model entirely. This is not good for an ecosystem of high quality content that needs to be sustained  economically. And there's been a further effect here if you look at it that given the speed of  the web, it's opened up an opportunity for proprietary platforms, social networks, for instance,  Facebook with its instant articles to say, well, yeah, the web is slow. We can make that fast.  Simply take and put your content with us. And I understand that approach. It makes great sense  from their perspective. But to me, it simply underlines the core issue that the web is not as  fast and furiously compelling as we all hope it would be and should be. And that's really the  genesis of AMP was could we take and in a sense re-architect how the web works while respecting  web principles and respecting web technologies such that we could make content instant everywhere?  And I mean just that, instant everywhere. Whether that's clicking on a search result  in Google search or for that matter a shared URL that goes into Facebook, we think we can do a far  better job of eliminating the friction between the content experiences and other platforms which

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  are driving audiences to those experiences. And so as I remember, there are four things  fundamentally that AMP does. It has a shared library of scripts so that you don't download  them every damn time. It caches and or prefetches content closer to the user optionally with Google,  but other CDNs could cache the content as well. Number three, it sets standards, especially for  the architecture of advertising so advertising doesn't jump all around the damn page. And number  four, we'll have a shared mechanism to collect data for analytics so you don't have eight  different snoops on you looking at every one of your pixels every millisecond. And those four  things together are the underpinnings of what speeds up this and that there are things built  into that code base that will constantly be growing because it's open source. So for example,  the way you insert a tweet, as you said yesterday, now requires you to download all this code to show  the tweet that will already be in their shared library so that displaying a tweet will be one  line and there will go. That's one thing though that really concerns me because that really

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  fosters incumbents and really promotes incumbents and gives Google or whoever implements AMP and  I know it's open source but it's going to be Google gives them some significant power and determine  you help Twitter but do you help this dot CM? I mean that worries me a little bit. That's one of  the things I like about the free and open web is everybody's at parity. Well, it is still the free

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and open web. I mean, I think I hear what you're saying. But of course, large companies including  Google have long played a role in how the web evolves in its protocols. And frankly, that's  what we're doing here. And it is very important that it's open source and we are treating it very  much in that spirit such that it can accommodate all the capabilities that people want to take  advantage of. I actually look at this as a huge boon to the publishing community, particularly to  all of those torso and tail publishers who frankly don't have the technical resources or  the business development resources to build all the things they have to build or strike deals with  proprietary platforms to get their content delivered at speed. So, you know, I actually  have obviously a very different view on that. And what we encourage everyone, and since we announced  this project two months ago, there are now some 4500 developers on the GitHub project. And I  strongly encourage anyone with views about how the direction of this effort should go to jump in and  express themselves. As I keep saying, I think this is so crucial to the future of the world wide web.  It would be incorrect to think of this as a Google project or think of it as being a success  just because Google is involved with it. This is going to take the leadership of many,  not just the leadership of one. So we want the publishing community in the broadest sense. We  want the technology community in the broadest sense to engage on this approach. Because the  alternative, the alternative is just devastating, right? We don't want to see a continued decline  in the viability of the mobile web. We don't want to see the mobile web or people's experiences on  the internet drift towards balkanized proprietary platforms. And I agree with you on that,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  obviously. That could be a big problem. Richard, how will the governance of this work in terms of…  That's what worries me. For instance, only JavaScript is allowed. Is JavaScript approved by Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can others get involved in that? Like any open source project, the philosophy of governance is  actually stated on the GitHub. It's a very much engineering centric effort. Clearly Google has  been the enabler of this and is leading the effort without question. But we know that the success of  this will depend on us doing the right job in satisfying the larger community of interests  without question. And that's clearly our core objective here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. I mean, everything you say is true about what's going on with the way large media is using  the web, in that they're embedding so much JavaScript and nonsense in there that it's very  hard to know what's going on. And this is one answer to that. And if you can get them to adopt  that, that does help. But the other part of it is that you could just slim down your web pages and  not do this and not have this JavaScript didn't read aspect to it. So this is the point, this is  a forcing function to encourage them to do that? Is that the goal here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. In fact, if you look at this from a technical perspective, it's actually a hugely simplifying  function for content developers and publishers. We make things simpler. The core approach to the  architecture is frankly to find optimal efficiencies by eliminating redundant code  and turning those into core primitive modules of code that folks can build upon. So slimming down  the site, it's hard to slim down the site with as much JavaScript that's being used today.  Every site, basically every web page is its own app. It's got its own menuing structures written  in JavaScript. It's got a slide show that's written in a lot of JavaScript, all this stuff  that frankly is largely redundant and can be addressed with core runtime modules. But we want  to do this also in a fashion that doesn't take away creativity. So yes, simplify the models,  expand the capabilities of the runtime as things progress, but also leave in appropriate, as it  were, escape hatches for people to do more. So we're not saying, for instance, yes, that's true,  that there's no JavaScript in an AMP file itself. It's simply tag calls to JavaScript components in  the runtime. But we do also provide affordances for escape hatches. So if along with that article,  someone wants to trigger, say, an interactive data visualization, there's an element in the  specification to do just that, such that you can click on that module. And then from that point on,  the publisher is indeed using JavaScript to create whatever they would like to create.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But one of the concerns is that you're replacing some of the native HTML elements with custom  elements. In particular, audio and video and image get replaced by amp-audio, amp-video,  amp-image, which means that the pages aren't really HTML in that sense. They, without the  JavaScript, they come out blank, which was a bug originally. But without the JavaScript library,  that doesn't load. You end up, the fallback doesn't work. I'm not sure I follow that, but I...  Well, so there's an inherent fragility in JavaScript as opposed to HTML, because you're relying on  execution rather than declarative documents. So with HTML, if you make a mistake in HTML,  the browser can cope with that. Whereas if you make a typo in JavaScript, everything stops working.  And so there is... So the declarative nature of HTML is you say things like, you know,  angle bracket video linked to video, and that becomes a video thing. With AMP, I have to put  an amp-video in there. And if the AMP JavaScript doesn't load because there's a glitch, I'm on the  train or something, then that page will not render, will not fall back reliably. And that's  part of the concern with this, is that it's a lot closer to actual HTML than what Facebook and  Apple have proposed for their compressed solutions for news. But it has some bits that  are a little more fragile. That was part of our concern for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Steve Sacken Actually, I'm not sure how it's more fragile, because frankly,  today, you're right about JavaScript, but there's just all kinds of JavaScript in every page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. But it's more fragile than pure HTML is what I mean. JavaScript is HTML.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Steve Sacken I mean, to the extent that there is less  handcrafted JavaScript in everyone's web pages, then frankly, the opportunities for errors should  go down. But again, I think the core thing here is, and the objectives are following, and we  encourage everyone to engage, is how do we take and smartly re-architect how the web works without  diminishing any of its capabilities or diminishing the freedom of publishers and content developers  out there to create the kind of experiences they want to create. And we think that's all very  doable. And again, given the alternative, I think it's absolutely crucial that we go down this road.  Other folks have better ideas to how to tackle the problem than we're all ears.  But when we look at the situation in the ecosystem today, we think steps need to be taken, because  the challenges that we're facing otherwise here, I think are very, very steep and very concerning to  all of the publishers that we've worked with in pulling this together. And I think that's an  important point here. This has been a collaboration from the beginning. As Jeff mentioned, this started  with discussions with publishers and technologists back six or eight months ago. Some of us were  talking about it far longer than that. But it's been a very collaborative effort since then in  terms of developing the spec, in terms of developing the overall approaches that were taken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Soterios Johnson Let me, and I apologize, because I'm going to be a little provocative here, but  mostly for kind of playing devil's advocate. But let me see if I can reformulate this in a very,  I'm stupid, dumb, simple way and see if I've got this wrong. The premise, of course, is that the  web has become a quagmire of crap code, of advertising crap. It's too slow. It's especially  a mobile unusable. So the solution is, and it feels like this, what Google's proposing is almost a,  and Facebook and Apple in their own way, a unilateral, well, we can create a new standard  that'll make this better. And sure, you're enlisting big publishers, but it feels like this,  it doesn't feel like the W3C, it doesn't feel like the IEEE, it doesn't feel like a open process.  It feels more like these three big incumbents are all three proposing a new, completely new way  of expressing content on the internet, admittedly not deprecating the old way. But if the old way is  slow and not so functional, and everything else is new and shiny, maybe it's going to hurt the old way.  I worry about that. And maybe I'm misunderstanding it. I understand what you're saying, Richard,  is this is, but this is going to be an open process. But it does feel a little bit unilateral,  even if you say, well, we're taking in all the big publishers. Well, I'm a little publisher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you should get as involved as you would like as well. I obviously would disagree on the point  that the AMP effort is a unilateral effort. It has not been a unilateral effort from the beginning.  Clearly, we're playing a key role in this without question. But unilateral, it is certainly not.  Now, in the end, does the standard evolve from this? Maybe so. And that would be very nice.  But as you know, setting a new standard, it takes years.  But in a way, that's what you're doing.  And so we are obviously, we have proposed an approach and are going to put in market an  approach, which we think can evolve either as a lower case standard or maybe into an upper case  standard as time goes by. But I think the urgency of the situation calls for action. And again,  if others have alternate approaches, then we're all ears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll accept it's with the best intentions, but this is how standards proliferation happens.  People say, well, that W3C moves too slowly. We've got an idea. We would like to create  a new standard. And now you've got two standards. And I don't think that that's an unusual thing.  So really, it's got to convince. Yeah, go ahead, Jeff.  Go ahead.  Well, I just feel like you have to convince everybody, all the stakeholders here.  And why not go through the W3C on this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My primary point on that would simply be time. Simply be time. We'll be talking about it for  three years, five years. Who knows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's, yeah. I mean, I'm actually at a W3C standards meeting at the moment,  and yeah, it can be a slow process. But part of this is there's been an evolution in the way  standards work. And they used to be effectively, you would write the standard first, then people  implement it. And what we've moved to is implementation first, and then standards as

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  documentation of implementations. You can make the case that each browser has been doing this.  That's right.  But de facto, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, also, I mean, but also there was, and most standards start out actually as that. People  implement things, and then they document how they implement them. And if two of them implement the  same thing, then it's on the ways of becoming a standard. And there's this sort of mistake.  But then once the standards exist, people treat them as sort of legislative documents that say,  this is how the standard works. And so there is this sort of mistaken idea that the standards  bodies are legislators, and they tell everyone what to do. And that was particularly awry with  W3C and XHTML2, where there was an assumption that if they wrote the standards, then all the  browsers and vendors would adopt them. And that the browser vendors decided that wasn't what they  wanted to do. And that's where we got HTML5 from, which was developed outside of W3C and then  brought back in. And that sort of pattern repeats itself. So there's nothing actually wrong  necessarily with saying, OK, we're building this thing. Can you adopt it? But there's some  sort of detailed discussions about the actual format and how it works. I wouldn't try to get  too much of the weeds there. But there are concerns about effectively replacing bits of  HTML with custom versions of those bits of HTML. And there's some hope we could  encourage them to use more standardization rather than the specialized AMP-variance of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, let me ask a question there, Kevin and Richard. What could break, right? If you go to  a browser that doesn't... This is still HTML. It's basically a subset of HTML, as I'm told.  And so if you have that AMP call for a video as opposed to a regular HTML call for a video,  then at a different browser or an old browser, is that going to be an issue? Or it'll figure it out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the old browser is tricky because they won't necessarily support video anyway.  But what it... Well, use image then. Everybody supports image.  Yeah. So the issue is if the JavaScript doesn't load for some reason, then you will not see  the parts that have wrapped in the AMP stuff because they're declaring it in their own format.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if I use instead of an image tag, I use amp-image. Oh my, we have more people joining us.  Hey, it's Matt Cutts. Hey, it's Matt Cutts.  Hey, how are you? Good, Matt. Good to see you. Welcome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff was going to be in the Googleplex and I couldn't resist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got reinforcements, Richard. Oh, no.  So if I... First of all, I feel like the image tag is the image tag. Why are we messing with that?  I understand why. We're in a crisis. It's as if Vint Cerf said, you know, this IPv4, we're in a  crisis. I'm going to unilaterally propose a new system. You need to come along. But you got an  image tag and I'm going to replace this amp-image. That's implemented in JavaScript. JavaScript that  comes from an AMP server currently run by Google. Others could run it. That worries me. And only  Google can approve the JavaScript that is allowed. But any other... I have a node.js site. What happens

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to me? On many questions, like on the image tag, I would encourage you guys to have another show  with Malte Uel, who is the technical guru. Yeah, we don't have to get too technical, Richard.  Yeah. And he can get into exactly why we're doing the images the way we are. A lot of it comes down  to how do we simply be smarter in how we handle content in the browser, right? I mean, you can  look at sites out there today that are actually... When you load the page, they're loading four  different sizes of the image, even though they're only going to use one, right? These are not  sensible approaches. So yes, we stepped out with an approach to attempt to address these issues.  And when I look at the situation out there, when I look at ad blockers in Germany being up to 35%,  40%, being up to 20% in the United States, when I look at the damage of the web ecosystem,  given the challenges we face, yeah, I think action is necessary. But as I said before,  if others have other approaches that we think should be taken, they should jump in. If they  have questions or challenges to the approaches that we're taking with AMP, please jump in.  What I'm sensing from folks is that the GitHub discussions and engagements have been very,  very fruitful and very, very collaborative. But I'd say get involved and see for yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I worry that... I guess my fear is that this JavaScript that's going to be running on my  page is coming from amp-project.org. I mean, admittedly, many pages have JavaScript coming  from all sorts of third-party sources that's insecure in many cases. It's crap in other cases.  But at the same time, it feels like Google's saying, no, no, let us handle this.  And you got a trust issue. I'm going to be honest, there's going to be a trust issue with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And we understand that. We go into that with a full understanding of that. And again,  we feel that's something we'll have to prove every day. But as I said, someone's got a different  approach. Come forward with it. But if you look at the way we're tackling things, I think a lot  of those concerns go away. You raised the issue of rampant rogue JavaScript and redundancy. Let's  look at how the analytics situation is. As I've often pointed out, the road to performance hell  on the internet starts with a vendor coming in and saying, add one more line of JavaScript  so I can give you some more analytics. And what you find is you've just added three seconds to  your page load time because of all the stuff that's going on behind the scenes that you don't have  much of a window on. So fine. We said, how do we tackle that? We certainly don't want to foreclose  third-party analysts from providing their knowledge and capabilities and analytics. We want to support  all that. But what we can do and what we are doing and that's what the specification that we put forth  and are writing against right now with regard to analytics is let's build into the runtime all the  core analytics gathering on the page. We don't need eight elements measuring the scroll point.  Let's reduce that to one such that all of that data can then be passed back to a publisher endpoint  or by the publisher to various analytic providers to do what they will with that information.  You know, I think it's a sound and reasonable approach to where you have simply too much  redundant functionality going on in a page. I think we can do better. But again, it's an approach  we've taken. It's open source. The spec is there. We're engaged with all the providers and participants  and we'll do our best to come up with the right solution and earn the trust of all the participants.  And frankly, I don't think we would have gotten as far as we've gotten had we not earned at least  the trust of the leading participants. Leo, I'm on speaker. Okay. Okay. Yeah, it sounds fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nice beard, by the way, Matt. Nice beard. Welcome, Matt. So, but this is this is an issue that I  raised at Newsgeist, which was two weeks ago in Phoenix, where you had some journalists come in  as the herd of EORs, as I mentioned last week in the piece I wrote in Observer, where, oh, what's  Google's agenda? Google this, Google that. And what I said back to the room was, listen, if Google  hadn't stood up and done this, we'd be here a year later still complaining about the slow web  and ad blockers. The question here is leadership. And in fact, one of the Google executives at the  original Newsgeist in Helsinki said, we can't build this. We build this. People are going to say,  well, what's Google's agenda? What's Google's this? What's Google's that? So Google did step up,  put itself at that risk, did take a position of leadership. Nobody else was doing it to solve  this problem. Now, is Google the right person to do it? Well, who else would do it? Is Google  doing it the right way? That's a discussion apparently Google's happy to have. That's what  an open source governance process is about. And open source governance is all about stepping up  and contributing, not just complaining. And so, you know, if we have that issue, if we have Twitter  here, but we don't have a new Twitter in, how does that get handled? We've got to deal with that.  And either this will sink or swim based on the adoption of it and what it does for the web.  People could just have to abandon it and go back to the way it was and go back to the slow web.  But I just think that Richard's right that the problem here was great enough  that somebody had to step up and show leadership. And in leadership,  in this day and age, you make yourself vulnerable to this kind of complaint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely. And by the way, Matt's here.  Matt, what are you doing at the Googleplex? Yeah, what are you collecting? Your monthly

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  paycheck or what? Well, I heard you were near in bat country and I said, well, I have to come see  you in bat country. But if you'll come all the way across the country and cross who knows how  many bridges, it only seems safe that I should, you know, come across the campus. That's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  paradox of Jeff Jarvis. He doesn't mind flying in a plane. He doesn't want to drive over a bridge.  He could take a helicopter over the river. That'd be fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  To your point, I mean, I think a lot of folks expected us in response to things like Facebook,  instant articles and Snapchat and so on. I think they expected Google to come forward with,  you know, with another proprietary format. And I think that would have been unfortunate and not  what the ecosystem deserves or needs. So very, very early on, we declared that the smart way to  do this was collaboratively through an open source effort that we would yet use our technical

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  expertise to drive. How many other AMP servers are set up? How many other AMP systems have been set

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  up? Well, it's say AMP systems. Keep in mind that an AMP page is like any other web page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no, not the client, but the AMP servers themselves, the providers of the JavaScript.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the ability to embed AMP is the thing. This is, you know, Jeff's original goal was like,  I wouldn't put things in other places. And I think Nasl did it, but I'm not sure who else  is actually displaying AMP pages apart from the Google demo. Yeah, but I'm not asking about the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  content. I'm asking, it was my understanding because it's open source that you don't have to  just go to cdn.amproject.org to get your image tag resolved, or is that not the case?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it is. So first of all, our plans for the runtime are to support all modern browsers.  And, you know, that's very clear and obvious. I'd also point out that, by the way, you can find AMP  files surfacing on LinkedIn today. You can find them surfacing on Pinterest today. And yes, you  can find them surfacing on Nasl today as well. So they are out there in the wild. But the pages are  indeed served by the publisher. I want to keep that in mind because one of the key principles  when we built this, I did step back and go through all the key principles, but one key principle was  leave the publisher in control of their content, of their page, of their business model. So they're  serving these pages. Now, yes, Google will cache these pages so that we can surface them in our  canvases. And what we have also stated is that we would make that cache available to any and all  comers who wanted to pull the content from the cache, which is a huge boon to many publishers  who are now spending. I mean, one big publisher told me that their largest cost outside of human  resources was CDN. And we're basically saying, we're giving you a free CDN. Take advantage of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  if you'd like to. Where does the runtime run from though? I mean, where does... Maybe I'm  misunderstanding the technology. Slap me down, Kevin, if I am. Are you downloading the library  into your browser? Yeah, from where though? Okay, so... From Google, but you could cache it locally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean... If you cache it... But the advantage of learning from Google is that everyone is  living the same one, so that when you go from side to side. So all of the JavaScript that is allowed

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  comes from a Google server or is cached? All of the JavaScript is in the core runtime, yes.  Because there is the opportunity to do JavaScript outside the runtime in prescribed circumstances.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Okay. I think that's a problem. Come on, Kevin, you're the open web guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That seems to be an issue to me. Well, again, I'm going to poke back on this, honestly.  What's the alternative? What's the alternative to the problems that we're seeing out there in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  market? I'll give you one alternative, which some people have pushed back on, which is to encourage  people to use much less JavaScript to much more HTML. I understand that is pushing back against

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  a lot of what we've talked about. Yeah, good point. That means they're taking away capabilities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but Richard, this is what it sounds like to me. It sounds like Google is saying,  you guys are crapped up the web. Let us handle this. Run JavaScript. No JavaScript except stuff  we provide from our servers is allowed. That is a non-starter with a majority of the world that says

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google is an advertising company. Look, that's what you said. That's not what we said.  Okay. What we say- Well, how is what you say different?  When we look at the architecture of the web, we see an awful lot of redundancy, right? And so we  took an engineering approach which says, how do we optimize this? How do we make things faster?  And the most obvious point was, let's look where there's redundancy. And there was a huge amount of  redundancy and it was almost entirely in JavaScript. Right? And so fine, let's reduce that to core  functions that don't take away creativity. So the approach to the slideshows, the slideshow module  in the runtime is a very basic primitive set of functions that the publisher can compose on top of  so that they can make the slideshow look and act and feel the way they would like it to look, act,  and feel. Right? But there's no reason to have 150,000 different approaches to the very core guts

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  of a slideshow. We can do better than that. But the right answer would be to then push that into  HTML itself and have a slideshow element and standardize that in the same way that we've  standardized audio and video elements. And so some of the pushback is that you're backing away from  the standardized ones and putting your own ones on top of those instead. So yeah, I agree a slideshow  element would be a nice thing to add to HTML and maybe this would be a way to move towards that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Matt Farris Well, and Leo, I think there's a little bit of a middle ground here, which  I was running the other week and listening to this week in Google and hearing you talking about AMP  and you were like, oh no, this is horrible. And so on the webspam team, often we would run across  a case where we'd like to solve something 100%, but maybe you could only solve it 80% for now.  And so if you can solve the 80% problem of people who have rich content but is relatively static  with an open source approach, because we all love the open web and we all really want to embrace the  open web, then that can help with a ton of publishers, the Washington Posts of the world  and the Inert Times of the world and the Nuzzles of the world. And I take your point because you're  a node.js. Like in some sense, by re-architecting your site, you've just moved toward an API based  system that's sort of- Leo Dion Completely opposite what this is.  Matt Farris Yeah, it's the most sophisticated. In some case, it's the corner case. It's definitely  in that 20%. Now, there are ways where you could use a headless server to sort of say, well, what  do 80% of the people do? They typically hit these 20 pages and you could pre-render those pages and  you convert them into AMP. And I think it's okay if AMP right now doesn't handle 100% of the cases  because that's probably not the intent. The intent is- Leo Dion As it was said yesterday,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you couldn't do Gmail and AMP. Matt Farris

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Leo Dion And there'll always be a linkscars.com. I understand that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Matt Farris But I take your point that you may be chafing a little bit at like, well,  Google's got to approve the JavaScript. I think there is a little bit of a trade-off there because  you want the JavaScript to be minified and small and compact and standardized,  and you don't want bad behavior to creep in. I do think, and what I've heard Richard say is  that people are open to conversations about how to do better or what other new things to incorporate  and all those sorts of things as well. Leo Dion

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't mistake me. I understand where this is coming from and it's coming from a good place.  And Google is, it's very Google-y. It's very engineering-driven. Look, this is a problem.  We know the engineering to solve this problem and we're going to propose this, but there is,  there's this also, there's this appearance problem that often Google is a little tone  deaf to the appearance problem, I think. And there's the appearance problem. By the way,  Facebook and Apple have a similar appearance problem to their proposals in this. You're not  alone. And people are saying, well, no one has to do this. But if suddenly all of the fast,  modern web is AMP, all the cool kids are AMP, you're at a slight disadvantage if you're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Richard Pruitt Maybe the pressure you're putting on is the standards body.  Leo Dion Well, that's why I want to see it at W3C thing. I feel like this needs to come from an

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  independent standards body. Richard Pruitt

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Richard talked about earlier, there's an urgency here.  Leo Dion I understand that as well. And that's the engineer talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The engineer says, we can solve this. Richard Pruitt

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a business idea. It's the rate of growth of app blockers. And notice, by the way,  when you download an app page, if you go to g.co.amppdemo, or if you go to Nuzzle and click  on a New York Times or a Guardian piece, you'll see that the content loads first, the text loads  first, then the photos load, and then the ad will load. But what you see oftentimes is a blank spot.  Now, at least the blank spot is now set geography or architecture so that it doesn't bounce around.  But the reason it's a blank spot for a while is because the ad is so huge and slow and stupid.  Leo Dion No, look, you don't have to explain.  Richard Pruitt It puts pressure on the advertising industry as well. Maybe it also puts pressure on  the standards bodies to try to put up better standards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo Dion And look at the IAB's response to ad blocking.  The ad networks don't want to deal with this. Their answers are very weak, to say the least.  And I understand that we've gotten ourselves into this problem. I also understand that.  And I use an ad blocker. And probably most of the people, far more than the 40% in Germany,  who are watching and listening to the show use ad blockers. And many of them also use NoScript  to block rogue JavaScript. They're willing to have a very reduced experience of the web because  they don't want all that crap. So to them, this would be, I'm sure, positive. But at the same time,  I think there is going to be this issue that it feels to me like a private company is kind of  saying, well, we got a better idea. Let's do this. Richard Pruitt

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Another way to think about that, Leo, is think about all the stuff that Google does with Chrome.  Chrome launched because Firefox was getting a little slow. And Google Fiber even. Even if Google  Fiber doesn't reach every single person in the United States, if it acts as a kick to the back  of the pants of some of the broadband providers. And even with Chrome, Google has the ability to  experiment with some things and see how well they work and iterate really fast on that six-week  release cycle. And then afterwards, once you know that this is the best way to do it, then things  like Speedy can be incorporated into HTTP 2.0. So I totally get where you're coming from, that you  would be worried about any private company, whether it's Facebook or Google, trying to say,  hey, here's the new standard. Everybody adhere to the standard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo Sopcich Well, particularly companies that make their revenue from advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Richard Pruitt Okay, so I think that-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo Sopcich Because by the way, this blocks all ads except approved ads. This is an ad blocker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Leo Sopcich Doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Richard Pruitt It blocks certain kinds of ads like takeover,  I hope the ads we hate that take over the pages.  Leo Sopcich It blocks ads that use JavaScript, which is,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think, most of the ads now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Richard Pruitt No, it doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo Sopcich It doesn't? Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Richard Pruitt Yes, it does.  Leo Sopcich There are paths to that. It obviously changes how things are loaded and constructed.  But again, it's not about taking about capability. Now, yes, we did build into the runtime certain  restrictions with regard to ads, but they're very basic. And I don't think anyone would argue  with them given the objectives of the project. One was, yes, load the content first, the ads  second. Frankly, it'd be great if they can become close to simultaneous. But one of the issues in  the ecosystem today is there's no transparency about the performance of the ad systems.  Leo Sopcich You know, none at all.  Richard Pruitt I think what you're-  Leo Sopcich We also say that the ads have to communicate at predetermined size  so that we can eliminate the jankiness. And we also say that ads can't reach outside the  document, meaning eliminate pop-ups. Okay, we've eliminated pop-ups.  Leo Sopcich Yay!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Richard Pruitt Well, but wait a minute, because most ads also have some JavaScript associated  with it. That JavaScript will not be allowed to run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Leo Sopcich Right. Well, the point is that they're trying to box out a class of ads that will be  allowed. So for it to pass the AMP validation, then it has to not have JavaScript in, apart from  JavaScript that's been loaded secondarily through the core AMP JavaScript.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Richard Pruitt Right. And I'm sure all of Google's ads are compliant.  Leo Sopcich Yes, what's the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Richard Pruitt I'm sure they're not, actually. Not literally today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo Sopcich Oh, that's good to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Richard Pruitt You know, but they're there too. I mean, the idea is there's no restrictions or  demands that people use our ad technology or anyone's specific ad technology. More ad networks  are supporting AMP every day. Clearly, the ad industry has to evolve its own sense of how to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  create and deliver compelling advertising. Leo Sopcich If AMP did nothing else but that,  we should celebrate it. Richard Pruitt

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Leo Sopcich And I think, Leo, the fact that Google's doing this in an open  path means they've got to listen to the feedback they get. And to me, the art of this in terms of  the trust question, I see two parts of this. There's a need for leadership that simply was  not being provided by media because we're the ones who- we in advertisers are the ones who  messed up the web. So that leadership was necessary. Google stepped up. Fine. Okay,  so the next question is governance. And yes, it says in the GitHub right now that it will be  open and so forth. And so far, it's not. So far, yes, you're right. It is Google with consultation.  So the art of this to me is how governance is opened up to active participating publishers.  Now, the next part of this is it's not just the web and publishers. It's also going to be  Africa and South America and places like that as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Leo Sopcich Look, that, in the case of governance, that is there today. But keep in mind with regard  to any project like this, the true governance lies in the balance between satisfying the needs and  desires of the collective group and those who are leading that collective group. And so, yes,  it's up to us if we're going to play that leadership role to prove our ability to be trusted every day.  And I think that's what's happening in the project today. And obviously, we'll look to continue that.  But to suggest it is absolutely not the case that there has not been, say, heavy participation  in terms of the crafting of the spec, in terms of contributions of code, for that matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Paul Matz So Leo, your site supports it. Do you know your personal site?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo Sopcich Well, with known site does, because known does.  Paul Matz Yes, known supports it.  Leo Sopcich But my Squarespace site does not yet. And certainly our own Twitch site, which is really  the only site I care about at this point, does not. And we'll never, as far as I know, support it  because of the way we've architected it. Paul Matz But you can still build that fast,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  as fast as you can. Leo Sopcich

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I don't know. I just spent a quarter of a million dollars on this site. I'm not spending  another. But we're not a text site either. We're not about text. So go ahead, Richard. I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Richard Well, I was going to say one thing about the way that we, the approach that we took to this,  that it allows really for gradual adoption and experimentation. We didn't go out there and say,  here's an entirely new approach for building your websites. Rebuild them all now. We didn't do that.  I mean, you could accomplish that with AMP as it evolves. But that's not what we said. What we said  is here's an approach for you to offer alternate, very fast, mobile friendly pages. So take your  current article pages and spawn an AMP version of that page. Not particularly hard to do. We've  seen companies who have very meager technical staffs handcraft this into their CMS systems in  a matter of days. WordPress has plugins available now. It's not hard to go down this path and at  least experiment and learn and conclude from there. I think it's very important that people  have that opportunity to, in a sense, gradually adopt and experiment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sounds like, sounds like WAP to me. But I don't want to go there. Let's take a break because I  have to do an ad. And you know what? If you want to block it, go right ahead. We're talking to  Richard. It's really nice to have you. Thank you, Richard. And I don't mean to be challenging,  but I think these are questions that our audience and others listening will want to ask you. So I'm  going to try to represent them. Richard Gingras is here, head of news at Google. We're talking  about the new Google AMP initiative. Also, nicely snuck in Mr. Matt Cutts from Google. We're great  to have you too, Matt. It's always nice to see you. Jeff Jarvis is sitting next to him. They're on  the love seat together. Somewhere in the Googleplex and Kevin Marks. And he's at Mozilla right now.  So this is, I feel like we've, this is a, this is a big table. It's good to have you all here.  Our show is brought to you by Zip Recruiter. If you're in the unenviable position of hiring  for your company, you know what it is? It may not be the fun position, but it may be the most  important person in that company because what is a company but its employees hiring the right employee  can make your company hiring the wrong employee. Well, we all know what that's like. You don't want  to do it. So let me tell you, Zip Recruiter makes this easy. First of all, finding the right person  means finding the right site. Zip Recruiter posts to a hundred plus job sites and all the social  networks with a single click of the mouse. So that means you're going to reach out to the largest  possible set of candidates. It also has, they have six million current resumes on their site. So you  within 24 hours, you're going to get matches instantly. And don't worry, they're not calling  you. They're not emailing you. They're all flowing into the Zip Recruiter interface, which makes it  very easy to screen candidates, just eliminate the candidates you don't want, rank the candidates,  and find the right one fast. No wonder more than 400,000 businesses have been using Zip Recruiter  to do their hiring. Get the right person fast. We got an email from Dan, a happy Zip Recruiter  client. He said, the hardest part, this is a quote, the hardest part about running a business  when you need to hire is you need to spend extra time recruiting precisely when you're short staffed.  But with Zip Recruiter, I have gotten quality candidates within 24 hours of posting a job.  Zip Recruiter's website makes this process so much faster by letting me manage candidates in one  place. It's fast. It's easy. It's effective. It's how you hire the right person. And I want you to  try it free right now at ZipRecruiter.com slash twig. Four days free. ZipRecruiter.com slash  twig. We're very happy to have them as part of our show. Great sponsors. ZipRecruiter.com  slash twig. All right. I take back that WAP comment. That was just mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was just mean. Hey, I'm not old enough to remember that. Oh, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You were doing teletext, my friend. Oh, man. I told Jeff and Kevin, I'm going to sit back and  let you guys take this. And I'm sorry that I got a guy and treated myself. But you just channeled  the public. I'm channeling the frustrated public trying to figure out what the hell this means.  What does it mean to somebody? I'll ask this of Kevin. What does something like this mean  to somebody like me? What we built was a headless website. It has Drupal as the CMS, but that's not  visible to the public. That's merely serving an API that is node.js. The website is node.js that  pulls from Drupal using the API. It's a consumer, just like our apps are going to be consumers.  In fact, there are three now Apple TV apps that consume the data from the Drupal backend.  Kevin, could I make an AMP site or do I have to throw out my node code?  Oh, you're muted. I know you're saying pearls of wisdom, but I only see...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sorry, I muted myself because I was typing and I'm using this computer mic.  So what you would do is you would... You've got a templating system on your website somewhere. You  want templates that are being generated by something on the... By SAS. Yep. In node. Yeah.  So you would generate a parallel template that is the AMP version for each of your pages  that would have less JavaScript in it. That's easy. That's easy. And follow the spec. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I did it with... Because we're allowed to run JavaScript server side. I mean,  node is a server side solution. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Quite. So we're allowed to run any arbitrary  scripting on our side. It's really the client that can't. Yeah. You're not going to get blocked  in any way. No, I understand. But there's a kind of blocking if some sites are clean and fast and  amped and shiny and new, and then some sites are like the old web. There's a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The question is today, I asked... Let's go back to a very basic point because I started this  really entirely about how do we create a healthy ecosystem for publishers, right? And wind back  from there. So when we talk about that, you say, this isn't about shiny new way pages. This is  about making pages fast. Yeah. Right? Yes. You mentioned earlier, I go back to the days of  steam powered modems and broadcasts. I remember someone asking me back then,  because we could adjust this stuff, what's the ideal access time for a piece of content?  And the answer is quite simple. It's instantaneous. Yes. Because anything less than instantaneous  simply degrades engagement. Yes. So when I look at the ecosystem and when I look at the need for  publishers to drive engagement, to have their content be more readily available on all kinds  of platforms such that they can drive engagement from their content, I just fail to see the  negatives in the approach to that or the benefits to that. Yeah. Here's the moral hazard that does

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  exist. And Richard was asked this at the product announcement in New York. Will Google favor AMP  over other content? And the answer was no. Good. But Google already favors fast over slow, period.  Right. So the issue there is that works wonderfully until the day when, let's say the way you  game this, because we have the king of understanding games here, the way to game this is that suddenly  spam becomes the lightest content on the web, the fastest lightest content on the web. Well, if that  yields bad search results with fast crap proceeding a slower quality, then search won't work anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That'll be an issue for Google at that point. Right. And in our ranking, we tend to use speed  as a second order effect because we want to return the results that people most want. And so as you're  approaching that hockey puck, you're moving towards the ideal page. The ideal page would also be fast.  And so just being fast alone won't help you rank above other people. But if you have every other  thing doing really, really well, plus you're fast, all other things being equal, then yeah, people  would be happier to get that content faster. And so I think it's okay that that would rank a little

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  bit higher as well. But it tends to be a second order effect. I'm going to have to wrap in a few  minutes. And I thought I'd offer at least a closing comment here. I take the expression of concerns  to heart. And I take the expression that Google has to be a trusted player in this regard to heart.  And I believe we'll do so. I do think that it's also important to understand that when it comes  to the publishing ecosystem in Google, Google is one of the unique companies that actually shares  a very common objective with these companies today. Right. Google's objective and need, frankly,  is for an open and rich ecosystem of knowledge. If that's not there, then frankly, products like  Google search aren't terribly relevant when you get right down to it. Right. That's why this is  an important issue for us. If you want to look at it in terms of our direct self-interest. But that's  also the same objective of a publisher today. Because if they don't have access to an open  ecosystem for distribution, if they have to basically go through proprietary platforms to  find opportunities to build audiences, then they will have lost. Right. So we have that common  objective. How do we take and make sure the World Wide Web remains that vibrant, open ecosystem of  knowledge that benefits all? And that's how we're approaching this. And yes, we're a private company.  We have business interests. But I do think that that philosophy and that core similar objective  is something that's very important to considering our role in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well said. Thank you, Richard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's been a pleasure. I wish I could spend more time, but I keep getting pinged I'm late for

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  something else. Okay. No, that's great. We're really glad we could talk to you. Thank you, Richard.  Thank you. Richard Gingras. He's head of news at Google and one of the people behind the  AMP initiative, which is exactly what we have been talking. Thank you, Richard. Yeah, we appreciate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think I think we can convince, I know, I know Kevin has to go too, but I think we can convince

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Matt to stick around a little longer. Good. Thank God because you and me would be boring.  That sounds good. Kevin, you have a little more time or do you want to take off?  I'll hang on a couple of minutes. Sure. All right. Yeah, I think it's a good conversation.  And I'm really glad you were here, Kevin, because I know that. So yeah, he's talking about trust.  I trust Kevin Marx to represent the best interests of open standards of an open web of free flowing  open web, where it's equal to all. So, you know, I look to you, Kevin, for leadership from you on

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  this in this regard. Right. And so the thing I was saying about is you would have to create a parallel  template for your site for this, which means that's not necessarily much work, but it adds to  maintenance for your site. And then the other problem is to support the Apple variant of where  you've got to create the feed that they like to call, that's another one. And Facebook. And to  support the Facebook one, that's another one. And suddenly we're, it feels like browser wars  again. It's like, I've got to create a page for each browser. Because these things are effective,  because they're restricted subsets of HTML, they're effectively browsers with different support  standards. And that's the piece that makes it a bit awkward. Yeah. And as usual, there's always

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  an XKCD gloss on this. How standards proliferate situation. There are 14 competing standards,  14 ridiculous. We need to develop one universal standard that covers everyone's use cases. Yeah,  situation. There are 15 competing standards. And that's another thing that worries me. That's why  I, you know, I understand standards bodies move slowly. They're highly politicized organizations.  They probably don't come up with the best engineering solution. And Google is all about

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  the best engineering. Sometimes they do. I mean, I think that that's a little unfair. But the thing  is, they converge more slowly over time is the issue. And, you know, I'm at a W3C working group  at the moment where we're trying to work on social standardization, which is one of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But do you agree, Kevin, that maybe this would be most appropriate? Wouldn't it be great if  Facebook, Apple and Google would hand this all over to the W3C, which then could say, good,  we were going to look at the best case, best usage scenarios. All right, here's the standard.  Now we've got a standard, one standard that everybody can adhere to. Wouldn't that be better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's, you know, that's what we've got. But that's what HTML5 is.  That's what got us here. Yeah.  And the problem is that people then find a loophole in that, which is they inject  terabytes of JavaScript into their pages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, so there's a lot of bad actors out there. Most of them advertising companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like everything else, if we've got Mac cuts here, it's a system that if it can be gamed,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it will be gamed, right? There's always bad actors. And so I think trying to find that 80%  solution that, you know, cuts out most of the bad actors or the bad practices. And then, yes,  there will be new problems that result as a result of that. But, you know, over time,  the web gets faster or the web gets better or the search results get more relevant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the market votes, right? This is the chance for the market to say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  good, we want fast pages. Yep. Yeah. And also, you know, people,  I don't want to because Kevin's right in their offices and I love them and there's a lot of  great people there. But Firefox got kind of bloated because everybody threw everything in.  Right. So Chrome, let's not forget, was a response to what was trying to  operate as an open standard that didn't work that well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the market voted and Firefox responded. And in fact, now it's much, much faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's why it's a good thing. So I don't know that this is why I think that the key to me about  AMP is the sooner Google can visibly, demonstrably open up the governance, the better it is for the  adoption. But again, I'm going to repeat one more time. Right now, listen, this was coincidental to  be able to do this with news publishers. AMP's not about news at all. AMP's about a faster web.  So there's tons of other interests out there that publishers are not going to be a good

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  representative for. Well, it's not just faster web, particularly for mobile. Right. But OK, so  thank you with known. Thank you to Aaron and Ben, who made a very nice site. And I use with known  as one of my content management systems. This is my page. This is my page unknown. This is my page  on AMP. It's aesthetically not quite as nice. Now is that I guess that's their fault. They

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  could have better templates. Well, it's constraints on what AMP is trying to do. So they took out the  background image because you're trying to make it leaner. That's part of the point. Yeah. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what AMP's called. That's speed. OK. But if you give me the choice between that,  my original site and the AMP version of it, I'm going to choose this site. And I don't think it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that much leaner. Well, maybe. But if you're on a desktop with a fast Wi-Fi connection.  Maybe on mobile it's not. Right. If you're on 2G or 3G, it can be kind of helpful. And it costs

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  people. Here's the other thing. It costs people money. You're downloading two to ten megs for a

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  page. What ADK will do. Well, known is pretty lean, to be fair. But yeah. In other parts of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  country, in other parts of the world, in Africa and in Latin America and in parts of Asia, that's a  real, real issue. And it cuts people out of the information and the substance is actually there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, and Leo, I'll just take a second to talk a little bit of smack about Google, which is,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you know, I'll try. You can't. You love Google. And you know what? It's hard for me to talk smack

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  about Google, too. No, you do a very good job. OK. So let me try. I think in internal discussions,  there's room to roll out like one web wide standard a year or so. You know, it's no follow  or whatever. And there have been complex things in the past, like escape fragment, where you want  to be able to crawl JavaScript. Back before Google could process JavaScript, we had these  pretty complex ways where people could say run your headless server and use escape fragment. And  we've finally gotten rid of most of that because Google's good enough to be able to process and  execute the JavaScript now. So it's always tricky. I think Google does have the best of intentions.  I think you probably saw Richard getting a little earnest because he's like, no, we're trying to help.  We're trying to make things better. And I take the point that Google doesn't always appear that way  from the outside. And sometimes people see things that are going on in YouTube or, you know, DMCA  complaints or stuff. And of course, they're worried about Google and whether it's too large or whether  it's not executing on things the way it can. But I think one thing that's a good indicator,  a good litmus test, is how well does Google execute and iterate based on feedback? And so  at this point, when we get the feedback on how to improve things, I think that will be a critical  thing. And no matter how well our heart is in the right place, I would love if we could find  representative people from across the web who could then say, look, we are going to have the  web's best interests in mind. And we're going to say this JavaScript is fine or it's really,  you know, efficient, but here's this practice or here's this set of JavaScript, which can do  really annoying, really slow things. And we're just going to allow that. And in my mind, it  doesn't have to be Google that makes those decisions. If you can find more people with  the web's best interests at heart, that's even better. We've said this a lot before that Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  needs to get better at communicating so that we understand it. It's good intentions.  And what doesn't work, and I don't think Richard was doing this. In fact, I think Richard is a  good person to speak for Google, as are you obviously, Matt, is what doesn't serve though  is a hand waving saying, no, no, no, no, just trust us. It's fine. We're doing what we're doing  is in the web's best interest. You know, you can't do the hand waving. You really, this is, if this  is going to work, and I want it to, I think AMP is a great idea. It's going to take a lot of effort.  And I think Richard was very much aware of this, a lot of effort and outreach and communication.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I saw that, I saw that Leo in the last two weeks at News Geist where there were a lot of  publishers there. There was a lot of confusion about it. Number one. Number two, somebody I know,  you know, is off the record. So somebody I know who was there,  told me today, you know, I left thinking, I don't know if I need to worry about this for a year.  And then when he heard the full explanation this time around, he said to me this morning, oh no,  no, no, I'm going to pay attention to this right now. And I get it. And I understand why it's  important. So that communication is critical. The openness is critical. The other thing that's  to happen is that the Valley itself has to get its act together because the Valley is seen as a  monolithic enemy in places like Germany and your regulators there. And so it does not serve them  well for Facebook and Apple and Google to be separate. So part of News Geist is we said,  we really, we publishers should convene a meeting where we invite the top platforms in and we raise  these issues. And we take a role of leadership here because what's happening is Google stepped  into a vacuum. And it's a vacuum that we allowed and we publishers in fact paused because we weren't  fixing the web. We broke the web. And we helped advertisers break the web. So we've got to take  a leadership role in this. And that's very Pollyanna of me, I know. But I'm going up the road to that  other place tomorrow. And that's my message is we've got to build bridges, not only between  East Coast and West Coast, Europe and the US publishing and technology. There's going to be  bridges among the technology companies too. Agreed. Now what maybe I'm going to do now  is this, Matt, I'm in here and I'm snuck in. I'm going to go walking around looking over all  the cubicles and see if I can see anybody dog fooding fixes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Dog fooding what? So on the other hand,  isn't it great that Google says, oh, we found this little manufacturing issue or I have no idea what  happened with Pixel C. But they want to make sure it's right and they're not going to give you any

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  USB-C cables that are, you know. I know. I like that guy. Man, the king of USB-C. The Google  engineer who's writing reviews on all the bad cables. So when do we get the Pixel C, Matt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I, well, they said by the end of the year, but I would rather have Google prioritize it being right and making it actually well.  That's true. I want it. I want it.  But it's in the coming close to the holidays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm budgeted for it. Yeah. Yeah. So I want to get that in here while I'm inside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And thank you, Kevin Marks, for doing the metrics on my known site. And the problem I gather is that  I don't have a giant one something megabyte image, background image on this site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The weird thing was the AMP version seemed to be loading more slowly for me.  Oh great.  Let's just send them a bug report there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And thanks to Ben Wordmiller and Aaron Joe Ritchie, who do a great job at known. And the fact,  I didn't even know that known is AMP enabled is pretty impressive. I think that's great.  Here's an example, though, of how the world maybe misunderstands Google and why this is a difficult  communications issue. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, which I support and believe in,  but I totally disagree with this, says Google is deceptively tracking students' internet browsing.  And not only that, they sent it to the FDC, the Federal Trade Commission.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they track. What I don't understand about the story in part is because we do it through  Google, track is a weird word because they record what all of us search for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, apparently there's a student privacy pledge, which is a legally enforceable document  Google agreed to. Of course, there's a lot of Google in schools, right? Where Google promises  to not collect, use or share students' personal information except when needed for legitimate  educational purposes or with parental permission. But according to the EFF, Google minds students  browsing data and other information and uses it for the company's own purposes. And of course,  that own purpose is dark intent, right? It sounds bad in the same way that it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  bad anytime you read terms of use. The one thing I'll say is I read that blog post and I have to  admit I didn't quite get what the complaint was. But if you go and you click on the FTC complaint,  it's a little more clear. They say one, two and three. Now one of them, the middle one was,  they didn't like that Chrome sync was turned on on Chromebooks. I think maybe by default for  education and I don't know whether that's true or not. But to me, the whole point of Chromebooks  is that they're fungible. And so you want Chrome sync turned on and if the kid spills high C over  his keyboard, he needs to be able to pick up another Chromebook and carry on with his project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's not tracking. That's the feature. That's the value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love the EFF and full disclosure, I'm actually doing some fundraising for the EFF.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and I'm a monthly donor. I love the EFF.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they're fantastic. And so I definitely will read through the complaint and if there was

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  something inadvertent or something that... Their issue is that Chrome sync stores  on Google servers the entire browsing history. But I agree with you. That's also a critical

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  feature to using a Chromebook. I love the EFF too. They presented this as if they were some  exception to how they were treating young people and they were doing this for nefarious ends. But  this is what Chrome does. Now if that's not compatible, if there's an issue there, then  explore where the harm is and what to do about it. I haven't read it all yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they also say part of the problem is that it's on by default, but there's even a problem  because the school administrator could turn it on even if it were off by default.  And so that would be a problem. Should school administrators turn Chrome sync on, Google could  then recommence collecting student personal information. I don't think there's any technology  you could put in a school, an iPad or a Chromebook or a Windows or a Mac, that isn't going to in some  form or fashion do this. I'm sure Google can respond to this and will respond to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is how Chrome OS operates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I could see where this is a little frustrating for Google because this is kind of part of the Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it is the Chromebook philosophy to be able to be synced on any Chromebook you go to.  And far be it for me to speculate on any kind of legal stuff. Certainly once you have the  interaction of syncing in Chrome with Google Apps or Google Apps for Education or something special  for kids who are under 18 or something like that, maybe it's just the case that policies like the  administrator should have the ability to turn on whatever they want, do or don't account for  whatever this pledge was or something like that. So I love the EFF. I'm glad that they brought it up.  I don't know whether they brought it up with Google before they filed with the FTC,  but they're always fighting for what they think is right. And a lot of times people feel like,  oh, the EFF is always pro-Internet or pro-Google. I don't feel that way. And I'm glad whenever they  fight the occasional hand that loves that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The clear solution to this is have some sort of escrow, third party escrow,  sort of store the sync data instead of Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's a show title. The Hand That Loves Them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Hand That Loves Them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a whole stuff there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We should just go home now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We all love the EFF.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Matt, have you gotten your Google Fi Lego or did you turn on Google Fi?  Because the last time we talked you were in the, you weren't sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have Google Fi. I have the Nexus 5X. And I was just looking at Jeff's because he's got the Nexus  6P. And I want to know, you know, oh, how does it feel? So I was, you know, checking it out.  I like the 6P.  It seems awfully nice.  It is.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Battery life's a little bit better too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. So Google Fi is wonderful. I love the Lego, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I was going to ask you about. Did you get your Lego kit yet? I didn't.  No.  I'm waiting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think you might opt to buy it through Google Fi. Buy the phone through Google Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's confusing. It says if you ordered your SIM or a phone with a SIM on November 9th or later,  I think that's a mistake. I think, or you ordered it earlier but it activated by November 19th,  you're covered.  So, and you couldn't use Google Fi unless you either got a phone from Google Fi or a SIM  from Google Fi. So I think we're all going to get it is what I'm going to say. It is a  Project Fi Lego kit that you build and you get a stand, a charging stand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Next time I'm going to the Schwag store. I'm hoping they have a few extras in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You didn't turn on the Fi, huh, Jeff?  I didn't turn it on, no.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because of the AT&T, AT&T is increasing its cost for the unlimited from  30 to 35 and as the story said about it, it's still a good deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I like Fi. I've been saving a lot of money on Fi.  So, but I want to get, you know, I think I have to read the, I think Pocket Now,  which is the article I'm reading for, got the verbiage wrong. It sounds like as long as you  activate it by November 19th, you're going to get it. It's only people who activate it after that  point makes, was what makes sense to me. Who won't get it. So I think-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As far as I'm concerned, the Project Fi people should send you all Lego kits.  No, no, no. I know, but I do, I don't, no more string pulling. You've already done too much for

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  us, Matt. You got us invitations. And by the way, I want to thank Matt Cutts because you also helped  us solve our Google search problem. We did a dumb thing with a wild card that you discovered and,  and then the search team discovered and we thank you because we got that fixed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's nice to have friends in high places. Well, and it's funny because Barry Schwartz was on,  and you know, so everybody was looking at the webmaster console.  That's so funny. We can take this offline. That's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love it. That's, that's awesome. Google is going to do-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think we probably have about 10, 12 minutes or so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, we'll wrap it up. We'll do a couple of fast ones. The Santa tracker is up. Google's doing  this again this year. They have a really fun page, 21 days, 10 hours, 53 minutes and 10 seconds  for Santa to arrive. And it's, they did this last year. Looks like a lot of new games  and fun in here. And then of course you can track Santa on Christmas Eve. That is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  santatracker.google.com. The site was redesigned entirely using Polymer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nice. And probably AMP enabled. No, Polymer. Yeah, I don't know.  I don't think so. I think it's Polymer rather than AMP.  Don't do this on mobile kids. Mom and dad will get pissed off.  That is true Santa.  No, they didn't. Don't start this. Did we mention the Verizon? We did. We mentioned the Verizon.  Are you leaving, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm going to head out now, but thanks for having me on. That was an interesting conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So glad we could get you here. Thank you, Kevin Marks. And indiewebcamp.com. Find out about the  next IndieWebCamp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  IndieWebCamp is tomorrow in San Francisco.  Good Lord.  We're combining it with the social working group day because a bunch of people are coming in for  that anyway. And tonight there's a website club in Portland and San Francisco. The Brighton and  Swedish ones have already happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you, Kevin Marks. KevinMarks.com, IndieWebCamp.com.  Bye.  Great to see you. By the way, another way that Google is speeding things up, Chrome for Android,  you can turn on a new feature that will just skip images.  And you know what? Saves 70%.  So, and I'm not making that up. Congratulations to Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan.  As I think everybody knows by now, certainly anybody on Facebook, you couldn't get away from  it on Facebook yesterday, had a baby Max on Tuesday. And I hope Max learns to read because  Mark wrote her an extremely long letter, which he posted on Facebook. And in fact,  he buried the lead, which was that Priscilla and Mark are going to give away 99% of their  fortune. Sorry, kid, your inheritance. They're going to give away 99% of their Facebook shares,  which are currently 45 billion, but of course we'll probably go up to advance their mission,  which is personalized learning, curing disease, connecting people and building strong communities.  They've formed the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. And of course, cynics all around the world said,  it's just a tax plot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Your act is terrible. It just really irritates the hell out of me. Oh,  was writing about it today. It's just, geez, man. And yeah, I mean,  Neil Dash has some decent points about how you can do it well or do it badly. Okay, that's fine.  Well, it's the biggest contribution forever. And we snark out of even for that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Geez.  When you give away 40 billion, then you can make fun of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And you know what? If he gets a tax break, fine.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But who knows if $45 billion is more than 4% of his adjusted gross income? I don't know.  Actually, it's more than 4% now. It keeps going up. WhatsApp. Have they turned this off yet? It  was blocking links to Telegram on Android. I hope that that was a bug.  I hope it was too.  Because Telegram, of course, a competitor to WhatsApp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hopefully, well, usually these things, often they're mistakes. So I'm going to hope it's a  mistake because that's a pretty, it looks bad. The optics on it are bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it was ham-fisted because it was just anything that had the word Telegram in it.  I mean, it was more than, it wasn't a very, if it was a regular expression,  it was poorly written. Let's put it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It made me go to you to Telegram and be like, I've got my username on Telegram, right?  I need to remember that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like Telegram. Yeah. I'm a big Telegram fanatic. Although I've been using WeChat  because I want to get hip with the kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Same here. I just, I just, I did the same thing. I just wanted to use WeChat again yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's got great stickers. That's all I care about.  And Gadgets Redesign launches tomorrow. Is it AMP? I don't know.  But they're doing, yeah, that is the show title. They're doing what The Verge also did.  And it worries me a little bit. A lot of these tech sites doing this,  instead of just covering gadgets, they're going to have a focus beyond gadgets and  consumer technology. They're going to cover how technology affects music, politics, sexuality,  privacy. So, well, The Verge did this too. And they slowly, you know, I think the goal of these  sites is to become more mainstream. And folks, you have my promise. We're going to get less  mainstream. I don't, more focus on geekery, less focus on that other crap. Finally, and this is a  huge story which may or may not materialize, but we're watching carefully. Apparently, according to  the Wall Street Journal, the Yahoo board is meeting this week. In fact, even as we speak to discuss  selling the core business. And I imagine some, some are saying-  That part of it has no value. Yeah, because their value is mostly in Alibaba  and, and Yahoo Japan. But there's also some speculation that along with the core business,  Marissa Meyer is on the block as well. So we'll see, we'll see what happens there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The list of speculated acquirers included what?  Um, Verizon, IAC, which is Barry Diller, News Corp, Time Inc.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. And Disney. Ask Yahoo. Disney. Time Inc. Time Inc. That's AOL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Microsoft and AOL both put bids in that were failed bids for Yahoo over the last few years,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  right? So here's the question. Marissa's getting a lot of crap and given the performance of the  company, I understand that, but I still say that if I were given charge of Yahoo, which she was,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I still don't know what I would have done. No, she was given, she was, but she knew this going in,  an almost impossible assignment. Um, meanwhile, Jerry Yang is off on his island.  Yeah. God, I got out of there.  And then they could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and there was some article in recode or something where they quoted a bunch of  former Yahoo execs and they were all anonymous, but none of them claimed that they had any idea  how Yahoo could do better. The one thing I would say is, you know, Marissa is incredibly smart,  works incredibly hard. If she can't turn Yahoo around, then maybe it wasn't possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's a good attitude. Yeah. And probably, probably the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And she's going to suffer for it now. Sad.  That's the breaks of business. I get that. But, uh, and maybe she shouldn't have taken it unless  she had the strategy. But the thing to me was everybody before she took it over says,  what's Yahoo? And we're still saying, what's Yahoo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of sad because Yahoo is a great name and great brand. They have many very

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  successful content sites to this day. Um, I mean, it was pretty much in the same boat,  but Tim Armstrong, you know, found a, found a desert Island to land it on.  And so he comes out smelling fine. He sold the Verizon.  Even though AOL is pretty much like what the hell is AOL?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Finally, it may be the beginning of the end and I'm sure you'll be very happy to hear

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  this Matt cuts of flash. Oh yeah. Even Adobe says don't use flash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even Adobe finally renames flash professional to animate and says, you know, this HTML5 thing,  it might have legs. So do we thank Steve jobs for this?  Yeah. He began this five years ago and I think the success of iOS and the fact that it has never  supported flash has to be a big part of this. And thank goodness, even YouTube doesn't use

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  flash anymore. Right. It's a lot. I think there's still a YouTube interface, but a large fraction of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it goes through HTML5. Yeah. That's a good thing. You know, everybody's moving in that direction.  So this, this is probably the, as, as one tech blog reported the nail in the coffin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Finally, somebody else said now Java applets are up next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We can, but hope. All right. Let's take a little break. And we'll, we'll wrap this up. If, if Matt,  you have a, anything you'd like to talk about what you're up to, your 30 day challenge,  so nice to see you as a surprise during the break, I'm giving you time to think.  And Jeff's got a number. I'll come up with a pick. I've actually got a couple of nice new Android  apps. I like, although I hate doing Android stuff, Jason, how because you know, you just,  you can just nail it with all about Android every Tuesday night and they've carefully  scheduled the shows so that yours comes the night before. I'm loving this new trend though,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  of Google unveiling new news on Tuesday instead of Wednesday. Then we get the breaking news also.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. All about Android 5 PM Pacific 8 PM Eastern 20 actually 0 100 a UTC on the  Twitter TV. By the way, I guess this is an update from a recode that came out today. The Yahoo board  is backing Meyer, so she may not be out. The journal said there were some concerns that she  might be out, but apparently, and you know that nobody knows more about what's going on inside  Yahoo than Kara Swisher and she says, despite Wall Street noise and sale rumors, Yahoo board  backs Meyer. So that's good news. I'm, I feel like we're all rooting for her and I'm rooting for Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We'll see. Whatever it is, we root for it. Yeah. Emerson. Yeah. Yeah. Whatever, whatever that thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is, whatever the heck it is, they brought back, didn't they bring back that great billboard on  101 in San Francisco? The Yahoo billboard, I think is back. Yeah, I think so. Yeah. So that means  everything's okay. They're resurging. Doesn't it? It's their 20th for their 20th anniversary. They  brought back Yahoo. The best billboard in the world. It was taken down four years ago.  So it looks like a campy roadside motel sign all lit up with a vacancy word. That's not maybe,  maybe they Marissa might want to change that to no vacancy. I'm just saying  our show today brought to you by Braintree. If you're a mobile app developer, you know that  challenges we've just been talking about, but one of the big challenges that you don't need to worry  about that you can just let go and let Braintree. If you're working about mobile apps, worried about  that, you know, security is important, making your users comfortable is important. That bad statistic  that says 70% of mobile carts are abandoned before they click buy that problem. All of that goes away  with Braintree and Braintree's v.0 STK. You know who uses Braintree? Uber uses Braintree. Lyft uses  Braintree. Hotels tonight and Airbnb. When competitors use the same solution, you know it's  the best. And what is the secret sauce at Uber? It's how easy it is to pay. GitHub uses Braintree.  Pinterest, those viable pins on Pinterest, that's Braintree. One of the reasons they use it, it's  easy to integrate just a few lines of code. It's fast. It's easy. Your customers will love it because  they can use anything. Apple Pay, Android Pay, PayPal, Venmo, credit cards, even Bitcoin. And if  something new comes along, Braintree will support that too. You'll see fewer abandoned carts and  more sales with Braintree's best-in-class mobile checkout experience. Try for yourself the Braintree  sandbox is waiting for you. Braintreepayments.com slash twig. Works with every platform. It works  beautifully, elegantly. It's secure. Payouts are fast. In fact, you're going to get your first  $50,000 in transactions fee free. Braintreepayments.com slash twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have you thought of something, Matt Cutts? I have. You're showing off using two phones right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've got my Moto X and my Nexus 5X. Double-handing it. So if you search for a webmaster blog,  the number one result by organic ranking is our webmaster blog. And the post that I'm  showing right now is really good. Every few years, so we do internal ranking and rating within  Google. We have a whole set of evaluators who say, this is a good result. That's a bad result.  I prefer the left side. I prefer the right side. And those don't affect our search rankings. But  every few years, that rater guide will leak. And people are like, oh my goodness, let's see what's  changed since the last rater guide. And so a little while ago, we had a version leak. And  finally, we said, you know what? Let's just publish the most recent version. And so there's  some updated stuff, our search quality rating guides. Now, you might not want to read 160 pages  about how people are supposed to evaluate stuff as high quality or low quality. But if that's the  sort of thing that appeals to you, now you can get it directly from the source. You don't have to go  and find a bootleg copy on Torrent or anything like that. And I think the biggest surprise,  I remember this quote from a few years ago, the biggest surprise is that there really isn't any  surprise in there. It's just trying to encode the sort of natural intuition that you'd have. But  I like that it's one of the ways that Google tries to be transparent about how it evaluates

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the quality of websites. Fantastic. And you can go there and find out how your website's doing  on the Webmaster Tools.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, on the Webmaster Console. Give it a shot. That's if, for example, you accidentally removed,  you know, you could self-diagnose that problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We should have, shouldn't we? Oh, God. I'm so embarrassed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you want to tell the story about how that happened, Leo? Or do you not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, I don't mind telling it. I think I may not get the details right. I think  we didn't, whoever did it, and you know what, we still don't know who did it. We wanted to restrict  the search index from some area. I can't, maybe you, do you remember, Matt? I have the email that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you sent us. I can look. So basically, you can remove a URL in the Webmaster Console. And so  you could say something like twit.tv slash file, for example. And that would also match twit.tv

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  files. It was a pre-published. See, that's what we didn't understand, is that it's kind of wildcarded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So in that particular case, we probably could have been more clear. A lot of people do this because  they've got the production-ready version of their site that they don't want to show up until it's  exactly right. So they have it blocked, and then they forget to remove it. Or, you know, they'll  accidentally allow the test version of their site or something like that. In this case, it was

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  something a little silly. We wanted to remove twit.tv slash show. But when we submitted that,  we didn't know that that not just show, but shows, which is the URL we use. And so that's why we  didn't have any search results for our shows. Yeah. But Webmaster Console is the great interface

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  where you can find out the latency of your pages, all sorts of stuff. And I'll just put one quick  plug. We do this thing called Webmaster Hangouts. So John Mueller and a bunch of other people do  this thing where if you have questions several times a month, you know, they're scheduling them  now for the month of December, they do them in English, they do them in German. And so you can  show up and you can say, I've got this question, why does Google do it this way? Or what's wrong  with my site? And basically people try to interact and give you direct answers to your question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm so embarrassed. As well you should be. So boneheaded. You call yourself an expert.  Oh my God. Well, and Google should put you in charge of AMP? Ha! Ha! See? You see? Richard was

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  right. Yeah. Good thing Google's standing between me and you, McCourt. What's your pick of the week  or your number of the week, I should say? My number of the week. Well, since we have generous  tech executives, it's very, by the way, very good job here. Jason's doing a splitting Matt and me up  from a two shot. I'm really going to get rid of it. Sorry, Jason. Deal with that, Jason. Oh, man.  So, sorry. Ev Williams sold a lump of his Twitter stock and just gave 46 plus million dollars to his  charity organization. Wow. Good for you, Ev. It's a good thing. We have the technology industry,  I think, finally stepping up to its role in philanthropy. And during the week we had Bill  Gates and Zuckerberg and many others signing up for the AMP initiative. So I think that the  oligarchs of Silicon Valley are, as I say, are probably stepping up. And so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  good generous act from Ev as well. Really good. And it shows now that Mark Zuckerberg is an order

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  of magnitude richer than Ev Williams. You had to rub it in. The guy has something nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, that's three orders of magnitude. Sorry. By the way, I'll be giving 37 million dollars to  charity as soon as I make it. A lot of people say that iOS has more apps than Android. My  experience has been it's pretty close to parity. But every once in a while there comes along an app  on iOS that there isn't on Android. And one of those apps, and I really love it on iOS,  that I couldn't use on my Nexus 6P is called Storehouse. And it is a really great way to  make slideshows, to make stories out of images and text and movies. I've got the camera a little

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  funky today. Apologies. We didn't get a chance to set it up. No, that's all right. And I have a few

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  here. I made a storehouse of our dinner. Where is my camera? There it is. You don't need a  microphone, right? For an audio show? The point is you can do, it's a really great way to make a  slideshow. I really like it. It's now available on Android. It's free. It's a great social network  there. You can share. Here's a recipe I put in there. It's kind of a really, a little bit like  Microsoft's Sway, kind of reminiscent of that. But I just feel like this is a little slo-mo in there.  I just really feel like this is a great little program. And I like them a lot. And I'm actually  glad that they're doing well. TechCrunch named them the best mobile application this year. They  got an Apple Design Award last year and they're now on Android. And free storehouse. It's my pick  of the week. Hey, Matt, it was so nice to see you. Great to see you, Matt. Thank you for dropping in.  Oh, man. Every day is a good day with Matt. Would Google let you just be a regular on this show?  That would be a lot of fun. Yeah, that would be the best. We can do that. I'll get you a love seat built for three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you have Jeff here. I'm like, oh, I got a crash. Well, if Mac is going to be a job at

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google, then I'll be here all the time. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Nice to see you both. Thank you so much,  Jeff Jarvis, BuzzMachine.com, for arranging Richard Gingras to join us. That was fascinating.  Yeah, it was. It's the kind of outreach I think Google needs to do in a lot of different venues  to let people know what's going on and it's good and safe and all that stuff.  And I thank also Kevin Marks for being here. Thanks to you too. We do this week at Google. It's, I think,  the most intellectual of the shows we do thanks to people like Professor Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't say much, LeBorg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's also the snarkiest show we do. You can join us every Wednesday afternoon, 1.30 Pacific, 4.30  Eastern Time, 21.30 UTC on twit.tv. Join the chat room, irc.twit.tv.
