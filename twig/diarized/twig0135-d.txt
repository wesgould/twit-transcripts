Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I dream of Jarvis.  This week in Google is brought to you by the National Security Agency.  This week in Google is brought to you by Ford.  Featuring the EcoBoost engine with turbocharger and direct injection.  Look for EcoBoost on the 2012 Explorer and Edge, the 2013 Escape, and at Ford.com slash technology.  It's time for Twig this week in Google to show the covers Google.  Oh boy, is there a lot to talk about this week.  But also other services like Facebook and Twitter, the cloud.  But it's not social media. It's whatever Jeff and Gina want to talk about is really what it is.  Jeff Jarvis is here. He is of course Professor of Journalism at the City University of New York.  And the author of Public Parts, a fabulous book all about life in the public. Great to have you.  Always wonderful. Highlight of the week.  Highlight of my week too. Gina Trapani is also here from SmarterWear.org.  And she's the author of Think Up App.  Steve Martin is going to join us. One of your customers.  Is that today?  Yeah.  Excellent.  Well and he used, and the reason it's relevant is that he contacted me about how do I save my tweets.  I might want to write a book.  And I said I know who could do it.  Gina Trapani. You hooked him up with Think Up.  And he wrote the book.  So I don't have a copy yet. But I'll have to ask is there an acknowledgement?  I'm sure there is to Think Up.  Speaking of books, we have somebody that I'm very excited to talk to with us as well.  Rebecca McKinnon is a journalist and the author of a brand. Hello Rebecca. Good to see you.  Hi Eric. Good to see you.  Also a Schwartz Senior Fellow at the New America Foundation.  She co-founded Global Voices, which is about the coolest thing in the world.  And is the author of a brand new book called Consent of the Network.  In fact, I think your ears must have been burning because we've been talking about you on this show for a couple of weeks now.  Oh really?  Yeah. Well, you make some very relevant points.  So welcome Rebecca.  Thanks very much.  And in fact, this week is probably a good week to have Rebecca on because Google's in all sorts of doo doo.  In fact, they're now facing a class action lawsuit over the Safari cookie circumvention.  Privacy is the subject. But this is not just about privacy.  The subtitle is the worldwide struggle for Internet freedom.  It's a balancing act, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Absolutely. I mean, we have a situation now where our lives as citizens, not only, you know,  our personal lives and our jobs and our businesses depend on the Internet, but our politics increasingly depend on the Internet.  And the Internet is primarily, you know, we're depending on these privately owned platforms and services to conduct our politics more and more.  And so there's this issue of how do we ensure that the Internet evolves in a way that's really compatible with the kind of political values that we have  and is compatible with the kind of rights that we believe we are entitled to and that people around the world are risking their lives to achieve every day.  And how do we make sure that not only governments are, you know, respecting our rights when they're seeking to regulate the Internet,  but also that companies are thinking about how their various commercial choices and cool features and so on are going to affect people politically all over the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have a unique perspective because for nine or ten years you were stationed in Beijing as a correspondent for CNN.  The years the Internet arose, 1992 to 2001.  That's right.  So that must have been a very interesting perspective.  Were you following what was happening in the U.S. with the Internet at the same time as you were in Beijing or were you focused on China?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I was covering China. I was, you know, we were just covering, we were responsible for covering China. I wasn't a tech reporter at all.  Right.  So I read the news. So I, you know, as a consumer and a user of the Internet, as it appeared, I was sort of aware generally, but not as an Internet techie specialist person.  But it was really interesting because the commercial Internet showed up in China in 1995 and immediately the journalists there and a lot of diplomats and business people were like,  wow, the Chinese Communist Party is never going to survive this thing.  There's just no way. But the Chinese government has actually managed to adapt to the Internet and also manage the Internet both through blocking foreign sites and also basically controlling domestic Internet companies to the extent that,  yeah, people do feel freer to talk about a lot of things, but they still can't use the Internet to organize an opposition party or to call for multiparty democracy without going to jail as usual.  And so the fact that China is kind of exhibit A for how an authoritarian government can actually survive the Internet is the cautionary tale and kind of pokes some holes, I think,  in some assumptions that some of us make about the nature of the Internet and the relationship between the Internet and politics and government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff and Gina, please don't let me hog this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was, Rebecca, I'm a big fan of Rebecca's. I was privileged to be there in the meeting where Global Voices started, where she started it.  And it was an amazing thing to watch at Harvard's Berkman Center going way back.  And so I have immense respect for Rebecca on these topics. And I'm really glad that she wrote the book.  At the end of mine, I too try to come around to say that we need principles to protect the Internet.  So did you happen to see Robert McDowell's, I presume you did op-ed in the Wall Street Journal today, the FCC commissioner who warns of United Nations governments of the Internet?  And there's just so many players now who are under the guise of piracy, privacy, security, decency or just simple power are trying to step in and claim some sovereignty over the net.  What was your thought about the Dalles piece?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I read that piece and I thought he raised a lot of really important points.  And in fact, I have a chapter in the book dealing with these Internet governance fights.  And, you know, the Internet, the standards and protocols of the Internet and our addressing system and IP addressing system and so on are all managed by kind of multi-stakeholder organizations of different kinds.  And ICANN, which manages the domain name system is a nonprofit company based in San Diego.  And the policy processes that they use are what we call multi-stakeholder.  It involves industry and, you know, nonprofit groups and consultations with governments and all kinds of different people who have a stake and who also have expertise in how the Internet should be developed.  But there are a lot of governments who feel that these functions need to be taken under UN control.  And the argument of China and Russia and quite a lot of other countries is that Internet governance should be left to governments.  And, of course, when you're concerned about human rights and you're concerned about kind of the bureaucrats from various countries like China and Russia determining how our standards and protocols evolve, that's a big concern.  So, you know, the argument being that when it comes to Internet governance, it needs to stay multi-stakeholder.  It needs to continue to involve not just governments, but the engineering committee.  I'm sorry, the engineering community and companies, the industry that actually develop the technologies who actually understand the technology better than the government bureaucrats and also civil society.  You know, the people who actually use the Internet for activism and need their rights to be protected.  And a lot of governments aren't interested in those people's rights being protected.  So we need kind of new ways of coordinating how the Internet evolves to make sure that, you know, everybody who uses it is going to be able to use it in the manner that is really consistent with our universal rights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do we need new ways or do we just need the present ways that have worked up to now not to be messed with?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know, I guess it depends on how you define what's been working and what's not and so on.  I think definitely with ICANN and with some of these organizations that coordinate protocols and standards, you know, they tend to work pretty well.  There are some issues with ICANN.  You know, the people who are kind of ICANN insiders will say that, you know, certain copyright industries have had too much say over how domain names are organized or, you know, there's a lot of issues and questions about whether civil society, sort of the non-governmental and non-commercial interests have enough say in these processes.  But also the Internet's changing, right?  So it used to be that the businesses that were involved with really creating the Internet and the engineers involved with developing protocols and standards were all in the West.  And that has changed.  Most of the development now with the Internet, the growth is all in the developing world.  It's all in the non-West.  You have a lot of non-Western companies that are becoming increasingly powerful.  You have Chinese companies that are more and more influential in bodies like the IETF, the engineering body that sets standards and protocols.  And so things are internationalizing and getting more complicated.  And there are more countries who are saying, well, you know, it's fine and good, you know, for these people in the West to say, oh, you know, the Internet should be this way because it's good for people in the West.  But it may or may not serve the needs of people in villages with slow bandwidth and other things.  So there are some valid reasons why perhaps more voices and more there needs to be more representation in coordinating the Internet's development from the non-West and from the developing world.  I think there's some legitimate arguments to be made there.  But I don't think necessarily it's up to governments to take control either.  So, you know, as the Internet evolves, I think the things that worked when the Internet was just kind of a Western thing may not work so well anyway as we evolve.  So it is going to have to change in different ways.  But I don't think a UN style solution is the solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People in the chat room say, why do we have to get government involved at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's involved. It's been involved for a long time.  Too late. You know, it's way, way too late.  And and the reason why it's involved is not just because it barged in there, it's because a lot of voters and Internet users invited government in there because people say, oh, you know, I don't want my children to to be, you know, accessing porn on the Internet.  Or people say, oh, you know, I need to have my networks protected from cybercrime.  And so there, you know, we have invited regulation and invited legislation and invited government in to the Internet to help us solve a lot of problems that are serious problems that do need to be solved.  But the problem is, how do you make sure that when the government is in there that it's behaving accountably and not abusing its power?  I mean, that's that's ultimately the issue.  And part of the problem is even in democratic countries, you know, here in the US, we had a big fight over the Stop Online Piracy Act.  You know, the whole question of how you deal with copyright infringement.  And, you know, the problem is, is that you get legislators or congresspeople who have constituents asking them to solve a problem and they grasp at a solution that ends up, you know, creating problems in other areas or infringing on people's rights in other ways.  And so they're not kind of trying to think about, OK, how does this affect everybody who has a stake on the Internet in all the different ways it might affect people?  And so there's there's not, you know, it's it's and and then you end up having mechanisms put in place, you know, for instance, fighting cybercrime.  Oftentimes, the solution that people grasp at is, oh, we need more surveillance.  We need more government access to networks so that we can catch the bad guys.  But, you know, that that comes with a price.  Right. And so how do you how do you hold accountable the abuse of power?  How do you prevent the abuse of power as you're trying to solve these problems?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And unfortunately, it seems that instead of some sort of consensus between engineering interests, government interests and we should mention commercial interests to Tim Wu and the master switch kind of posits that there's no way we can maintain this as a open system because just with other previous open systems like long distance commercial interests are just going to say, hey, OK, thanks very much.  See you all later. It's ours now.  So you really have at least three parties and if you include the public, I guess there's four parties who all have a vested interest, which all seem at odds with one another, to be frank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mm hmm. Well, oftentimes they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How do you reach consensus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, you know, well, look at how we do it kind of in a physical democracy.  You don't really reach consensus.  You just kind of balance off the interest.  Nobody's happy.  Nobody's happy.  But you kind of set up the system in such a way that as people pursue their self-interest, they're holding each other in check.  So nobody can go too far without a backlash, you know, or that's how it's meant to be.  So I think, you know, that's likely to be where it kind of goes.  And you also you sometimes get alliances like with the anti SOPA stuff.  You saw industry and the human rights community joining forces against the legislation, which was fascinating.  And so, yeah, I think we need to find a way to kind of have a balance of power in a way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the title of your book is Consent of the Networked.  And really we are, as the public, we are the ones who have the most at risk, most to gain, and unfortunately have the least, not only authority,  but least understanding of what the issues are.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I think if we gain more understanding and we start thinking about these digital spaces that we're spending growing amounts of time in,  these services that we're increasingly relying on, if we think of ourselves less as a user of these things, just sort of passive and more sort of as I use the term netizen,  sort of a citizen of these spaces and think about, you know, what are the levers I can use?  But as a consumer, as an investor, as a citizen, as a voter, how can I sort of exercise my concerns, voice my concerns and exercise my rights  and push the people who do hold power in this digital realm to change what they're doing or to modify what they're doing and respect our rights  and to recognize it's in their long-term self-interest to do so.  It's in the government's interest to respect our rights.  Otherwise, they have no legitimacy in the long term, which is politically bad for them.  And with companies, if they don't respect our rights over the long run and we totally distrust them, that's going to diminish the value of what they're trying to sell and what they're trying to do.  And so I think in the long run, the legitimacy of the Internet as a whole and the various actors on it does depend on behaving in a way that respects people.  But they're only going to understand that if people make that clear and impose costs when our rights aren't respected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But there's not, by the way, we're talking to Rebecca McKinnon. Her book is The Consent of the Network, brand new from Basic Books.  The website is, is it Consentofthenetwork.com?  Correct.  So you can go there and find it. There it is. You can find out more about that.  Although, you know, you even have disputes among individuals over what we want from the Internet.  For instance, the European Union wants to pass this right to be forgotten legislation,  which I'm sure not only do governments in Europe, but many people, particularly Germans, no, I'm just kidding.  I'll get the email in Europe think this is a good thing.  And but it but it's technically ridiculous.  And that's this is why this seems to be such a Gordian knot, to be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, this is, you know, and this happens on a lot of issues.  I mean, you get other constituencies in a number of democracies that are calling for censorship of the Internet to protect children from pornography.  And they're demanding that their elected representatives do something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And and so that's why God created Lamar Smith.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, so I think people there's part of it is that there just needs to be more nuanced public discussion about kind of how the Internet works and what's possible and so on.  And and I think, you know, maybe industry needs to kind of treat the concerns with respect, even if the solutions proposed might seem idiotic because the concerns are real.  And I think if those concerns are treated with respect, then then will not be trust, not mocked anyway.  Yeah, not mocked. Yeah.  I mean, it's you know, I think I think one has to respect the fact that that a person is freaked out by Google Earth showing what's in their backyard.  You know, I think they didn't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait, wait. Google doesn't do that. Google doesn't do that.  So that's that's just the problem. It's that kind of of presumption that causes this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I am going to defend I'm going to defend Rebecca in the sense that we cannot we will not be able to reach consensus if we don't look to the other person and say, well, I understand your your your desire for privacy  and why you might want to blur your building. But there does need to be some dialogue about but but what you know how how does that work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, Leo. But but you know, if you look at the basis of Vivian Redding's regulations in the EU, it's you know, it's it's polls that say things like, are you concerned about your privacy?  Well, 100 percent should say they are. Of course I am. Everyone is right. Without any real discussion of the harm.  Well, but I think that's and I think that's what we are. That's our mission is to educate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a lot of education needs to be done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's tons. And you look at all these issues, you know, it's it's balances and it's tradeoffs and and how to how to how to negotiate that on a global network, you know, where where the European regulations end up affecting people outside of Europe, et cetera, et cetera.  And so it's you know, and why how do we hold them accountable for affecting how our Internet works?  It's it's we don't really have kind of the way of approaching that that can kind of bring us to a solution at the moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And your solution in extrapolating, correct me if I'm is that by the last chapter book is building a net is in centric Internet is is involvement.  Involvement of us as net we need to be good netizens.  You also talk about utopianism versus reality, because I think Jeff and I are utopians.  We're like John Perry Barlow. We believe in, you know, power to the people, freedom of cyberspace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I mean, you know, it's it's it's definitely you have to start with awareness.  You have to start with people being involved.  And, you know, just to clarify my my critique of utopianism, which is, I think, different than some other people's critique of utopianism, which I won't get into here, has really has to do with the fact that I started out my academic life studying the origins of the Chinese and the Chinese.  And the Soviet revolutions that were started by utopians who thought that, you know, you could change human nature and, you know, had, I think, overly unrealistic ideals about what could be changed.  And the idealistic people got used by very evil people and very bad things happened.  And and so I just tend to feel that, look, you know, the Internet and what's going on on the Internet is an extension of human nature.  Human beings are pretty screwed up lot.  And and I don't think that the Internet changes human nature.  I think we need to work under the assumption that, you know, we remain human and different aspects of human nature get amplified in on the Internet.  And in all kinds of interesting ways, some very positive and some very negative and some just delightful and some just strange.  And but but given human nature and what it is, I just think we need to be realistic that, yes, there are many delightful and wonderful things that the Internet empowers.  But it also empowers another set of things that that are kind of part of who we are as a society and as a species.  And that's not going to be changed by technology.  And so we need to kind of embrace reality and make and and accept that absolute power corrupts absolutely as much did in digital space as it does in physical space.  And and that you're it doesn't matter how enlightened a particular technology CEO might be or or how idealistic or utopian certain programmers might be.  They're going to mess up. They may abuse power.  And we need to kind of construct a digital world that kind of defaults for the absolute certainty that bad things will happen.  And that we need to constrain that it's made the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's made of people. That's right. Yeah, it is made of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go ahead, Gina. Please. You know, I was going to say that, you know, certainly the solution is for everyone to get more involved and to take their role as a netizen more seriously.  And I may be saying this just because I'm a web developer.  But for me, like if I have to choose between the engineering community, the government, commercial interests and the public, I expect the engineering community especially to step up and to explain to government how technology works and the public so we can have those more nuanced discussions.  And and I kind of discussions. You're right. You know, informed discussions.  And I, I look, I like to see benign engineers, you know, kind of making a difference.  I think code is some of the best kind of activism possible.  You know, when you look at what Reddit did with SOPA and you look at things even like like screw, screw, or focus on the user.  I mean, these are people who have opinions that are expressing them through tools.  And I think that's really important because the engineers are the ones that really understand how this stuff works.  And the engineering community has to figure out how to communicate that well to the public and to the government so that these decisions can be informed.  I mean, the problem is that, you know, the culture of being an engineer, sort of growing up a nerd or a computer programmer is that you sort of you view yourself as an outcast, as someone who, you know, is necessarily the most popular kid in school.  Perhaps I really want to see that mythology change in the next couple of generations.  It has to happen.  I really want to see, you know, a president United States who used to be a software developer.  Like, I really look forward to that day.  But I and again, I wouldn't that be something it would never happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, but yeah, just pointing that out.  But good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, certainly you need people who understand people as well as they understand code.  And there's often a disconnect there.  But for our audience, that's way we have a lot of we have a lot of engineers or at least just technology enthusiasts who understand how how tech works more than the public.  Government or even the guys in business suits who just care about, you know, next quarter's earnings.  And I want to see I want to see more of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I would say, again, that's our mission.  I mean, and I unfortunately we speak to enthusiasts who already probably have a pretty good idea.  But that is really the mission of everything that I do is we got to get people to understand technology, given the facts, let them make their decisions, but make make informed decisions.  I would also guess that some of the issue is is that the the perfect is the enemy of the good engineers or purists.  See, black and white.  And this the SOPA discussion was a perfect example where people who are more political like me like Patel said, well, we got to find a middle ground because and then purists like me say, but there's and Jeff say, there's no such thing as piracy.  It's good for everybody.  Screw it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think engineers are aren't aren't aren't aren't utopians, which we're accused of doing.  And we laugh about.  But engineers are optimists because they basically try to have to always find solutions to problems and believe there is a solution to a problem.  And that can be found if we're smart enough and work hard enough on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But politics is messy.  It is the art of consensus is the art of just as you were saying, Rebecca, there isn't a perfect solution.  It's the art of you give a little I'll give a little.  And that's something engineers may not be very good at.  And I think one of the other around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And one of the other challenges, too, is increasingly these tools and platforms are being used by people in cultures and political contexts and languages that the engineers here in the United States developing certain platforms anyway, just can't kind of conceive of how that  experience ends up interact interacting in a particular political or cultural context and what ends up meaning for people.  And so this is this is where I think not only diversifying the community of engineers and bringing people kind of from the developing world and from the nonwest into the engineering community is really important.  So that the concerns and needs of the world's fastest growing part of the Internet can can really be understood better, but also find ways to kind of consult with with types of people who face risks and vulnerabilities that that somebody sitting in Palo Alto just might never have been able to dream about.  Yeah, that's exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Diversity is so important for that reason.  Luckily, we have a global network that can help us.  Thank God, because Sand Hill Road is the opposite of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But so many of our tools are built and conceived in Palo Alto, California, which is a completely different thing.  We've got to change that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, we absolutely do.  And I do think it is starting to change.  And I see more and more.  That's why I loved going to the Web and seeing the vital startup community in Europe.  And it's just now it's all over the world.  And there are startups all over the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And immigration into here and investment out of here is are both important.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although I have to say, you know, Rebecca, you speak Chinese and you have a unique perspective on China.  The language barrier is really a significant wall between what's happening.  And there is a ton of stuff happening in China.  And and because of the language barrier, it doesn't it's the membrane is impermeable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, that's what makes you know, there's kind of a set of engineers and technical people who are bilingual.  And those people, I think, are going to become really huge.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hugely.  You actually grew up part of your life in China, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. I spent a couple of years of grade school in Beijing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I envy you.  And what a change you've seen in Beijing over 20 years.  It's just remarkable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  It's Beijing's unrecognizable from when I was a kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just I mean, this is completely off topic, but I'm going to throw it anyway.  By the way, look, let's give you a plug.  Consider the network. Rebecca McKinnon, everybody buy it.  What is your sense of what role it's you know, I was in Beijing a couple of years ago.  I was in Beijing a couple of years ago and it blew me away.  I was a Chinese studies major in college like you.  Really?  Yeah. And I fell in love with China.  No, I forgot all my Chinese.  I fell in love with China.  And when I went back and I had never gone and I went back, I went there for the first time, blew me away.  And I actually said at the time, I have a feeling this is the Chinese century, not the old.  Last century was the American century. This might be the Chinese century.  And some people there said, there's some structural issues. It may not be economic.  What's your sense of the role China will play going forward globally?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I mean, it's it's hard to predict.  I mean, obviously, they're already a major economic powerhouse.  You know, when it comes to technology, you know, you've got Chinese networking companies like Huawei and ZTE and so on that are globally competitive with Cisco and and and other major multinationals.  And so, you know, there's there's a lot going on.  I think there are very smart and innovative people in China.  I think the innovation is stifled somewhat by the system.  There are a lot of things, particularly anything related to user generated content.  There's a real disincentive from doing anything new because you don't know how to control it.  You know, and and then you might get in trouble and get your business shut down.  So you're better off just kind of cloning stuff that already exists elsewhere.  So there's you know, I think there there are some issues with the nature of their political system that does kind of get in the way of the Chinese people being as great as they really could be.  But, you know, certainly we're seeing in so many ways how, you know, it's that country is a player.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do they recognize that? Do they realize that that their restrictive policies are holding them back economically?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think I certainly I know a lot of Chinese people who do feel that way.  I know people, business people in China who feel that way.  If they say that publicly, they're you know, if a CEO of a Chinese company who says that to his friends goes out and says that to The New York Times.  Yeah, that's that's that's like, you know, going to be problematic for him.  So there's actually a lot of people who do recognize that.  And there's even a lot of people in the government who, you know, if you talk to them privately, they'll say, yeah, you know, our our system is, you know, ossified.  And we do need to find some way to move it forward.  But the problem is, like, how do you move from A to B without everything falling apart?  And everybody in the system has so much at stake and they don't want to lose their jobs or they don't want to lose their business or a lot of people have a lot to lose these days in China.  And so they don't want to take too much risk of getting in trouble.  So everybody's just sort of muddling along and just kind of making do with the system as it is.  And nobody's kind of really, you know, I mean, I think if the business community in China really kind of stood up and said, you know, we're not going to take this anymore.  This is lame. Perhaps things might change, but they don't have the cajones to do that at this moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's fascinating. We're going to take a break. Rebecca McKinnon is here.  Consent of the networks dot com. If you want to know more about her book, The Worldwide Struggle for Internet Freedom.  And it couldn't be more timely, really. I mean, with the Arab Spring last year.  It's just a fascinating world we're living in a very rapidly changing system.  I do want to talk about Google and iOS and and Rebecca, if you would like to stick around and join us, it really is about privacy.  So I think you might have something to say about it.  It's an interesting debate. But before we do that, I want to talk also about Ford Motor Company.  Our sponsor, Ford, of course, is a 21st century car company, a global company, by all means, making amazing vehicles.  And it's just really inspiring when I've had the chance to speak to people at Ford about what they're doing, not just in the U.S., but worldwide.  It's kind of inspiring. Here's a company that sells in pretty much every country of the world.  They manufacture everywhere. They're trying to create a system that benefits from economies of scale in markets that are very diverse all over the world.  And they have done some amazing things. And it's technology that is taking this 20th century industrial power into the technological 21st century.  It's very fascinating. You find out more about the technology story at Ford.com slash technology.  One of the things you can't forget is, you know, we talk about electric cars. They're doing it hybrid, hybrid electric diesel.  But it's still, you know, it's still the Alan Mullally calls it the petrol car.  I think we're the only country in the world that still calls it gasoline. The petrol engine, he calls it.  And EcoBoost is, wow, fascinating solution to an interesting problem that might seem impossible.  How do you give consumers what they want, which is big, powerful cars and big, powerful engines,  and still get the fuel economy that not only do consumers want, but governments mandate?  And that's where the EcoBoost is quite interesting. I drove the 3.5 liter EcoBoost in the SHO and I was blown away by the pickup, the torque, and yet the great gas mileage.  They've got two liter EcoBoost engines now in the new 2012 Ford Explorer and the Ford Edge getting 28 highway miles per gallon in that two liter engine in a big utility vehicle.  It's just so cool, amazing. They do it with two technologies, direct injection, producing a cooler.  I'm going to read this because I'm no automotive technologist.  DI produces a cooler, denser charge that generates more power per drop of fuel.  And then they use turbocharged. I know a little bit about that because we've had, you know, turbocharged engines for years.  But traditionally that single turbine takes a while to spin up.  They take a little bit of a spin up from the exhaust and the turbine compresses the air going into the piston, which again gives you a much more efficient, powerful ride.  But the spin up is slow. It's a little hesitation. Not with these new Fords.  They're using smaller dual turbochargers, engine cooled turbochargers to do the same work.  So they spin up fast. There's virtually no lag and you get incredible low end torque and responsiveness.  So I have to say, I'm just, you know, if you're interested in this stuff, and I know many of you are, go to ford.com slash technology.  Learn about the technologies Ford is putting into its 21st century vehicles, including the new EcoBoost engines and the Ford SYNC and the MyFord Touch.  And it just goes on and on. And of course, the gas free engines, the electric vehicles, ford.com slash technology.  And you know, if you went to your Ford dealer, they might let you drive one today.  The 2012 Explorer, the 2012 Edge and the 2013 Escape coming in just a few months.  Ford.com slash technology. We thank them for their support of our show.  So I do not know what to say about this thing. I have been myself. I've put my head into the turbine.  My hair is a little shorter than it was.  I may be joining you there.  Well, good. I'd like to, you know, and we're seeing, I think you and I, Jeff, are sometimes seen as Google apologists.  And I want to emphasize, I don't believe that I'm a Google apologist here, but I want, but I want to raise all the issues.  And I think that the Wall Street Journal was perhaps a slightly slanted.  It published an article based on a work from a security researcher about what Google was doing, which was absolutely sneaky.  I have, you know, they, they.  Sneaky.  It was. There's no question that it was. You agree. Sneaky.  Yes.  We're not denying the sneakiness thereof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They were invisibly submitting a form and they were posting a form in an invisible iframe in the background without telling you when you visited a website.  Let's just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's pretty sneaky.  Let's just be clear about what's happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's pretty sneaky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, the reason they were doing this, and this is, this is where it gets to be a larger, larger story, but I'm not going to deny that it was absolutely sneaky.  It was wrong.  I'm sure Google will not do it anymore.  They said, and this is getting wearing a little thin.  Oh, we made a mistake.  We just did it so that we could put plus one buttons on the ads.  The reason they did it is because on iOS.  Safari by default without, and I have to say without telling the user does something, it disables third party cookies.  And then Safari settings, there are three settings.  This is on the desktop.  Most browsers now do this.  Chrome does do this.  You have three choices except all cookies, except no cookies.  Of course, you accept no cookies.  Cookies are those persistent state information settings.  Basically, they're saved on your hard drive.  Except no cookies.  A lot of the web doesn't work.  There is a middle ground, however, and this is what Safari does by default, which is except cookies, but only from the site that you were specifically visiting.  So when you go to, let's say the Wall Street Journal, only the Wall Street Journal can set cookies, not the 15 different ads services that they have on that site, which are setting, which are attempting to set cookies from their domain.  Why do they do that?  Well, because they want to track you what you look at and try to serve you ads that are more targeted.  It's also something Facebook has to do with the like button.  Google has to do with the plus one button.  You know, if you go to a site with a like button, a cookie may be set by that site, but the like button could also set a cookie as a third party unless it's disabled.  Apple decided only on iOS, not on its desktop, to disable these third party cookies.  Some say, John Battelle specifically, and again, John has a dog in this hunt because he's the head of Federated Media.  And ad.  An ad.  An ad servicing agency.  But he points out that there may be reasons Apple set this policy on iOS that have nothing to do with privacy, despite the fact that that's what Apple says it's all about.  But in fact, Apple, and I think this is pretty clear that this is Apple's intent anyway all across the board, is if you're an Apple iOS user, you're an Apple customer.  And the hell with anybody else who wants to find out anything about you.  Apple keeps that information to itself and we should point out, uses it to sell its own ads on iAds.  So John's saying a sad state of an Internet affairs, the Journal on Google, Apple and quote privacy.  There's no question the Journal got it wrong with the headline.  There's no iPhone tracking going on here.  That is not what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that is the worst headline in the history of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and probably the case that Julia Angwin did not write the headline.  Usually they have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's still the Journal's hysteria.  It's the moral panic and hysteria that the Journal has brought to this entire topic from the beginning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now I had Kara Swisher on Twitter and I challenged her with that because she writes for all things D, which is also a News Corp company.  And she did work for the Journal and she said, look, you got to understand that Julia, who writes these articles, is not driven by, you know, that she's doing, she's exposing these things.  And, you know, headline aside, I think there was nothing wrong in what she said in her article, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I'm going to disagree there because I think that it mischaracterizes what was happening.  And I'll point to Lauren Weinstein's very good blog post on this.  Let's get back to some non hysterical basis of these right.  Cookies were invented, correct me if I'm wrong, Gina, but to set state, to understand from one request to the next what's happening here.  And and we can look at this a lot of ways, right?  One is that Apple, I think, is almost engaging in a form of antitrust by trying to cut off everybody else's advertising revenue in this because you need this to be able to do it.  I know I'm frozen.  I'll that's OK.  It's a good it's a good look.  Turn off. Yeah, I know.  I'll turn off and turn on again.  And and it always happens when I start a rant.  It's trying to tell me something.  So so, you know, a few things here.  One is I want to stay signed into Google.  And, you know, I don't know that Apple is necessarily representing my my desires.  They change just like Facebook has been accused of doing.  They changed a preference kind of in the background without telling me that has an economic impact on media that I care about.  That's an issue, too.  Second, since the beginning of advertising very, very soon after advertising began on the Web after Wired had the first ad long, long ago, General Motors insisted on serving its customers.  It has insisted on serving its own ads and thus its own cookies.  And that has been the standard of Internet advertising since like 1997.  It has been a constant and it's not evil and it's not wrong.  Third, I think we've got to get past this idea of calling anonymous cookies a privacy violation.  If you don't know who I am, how could it be a privacy violation?  And so what Lauren points out was that Google used a well-known wasn't even a hack.  It was it was a door that was put there for a reason.  And the problem with it was was in an engineering sense, according to Lauren, is apples that the door was meant to just all Google intended to do was have its cookies stay there so that keep you signed in.  What happened with the way it was engineered with Apple was that it allowed other cookies and other things to be said that one would not have otherwise guessed.  And so, you know, I think there was a there was in this entire story, there's what I it's approaching a moral panic.  But I think has become rather ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, by the way, I just learned something on our security.  Now we had quite a debate on this as well, because Steve Gibson, our security guy, does believe third party cookies are privacy violation.  I think you should have the right to turn them off.  And I'm glad that Apple has that setting.  I don't think that that's I have no problem with that.  But here's an interesting point.  I don't know if it's a data point, but interesting WebKit, which, of course, both Chrome and Safari are based on.  Gina, you'll vouch for this.  Yeah, that bug or hole or opening was fixed in WebKit months ago by Google.  Apple did not adopt that patch on Safari yet.  But it's been out for I don't know how long, but months.  My sense has been out for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the ability to post to the I-frame and the matter, the way that is disabled is disabled WebKit and Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the idea is if you have disabled third party cookies, which mobile Safari does by default, it blocks that no other browser does by default.  So there's a couple of issues here.  So, you know, and but tell John Patel says everybody in the world, every browser in the world by default allows third party cookies.  So the fact that Apple has changed this default setting in order so that they can say that mobile Safari is more secure.  Right. So they can use it kind of as a PR thing was wrong that they shouldn't have done that.  I have a little bit of a problem with that.  I mean, I just as a developer, it's Apple's decided to change the default setting because they thought it was a better experience.  I mean, the user, I mean, granted, most users don't change their default setting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Most users have no clue what third party cookies are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Let's talk about that for a second. Yeah, let's talk about I was thinking about this.  I was thinking about this today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Rebecca, don't let these loud mounts keep you out of the conversation.  You have anything to throw in when I'm ready.  And by these loud mounts, I mean me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good. If we believe so, let's let's compare this to piracy.  If we believe that a business, a content business has the right to set its own business terms, which in the case of piracy is I will charge you for content and to violate that is a violation of their rights and is wrong.  And by God, we should pass all kinds of laws around that.  Well, the same account, a content business that is advertising supported sets a business term which says I'm going to give you advertising and to give you advertising that is a value to me.  I need to set cookies.  And if you turn that off, which even though the entire web enables that that that capability, if you turn that off, why aren't you robbing value for me the same way up?  Damn pirate is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, wait a second. You say the entire web enables it.  You're saying that most browsers have that ship by default have don't allow third party cookie.  My question is, why doesn't Google, you know, because it's doing this crazy JavaScript to submit this form in the background, why is it just pop an alert that say, hey, that's what they should have done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, you know, allow Google cookies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, cancel. You know what I mean?  Like, that's what's sneaky about it.  That's the argument against it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We had last year. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think we have to go back to Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But what I'm saying, even without this specification, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, Gina, there may be a technical reason.  Remember, Apple tightly controls this platform.  It may not be possible for Google to re enable that programmatically from the website.  In fact, I guarantee you they can't.  So what they would have to say is, by the way, you can't use the plus one button on iOS Safari.  You need to go into settings, go into Safari.  So that they couldn't do it themselves.  You'd have to go through this thing.  And I don't blame Google for not wanting to do that.  I do blame them for sneaking through.  Maybe they should have just put out a blog post saying, hey, we can't do this.  Just show you should know.  But the other argument is it only happens if you're logged in, if you're logged into a Google account.  It doesn't happen if you're not logged into Google.  Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me just try that one last time.  I don't want Gina to argue with me.  That would be lovely.  Forget the Google case.  Just go with my economic argument here that says that if you violate the business terms of an advertising-supported service,  why is that any different in economic terms than piracy is alleged to be?  And why are we not having fits about that the same way we do now?  In fact, in fact, the web is set up.  Most browsers do let you turn off cookies.  You could kill cookies.  You can go to incognito windows.  It does allow all those things.  And I think it's fine that you have that capability.  But there's no moral outrage about cutting off the economic support for the New York Times.  There is a moral outrage with better lobbyists for cutting off the economic support to Warner Brothers.  Wow.  Jeff, I want to thank you for making it look more...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You might see the lobbyists going to Congress on this one next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is a point to be made, which is you are in fact cutting off their ability to monetize.  They can still monetize without these third-party cookies.  The ads are still seen.  What it does is it reduces the amount of money they can make because they can't sell targeted ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I fast-forwarded the commercials on my TiVo.  I have a 4TV that I pay for, and then I fast-forwarded the commercials.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We should make a law against that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Somebody probably tried.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Actually, they did.  In fact, there was a very good company, was it Replay TV, that got sued out of existence because they had a 30-second ad skip button on their remote.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, this is a thing.  I just think that that's a closer analogy.  I mean, I think there's a difference between Bitsor and doing an HBO show and skipping through the commercials when you're watching TV.  You could argue that it's the same result, but there are different kind of levels here.  So I mean, disabling third-party cookies, opening up an incognito mode window in your browser, those things are not ...  I agree.  It's not piracy.  I agree.  I agree.  They should be fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But where is the outrage from the media companies about that?  Where is their support and conference?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's hard to get humans motivated to support ads.  But the fact of the matter is, as unpleasant and unpalatable as it is, we get a lot of free stuff on the internet.  We get Google free.  We get Facebook free.  We get that stuff by pay.  It's not really free.  We pay for it with our attention.  And I believe, and I know you do too, Jeff, we pay for it with demographic information about what we look at, behavioral information.  That is the ... and the problem is it's not so clear.  People aren't really aware of this, so they can kind of not think about it.  But the reason you get Gmail and Google Docs and all this stuff for free is because Google can monetize it using your attention and your demographic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And let's push the other presumption here that you said earlier that Apple decided that doing this was going to give you a better experience on the web.  How is it better?  Yeah, I'm not clear that it's better.  What is Apple's real motivation here?  Why did Apple make that setting?  I think that's where Patel is right.  We haven't really probed that enough.  And I'm not, you know ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you make the case that Apple, which has done this in many other instances, wants to keep its customers to itself.  They don't want Facebook to have that information.  They don't want Google to have that information.  You can close it in the garb of privacy.  But you could also reasonably, as John does, interpret it as a commercial reason.  They don't want data going up apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't believe I'm going to make the pure Apple argument here, but I'm going to do it just to be Devil's advocate.  I mean, it affects the speed of the page load, and it also is just Apple's general policy about native apps is you don't transmit information about the user without their consent back to the server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Privacy by default is what you're saying.  Privacy by default, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which is, they would say, is for a better user experience.  Certainly, speed is an issue.  And again, I don't want to defend Apple here, most likely.  It's a commercial interest.  But those are possible.  It may not be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you could say, Apple could say, no, no, it's privacy by default.  And that's how we do it throughout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's not the real reason that they do other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I don't think you, for instance, IADS, which Apple is an Apple company and Apple advertising on third party apps that Apple sells, I'm sure they track you across app.  We don't know, but I'm sure they track you across.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Apple does plenty of things that are troubling.  The way in which they choose to censor apps.  There have been stories, I think, including in the Wall Street Journal about the collection of people's movements that was sort of a bug on the phone.  They've screwed up themselves on privacy and tracking on their devices.  There's been all kinds.  None of these companies have pure motives.  And some of them are kind of disingenuously.  You've also got Microsoft kind of trying to use Google screw up to their advantage competitively and so on.  But I think this points to a bigger problem, which is that we've and which I think some of the news stories may kind of, as Jeff says, kind of overhype.  But that people don't feel like they can trust what's going on.  People are feeling increasingly distrustful of these services that we're now all kind of dependent on and that that we want to use for all kinds of reasons.  We don't want to disconnect from them.  But at the same time, we feel creeped out half the time.  And, you know, in some cases there are there are people have who have real concerns about how their information might get exposed or used by various authorities or various people seeking to do them harm.  And and so we need to you know, how can we ensure that that industry will do a better job of of kind of making people feel reassured that their best interest is is actually being thought about?  And yes, we are making tradeoffs using these services.  But at the same time, trust is eroding.  And if companies can't figure out a way to rebuild that trust.  And I think that that's actually on them.  Yes, on the companies.  There's a lack of trust.  And if they don't work harder to build that trust, they're going to get regulated in all kinds of crazy ways that that are right, Rebecca.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they allow by being mysterious, they allow cookies to be demonized, mystified and demonized because they weren't transparent about they weren't open about what they were doing, why they were doing it.  And they asked for a lot of this trouble.  The result, though, could hurt us all and hurt the Internet and regulate the Internet in ways that frighten me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  By the way, the question is, where do we go from how do we move forward towards a good result?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's that's good.  So I and by the way, it was March 2010 that this bug was fixed everywhere.  But iOS March 2010 is more than almost two years ago that this bug.  It's a WebKit bug.  I just posted in the chat the link.  Lauren Weinstein, Lauren Weinstein actually put this in her post.  This bug was fixed by everybody but Apple two years ago.  Just so the question is, why was this not patched two years ago?  So I think that that is a little bit of a smoking gun.  So I look at the only point that we have here.  I know people are going to assume Jeff and I are Google apologists.  That's not the point.  The point is there is a more complicated, more nuanced discussion than the Journal would have you think or any of the other tech blogs would have you think because it really does make for great copy to say Google tracked iPhones.  That is a great that is link bait.  But I think, Rebecca, you're absolutely right.  And you're the cooler head prevailing here.  Whatever side you come down on, the question is, what is what should policy be going forward?  How do we how do we avoid this happening again?  Not who's at fault, who's who's sneaky, who's nice.  But what what how do we handle this?  How do we handle this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And is this for government to sort out or do companies need to be?  God, I hope not.  I think we all hope government doesn't get involved in this.  I'm here in Washington and I can tell you there's people down the street on Capitol Hill just really wanting to get involved with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The FTC has already asked Google, what the hell are you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's all kinds of bills being proposed and so on.  And so but if industry doesn't want to get regulated, they've got to step up.  They've got to prove that they can be trusted.  And they are not providing particularly solid evidence in that regard.  And so they've got to figure out how to interact with their users or constituents or whatever you want to call them to try and build trust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Rebecca, I think you're you're absolutely right.  And let me do an 80 20 rule on this.  I think 80 percent of it is that they have to act far better, be more transparent, be more open.  Just think this way in general.  I've used the example before.  The people don't complain about about Gmail Priority Inbox because they get value out of it.  They've got to think about value.  But the other 20 percent, I think, is they do have to start fighting back when they see things like these headlines and say, whoa, that's not true.  Here's what's really going on.  And and you know, you said before, don't don't lock the I would agree about not mocking the the consumers concerns, but one should block have bad headlines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is such an interesting story.  And I it's it's going to resonate.  And it's not.  Unfortunately, for Google, if your Google, not unfortunately for anybody else, but unfortunately for Google, if your Google, this is just one more piece of mud on the I mean, they are they're buried by this stuff.  They don't respond well.  There was apparently debate internally about should we make a video explaining this?  And they said, no, nobody will understand it anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the Arrington.  There is the dog with your belly up.  Yeah.  OK, OK, OK.  You know, forgive me, even if what you did wasn't wrong.  But again, Rebecca's still absolutely right.  What they've been wrong about and it's not just technology companies, it's also very much media companies and advertising companies have been have just been terribly mysterious about this.  And that's what does I'm going to use the word creep people out because they don't know what's going on.  So transparent, radical transparency, radically thinking truly about the consumers, the customers, desires and serving them is the only way to start digging yourself out for real.  It's not messaging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And if if it's not enough just to say, well, we owe this to our customers, there should be motivation in the idea that if you don't government will and they all screw it up.  Boy, will they.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's also you can almost make a kind of a sustainability argument if you want the web to be as valuable as possible for everybody who's using it and doing business on it.  And if you want it to be a place that people want to be, you know, you have to kind of take responsibility for it developing in a manner that, you know, to to continue the creepy meme, you know, doesn't creep people out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Google has to be in that isn't just as much as we have to be medicine, so we all need to be.  And that's, that's for, you know, at some point, the excuse that well, this is new territory, we're all learning doesn't hold water anymore.  And I think now is the time.  Okay, that's it.  No more free passes.  If if an app developer, if Facebook, Microsoft, Google or Apple or Amazon was unclear up to this point that people really care about this stuff.  Guess what they do need no more excuses.  Oh, Josh, we never thought about that.  That doesn't it's not gonna hold water in the future.  All right, moving on Google to Google to sell.  That's it.  I'm done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's it.  That's it.  Where's my gavel?  We're done.  We're done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what?  You could go on for hours and we have I mean this discussion.  If you want more folks, and I know you don't, but if you did security now earlier today, this week in tech on Sunday, this was the absolute topic discussion and thank God Jeff Jarvis has made me look like a moderate by saying it's akin to piracy what Apple's doing.  Thank you, Jeff, because up to now, I was all alone on this hill.  Jeff the one in the red shirt kids.  I'll take boards for your boss.  Google's going to sell heads up display glasses by years and I do not know why Nick built and wrote this article but he did.  I don't know who will buy this but I guess they will according to sources at Google familiar with the project.  250 to $600 for glasses that look like those Oakley thumps they were sunglasses that had earbuds.  Apparently, if you have an Android phone you'll have a heads up display on your glasses that will show you crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you not want this. Am I the only one here that wants this. Come on. I want this. Oh, absolutely. Google I oh giveaway baby. The glasses. Really you want this. The glasses will have a low a low.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we're all going to Google I oh that's that's all right. The glasses will have a low resolution built in camera that will monitor the world in real time. It's augmented reality and overlay information about locations surrounding buildings and friends who might be nearby.  You know this reminds me of I don't know if you read Daniel Suarez's book Demon and that's exactly what I was going to say.  So in that world you could see a metaverse that was superimposed on the real universe and it was like games people would have their reputation score floating in bubbles over their head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And they had self driving cars. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I think obviously Larry Page is a big Daniel Suarez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So with these glasses on if I look at you Leo am I going to see the number of circles you're in kind of above your head.  Damn straight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. And then in Suarez's story novel too it was like you could see people's approval ratings their popularity ratings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know all kinds of stuff. Yeah. It's about reputation. It's like gaming where you have hit points experience points all of that stuff.  You have you actually have levels I think you could level up as I remember.  The project is currently being built according to Nick Nick Nick Nick Nick has really been on it lately in the Google X offices a secret lab near Google's main campus that is charged with working on robots space elevators and dozens of other futuristic projects.  Steve Lee who created latitude is involved.  Sergey Brin is spending most of his time in the X labs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love the idea there are multiple space elevators being worked on.  Oh that's right. It's plural.  You know all those space elevators.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's different ways to do it.  The glasses will send data to the cloud and use things like.  Well if you think about it this is what Eric Schmidt was talking about when you with your pants the pants analogy right.  This is more of that.  They just want you to they want to they.  But think of the privacy implications with the with the phrase the glasses will send data to the cloud.  Now Google will know not only where you are.  But what you're looking at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google goggles.  It'll keep it'll keep twigging business for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apple Apple will probably say somehow have a way to avoid you using this somehow block it block it.  We have the Apple glasses that you put over the Google glasses.  Well OK.  What would Apple glasses do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apple glasses would just show you the things that that that Apple will sell to you.  No no they would only.  No Jeff they would only show you things that are beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right.  Yes anything with hard corners.  We will take square corners and round corners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We will take square corners and round them.  It automatically rounds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You will live in a world of beautiful design.  It actually revisits the world.  I'd buy those.  I know it's such a goofy story.  But it's Nick Bilton in the New York Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nick Bilton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How could it be false.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I say June Google I.O.  We're all going to be walking around that place.  That would be a site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bumping into each other because you won't be able to see anything.  Wouldn't that be a site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is my.  I hope like bumper bumper cars where these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's definitely a way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To get press.  I could just see the front page of the New York Times and all us geeks walking around.  So have you played with a new latitude.  Google's going after four square I guess.  Yeah.  So latitude has always been the automatic check in.  It knows exactly where I go.  Right.  And you can't see this only I can see this but I'm now showing the world that I have  traveled seventy four thousand five hundred seventy seven miles which is apparently a  third of the way to the moon.  I spend I spent.  Now I just want everybody to note this seventy four hours at work last week.  Despite the fact that my average is twenty nine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I buy stock in that company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twelve hours out countries visited airplane trips my trips.  But that's not that that's not the interesting thing.  There's also a leaderboard.  Now these are all my check ins.  I guess the leaderboard is only on the.  Is it only on the phone.  Maybe it is.  Well apparently you're in the lead.  I am in the lead.  There it is.  That's the end gadget of screenshot that puts me number one.  But that I think is the only thing that's going to be on the list.  I don't think that counts.  I think it's just because it's new.  Right.  I guess.  And I don't think that's like a global leader.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't even know that guy.  Terrence O'Brien.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know why I'm on his list.  But anyway there you go.  And this is a little creepy.  This is I guess again only I can see this.  This is today.  Let's go to yesterday.  These are all the places I visited.  And you can go hour by hour.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  You can go hour by hour through your travels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So can you blacklist some places?  Can you be like when I go to the.  No.  I don't think you can blacklist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you can delete.  Check me in.  My visits to the porn shop you can delete.  But I don't know if you can block.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know I got to say after spending nine years in China living under pretty heavy surveillance.  I just cannot bring myself to use Foursquare or Google Latitude.  I just have this thing about not wanting people to know where I am.  It's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just Google.  It's not the government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it didn't make you more comfortable.  It made you less comfortable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Being under surveillance all the time.  I mean yes.  You don't feel safer.  It's definitely an uncomfortable experience.  Did you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We got guys in cars and stuff like you would look at my mind.  There was a bit of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know but my phone conversations were bugged.  And you know my apartment was bugged.  My office was bugged.  If you wanted to have a really private conversation you leave your phone behind and you know go for a walk in the woods or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you did that for a decade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And now soon we're going to have to leave our glasses behind too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When I visited China for the first time like a few months back and I was just the cameras and having to hand over your ID in order to do anything to check in a hotel.  Well check in a hotel but like ride the subway or go anywhere.  That was an interesting.  It was an interesting experience for me as my first time.  And I understood that culturally handing over your ID is just a part of what you do.  And it's not it's not that big a deal.  So I wondered you know if it became sort of less of an issue.  But certainly where I traveled to my knowledge wasn't you know the rooms weren't bugged and my phone wasn't bugged.  So that's just why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's to your knowledge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To my knowledge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  Yes.  So I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One of the big hotels in Beijing is actually.  Not a version of entrance.  One of the hotels in Beijing is actually owned by the security services.  Oh sure.  Yeah.  And I'm told that's if you want to if you want to prostitute that's the place to go.  Seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That is often true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  There was a report this week that the Guardian is looking at starting a Guardian branded hotel which just struck me as it was like faulty towers.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess you know what I think some of this is I've so brow beaten by all this that I don't care anymore.  It's like go ahead follow me around.  What are they going to get?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know for most people I think that's how most people feel.  But you know there and this is the thing there are always some people for whom it's really non-trivial and really serious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Those people should log out of Google.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you know so let's let's let's take for an example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they should use burner phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So so let's let's say you you are just just to take an example a victim of spousal abuse.  Right.  And you're involved with sort of political activities to try and get the law to protect people against spousal abuse better or something like that.  And so in order to conduct your activism and communicate you need to use these services because that's where people are.  But you know at the same time you want your privacy protected and you have really good reason to want your privacy protected or you're living in a country where you know your your political activity could be putting your life at risk.  And you know there are a lot of places where that's the case.  And I think a lot of times that the concern for privacy may not necessarily be for the sake of the majority because I think the majority of people in any given country probably don't care that much or may feel like it doesn't matter.  But you know if people who are unpopular people who are physically vulnerable you know people who have peaceful yet you know kind of strange ideas that make others uncomfortable.  If they have nowhere to go unless they're engineers or programmers or geeks you know if you're just an ordinary person who uses technology about the normal level and you don't have technical skills if you're not able to participate.  That's a that's a real problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No I completely agree.  I completely agree and that's something to be very aware of.  And the point and I guess the point and we'll sum up the conversation this way is you deserve a choice.  But you do have a choice.  I guess the issue is, is the internet and with this was an interesting conversation we had a couple of weeks ago, a human right.  And if it is then you then you know and I think increasingly it's if not a right it's a it's a need then you should have the right to participate on the internet without being tracked if that's your desire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah I mean increasingly you can't apply for a job you know there are some communities where they're shutting down post offices and if you don't have the internet you know your ability to communicate with the world is getting constrained and so so yeah.  But I think track is the wrong way to put it.  Yeah but we do need meaningful choices and we need meaningful levels of access.  I agree completely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think what it comes down to a different way to put it is that there are appropriate times and needs for anonymity and pseudonymity and some control over that.  And you may not be able to use that everywhere you know you can't drive if you don't say who you are and prove that.  That's true.  We agree that but but but for Rebecca's case what you really need is a way to securely maintain your anonymity or under your pseudonym and know that you're secure in that way and if you're a whistleblower if you're a vulnerable person and so on.  There are needs for that and there are other cases where that's not appropriate where you have to say who you are because otherwise you can't get a license or get a passport and so on.  These are these are norms will figure out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're going to wrap things up with because it's time for TNT with Gina Trapani's tip of the week.  Two tips today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well yeah two tips today.  The first one is kind of goes along with this conversation really well.  March 1st Google's new privacy policy consolidation goes into effect.  And if you want to start with a clean slate basically if you've been tracking your web history or if Google has been keeping track of your web history up until now when the new privacy policy goes into effect on March 1st.  It'll be retroactive so Google will be able to use the data it's collected in your web history to inform ads and other suggestions and its other products.  You want to start with a clean slate before the privacy policy consolidation the EFF actually we should put post this in the show notes the EFF just walks through you can go to Google.com slash history sign into your Google account and you can basically clean your web history up until now.  Not saying you necessarily and you can turn it off if you want.  It's basically three steps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean it's three steps.  Go to Google.com slash history and then remove all web history.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's it.  I'm not saying that you should do this or that you should turn it off.  Web history is actually really useful.  I'm just saying that when this privacy policy consolidation goes into effect on March 1st if you don't want Google to use all the data it's collected thus far and just want to start with a clean slate on that day then clean out your web history.  There's your right to be forgotten.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google deserves to be commended a little bit for the fact that they do give you this.  They give you a dashboard that lets you know what they know.  They give you the ability to delete it.  They give you the ability to extract your data from Google and move on.  None of which Apple gives you.  So you know admittedly Google was bad and wrong and sneaky but they do give you the tools to get out.  It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think as long as companies communicate what are they doing with this data how are they collecting it how do I clear mine out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they have a very good privacy policy very clear privacy policy.  And now it's very clear and a lot more simple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Second tip Google Docs for Android.  A new update just came out today.  You can you can see real time collaboration.  So there's a little video.  If Jeff and Leo and I are all working on the twig rundown for today of stories I can see on my Android phone you know Jeff and Leo making changes to the spreadsheet or the document real time on my phone.  You know that was happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't know why but that was happening while I was working on the dock right now.  I was looking at things I saw these people in their mod of wow that's weird.  That is.  The video is kind of cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can see that they're putting a best man is going to give his his toast at the wedding and he's got all of his friends.  This is a good idea.  Making suggestions on their phones.  That's a very good idea.  It's a good idea.  I mean the real time collaboration has always been great in Google Docs.  But the fact that you can see it on your phone is pretty incredible.  You eyes pretty good even for small screens.  And so it's just just lets you get get worked on on the go.  I love that.  And it's Android only I believe right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't don't write a best man's speech without it.  That's actually pretty.  That's a pretty good example.  Yeah it was it was a good example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Of course in reality most of us use Google Docs to you know for work for reports and write and real stuff.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis your number of the week.  I'll go with this one five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was down this morning at Nike doing a big whoop presentation.  They were kind of active.  This was their Apple product release.  They released the fuel band which went on sale last week or went on sale today which is like the up and like the Fitbit and so on.  But it's done in a Nike way.  But the thing that they oh man frozen.  Well here's the fuel band.  You can show it.  I'm not going to get my fuel points for moving around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you get it because I'm wearing up.  But this this might work which would be nice.  I'm supposed to get one tonight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well I'm going to be able to play with it tonight.  But what they did what they showed today was they also showed new shoes with five sensors in them.  And ties it ties directly by Bluetooth to your phone to your iPod.  I mean your iPhone.  And so they showed for example being able to take a video of you playing basketball and superimposing on that video how many fuel points you got how fast you went how high you jumped.  You they have people like Ralph and a doll doing workouts and you compare yourself with that workout.  But of course here's the cloud touch.  You could put it into the cloud and it becomes social and you can compete with other people over a workout a day a month whatever.  And you know their argument is that it makes workouts not be work and be more fun.  It also creates an incredible amount of fascinating data here and we can get in the privacy discussion too.  But they're going to have aggregated data about people's exercise that I think will be really interesting.  So it's like can somebody said on Twitter as I was tweeting this morning it's like connect but you can actually take it outside.  Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know I have to say this is why I don't like this whole privacy discussion because that's the kind of thing that kills this kind of innovation.  Yes.  And you know it's opt out as long as it's up to you don't have to wear one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't have to send it anywhere you don't do anything but you know oh my god Nike knows how fast I run.  Well let me tell you right now that's very slowly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll tell you I'll give you that information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I put air quotes around run when I go do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Anyway so you and me both look at the stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just try.  This is a great video.  You got to look at the stuff that that doesn't count in it.  Let's see if I can rewind it.  I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's some there are some really great clips here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is very funny stuff that doesn't count.  The dude from the big Lebowski sitting in his chair does not count.  Very funny.  Yeah I love that.  My tool is something I had never heard of and then Trey Radcliffe was here yesterday doing twit photo and Troy Trey is somehow magically wired into the Google verse and he's offering invites to something called Google Schemer.  Did you have you heard of Google Schemer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh I love Schemer.  And I'm sorry that I didn't bring it up sooner.  It's really cool.  Thanks for telling us.  I know I'm sorry.  I love aspirational things especially social aspirational things.  You know it's like I really want to run a 5k and then you know you can tell your friends but I'll let you explain it.  It's a really cool app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well the only explanation I'm going to give is it's invite only and but somehow Trey has seems to have an infinite number of invites at his website stuck in customs dot com because he's using it to get people to sign up for his photo walk which is coming up on Sunday with Tom Anderson the guy who started my space which is kind of cool.  I met Tom yesterday.  He's a pretty cool guy.  He's got a cool I tried to get him on the show before did he come.  He's very private.  He won't come on.  You know it's very private.  He started my space.  You know what he did before my space.  By the way.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know it's pretty funny.  He's a nice guy.  I have his friend on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's done.  He doesn't want to.  He's like I did.  I don't want to be in public.  I just want to be me and I completely don't blame him and he's worth a gajillion dollars so he just could do whatever he wants.  Before he did my space.  I hope I'm not revealing a confidence.  He did two things that I've done.  He wrote he wrote chapters for John C.  Dvorak's books.  In fact one that I wrote a chapter for and he was an intern at tech TV.  Oh wow.  He was an intern for three months for Internet Tonight.  I knew him.  I didn't know I knew him.  He was the he's by the way now I think officially the most successful tech TV intern in history.  Unlikely to be unseated.  Not just financially but also outsporting Rupert Murdoch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought it's a yeah.  Yeah.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He sold my space before.  Take that.  Yeah.  Anyway so here's where you go.  Go to stockandcustoms.com.  L.A. photo walk entry.  And right here there's a link that will actually give you an invite to Schemer.  So Schemer is first of all doesn't look like Google.  It looks it looks so cool.  It's a little bit like a Google.  It looks so cool.  It's really neat.  Gina I just I just got it.  What is it.  Tell me what it does.  I can sign up for events.  I can say this is what I want to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  So you can enter a scheme say like I want to learn Italian or I want to climb Mount Everest.  So it's kind of like aspiration.  It's like an aspirational to do list like a big kind of lifeless goal type thing.  Right.  And then you can see schemes that people from your Google circles have have proposed like  you know some of my friends have said that they want to write a book.  They want to visit certain museums.  And so then you can say hey I want to do this too.  And you can mark schemes as things that you've already done.  So it's kind of like a social you know lifeless or kind of bucket list type thing.  What I like about it is that they're kind of big goals and a lot of fun stuff.  You can really tell a lot about people and it's just fun to kind of browse around and say oh yeah you know I want to do that too.  And then people can leave comments and that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Would you say there's functionality to it or is it just fun?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah I mean I think it's fun in that it's a social app just sort of centered around the idea of like stuff that you want to do.  And you can you know that the language is like you can you inspire people.  If you add a scheme that a lot of people say they want to do you can say oh hey you've inspired 50 people to want to want to do this.  In fact there's quite a few people who want to appear on Twitter.  I noticed that.  That's become a very popular thing.  So you can see who's done it and who wants to do it.  So if it's something that you that you want to do you can talk to people and say hey how did you go about this?  I want to take a hot air balloon ride.  You know where did you go?  How was it? That kind of thing.  Bring home a steak from Shabz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean some of this is weird.  Yeah I mean some of it is really weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's fun.  It's fun and it's social and for me it's like one of those things that you go to and just kind of feel inspired.  Like oh yeah this sounds really fun.  I do want to do this.  I didn't know that so and so you know is a pilot or you know that kind of thing or had you know filed a patent.  I think things that that that you would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Next time your kid comes up to you says I'm bored.  You say log into Schemer and find something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Find something to do.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a lot of options and a lot of inspiration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's it's way more fun than a to do list app where it's like pick up the milk or the dentist.  It isn't that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stuff you want to you want to do.  I want to thank Rebecca McKinnon for being here.  So great to have Rebecca.  She talked about an inspiration.  I you know we mentioned the book which is brand new Consent of the Networked from Basic Books.  But I also really want to give her props for Global Voices Online dot org which is an amazing.  It's kind of a journalism Wikipedia global.  It's a community of bloggers who report a citizen media from around the world and it is just brilliant.  And it is so important I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've got to say to the people working on that and the community around it is so inspiring.  I just learned so much from them.  And but thank you so much for having me on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you want to get the news disintermediated direct from people who are living it.  This is the place to go Global Voices Online dot.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Amazing.  Amazing.  And get the book because this is inspiring too.  And I think it's homework.  This is to do too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is fun.  I'm told by people who you know are not connected to me that they think it's an easy read.  It's not a slog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No it is.  It's quite because you load it with stories and anecdotes which I think is the key to something like this.  So there's a lot of examples of and it's really it's fun.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a great read.  Thank you Rebecca.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you for coming back.  You were really great.  Everybody in the chat room agrees.  We want you coming back on the show.  Love to do that.  Thanks.
