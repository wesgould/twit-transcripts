He's at the LastPass event that you've probably been hearing a lot about leading up to it.  That happens tomorrow.  So he's there.  I think there's scope in the place.  Maybe they're partying.  I don't know.  Maybe both.  Who knows?  Joining us as always today, of course, Jeff Jarvis is joining BuzzMachine.com.  How you doing, Jeff?  Great.  Glad to be here.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Nice to see you.  Also, Stacey Higginbotham, Stacey on iot.com.  What's up, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everything.  Everything.  Everything.  So much news.  I can't wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We do have a lot of stuff to talk about.  And of course here at the table to my left this time, I think last time you were on my  right, so every time we'll like trade seeds.  We'll see what works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is my bad.  No, this is my good.  Yeah, I don't know.  We can do a vote.  We got to figure out.  Which is Ant's good side.  Which side is the good side, the gray side or the not so gray side?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, is there a difference?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, there's definitely a difference.  I was looking at your facial features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  So that side's grayer.  All right.  So your left side is less gray.  Your right side is more gray.  Pretty much.  I'm just weathered.  That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Hipster gravitas.  Hipster gravitas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There you go.  Please don't make this into a GIF.  Business in front, party in the back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  Someone probably is already working on your animated GIF.  So.  I want to start with something.  Okay.  Excellent.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Take it away.  Vindicated.  Bottom of the rundown.  Dark mode is for suckers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay.  I'm so happy you brought this up.  I was wondering if it would end up making it in here.  I'm curious to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're starting with it because I'm vindicated.  Okay.  Gizmodo says it's all BS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay.  This guy on Gizmodo says it's all BS.  Yeah, this guy says it, but it's good enough for me.  He has some research.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Adam Angst at Tidbits explains in exhausting detail that except in extraordinary situations,  dark mode is not easy on the eyes in any way.  Well, how is that?  Samantha Cole reports the research has found that people with astigmatism,  light text on dark backgrounds aggravates the condition making text harder to read.  What's more, as Suzanne Mayer, University of Passau researcher said,  who conducted multiple studies and found which design screws with our brain.  In all the studies, participants were better performing in the positive polarity  condition, otherwise known as not dark mode.  They detected more errors and read faster when dark text was presented  on light background rather than the reverse.  So I just want this on the record that I'm not insane.  You're done?  My hatred for dark mode.  You hate it.  No, I'm not done.  I'm not done.  Or stick with light mode.  Light mode is the way to go.  It's the way God made phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, John, could you just kill the lights in here?  It's too bright for me right now.  It's far too bright.  Thank you.  This is what we need to do.  Thank you, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, there we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I know Ant has some opinions.  I'll just throw out the two times that I have really like I like dark mode on Twitter  where reading comprehension doesn't really matter as much because it's very short.  And then I also like it when I am in a professional setting or like a conference setting  and I'm trying to type without everybody else being really aware of what I'm typing  and that I'm typing in dark mode is awesome for that.  So those are my pro dark mode moments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I appreciate dark mode when I am in a dark environment.  Like I think that that is a very honest application of why dark mode can be very useful.  If I'm in a dark environment, like if I pick up my phone off the bedside table or whatever  and it's dark in the room and I look at it, it's a bright white.  Like that does irritate my eyes.  Shocks you.  I mean, it's not like uncomfortable or uncomfortable, not discomfort, uncomfortable.  But but at the same time, like a darker mode is more pleasing.  So your eyes are smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They figure it out.  I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So when I have a migraine, dark mode is the only way I can get online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Pulling out the migraine card.  Yeah.  I'm pulling the migraine card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm pulling the cranky old band card.  Jeff, come on.  I got it.  I got to do the migraine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You see, it's a thing.  I battle with this and I'm one of those people that see better at night time than I do in the  daytime.  And it's been that way for for about as long as I can remember.  As a matter of fact, just within the last hour, I was walking the hallway and I had on my  sunglasses and I had to think, oh, take your sunglasses off.  You forgot that you were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I want you to do the show in the sunglasses.  This is your new look.  OK, yeah, I would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I'm I really do.  They add a little use to it.  I do get better use out of the dark mode on my eyes because of the sensitivity.  I like having a better contrast when I look at the screen and heck, even sitting in the  office with Mr. Howell here.  Yeah, when I get I get here before them most of the time and the office is dark and I have  on one little lamp because that's enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you look at your dark mode with sunglasses on?  Are you double dark mode?  I have super duper dark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not on purpose, but I have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right, here's the next question.  So when you're on a plane.  Sunglasses.  There's a lot of fighting going on.  Now, a lot of fighting going on these days on on the rights on planes.  And when I got on the plane because I'm global services bowed down before me.  I got on the plane before the pilot does.  I get on first.  Right.  I go to the seat on the aisle.  I always raise the shades.  I want the shades up.  I can't stand people.  The shades down.  Are you a shades up or shades down person on plane?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good question.  There's a good reason for this, though.  I am a shades up.  But that's because I am a aviation nerd.  I love airplanes, so I'm always looking out with my sunglasses.  With my sunglasses on.  Shades.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm a shades down.  Jeff, I can't believe it.  We don't agree on anything.  A secret.  Shocking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, again, you know, for me, it mirrors my dark mode rationale.  Like, it depends on the time of day.  If it's daytime, I want the shades up.  If it's nighttime or if it's like early morning, that's probably the more applicable time.  Like, if I, you know, travel to the airport and it's like 5 30 in the morning,  I have to catch a flight or whatever and the sun's going to come up and I do want to sleep  a little bit.  Sure, shades down.  That's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I'm also the same person that discussed last week that I wear my glasses just sparingly.  And it's clearly helped my eyes over the years.  Because I don't have to wear them all the time the way most people.  No, it's vanity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's pure vanity.  No, no, no, I don't wear my glasses all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How could you not deserve it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's because I hate having a filter between me and people I'm talking to.  I feel like I don't know why.  I just, I always take them off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can't walk to the bathroom from bed without glasses on.  I can't talk to anything without glasses on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wow.  Yeah, my eyes are probably about as bad as yours.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry to hear that.  Yeah.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I just want on the record here that Gizmodo says dark mode is for suckers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And Andrew Coutts says it so we should all heed what he says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's it. I never quote Gizmodo, but now they're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. And I mean, a large part of what he's saying here is that it's a trend.  Like dark mode is a trend.  Therefore, people like it because people like it.  And I mean, yeah, there's probably a little bit of truth to that actually.  Sheeples, dark mode sheeples.  But I know that I like it for reasons outside of that too.  I think at certain times a day for me, it's more aesthetically pleasing to my eyes.  Yeah, I agree with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are people that are following the trend because they've heard about it.  But again, there's people like me, it's just for comfort.  Yeah, comfort.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And some people will tout the battery savings and everything.  Andrew makes the point, like if you really added it up, you're probably not saving that much.  A lot of dark mode is not true dark anyways.  It's like a shade of gray and you're still burning battery.  You can do that.  So what are you really saving?  And you have to be on the, you know, an AMOLED display so that you have to have the right  display technology for that to even matter.  So anyways, I don't know.  If you like dark mode, now you have the option at the end of the day.  Isn't it nice to have options?  Yes, it is.  Options are good.  All right.  I'm happy we got the most important story out of the way at the very top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was going to ask about that because I saw it in Jeff.  Did you send it to us or did I just see it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was so victorious.  I emailed it to the team during the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're like, boo.  I saw it and I just said, bless his heart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There you go.  That is that is the true Southern passive aggressive right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bless his little heart that Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's funny.  All right.  So where do we even go from dark mode?  From there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's the highlight of the show clearly already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right.  Cool.  Well, we started on top.  That's it.  It's over.  It's time to descend into.  We want to talk about neutrality.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We want to talk about Google.  Yeah.  Let's talk about Google a little bit.  We'll do Google and then we'll go for it.  Yeah.  Then we'll spread out and spread our wings into Amazon.  Because I know we're going to talk about Amazon a little bit because Stacey,  that event was after last week's twigs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So yeah, I missed our I missed Twig because I was at Amazon's event.  You guys were there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I remember I have a question for you, Stacey, when we get to it.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right.  What about this whole DNS over HTTPS thing in Chrome?  Wall Street Journal has a report that reveals the House Judiciary Committee is investigating  Google for its.  You guys explain this to us.  Implement DNS encryption within the Chrome browser.  And ISPs are complaining about this.  Basically, from what I gather, Google wants to make things safer and more secure and more  private for users of Chrome.  And so baking in encryption, DNS encryption within the Chrome browser would allow them  to do that.  But ISPs are realizing, hey, when you do that, we can no longer see the activity of users  using the browser and therefore we cannot do the things that we want to do with all of that data  to make money on our end.  And that's not OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ask a dumb question, which is my stock and trade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I might not even have an answer for it.  What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, so DNS resolves a name to an address.  Once I go to that IP address, that can't be encrypted from the ISP because they got to take  me to that address, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is saying that your DNS resolver, which can be operated by your ISP or you can go through  another service, that's what they're saying.  They want to make that encrypted and they want to make that a standard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So if you see something, I'm dumb, I'm dumb.  Go slow here.  OK, just go slow.  What part of that transaction is encrypted?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right now, nothing.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But if Google gets its way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If Google gets its way, what will happen?  OK, here we go.  I'm just pulling up the site just so I can make sure I don't do this wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hold on to the table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're all counting on you, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, this is DNS.  So DNS, the process of looking up the IP address when you type the site's name in, right?  So I typed in stacey on iot.com in the web browser.  There's this magical long number that happens.  The DNS is the look up to match that name, Stacey on IT, to that number to send you to that place.  What they want to do is they want to route that over HTTPS, which is the current secure protocol  that we route everything over.  And Google, was it two or three years ago that they were like made HTTPS?  The fall requirement, yes.  A requirement?  So they want to do this for doing DNS lookups over that so people can't eavesdrop  during that transaction where they're looking this up.  And they're going to block and they're going to do that by encrypting your DNS requests.  Oh, what is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, so because that's an external communication to somebody else's DNS.  I use 1.1.1.1.  It goes over there.  They want to encrypt that so that nobody can snoop on that.  However, once I get back the number, it's 123.4.5.5.6,  then the ISP knows where I'm going.  So how is the ISP left out of any data other than the name of the  server, which they could probably reverse resolve?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, but your ISP, like.  OK, your ISP still.  OK, I see what you're asking.  You're playing stumped with Stacey.  No, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm like, OK, here's where here's why my brain,  if you're not using your ISP's DNS.  Chat room.  Because I don't use it.  So they shouldn't ever see it.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, but they but they're always going to see the IP number of where I go,  because they have to route me to it.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, because you're the DNS service is routing you to it.  You're doing all of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's always going to be this time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  Like if you're using one dot one dot one dot, however many ones or Google's.  Right.  They're doing the resolution, not your ISP.  Your eyes, but every time all those packets are being encrypted.  So your ISP just sees the encrypted packets.  They go up to the DNS resolve.  Even the IP number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I open a page, I open Stacey on IoT and say compact design, wonderful page.  So there's 10 server calls that one page, one page.  Each of those calls is then the ISP is blind to each call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I believe so.  OK, well, let me keep reading.  Now I'm looking at other options.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and I'm reading through the SARS Technica article by Timothy B Lee,  why big ISPs aren't happy about Google's plans for encrypted DNS.  It says in here, ISPs could still see which IP address a customer had accessed,  which would give them some of this information,  which could be an effective way to detect malware infections, for example.  But this is a cruder way to monitor internet traffic.  Multiple domains could share a single IP address.  Domains can change IP addresses over time.  So they'd wind up with reduced visibility of their customers browsing habits,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the next question becomes, why does your ISP need to know this in any case?  Well, that's a great question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Which is why most people are targeting VPNs now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Monitoring for copyright infringement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they do it just, I mean, they used to remember how they used to do DNS takeovers.  Do you guys remember that?  Let's see, I'm trying to remember Frontier used to do it and some other small ISP used to do it.  If you type in a URL slightly wrong, you would get an ad from your ISP.  They want to have this information.  And I should say, in the chat room,  someone just explained that the DNS server does not do the resolution.  So I'm sorry on that one.  The DNS server does not route packets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I sent to the website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  My bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So given the choice of trusting my ISP or Google,  Hey, I'm on this with Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, but this is DNS over HTTPS.  This isn't just a Google thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But Google is the fight.  Google is trying to do something that the ISP is fighting.  Whom do I trust in that fight?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, always trust Google over the ISPs if they're fighting.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would agree with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a good rule of thumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And Google has also said it has no plans to centralize or change, go away Google,  to centralize or change people's DNS providers to Google by default also.  So there have been people, some that have wondered or questions Google's intent to move  them over to Google for the DNS provider.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is another interesting question here.  So I see PC Guy 8088.  I love saying 8088.  I agree.  So ISPs could block access over the UK because they have a list of sites that are blocked.  In nations that are blocked, does this get around things like Chinese censorship?  Oh, good question.  That is a good question.  I do not know.  Nothing but questions today, people.  Nothing but questions.  Don't answer us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would also tell you, Jeff, that Mozilla and E, I always do this wrong, EFF.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  EFF.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  EFF and Mozilla are also in favor of doing this.  So even if you don't trust Google, I'm guessing you probably trust Mozilla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You sure trust Mozilla.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And someone in chat, the name just blew past me here, but made the good point that this  isn't necessarily about Google except for the fact that Chrome is so popular.  And so if Chrome does this, then it kind of is, in many people's view, about Google because  they've made this switch that's going to affect so many users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does Firefox, Firefox has already done this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I believe that they do this.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yes, they do.  Look at this.  Retcon 5.  Thank you, Retcon 5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The on point answer right at the moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He is giving us so there you go.  He is next.  Dream for screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like the twit brain just comes together at one time.  It's so impressive.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why are we here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the question.  Retcon 5 is at zero latency right now with us.  It's right there.  She is right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, and see, here's someone saying this does not get around the great firewall,  which would make sense because that's pretty non-porous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank you very much, everybody, including Retcon 5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think we all learned a little something with that.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was not prepared for this.  I did read a lot about net neutrality, though, you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do think it's a new game.  Stump the Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's a terrible game because this sort of thing is really like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I love that because Stacey knows everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I don't know anything.  And it's so sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We weren't able to stump her this time.  Dang it.  We're going to have to work really hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I could not answer off the top of my head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's okay.  If you stump the Stacey, you get free warm bread, warm cake.  Warm cake.  Well, free warm cake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, man, you guys.  Okay.  Storyville Coffee.  They have it in Seattle and in Bay Bridge.  It's random.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Stacey is the sacrifice Stacey's making people, for those of you who came in with the actual show,  is that she could be in a coffee shop right now getting free warm cake,  but instead she sacrificed she's here with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's warm chocolate cake.  And the icing is still like not totally melty, but sort of melty.  And there's a little hint of coffee in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's so sad for Stacey.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but I like you guys a lot.  I'm sad for all of us, to be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'd rather be talking about DNS encryption, you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If we're talking about DNS encryption, we would really,  we would really prefer not to do it without you, to be honest.  It's made much better having you here.  What about translation at the border?  Lots of fun stories today.  ProPublica report shows how US Citizenship and Immigration Services  has been using and relying in many ways on Google Translate to scan refugees' social media posts  to determine whether they should be allowed in the country.  So Google provides this app and, ah, what is going on?  I'm not even saying the word.  My phone keeps waking up.  Google provides this.  We can't use the word Google on the show called This Week in Google.  Apparently.  It's going to happen like five more times, I'm convinced.  This app is not meant for this, right?  No.  I'll just say that, right?  Probably you should not use this.  One should not use this app to determine people's livelihoods or the ability for them to be safe.  It just seems like the wrong application of this particular tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you think that facial recognition has problems, Google Translate has problems.  Yes.  It's come a long way.  I've had a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google Translate.  It did help me in Shanghai, but still it could still use some work.  Yeah.  You don't want to get arrested on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I just got a press release or it wasn't a press release.  It was a story in a Chinese newspaper.  So it was written in Mandarin and I Google Translated it.  It was all about Jeff Imelt, the former CEO of GE, joining the board of a company called  Graffiti Intelligence.  And I was looking at this because someone sent it to me and they were talking about Tuya,  which is a smart home IoT company.  And I'm like, I don't see Tuya anywhere in here.  So I sent an email out to the Tuya people and I'm like, what is going on?  And they're like, oh, this is a Google Translatism.  Tuya means graffiti in Chinese.  So Tuya Smart became Graffiti Intelligence as the name of the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I had spent like a good 45 minutes trying to like, I'm like, I don't see the relationship

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that this person is telling me is here.  What is this Graffiti Intelligence?  So again, as a journalist, even I don't trust it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, there's a lot of lost nuance in the Tuya.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a wonderful, brilliant thing.  Totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's come a long way, but they actually had a demonstration in this article in Urdu.  I think that's the name of the language.  Urdu, U-R-D-U-U post would correctly translate by if a human translator took a  stab at it, it would say, I have been spanked a lot and have also gathered a lot of love,  in parentheses, for my parents.  Google Translate's version came out to the beating is too big and the love is too windy.  So there's nuance that is definitely lost in translation.  And, you know, it also kind of smacks of, we talked about this a little bit last week  on Tech News Weekly with Micah.  This was one of his stories of the week.  And for me, it just kind of smacks of using a tool that might not be perfect for the job,  but for some of the folks who are using this tool, that's actually a really convenient  fact that it doesn't do a good job of the translation because it creates more uncertainty,  which could result in making it much easier to say, no, you can't come into the country.  And let's just say some people, that is priority number one.  So not just poor judgment, but incorrect judgment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Absolutely right. Incorrect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're at the chaos administration.  Something like this helps contribute.  Totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Totally.  And I mean, the manual for the service, for the US citizenship and immigration services reads,  the most efficient approach to translate foreign language contents is to utilize one of the many  free online language translation services provided by Google, Yahoo, Bing, and other search engines.  And it's just such a critical application, like our critical need  being translation to rely on these free services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mistranslated, tries to explain.  Their language is not going to be up.  It's just a cluster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's baffling to me that we have people, granted, there are plenty of languages that are way more  esoteric, but probably the top 10 languages, I feel like we should have people who are multilingual.  I mean, that doesn't seem tough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it should.  It's just definitely uncommon here.  I know in my travels, it blew my mind when I went somewhere and people could speak English  as well as I do, or attempt to speak English.  Or sometimes better.  Right, or better.  You didn't even grow up where I grew up.  So how are you able to just grab all of these extra languages and it's no big deal.  But here in the US, it's like, you go to a hotel, and they speak four languages and you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  think in the US you'd be lucky to get two tops.  I always say I speak 1.1 languages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, you've got some choice phrases that I know I've heard on the show many times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gutenberg is just someone's name though, Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Good enough.  Good enough for me.  Let's see here.  New European copyright laws.  Gonna stop Google from showing news snippets to French users.  This is a big deal.  Only showing headlines, not the first few lines from the story or even a thumbnail image.  Although publications can request to show those previews if they prefer.  European publishers can do that.  France is the first to implement the copyright reforms.  Other countries have around a year to implement them.  So this is like the beginning of a...  So funny I should mention the Leichtdorfschutzrecht.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  Because this is a continuation of that.  Leichtdorfschutzrecht, ancillary copyrights, try to stop Google from showing snippets unless  they paid.  Google said FU.  Publishers said FU and back.  They went a week without Google.  They said, oh, never mind.  You can show our stuff.  Then it went to Spain where there was a link tax.  There was no choice in the matter.  Google had to negotiate payment.  Google said, no, we're not doing that.  Google's news left Spain.  Then it became part of the infamous articles 11 and 13, which later became articles 15 and 17.  Don't ask me how, I don't know.  Of the European copyright directive.  An effort to have a copyright reform so there's one regime across Europe.  The publishers lobbied for this.  They won.  It's a snippet law.  Google cannot put up content, no, shush, cannot put up snippets unless they have negotiated  the license.  Google's saying we're not going to do that.  We're never going to do that.  We don't pay for content.  We don't get paid either.  This is not the way we do it.  We're not doing it.  Richard Gingras, who's head of Google News, went to France to make clear to everybody  this was the case.  We'll put your link in, but we won't put the snippet in.  You're not going to get any traffic out of it because nobody's going to know if it's  worth clicking on, but hey, you asked for it.  You can say, yes, as Jason just said, you can say, no, put us up, but that's the only  condition of which is going to happen.  And this is going to happen across all of Europe.  It's going to hurt publishers terribly.  I've been in rooms with, I was at Google News, guys in Athens in Europe about two months  ago, journalists in the room, in a big room in one of the sessions that I caused, were  complaining mightily about the saying it's going to kill them.  And I said, blame your bosses.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How long do you think we'll see this eventually get turned around?  Is this something that could be turned around within a quarter?  Is it going to take a year of going through?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I think every time it's happened, a good question.  I think when it happened, it originally happened in Belgium where there was an effort to do  this earlier than the Leistung Schutzrecht, which I love saying.  And the Belgian publishers turned right around.  The German publishers turned around.  The Spanish publishers lost traffic forever.  I think that most publishers in France will turn around in a week or two and say,  okay, Google, uncle, put up our content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm surprised my phone didn't show up.  Somehow my phone missed it.  Somebody out there, they got it.  All right.  So a couple of weeks before the publishers themselves say, yes, okay, make this happen  because we've already seen stuff, you know, the traffic tank.  I mean, I can't recall if you mentioned this, but Spain, Germany, you know, they had tried  this years ago, taking the snippets out of the news articles and ultimately, you know,  they had to, yeah, it completely backfired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So in fact, part of the argument in Germany around the Leistung Schutzrecht.  Let's see how many times it is.  What does that word mean?  The drinking game at this point.  It's translated as ancillary copyright.  Okay.  I'm not sure.  Okay, Google, translate Leistung from Germany to English.  Power.  Power.  I don't know.  I don't know, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love how Germans have these phrases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you got me back.  That was stump the Jeff.  You get free warm cake.  Don't say that if you can't follow through.  Yeah.  What was the question?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a good question.  I can't remember.  I was distracted by cake.  Yeah.  So, all right.  I don't know where to go on from there.  Copyright.  From copyright.  Where do we go?  Yes, I know.  I know.  I know.  Now I'm just thinking about cake.  I've got this warm cake repeating in my brain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We could talk about jackets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  So I know that a couple of weeks ago,  you guys talked a little bit about the Yves Saint Laurent backpack strap that has-  Strap.  That is Project Jacquard.  There's actually a whole backpack.  It's not just the strap.  That's true.  The whole backpack exists and then the strap has Project Jacquard in it.  For touch sensitivity, control of your phone, that sort of stuff.  Now we've got a jacket, which is not the first jacket that we've seen with this.  In fact, the first product was a couple of years ago.  It was a Levi's Courier jacket.  So this is the backpack from a couple of weeks ago.  And now Levi is selling, about to sell anyways, a couple of new denim jackets  with a smaller Jacquard tag than before.  And the tag is the electrical kind of pod that actually does the transmission via Bluetooth.  It has to live somewhere in the jacket.  So I think they're putting it in the sleeve.  It's a smaller profile.  So in two years, they've reduced the size of that.  A trucker and Sherpa trucker jackets for men and women, $198 to $248,  which I think jean jackets are kind of in that price range, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, the Levi's jackets, like a straight up Levi's trucker, is usually around $85.  If you do the Sherpa though, it's going to be much more.  Okay.  They're sub 100.  Okay.  Really?  I thought they were over a hundred bucks.  I thought.  The truckers?  I feel like I just was in the market for one.  I mean, that was a ladies jacket, but yeah, I'm seeing them for $98 to $70.  Nordstrom's has it for $98.  So that's as expensive as you go.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm clearly out of touch on that.  So smart jacket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it was their commuter jacket for people who care about jackets,  which I actually do care about.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, so the first one that they did was the, was it the commuter jacket or the courier?  It's their commuter jacket.  Their commuter jacket.  Okay.  And that was, if I remember correctly, Google really, when they first announced this,  it was like, it was for, you know, bike couriers was kind of what they, what they promoted.  They're going to afford this.  Yeah.  Right.  Like that when you're riding, you don't want to look at your phone.  So you can see, you know, slide your hand on your seat.  I'm surprised we haven't seen the Jacquard hoodie given where it comes from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  The land of hoodies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, you're right.  You're right.  I was a little late on that one, but you're absolutely right.  They need to have some hoodies out there.  All of Silicon Valley would, it would probably become a status symbol.  You know where I want the Jacquard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where?  I want it in my couch.  I actually want the little thing in my arm of my couch or my recliner, because then  that's my new remote control.  Yes.  That would be cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's cool.  I like that.  And the back of your couch would have a little plug for you to plug it into the power supply.  You wouldn't need it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I don't think you need a plug for this.  You just, it's just, you'd have the little, the little, I guess it is.  It's the battery part that connects to it, but you wouldn't need a plug.  You could just place it or charge up the little battery thing.  Yeah, you're right.  I'm going to want that charged.  Nevermind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If your couch is just always going to be there, you might as well just have it plugged in and  out of the way.  You might as well have your couch plugged in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm old enough to remember when they had these things that you could buy for the couch to  put over the arm with two pockets, one for the clicker, as we called it, we old people,  and one for the TV guide.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, you can still buy those to put on your bed.  If your bedside table, you stick it underneath your mattress and then you have this little  pocket. They still sell those.  For your phone?  It's for whatever you want to stick in the pocket.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And do they still sell-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This was specially made for beer and whiskey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do they still sell TV guide?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, it's bigger now.  In print?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a full-size magazine now.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Fancy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. Moving on up.  My day.  It was tiny.  It was tiny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was like a little journal size thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  As it sometimes says on my lower third, former TV guide critic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Tell me you've got at least one copy of the TV guide framed in your house.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was promoted on the cover for my first issue. There was a Roseanne cover  as Lucille Ball and then there was a little thing. Meet our new TV critic.  Nice.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, wow. You and Roseanne sharing space. Wow.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Six degrees of Jeff and Roseanne.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She blocks me on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  second link I put up in the chat. Stacey, I know you're going to order this tonight immediately for  your decor at home. I know you're going to want this. That is a link. Where is it? Holy cow.  It's the second link. It's Amazon. That link is like a paragraph, half a page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where is it? Which chatter am I supposed to be on the on the rundown? The doc chat. Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay. So John, there I put it in the chat chat. There we go. That is beautiful.  That is gorgeous. And only $20 is the San Lee chair cover, which has a TV remote control holder,  arm rest organizer, sofa chair protector with five pocket armchair caddy.  We used to just use plastic and some egg crates. It's water resistant, which means I bet it's  case-o resistant. Case-o resistant. Yes. And it comes in gray. Perfect. You got a place for your  sunglasses for when you're sitting in your chair and you need to put your sunglasses on.  Oh, good. That's brand. Perfect brand. The sunglasses don't come off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's for your normal glasses if you need to switch to those. That makes more sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, he's too vain to wear those. That's why they're in the chair pocket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think a vain person has one of these chair cover things either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, you're probably right. Wow. That thing, especially not in the coffee color. Like I could  maybe understand the gray. Gray is quite sophisticated.  The beige is looking pretty as well. That thing is $20 too expensive.  Actually, there's a coupon to save an extra 10%. So we can knock a couple of dollars off that  price for you. What's it going to take to get you into one of these things, Ann?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We always get Leo to buy things on the show. I think you should buy this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Anesthesia. Yes, exactly. You could review it on Hands on Tech.  That would be no. I mean, it's kind of technology. It holds technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It holds technology. You know what you could do? Google needs to make a Jacquard version of one of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  these. That's what I'm saying. There you go. Oh, okay. I'm sorry, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. You see, that's the whole thing. Oh, and then it's like a retrofit for my furniture.  Yeah. I like it. You could think of yourself as Captain Kirk.  I do think of myself as Captain Kirk often, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not touching that. Perfect. It's a match made in heaven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right. Sorry. Back to normal programming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I didn't know that existed until just now, and now I'm frightened.  I know the last time I was on, we talked about Google Pixel 4 leaks because, man, we've known  everything. Hey, you are the god of Android.  We've known everything about this phone for so long now that I kind of feel like showing  new renders of the phone. It really doesn't matter anymore. We know exactly what it looks like.  We know exactly what it offers. But what has happened over the course of the last week is,  and especially 9to5 Google, I feel like is leading the charge. They are, and then XDA have  posted a number of exclusives being polled from these Pixel 4s, which maybe I should actually  start with the fact that somebody is selling Pixel 4 demo units for $1,200.  So if anyone wants to get into the pre-release, pre-announcement Pixel 4 leak game-  For a mere $1,200, huh?  For a mere $1,200, you can go and buy from online shady sellers. I'm assuming a lot of the other

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  people that have leaks, is that what they did? Google put out a lot of stuff and then they  released a lot of stuff in their code, but then I guess maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, yeah. I mean, all the people that have the actual device and have been showing it off,  I'm really fascinated to know how that happened or how it continues to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I still say marketing 201 at Cal State Furlitton or wherever university you are.  That's just Google marketing. I still believe that. I don't believe in the whole supply chain  leak. This is Google just-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, the supply chain totally can leak. And you can see it when you talk to different companies.  If I talk to a chip supplier, if you mention Apple, nothing. But if you talk about other  companies, they'll talk about all kinds of crazy features coming out. So there is very much a fear  of God component to some of these things. And Google probably just doesn't have the- And they  don't have the market share either. I mean, like what if you're if you're canceled from the Pixel 4,  it's not like it's going to sell. All the reason why I believe Google's pushing it out themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't have the market share. Just push it on out and embrace these leaks, if you will,  which is what they've done for the last couple of months. They've gotten tons of free publicity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're right. In a way, they get more than one day's publicity. They've gotten three weeks of  everything you want to know about it. That's not so dumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right. So by the time the announcement happens, though, we will have been hearing  about this phone and seeing official press images from Google. A couple of months ago,  we saw the official, like, yeah, that's it. And they posted the back of the phone. So we will  have already known about this phone for three solid months before it ever-  The keynote's going to be about 10 minutes long.  It actually happens. The keynote's probably going to be the same length it always is.  So it's like, yeah, never mind the fact that you know everything. Here's everything again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Give everyone bingo cards. That's what we need to make before the 15th, right?  Let's do it, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I like it. I like it.  So does it have a headphone jack or no?  No. Oh, heck no. They'll save that for the A version, if and when there is a 4A.  At least that's what they did with the 3A. They kept the headphone jack on there.  No headphone jack as far as I've seen in anything. I think that's pretty certain.  That's not going to be there. What we're seeing from 9to5Google, though, are a number of leaks  around kind of some of the software features that we're going to expect to find. A Pixel Themes app,  which actually the APK- So someone who had this pre-release phone has gone in there and ripped  out a bunch of APKs and published them online. So you can actually use them in advance of the  Pixel 4. So the Pixel Themes app is embedded and integrated into the wallpaper. When you tap and  hold on the screen, it gives you the wallpaper section. And then in there is a styles, like a  theming section. Actually, I forgot. I installed it so I could actually show you.  Do we have it in the whole shot? I forgot to even set that up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're such a rogue, Mr. Howell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, my apologies. I expected it not to work last night on the show, and then for whatever reason,  it ended up working. So styles and wallpapers, if I go in there and down at the bottom, you can see  the little style button. And when I go over there, you can then go in here and theme just a bunch of  different aspects of the ULS. It looks like dark mode to me.  Yeah, it does look like dark mode, doesn't it? I probably have it on right now, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's saving his battery. I probably have it on right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're going to get an extra 30 seconds of time today.  Congratulations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sans Serif? Serif.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I like that.  XDA, we had Michel Roman on last night, editor in chief of XDA, and he was saying that when this hits  officially, there's going to be more options than just two fonts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like Serif. That's cool. Yeah, that's nice. The hell with Helvetica.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There will be more icon options right now. It doesn't really give me much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you hate Serifs too, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm now just going to be in opposition on all of these insignificant things. I'm just going to be  like, yes, I am. Grow Helvetica. Take your time to do Roman and shut it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Whatever the opposite of what he just said is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hellvetica, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My font got a documentary. What did your font get?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nothing yet.  Go to Helvetica.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And if there is no documentary for that font, that's opportunity right there.  I think you should be the one to make it happen.  So we're going to see theming. Another thing that just posted right before showtime was  were a bunch of videos that I'm not really quite sure what the back story is, but leaked videos  from Google as far as what the new Google Assistant on the Pixel 4 is going to be.  We saw a little bit of it at Google I.O. how, if you remember, the woman went on stage and just  did this constant stream of actions, talking to the phone. It was doing all these things  and blooping and blipping all around and with no pausing to wait for it to catch up or whatever.  And it was definitely a big moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What happens when it's thousands of people making that request?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the beauty of it. It's all on device.  And that was part of what they were saying months ago is that the next Pixel phone will be capable  of doing that. So I'm wondering if some of the hardware in there,  they've shrunk down the data set to allow for it to be stored on the device.  Maybe the hardware makes some of this stuff even faster, zero latency, that sort of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But is this enough to get those Samsung customers? Is this enough?  I'm not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What can Google do?  What do you have there, Jeff? What am I looking at?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A Caslong type specimen.  Type specimen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have this hanging in my office. I love Sarah, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Take that. Do you have a framed font picture in your office, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm looking around. No, no, I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You might have a documentary, but do you have a font set framed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  Stacey one, Jeff two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true. I have, I have this. Oh no, that's from the spy museum, not the museum.  I was like, I have a picture of a poster with a sans-serif font, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sort of. Yeah, that's a half point, I'd say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know why, but I'm feeling very impish tonight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You are punchy. I'm enjoying the punchy, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I, so did, I don't know if we've talked, well, I'm pretty sure we didn't talk about that because  I actually was paying attention, but did the, did you guys see the, the leak about voice  transcription on the Pixel 4? Cause I was like, I would like that now, please.  Oh, no.  Which is.  Oh yes, I did see that, that mentioned.  Yeah, it automatically transcribes your voice memos and turns them into searchable content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Isn't that, isn't that already on 10 Android 10?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you're talking about the, you're talking about the recorder app, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. The native, the native app.  I'll go ahead and show it. This, this is my tool for the.  Oh, I'm sorry.  No, no, don't be sorry. It's actually really, it is actually really cool. So this was a,  one of the APKs that was leaked from the Pixel 4, it's called a recorder and it is a voice recorder.  When you hit the record, it starts recording. You can see up there, it's detected. What I'm  saying is speech, right? That's the waveform for it. As I showed last night on the show, if I whistle  it picks up whistling, it's able to determine different, different types of audio.  And there's like a list of things that it can actually determine. I think even like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  bark like a dog. Let's see what it does. Oh, clapping is also no clapping is not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Apparently clapping doesn't work. What about barking like a dog?  Oh, no, that's laughter. Okay.  Okay. It doesn't pick up fake laughter. I love it. But anyways, I can go over to transcripts  and everything that I've said is has been turned into text and it's doing it in real time because  again, this is all happening on device and not in the cloud, which is just unbelievable. So if I  stop this and go ahead and save that, I could add tags and stuff like that. And then if I go  up to it, everything that I have is saved here, which allows me to, let's see, let me pick out a  word laughter. So I'll go ahead and search. Oh, sorry. I didn't realize you were up close.  Let's see here. Laughter. And then if I search that, it takes me to the point in the audio  that laughter was spoken. Oh, wow. No, no, that's laughter. Okay. Oh, what this does for reporters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Totally. It's actually really cool. That's why I was like, I was reading about this and I'm  like, Oh crap, I should have bought the four. Now my daughter's going to get the three a sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because it needs the processing power or the four. Well, I don't know. I'm running on my three XL

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  and it seems to work pretty well. So I'm going to say no, I mean, I don't know if Google is going  to intend for it to only be on the four, but the APK is, is, is that there in the wild? I'd go get  it. Yeah, I'd go get it. Yeah. Yeah. You can go to APK mirror.com. That's the site that is owned  and operated by the folks at Android police. So you can trust it. And they have the APK posted  there for you to download. And as it gets updated, they will refresh it there as well. But that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  where I got it. I'd like to see this in the wild with like at CES. We have all of this extra  ambient noise and you have the noise canceling mics on it, but I just want to test it out and  see how well it does. And cause this, a lot of times you're recording your person, your interview  into whatever and you have to write it out. And sometimes the recording sounds bad and you're  trying to remember what exactly did they say? You think they said, I'm curious to see how that  transcripts. How many people do you have in the studio? You don't take physical notes?  I do sometimes, not all the time, but I do. I was like, what? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I'm reading

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  over my transcript here and it might not be perfect, but it's pretty darn close. You know  what I mean? Google has come so far with this stuff. It's really unbelievable. Now,  I can translate it back into another language though. Not that I could tell. Still don't use  this at the border for clearing people coming into the country. I'd like to use it for recording  podcasts remotely. Just another audio recorder. Yeah. Right. Right. And then you can kind of  search in if you need to find out what the time code is for that particular edit or whatever,  jump to it. Yeah. Pretty neat stuff. And then you can also upload to a Google Drive if you  cap and hold it, share it to your drive. Yeah. I have that drive integration. Yep. Of course.  Yeah. Big surprise. Welcome to Google. Another cool feature coming to Pixel Phones will be  emergency detection for when you might have been in a car crash. That's great. So the emergency  information app is going to update to the personal safety app and car crash detection.  Essentially, it's going to be running if it detects based on your sensors and your  accelerometer readings and all that kind of stuff. If it detects that you have most likely  been involved in a car crash, it will give you the opportunity to call 911. It's hard to imagine

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  how it would know that versus a fast stop. Uber also is doing this. It has a feature called

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  RideCheck and it uses your GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope and stuff in your phone for the same  thing. It's called RideCheck. So I expect to see this on lots of things coming up.  It's actually kind of cool. Yeah. Although if you've got two people in the car running this,  is each phone going to call 911? Or how are we going to reconcile things like that?  If you think about it, my phone already asks if I'm trying to play something from Spotify and I'm  in a car, it's like, are you in the car? And it'll switch to auto mode. And I'm like, I'm not driving.  Please let me control it the way I want. Yeah. I wonder what the threshold is though,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because just like you said, if you're in traffic somewhere, you have sudden stops,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but not necessarily an impact. So they're using machine learning. So my hunch is they have enough  actual impact data that they can differentiate between what happens at a pretty granular level.  And I imagine sometimes they're going to be wrong. Uber only gives you the,  I think it just gives you the option to call 911. Oh yeah. It says you get a notification  will pop up and be like, Hey, are you all right? Yes. And that's what you get here. Essentially,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it would sound a tone at the loudest volume and then asks if you need help in that moment. Do you  need help? And you could then say, yes, I need help or call 911 or whatever. And then it would  do it for you. If you say nothing, what happens? That's a great question. I actually don't know  the answer to that. It might be in the article and I missed it, but that's important. Waiting

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  for the story where someone gets a heart attack, nothing happened, but the sirens come rushing to  them. That's what gives them a heart attack and they die. If no response is provided,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the pixel will proceed to automatically dial 911 and share your location. Okay. Oh, that's so I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  will tell you, my mom, when I was a very young child, had an ectopic pregnancy while she was  driving to work. And that means that it's in the wrong space in your body and it just explodes.  You bleed to death internally, basically. And she was driving a car and she was losing blood and she  passed out and ran into a guard rail. And it was like five in the morning. Someone did see and call  because she lives in Houston, but it was early enough, but it's possible that my mom could have  bled to death. So something like this is actually kind of awesome. And there was news, Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  published news. I can't remember when this was, probably like a month or a month and a half ago,  something about calling emergency services without using your voice. Because if I remember  correctly, it had something to do with like, if you're in a situation where you can't speak,  but you still need help, you'd be able to use your phone to call someone emergency services.  I want to say that would be something to look towards, like if people were being held up.  Yeah. Right. I do remember seeing that. That's exactly it. So I wonder if that's going to be,  kind of rolled into this as well. Another feature of this is a quick sharing of emergency status  with select contacts. So like you were saying, if you made no response, calls 911, but then it also  pings whatever contacts you've identified as like emergency contacts to let them know. Of course,  Google has all the backend stuff to make phone calls for us now. So I'm sure it's probably really  good at notifying in that instance as well. Oh my gosh. And it could possibly get through

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  do not disturbs too. Like in that situation, I wouldn't want to have to call someone three  times to be like, hi, I'm dying in a car accident. Oh, right. Right. That would be really interesting  because right now we have so much infrastructure set up around, you know, not reaching people

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  during certain times. Oh yeah. Although I know on my do not disturb, I have it set to allow  starred contacts. Certain contacts. Okay. And I wonder if Google would go so far as to override  the do not disturb settings on someone's phone if they were marked as a, I think if you're going  to call 911, you might as well. Yeah. I mean, I agree. It's a pretty big call right there.  No, I completely agree. But that would, that would over, that would supersede someone's specific  instruction to say only let calls through and do not disturb in this particular scenario. So maybe  there should be a setting in there or something to allow them to opt in, I suppose. But I, but I  completely agree in case of emergency, they're probably going to want to know. So there you go.  But anyways, I love this feature. I think it's my new master. They're going to save, save lives.  Absolutely. And I mean, these are features that, you know, you find in like on star,  that sort of stuff, and that requires a monthly fee. So it does, you know, this is something very  similar to that and just kind of baked into pixel phones. So another feature of having a pixel, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And, you know, if there's too many false positives, you could see something happen.  Like a lot of municipalities, for example, only give you like two or three free,  free responses to like emergency things. So like if ADT calls, if it's a false positive and they  send out the police, they'll start charging you after a certain point in time. So I guess we could  see something like this if there's a lot of false positives. I'm pretty sure Google's probably  pretty good at figuring this out though. Yeah. Yeah. And then finally, if you've been

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  waiting for the day that Google would update its pixel buds, apparently. Well, actually,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  actually, I was thinking about getting some buds. And I went to Best Buy, then I said, no, Jeff,  hold on. There's an event coming up. Yeah. Right. And I thought maybe they'll improve these suckers

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and they'll be good. I only know one person that loved those things. Only one person loved them.  And that's because they had funky ears. It's about the best way I can describe it. I didn't feel like

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  they fit my ears very well. Ron Richards on all that Android, he actually loves them. So that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  two people. I can't wear those ear things. I cannot do earbuds. They just do not, they just fall right out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't have a problem with earbuds. Have you changed this a little to the smallest setting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The little loop-de-loo thing? Yeah. Well, no, I was going to say, have you actually  used the custom earbud things? Do you actually customize them? Oh, the tips. I've changed the  tips on some. I changed the tips. Yeah. Oh, okay. I had a friend who was like, they never fit me.  And I asked them and they were like, what? So I was like, maybe. The things that just kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  hang in your ear? Impossible. Okay. Yeah. What do you have on now? Oh, these are like just little

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  white earbud. I don't even, I think I pulled them out of my jar of tricks because I didn't want my  big heavy ones. But there are two new buds out, the Microsoft ones from this morning and the  Amazon buds that bring you Madam A in your ear from last week and then presumably the new ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So there's a cornucopia of buds. I love that you did that. You're making the segues easy,  Stacey. How about this? Let's thank the sponsor and then we will come back and we'll talk about  Amazon. We will talk about this morning's Microsoft event. Ant was on set with Micah this morning.  With one eye open, trying to stay awake. It was a little early. It's okay. You get up really early  these days. So it's all right. It's no big deal. And then of course, Stacey, you were at the Amazon  event. So follow up. I have questions for you, Stacey. Can't wait to hear your reaction to  things. I can't wait either.

It's the freshest, I feel like there was  a big surprise in the Microsoft announcement this morning that there were a couple at the very end,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  right? Yeah, right there at the very end. They did their whole one more thing, but I think it was more

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  like a 1.1 thing. It was one more thing and then what, did he go off stage and then he came back

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and he's like, oh, actually there's another thing. He literally said, thank you, thank you, thank you,  as if, all right, that's the end of the story. And then we get the Neo, which is a beautiful  dual display device, but the Duo right after that, that was quite a surprise, quite a surprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I mean, we've been hearing for a long time now that Microsoft is just out of the mobile phone  game. Allegedly they are. Allegedly. Didn't really work for them. So they kind of, you know,  back to the drawing board apparently. And so the Duo is actually running Android, right? Right.  That's part of the reason that we would talk about this on this show. What did you think?  It kind of seems like we know very little about it at this point, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Again, I'm going to go on record, as I said, in the live stream that we had here on the network.  The Duo, I'm not sold on it because I'm just not ready for the foldable phone.  I just don't see where that fits in my workflow. I know there's some people that think  having the extra screens in their pocket is just giving them a smaller version of a tablet,  but I just can't get into it. I do like the fact that the screen is not foldable itself. There's a  space in between the hinges. So you don't have to deal with what Samsung was dealing with for a  $2,200 device that's going to eventually wear out, regardless of how many times they tested it in  their labs. So you got that going for it. But the Neo on the other hand, I totally dig that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now the Neo is not Android. This is a Windows 10X.  Not Android. It's Windows 10 only. 10X, sorry.  What about it has you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because you're getting productivity out of it. You have the dual screens, but you can have  basically like a smaller laptop, if you will. You get your extra keyboard that pulls out,  that's magnetically attached to it. It can slide to give you an extra  touch bar like what Mac had on the MacBook Pros, the touch bar, but it's actually useful

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  in not getting in the way. So is it a tablet? I'm sorry. The Neo is a tablet or is it a laptop?  The Neo is a tablet. Okay, it's a tablet with an attached keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, right. But it's just small enough. Now the way they demoed it in the keynote is they  were holding it more like a book. Yeah, definitely they were holding it like a book.  I don't like that. Give it more of a clamshell productivity form. They called it a posture.  That's what they kept saying during the keynote. Posture. If you set it up more like a laptop,  I think it's a great device for about a nine, I think it was a nine inch display.  But the phone, the duo, nice that they're jumping in with the Android world and trying to get that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  market share, but it's not for me. But they went to great lengths from what I understand to not  call it a phone, right? No, they didn't. Why? Maybe because there's still more development.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay. Yeah. This isn't coming out until like holiday of 2020. 2020, correct. Yeah, this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  a ways out. That's like a full year. I give them credit for not rushing into it the way other OEMs

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  have, but it's nice to just wait. Yeah. Early preview out a little more than a year from now.  The version that they were showing has a Snapdragon 855, which is this year's nearly top of the line.  It was top of the line until the 855 plus came out. So if they stick with that and it comes out next  year, running into the complaints of like, okay. But again, this is a non-production version.  Totally. Hopefully that would upgrade by then. I totally agree. I'm not a big fan of the  foldable technology the way it is now because from a fragility standpoint, things are so fragile.  You're spending too much money for that to break. Yeah. At the same time, the scene down the middle  is really nice when you're using it for productivity, but don't watch a movie like that.  I guarantee you it's just not going to be fun seeing that line through the middle of your movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like with the Neo, they had the dockable options. If you're running Windows 10,  you're used to pinning windows along your display, but you can do this with the Neo and put it down  on that lower tier screen just above your keyboard and hop back up to the main display and take notes  or what have you based on what you're seeing down there just above your keyboard. I think that's just  a perfect use case. It's not just, oh, it's a pretty display there. You actually get in some use

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  out of that extra real estate right there. Yeah. Do you think it will fair better than the TouchBar  has on the MacBook Pros? Clearly. Night and day. Yeah. Night and day. Now granted, Microsoft was

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  showing it off with a bunch of emojis and things of that nature, but- Which you could do on the

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  TouchBar. Whatever. I feel like the TouchBar hasn't quite lived up to what people- No.  What Apple probably expected that it would. No. But-  It's a neat idea, but yeah. I'm interested in that. Then of course, Surface Buds,  this kind of ties back in with what we were talking about before the break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Surface Buds, a lot of people didn't like the aesthetics.  We were looking in the live chat. It's like a big circle.  They look like, what do you call those? Gages. Gages that people wear.  Oh yeah. Yes, they do. But people tend to forget that when the Apple AirPods came out, they took  a lot of flak from the way they look too. And they still look weird. Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People love them, but people- My opinion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is like an etiquette thing maybe, but I noticed that my husband has the AirPods  and I can always tell when they're in his ears. So that's nice. I try not to talk to him when he  has them in his ears. Now I have the Jabra. Oh look, they're right here. I have the little  Jabra things. And when I put them in my ears, you can't actually see that there's anything in my  ears because my hair is in the way too. So he never knows to talk to me or not. He's just constantly-  Is it safe? That has nothing to do with the AirPods. I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's your excuse. You just ignore them all the time. I know how it is as a husband. I get it.  Just, oh no, I got my AirPods. I'm listening to you. Sure. But I-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So yeah, he has this weird thing where he'll walk up real close to me and he peers over into my ears  and I'm like, what is happening? But that design is really helpful because it's also nice for  people. If you have them in while you're trying to shop or something, you can see them. They don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  hide. It's like a visible do not disturb mode. Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And there's a question- That's perfect for the airplane. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Should you be wearing them all the time? Maybe not. But yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  I don't mind that design. I think it's good to be obvious in that situation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. That's not a bad place for it to be obvious when you're listening to something.  Sometimes that's why people put earphones on to begin with, whether they're listening to  something or not. I do. I want to be alone right now with my thoughts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're okay. Confession moment. Do you ever not want to talk to anybody so you put in earbuds,  but you're not actually listening to anything? Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh yeah. Yes. Totally. This is the land of introverts. What do you say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Geez. None of us want to talk to people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sometimes I just walk around with a scowl on my face and no one talks to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh yeah. That doesn't. Yeah. So in our office, actually, I have big  over ear headphones and I don't necessarily put them on because I don't want to talk to people,  but I put them on because I can concentrate. Isolation is better that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Notice the dynamic here. Jason's trying to say to his office roommate,  I'm not ignoring you. If you catch me with no sound on, it's not an insult. Really, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm just meditating. Let's put it this way. I did it long  before you got into the office there. Noted. Wow. But I feel it's almost like putting on white noise  for me. Sometimes wearing earphones and especially the over ears because they kind of block out all  sound. For me, it's like a vacuum that sucks out the noise from the room so that I can  focus on what I'm reading. I get that. I get that. But I enjoy being interrupted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Interrupt me anytime you like. I have officially been here for-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I bet he loves when you come over and tap him on the shoulder. That's probably his favorite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've officially been here for one month. That honeymoon is clearly over now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh hey, Ath. Don't bother me. Headphones are on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, the pricing of those Surface Buds, they're listed at $249. You can get them at the end of  the year, holiday season, I believe is what they said. It's the price of earbuds.  That's expensive, but I wonder if it lives up to the far as audio quality and then you have all  the other gesture controls and whatnot built into it. Will it work well with Android? I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  all the OK, G stuff and all that? Oh right. I don't know about the voice assistant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Voice assistant. And you activate a voice assistant. Yeah, so, yep. I could not. Yeah,  it works with Cortana or Google Assistant. You don't have to use

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  a voice assistant. I wish it was Willie or whatever. What's Microsoft's?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Cortana. I wish it was Willie. Hey, Willie!  Willie is a really good voice assistant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they have to have three syllables, but Willie would be awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I wish it was. I wish it was Willie. It's Cortana, by comparison, a much more boring name.  But yes, it does support that. It doesn't say anything about Siri.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wonder why. Weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And $250 for like true wireless earphones isn't actually really that expensive. I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's pricier. But again, looking at the quality you get, that's what I want to know. How will  these things sound in my ears? Because you're paying a lot of money for those dad gum horrible  beats by Dre headphones and all of that stuff. This has to be a better value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sherlyn Lowe from Engadget says that the sound quality is, it says there, let's see here,  I wouldn't go as far as to say they're top notch quality, but I wasn't disappointed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And she is in a crowded newsroom right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a pretty caveat review right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Could go either way. I think that just means wait for our review,  right? We can actually listen to these in an environment that we can control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the showroom floor with a bunch of grabby other journalists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, totally. Totally. Okay, so that's Microsoft. There were other things.  But I think we should also talk about Amazon because Amazon last week had their big announcement  with like 80,000 new products all running Alex. Sorry. Madam A. That was close. I'm sure I fired  one off anyways. So what did you think, Stacey? I actually already know because we talked to you  on Tech News Weekly, but what are some of your highlights? Okay. Yeah. And I did a bad job on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tech News Weekly because I didn't even get to like the cool gadgets. I was so busy being excited  about other stuff. So I'm sorry. No, that was great. Okay. So a week later, having had time to  process the biggest, most exciting things for me were Samuel L. Jackson, because everybody wanted  him. Hands down. In sound. So they will replace Madam A. with Samuel L. Jackson for 99 cents.  You get explicit or clean. It's pretty cool. I don't know. Is that available now? Does anyone know?  I don't know. I looked it up like two days afterwards, but I haven't looked, it wasn't  there, but I haven't looked like today. Coming soon as of today. Okay. Still coming soon.  All right. I don't think so. You got some new Echo devices, new Echo Show, medium size, not great.  You got an Echo Dot with an alarm clock. You got a tiny Echo device called a Flex that plugs into  an outlet and is like, you could put Madam A. anywhere in your house. And it's cheaper than an  Echo Dot. So if 30 bucks was too much, try 25. And then their crazy wish fulfillment, the crazy  out there devices, they introduced two. One was the Frames, which is an invitation only 179.99  pair of glasses that has Madam A. integrated into the glasses. There's no heads up display.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you see them, Stacey? They look pretty clunky in the pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they're hipster glasses. I picked them up. They actually weigh less than my glasses.  I have, I have, well, so I have some hipster glasses that are made of old press record vinyl.  So that's, I do, and I love them, you guys, but these are 31 grams. So if you scratch them just

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the right way, it plays a tune. Okay. Anyway, that is like, that is like hipster at another level is

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  sunglasses made from vinyl. This is actually Abbey Road. I'm married Abbey Road.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're all bespoke. So I'm just, everyone is custom. You don't get to choose your color on

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  the inside. You don't get to choose the artist that rep, that is printed on your glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway. Okay. We can all mock my glasses. All right. All right. These glasses,  which I really want. You get the permission after we started.  I'm just rolling with it, man. These I want, I have applied for them. I want them so badly  because I really would like Madam A to be accessible through a pair of glasses that I  wear all the time. And they're not designed, I would like it without the earbuds because I don't  like wearing earbuds because then I can't hear the world around me. So this feels kind of both safer

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and a little less. Will the next person hear what you're hearing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's very hard to hear. I had to get up really uncomfortably close to a complete stranger  to even hear that there was like something happening. Is it bone conduction? Bone conduction?  I don't know. It's not, it's not, it's not, but it's, it's really well done. Like again, complete  stranger. I'm really sorry. Whoever you were. I'm like, hello. As I lead really far in,  so it's, it's nice and they're lightweight and I'd like that they don't have the heads up display  and the battery life is enough for like 90 notifications for about a day of intermittent  Madam A use. It's only like 45 minutes of listening to music. So this is not a replacement.  It's additive to something like earbuds. And then the other thing they showed in the crazy device  category was something called the loop, which is a fat ring that has both a microphone and a speaker.  And you can talk to your hand to be like, how do I add this to my list or what is the capital of  Pennsylvania? And then you, she would tell you, you can hold it, you can hold it up to your ear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you don't do that. Really? Really? They actually showed that. And there's a video.  If you look for the video for the loop, the guy is like surreptitiously talking to it just like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then he's like, I'm sorry. I'll probably get, I'll probably get fuzz for this, but talk to the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  finger. I was like, yeah, talk to the hand. So that's a little cheaper. I don't see why you would  want that, but if you would, you can order it or you can. So it's a little tiny speaker.  It is. It's easy. You have a phone call.  You could, you can actually have a small phone call on it. I don't, I think it's only got 20  minutes of talk. Maybe that's the frames that only have 20 minutes of talk time.  I think the frames have 20 minutes of talk time. I don't know what the ring has  because who would talk to their ring?  So those were the devices. The other device that I was really stoked about was the new echo studio,  which was a shape like an ice bucket and it plays Dolby Atmos formatted stuff on a really high end  speaker. It's kind of the competitor for Google's max net. Oh God, what is it? The Google nest?  Hub max. Yeah. Yeah. So this one's $200. So one 99 99. And I kind of want it because dang,  it sounded really good. And if you have a fire TV, you could almost replace the soundbar.  I mean, this was really well engineered from an audio standpoint. So those are the devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Stacey, you left out the two things I'm most curious about, given your opinions.  Okay. One is your dog going to be, have your, have, have, have her privacy violated wearing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the Amazon dog collar thing. I can't wait to talk about sidewalk. Okay. Cause y'all, it is a new

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  wireless protocol and everyone who knows me knows that like I literally squealed in excitement.  It's doggy mesh, right? It's not a doggy mesh. We'll talk about that. Oh, okay. The exciting  thing here is what Amazon has done is create an infrastructure or the potential for infrastructure  that would allow it to set up its own wireless network, low data rate, low power wireless network  wherever it sells devices. And that is freaking amazing. And a huge coup, cause it would take out,  it would compete with businesses like Sigfox, the cellular carriers with NBIOT and things like  Laura. So what they did is they found out doing their ring security stuff. They were like,  Oh, wifi really sucks outside of the house and in the neighborhood area. So we need a good protocol  that talks that lets these lights and security things talk to each other. And they realized  that they didn't want to probably deal with cellular carriers because who wants to do that.  Of course. So they took a 900 megahertz radio. They built a wireless protocol that is secure  or that they say secure on top of it. So allows these devices to talk to each other. It's a mesh  network. It is low power. And because it's 900 megahertz, that's unlicensed spectrum, which means  they're putting this in there. Some of their ring devices, they have 700 test devices in the LA  basin among their place. It's not just that. It's all, Oh, I see the way, the way the press release

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  read it, like there were 700 dogs. No 700 rings, like devices that have this radio in it. And they've

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  created a network that covers that to show that off. They launched something called fetch, which  is a dog collar tracker thing. So when your dog goes to the gym, they're like, Oh,  so when your dog goes out of your yard, it'll notify you. But it also will be able to track  it anywhere within these other anywhere within that coverage area. So imagine now anything you  buy from ring coming about in this, not the case today, the new stuff from ring will have this  radio in it. But eventually anything you buy from Amazon, if they like this idea, could have this  radio in it. And then suddenly Amazon has this whole network infrastructure wherever they have

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  devices. See, I don't think I understand this because, well, maybe you just answered it,  wherever these devices are. What if you're in a rural area and you don't have a another neighbor

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  for another five miles? Yeah, your dog in that case is going to be lost. It has about a half,  it's 500 meters is about the coverage for one radio. Okay. So you are, this is not going to work

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  well in super rural areas. But your dog runs two miles away where they happen to have a bunch of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  them. It'll pick back up again. Right. Yeah. So if you're in an area where people have these devices,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  then you've got a de facto network and de facto. It's going to take a while before it populates

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  sufficiently. Right. So I don't know, think about how fast they've been selling Amazon echoes.  That's true. All right, Stacy, here's the question. Wait, hold on. In next year, they said they're  going to release the SDK for the protocol, which means other people could put this in their devices  and 900 megahertz is really popular for things like microwave ovens,  for baby monitors, for garage doors. It's crazy. Okay. But that doesn't mean, wait, wait, wait,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  now I got two questions. That doesn't mean, but the Amazon one is hooked up to an Amazon network  that says here's Fido. Well, whereas I've used the SDK for something else. It's not the same network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So yes, what you're so we're talking tradition. We're talking about what is essentially two  networks. One is a 900 megahertz network, which is all these devices communicating in your fetch  device. We'll talk to that. All of those devices have to have a back haul to the public internet,  which in Amazon's case in rings, the ring devices, it goes through wifi. So your dog's  tracking is actually at a 900 megahertz thing. Yes. That's your cell phone's wifi. Yes.  Any privacy implications to this? Well, that's we don't know because we don't have the protocol.  There have been precedent. So something like phone from back in, God, when was phone F O N,  that was probably 10 years ago. They wanted to share people's public wifi by creating a  separate wifi network. Your cable company actually does this already. Like Comcast has a public  network that piggybacks on your wifi. So you've got your wifi. It's personal,  but then they also use your router to have other public wifi. So  could you still exist? No, I think it might still exist. Yeah, it does. I think it still exists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. So I mean, so from a like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sure there are ways to hack into this. I'm sure Amazon has considered a lot of them.  I'm sure that it will continuously update it, just like anybody who owns a protocol should update  these things. So the answer to your question is yes, probably. But I know they're thinking about  that. I should also mention that at the event, Amazon did spend the first 10 minutes talking  about privacy and ways that they're checking privacy. All right, Stacy, you still haven't

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  answered my question. Oh, I'm sorry. What was the other question? Will your little doggy be

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  wearing one of these? No, because right now I don't live in an area where I have network coverage,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  but well, if you had network coverage, yes. Yes. Yes. Okay. Yes. All right. Here's my other device  you haven't talked about. Oh, Ms. $1,500 June oven. Oh, are you getting the Amazon oven?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How could you not have led with that? We talked about that on the show this morning. So if you  tomorrow's show is going to be very boring if you listen to my show, because you're going to hear  so big theme here. Last year, Amazon's big theme was like, keep it simple, stupid,  and like help people get their devices on the network and help make Madam A accessible all  over the place. Right. And this year they were like, hell yeah, we've done that and more.  And they had some really good talking points to prove that the next year, what they've signaled  that they're focusing on is making Madam A into a super platform that runs across all  kinds of services and devices. And the oven is a great example of the power of that platform.  June, their oven is like, is it 799 right now? Because I know they had to raise prices because  of tariffs. So it's 799. You're paying for a camera. You're paying for an Nvidia Tesla chip.  That's doing the image recognition in there. What Amazon has done is they've said, you know what,  we don't need any of that because we have this digital assistant that it has. So when you say,  make me a baked potato, the June has to recognize that I've put a baked potato in there.  Amazon's oven, I'll just tell it that I'm putting a baked potato in there and then it cooks it.  And that's a very fundamental difference, but it makes a cheaper device  and it shows the power of this type of Madam A platform. And that is what I think about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is there a separate Madam A device from the actual oven or is it built into the oven?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You do need a dot. So the oven comes with a dot because it doesn't have Madam A inside of the  oven, which is fine. That's another example of like the power of being able to do something  like this. You can just basically, you don't actually have to have the speaker or anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  in there. Right. You could get one, Stacey, are you getting one? I don't know. I don't have the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  counter space, but I really want to try it. So I'm probably going to try to get a review unit so I  can send it back. I believe Mr. Toffle was pretty excited about it. Does anyone else want to send me one to review?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who was excited about it? Wasn't Mr. Toffle excited about this last week when we talked about it?  I don't know. I wasn't on the show. But he was trying to explain the whole, with the camera inside of it, recognizing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  a chicken breast or something like that. And that's what's so cool about the June, but now you don't  need that because the smarts are built into the digital assistant platform. It doesn't matter if  your oven recognizes the food because you just told it what it's supposed to make. I mean, it's a subtle  difference, but it's a really important one if we think about the smart home going forward,  because then you could build an internet connection into a device and have it talk to its preferred  digital assistant. So my lamp could have an internet connection, but it doesn't need to have a microphone  and speaker. It's just controlled via my voice from the cloud. So you could either have that oven

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  or you could have a jimmy twerking bear and they would operate roughly the same except one cooks

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  things and one twerks. One does nothing useful. I'm so down on this bear. I hate this bear. There

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  was so much cool stuff and everyone's like, the bear. It's a bear that's twerking. It's cute,  right? Sorry, you guys, there was a whole new wireless protocol.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, all I know is we don't have- Priorities people.  A hands-on review of the wireless protocol, but we do have a hands-on review of the twerking bear,  which is pretty funny. Quid.tv slash HOT, episode 54. Look for that, Micah Sargent.  It's a great review. Reviewed jimmy. It's jimmy, right? Not jimmy. Okay, jimmy twerking bear.  Yes, it is a wonderful review. Whether you like it or not, you should watch it, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just saying. Oh, and everyone- Okay, I have to address this because it's happening in the chat  room and I love you guys, but the issue isn't the ability to control your oven with your voice.  It's that you can be an idiot and not know how to cook food and it will do it at the right- It's  got the pre-programmed recipes and ability to control the cooking settings. Well, see,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that was my argument last week with- It seems like for me, cooking is, unless you're baking a cake or  something, cooking is done a lot off of feel. You go to make a steak or what have you, you're  seasoning it up and you're grilling it or whatever. It's the feel when you know when that thing is

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  done. This eliminates you and you're not needed anymore. You're over. But if you don't have that  knowledge- It's going to happen without you now. Yeah. Oh, don't take that joy from me. If you don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  have that knowledge, this is a way to gain it without ruining- Totally. Right. You know,  if you buy a $50, what are those things called? I don't eat a lot of meat. It's filet mignon,  but big. Right. Rib eyes. No, it's that big hunk of meat. Tenderloin. Oh, tenderloin. Beef tenderloin.  Right. Super expensive, right? If you're cooking that thing, you are like, oh my God.  I will put that in my June oven and I don't even worry about it because it knows exactly- It's  got like nine cooking cycles for these things, right? And that level of pre-programmed knowledge  is the value here. It's not that I'm telling it to do something. Or there are probes? Probes  available with this? I don't know if the Amazon oven has a probe. I have to think it has to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It needs a feedback. Right. Because again, it's feel when it comes with meat, you know, because

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  one roast is going to cook a little bit faster than the other if it has a bone in it versus  how much fat content it may have in it. It's feel. Yeah. And here's my confession here. So I was

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  a Ponderosa Steakhouse kitchen manager. I never made it up to the grill because I never got that,  you feel it, you know it's meaty. That's right. It's this part of your hand. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly. See? Rare. Medium rare. That's not right. Oh my gosh. What were you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What I'm doing right now is just for TV. Don't follow. It's this part.  It does have a temperature point. It does. I know it feels kind of bony to me. So does it have a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  dialogue? Like cook the meat. Does it say what meat? Yes. Cooked potatoes. How many potatoes?  Cooked salmon. Is there any dialogue here so it has a little more data from you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you can't, I don't know. My June, if I put a piece of salmon in it, it asks me if I want it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  flaky or tender or something. It also has a camera to know how big the salmon is. It's got to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, but it's using the temperature probe. I thought it was using scale and things like that,  but it's really only using the probe. Okay. So the camera's, yeah. That makes it, I hate saying it,  idiot proof. I get that. And that's good though. I mean, I know that there's a whole bunch of-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff proof. Yeah. If you like to cook, you like to cook, but there are tons of people who-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Oh, when my wife went on bed rest-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Someone said the most popular search is how to boil water on one of their cooking sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm terrible. My wife went on bed rest when she was pregnant with our first and second,  and I practically killed her with near raw chicken. I have no idea what I'm doing. No idea.  Oh, bless it. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I need the Jeff proof oven. So maybe Jeff, you should be the guy reviewing this. Tell your wife  you're going to take over dinner and play with it. See what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, something like this, like it doesn't have to replace the person who really enjoys cooking  and can do it. Right. It's just another option. Yeah. If you enjoy cooking, I enjoy cooking. If  you enjoy cooking, like continue to do that. Yeah. And it's going to be the cooking Luddite. He's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  going to be slamming ovens to the ground. You will not replace me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  While I'm out trying to find a hickory tree and-  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was like, I like to cook, but it's so awesome. Like I'll just pop like some chicken breasts into  the June oven, stick that thing in there. And I mean, and it's done and I don't have to think,  I'll actually be cooking like our dinner while I do that for like to chop up on salads or whatever.  So I mean, I don't know if my daughter can cook and she's 13.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sometimes you feel like cooking, sometimes you don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. You're right. It depends on the night. If it's Thursday night football, no, I don't want

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  to cook. Yeah, exactly. Throw it in your automated oven and be happy that it's cooking for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want filet now before I kick off. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There we go. Sounds good to me. Let's see here. Before we get, should we do the change log now,  or are we missing anything before the change log?  Oh, hold on here. Hold on.  I know. Cause there's so many things in here. There's no way we're getting to it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, not at all. Hold on. Hold on. I think you did a good job, fella.  I think you hit the interesting stuff. Oh, I know one thing. Yes.  Yes.  So Kamala Harris sends at Jack a letter urging him to suspend Trump's account. What do we think

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  of this? No, no, let's not talk about this at all. Panic, panic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I took a breath. I don't know. What do you think about it, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I'm of two minds. I'm arguing with myself. The Stacey me says and the Jeff me says,  um, um, I think normally I'm Mr. Free Speech, but this is not a matter of free speech,  not a matter of first amendment. It's a private company. And I think at some point,  the private companies have to say enough. The Twitter came up with a policy that it's not  following. There were three policies announced in short order. Twitter is for newsmakers,  for important people, right? For politicians. Twitter's policy was we're going to leave it up  and we're going to put a sign on it and says this violates our policy, but because this is a  newsmaker, we're leaving it up so you can see Facebook and Facebook called me among, you know,  50 people and I don't work for Facebook. I did raise money for my school from Facebook,  but I don't work for Facebook, but they call people. They call this. What do you think we  should do? And I said they should do a Twitter's policy says, which is leave it up so we can see  what the, what the dastardly deed is, but say it's a dastardly deed and this doesn't meet your  standards. They're not doing that. I think it's a bad idea. YouTube is following the Facebook  model. They're going to not do anything. It's going to leave it up. So I think that the Twitter  model is the right model. Problem is Twitter's not following it. And, but I kind of get that.  You know, if you're, if you're Jack Dorsey sitting there and are you going to be the brave person  alone who's going to say, I'm going to start slapping around Trump in my own car. Yeah. Oh,  what a headache. Give me some warm chocolate cake. Right. And, and so I think that the Kamala Harris  long-winded answer you, sorry you asked me, but I asked myself in a way. The Kamala Harris letter  gives him cover to do something. And I think that we have to start doing that. I think we have to  start putting not just pressure on the platforms, but also cover for saying it's not good enough to  go laissez faire and leave it all up. You've got to take a stand at some point. If you start,  people start, start calling for civil war. That's going over the edge here folks. And you can't just  let this happen without comment from you. And so maybe Twitter comes and says, no, we're not going  to take it down, but we are going to start putting the warning up. And maybe that's a good thing.  And maybe it starts to have a better discussion about what kind of internet discussion we want to  have since you asked, since I asked. That's my answer. You guys? I'm with you. The only issue

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I had with it is the, the, the, what do you call it? Letterhead. Come on, I blank out on that word.  It comes off as it's a campaigning. When I see the letterhead, take that out and I'm totally fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which letterhead she, oh, she used her campaign letterhead. Well, if she had used her Senate  letterhead, would that have seemed to be trying to intimidate Twitter by using official position?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, because she is who she is. She is a Senator. You know? Yeah, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't she their Senator? Isn't she? She's California. Yeah. Yeah. So that's,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's not an intimidation. That way you're right. It's just a fact, you know,  but this looks more like, um, campaigning in my opinion. That's, that's what stopped me, but I,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  well, to my mind, so does Elizabeth Warren saying she wants to break up the platforms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's campaigning. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. When, when anyone's running for, for president or, or hoping  to, you know, make it into, into contention to, to be the next president, I just kind of assume  almost anything they're doing has that at least in mind, you know, that everything is through that  optic. Um, at the same time where it feels like in very unprecedented times right now, and  sometimes they, that calls for things that, you know, are outside of the norm. And I feel like,  so, so if Kamala Harris, sorry, is, is moved to do this right now, it's kind of a little of both,  right? Like, of course it's campaigning, but it also might be out of a point of necessity for,  for someone in her, uh, position to do that. So Stacy, you didn't want to answer the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You didn't want to talk about this, but I'm curious your response. No, I,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you know, I think Jack had, was it him? Someone had recently come out saying that politicians  are held to a different standard on Twitter, uh, newsmakers being held to a different standard.  And I actually think that's right. I think, I mean, part of me is utterly dismayed at the,  the lowering of presidential discourse or lowering of just any civil discourse. And by civil,  I don't mean being nice, but like civil around democracy and talking about our society. Um,  and in that, it, I mean, the president's tweets, obviously, I mean, they just, they make me sad. Um,  there is a lot of hate coming out and it feels sanctioned, but I don't see how you can take  someone like the president of the United States off of a platform like Twitter. Do you think,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  do you, do you think Twitter should label things that otherwise would not pass their standards?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, I think it, but there, that's always going to be politicized. They're always,  the right is always going to call that as a political step. So I understand intellectually,  I understand why I don't really know what you can't build. Like, I mean, the thought of it is,  oh, let's build an algorithm, but we all know that algorithms are just as biased as we are.  So the only, like, this is, this is kind of like arguing morality in some ways, right? Like,  we all have different versions of it and we know what's really wrong. And I could,  I feel that most people on Twitter can look at that and say, this is not how we would like to have  our president discuss things. But there is a small segment of people who are really thrilled by this.  And it emboldens them when you try to stop it. The bottom line is it makes me sad and I'm very  confused. I mean, it makes me sad, but I don't think it should be shut down. I guess that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  really what it is. I don't like it. It's polarizing on both sides, just like you said. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, yeah, it makes me sorry. I know this is Stacy's really insightful comment. It makes me sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is not whiskey. We'll get you some whiskey after the show.  All right. And why don't we then sound the horns? Yes.  The Google change log. That was the end one at the beginning. That's okay. We'll do the horns  at the end. When Leo's out of here, we do things opposite. It's opposite day today.  So I know that you don't care about dark mode, Jeff, but-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not a question of not caring. It's a question of hating it.  Okay. I know that.  It's a question of Niagara Falls, step by step.  Wow. No kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I despise.  Jeff has no mild opinions.  Jeff is all-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It creeps me out.  Oh, man.  Go ahead, Jason. Go ahead and talk about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to lead with it.  Greet me out, fella.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google messages and Google voice, both getting their dark mode theme. Yeah. They aren't listening  to you, Jeff. They're going forward with the dark mode because they kind of promised that they would.  So that's happening. Not a whole lot more than-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I give dark mode on Gmail, by the way. And it turns Gmail, but the actual emails,  when you open them, are still light. So it's absolutely-  Oh, man. It's still buggy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a little broken. Gmail knows best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Gmail and Jeff are in cahoots.  You'd have higher comprehension of your email. Otherwise, you wouldn't really be able to read it.  You'd be reading it slower.  Oh, it's protecting you.  Gmail knows best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's safe. It's saving you.  Google announced a number of privacy and security-related features rolling out soon.  Just real quick here, Maps is finally getting its incognito mode update, which we've heard about.  You would just tap profile photo, turn on incognito mode, and then you're searching,  you're navigating. All that stuff would be incognito. So it would not be saved to your  Google account or guide any personalization in the app. Android's going to get it this month.  iOS will be getting it soon.  Also, YouTube is getting auto-delete history functionality. This happened a few months ago,  I think, back in May for deleting a location, a web activity. Now YouTube's getting it. You'll  have the option of auto-deleting your YouTube activity after three months or 18 months,  or you can choose to just delete it on your own or keep it forever, whatever. It's up to you.  Soon coming to Assistant, you can delete Assistant activities simply by saying,  hey, G, delete everything I said last week or something along those lines.  I wish I could do that for life.  That's awesome.  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I was like, Amazon said you can do that now for Madam A, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  That's awesome. So that is apparently going to hit Assistant devices next week.  And then also, one other thing here, password checkup is coming to Chrome later this year.  It's going to check to see if a user's password has been leaked or compromised  in known data breaches. You'll be able to find that within Chrome, I think, at the  passwords.google.com site, and Chrome will warn you to change your password when it finds that  your ID and your password have been found in any of those databases for previously known data  breaches. Google Play will now have new settings for bulk adjustments. So if you go to Settings,  General, Google Play Preferences, and I don't know if this is there yet, but it's coming,  you'll have the ability to in bulk clear wish lists, leave from all of the betas.  You just want to be done with all betas. You could do that in one swoop instead of having  to remember and go in and do it individually. Unregister for upcoming events and unregister  for app and game preregistrations. So that's a couple of options there. YouTube Music is now  going to replace Google Play Music as the default music player on Android 10.  No one's thrilled about that one. I'm not thrilled about that one.  This would only be for a new device or a factory reset, that sort of thing.  Play Music still exists? Play Music still exists, yes.  It's not going anywhere yet. Google has said that it won't go anywhere until  something along the lines of YouTube Music has feature parity for the most part,  all the main features, and we are nowhere near that. Yet Google is still kind of  on this trajectory of making YouTube Music replace it. I feel like it's a little premature  because I'm just not a big fan, but there you go. Google has its reasons.  Google Duo for Android is getting an update that now includes effects and filters for video  messages. So you can have things like animated backgrounds, things like glasses to wear to that  track along with your face. At this point, this feels like old news, but Duo is getting it now.  Some more traditional color filters, that sort of stuff coming to Duo for messages.  This is actually really neat. Action Blocks, which was just announced today,  it's a new accessibility tool for creating multi-step tasks using Assistant. It's actually  designed for people with cognitive disabilities. You can do something like add a title, assign an  Assistant task, so spell out what the Assistant task will do. You can pick an image to be  associated with it, and then that's placed as a shortcut on your home screen so that when someone  is using their device and they look at the home screen and they see the picture, the example that  they have is of a man reading a story to a little girl, then that would fire off an Assistant command  to read a story, and it would jump into it. It would be an easier way for them to just,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  one with one tap. It's great seeing an effort like this being put in there. We were just looking in  the Twit community, the Twit backstage, twit.community website there. Someone was just  bringing that up saying, hey, we need more recognition and acknowledgement for people with  disabilities and accessibility concerns when it comes to using today's technology,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  other than voice activation. There's a lot going on in Android when it comes to accessibility  right now. I feel like Android for the longest time was behind, and now especially the live  captions. That's such a huge step forward. Competition is a wonderful thing.  Absolutely. That's just amazing that that's coming out now. Then finally, yet another service to add  to Google's list of killed services. Bulletin, if you remember, was a hyper local news service,  similar in ways to Nextdoor. It launched in 2018, and it's shuddering in two weeks' time.  Shared posts, if you've shared any there. We hardly knew E.  Yeah, really. In fact, we forgot E. Completely forgot E.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It wasn't really available. It was only available in a few places. They didn't promote it. Nobody  to put anything up there. It's the same problem in my biz of user generated news. Why should I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why am I getting out of this? Quite honestly, this is the first time I've heard of Google Bulletin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I vaguely remember hearing about it, and then it was just kind of gone and forgotten.  Obviously so, because a year later, it's being shuttered. If you happen to share anything on  there, you have until November 22nd to pull it off, and then it's gone forever. That is the Google  change log. In reverse. Nicely done, sir. Nicely done. Well done. All right. Cool. We make this  show our own when Leo is traveling the world. He's going to stop leaving you in charge. We

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  actually talked about Google. We did that first. Although Jeff and I still have a show in the  fight. So I'm like team Helvetica versus team. I don't know which Serif you were going to go for,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  but I'm assuming it's Times New Roman. Caslon. Well, actually there's a story about Caslon.  Oh, no. When I started, Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. When Uncle Jeff starts a story, you say,  Oh, goody. It's story time. So when I started entertainment weekly, the design was frankly,  I will admit it today, ugly at first. And there were other business reasons why we were getting  cancellations because it wasn't my fault. But they were blaming the design because it was the first  major magazine produced all Macintosh, entirely Macintosh, entirely Quark. And they came and they  said, it's that font. It's that unreadable font. You pick this computer font. It's a postmodern  font. It was Caslon. Caslon has been around for centuries. And indeed in the lobby of time,  time, Inc. They had a huge typographic sculpture of a whole font strain was like a story tall.  It was Caslon is exact same font, but it was that postmodern computer font you use Jarvis.  So I have a certain soft spot spot in my heart. It was the font used for the U.S. declaration of  independence. Caslon. Wow. Caslon. All right. With reverence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I saw something like a month ago. It's probably a meme of some sort. It was like,  it was making fun of the fact that like Avatar with all the millions upon millions of dollars,  you know, budget and everything still opted for Papyrus as its font set for its logo.  It's like, yep, you know, they just decided we could do anything with all of our money,  but Papyrus is the right font to choose for the logo of this multimillion dollar movie.  That's my font story. That's the only font story I have right now. Sorry,  that I had to contribute. Let's do numbers and tips and tricks. I already did my tool. So  if you don't remember, it's the recorder app and find it on the APK mirror. Jeff, what is your

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  number? What other number could it be today has to be on this show of all shows? Google can drink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google is 21 years old. Oh, who's okay. So who's going to take Google out and get Google drunk?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think Google should take us all out. Yeah, that's true.  Google can foot the bill. I'll go just put it on there, Don. Google could afford to buy the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  world a drink. Really? Happy birthday, Google. Happy birthday, Google. No, not. I told you it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  would happen. All he wants to do is come to the party. Come on, Jason. Obviously Google is

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  listening. It's like, I'm here for the drink. Did you say drinks? Wait, wait, wait, wait. I think  we should have a little song. I think we should all sing it. Oh, ready? One, two, three. Happy

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  birthday, dear Google. Happy birthday, dear Google. Happy birthday, dear Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was really, really awesome. We will not be winning any Oscars or Emmys or anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look what you've done, Jeff. Look what you've done. Did the viewership just drop off?  Pretty sure. Yeah, I think the chat room is empty now. Ran out of the room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If Leo wasn't convinced before never to leave again. Now he definitely has. I have a cool tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, what's your tool? Okay, this is super nerdy, but I love it. And it's been around for a  while and I had no idea. It's called PlantNet and it's this community project to identify. You take  a picture of your plant, any plant on the phone, and it identifies it for you. Oh, that is awesome.  That is cool. And it's free. And when you log in, you don't have to log in. So you could do all this  and be totally selfish and not contribute back to the community, but it'll identify plants even if  you don't log in. I've done that with Google Assistant. Oh, yeah. So this is a little bit,  it's better than Google Assistant. Oh, yeah, it says you.  I've tried to identify plants with Google Assistant. But yeah, so it's using image  recognition. It takes your images and you can add your location and you say, hey, this is it. Anyway,  so far I have tried all kinds of crazy plants and it works really well. And I love it as a person  who's like kind of nerdy and stupid. I'm really excited about this. So that's my pick of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's see here. So what's a plant I can do a search for here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, do a chocolate vine because I have one near my house and it's growing. Chocolate vine. Chocolate

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  vine. Okay, let's see if see if I can get this to work here.  Hold on. I'm just trying to get the image in a new tab. See if this will work. It might not work.  I don't know if you've got the overhead. Oh, nice. I see what you're doing here. Certainly try this.  I see you. Okay, so there's a chocolate vine. There's the app. I'll go camera. Yes, allow.  Allow. Okay. You and all your security. Okay, so then I take the shot. It might not be framed  perfectly for the let's see. I'll be surprised that this works. It's all pixelated and everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Choose related organ. So that's a flower. Like a flower. Like what part of the tree or what part  of the plant are you looking at? Okay. That sounded very bad. Yeah. Chocolate vine. We got it. Yeah.  Got it. Outstanding. Boom. That vine is chocolate. I have one of those and they make these weird,  crazy looking fruits. And I was like, what the heck are these giant weird fruit things?  And now I know. Nice. That is really cool. I don't know you guys. That is really cool. I'm super nerdy

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  about this. I love it. And I'm happy that it worked. It's always nice when a demonstration works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, especially that particular demonstrate. I was like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  who knows? Who knows ratcheted up the level of difficulty there and it worked, but it worked.  That's what I like. All right. And what you got? Mine is a little bit different. As I said  previously in the show, I like airplanes. I'm an AV nerd and just love watching airplanes. And  there's a website I go to that's called airline pilot guy.com, but they also happen to do a  podcast. Now, when you go and look up news from airlines and so forth, nine times out of 10,  it's sad. These guys, they give you what they say, a view from the pilot's perspective. Yes,  they share news. That is some sad news, but there's also some other things out there that's really  nerdy and technical. And they are actually big fans of the twit network too, I found out.  Captain Jeff, he's the main airline pilot. He told me himself he was inspired by our Mr. Leo  Laporte to start his podcast and start the website, even down to using these particular microphones.  Very nice. But I love the podcast, like I said, because it's real nerdy. What kind of things do  you learn? Yeah. And it's not always just the bad news because Bowen is screwing up and having all  of their issues with the 737 MAX and so forth. But there's other things out there. There's always  some good stories. Did you see it today? Oh, no, I didn't see it today. No. New 737 there. And within

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  a week, they've got to inspect all kinds of 737s for fatigue in the wings. Oh, man. See,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like getting more uplifting stuff on my podcast. Sorry.  I don't like all the sad news, but these guys are funny. Now, I know we have long podcasts on here,  but their shows are usually about three hours long. But it's about three hours long. But it's  funny. And I really do enjoy listening to those guys. Captain Jeff. It makes us seem

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  positively brief. Yeah. I know. We've had three hour shows on this network. Oh, really?  It's happened for sure. And folks in the chat room are saying that some of them  have actually been relatively frequent guests on the Tech Guy. That's awesome. That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But yeah, it's Captain Jeff. There's Captain Dana. There's also retired Captain Nick and Dr. Steph.  They're all just varying ranges of aviation certification and so forth. So you get different  point of view and a lot of different fun stories. And they have a good time with bourbon and beer.  Nice. Not while flying. Not while flying though.  Not while flying. But that's my favorite. I want us all to be captains. I like that.  But that's my pick. It's just something that's a little more happy and uplifting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Right on. Nice. Good pick. Good pick, Captain Ant.  Thank you, Captain Howell. Thank you. We are all captains here,  including you, Captain Stacy and Captain Jeff. And Captain Listeners as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We might be an insult to captains everywhere. That's true. I might be really insulting captains

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and our co-pilot is Karsten. Karsten, the first mate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Today it's actually John. It is John. Oh, it is John. Yes. Karsten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No wonder I haven't gotten insulted or attacked today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Karsten is with the team getting ready for the last pass event. Oh, Boston.  Ah, okay. It happens tomorrow. But that is it. We've reached the end. Captain Jeff,  what do you want to leave people with? Where should people...  Oh, just plain old... Buzzmachine.com?  Look me up at Medium. Yeah, that's fine. Medium, at Jeff Jarvis. Don't do a search for  Captain Jeff. You probably won't find him. You might find a Captain Jeff, but you won't  find Jeff Jarvis. Also Captain Stacy Higginbotham, Stacy on iot.com. Thank you, Stacy. Always fun  doing a show with you. Thank you. At Giga Stacy on Twitter. And then Captain Ant Pruitt.  I am. Sitting at the table.  Yes. Anything you want to promote or... Do you have a Hands on Tech episode?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to promote first and foremost Hands on Tech with what Micah did with that bear.  That was pretty... It was pretty daggum funny. Pretty well done. I also have my Opspot tail  review out there where you get to meet my dog Kylo Finn. But actually go back and check out  Triangulation from last week. That is twit.tv slash TRI episode 416 where I sat down with my  friend Todd Moore who is the developer for the popular app White Noise. I watched how that app  just changed his life. It was pretty fascinating. Now did you know him before the app? I knew him  right as he was getting into it. Met him several years ago and yeah, it's pretty crazy. I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  that's a huge app. I mean, I use that app every time I travel. When I travel, that's the app that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I use. It was a fun conversation. I don't want to share too much here. Go over there and check it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  out. It's worth a listen. Right on. That's twit.tv slash TRI. Yes. Episode 416 with Todd Moore. And  that was your first Triangulation. That was my first. Fantastic job. And I survived. You did.  See? See? He knew he'd do great. All right. And then yeah, as for me, I'm just here doing  shows on the twit network tomorrow actually. Tech News Weekly. Ant is going to be sitting with me.  Did I not tell you? We'll talk about it.  Micah will not be here tomorrow. So Ant will be on set with me. Oh boy.  Oh boy. Designated hitter. Yes. Yeah. Apparently I didn't do a good job prepping him for this show.  You're going to be great. We'll talk. But that's twit.tv slash TNW. If you want to go there,  you can find all sorts of interviews and episodes. Last week we had Stacey on to talk about the Amazon  stuff. So yeah, it's a fun show. Definitely check it out this week.
