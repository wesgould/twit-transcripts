Joining us from Google's, I'm sorry, Facebook's F8  Developers Conference. Jeff Jarvis, he's in the lobby right now. Sounds like he's  coming to us via Gemini 8, somebody in the chat room said, but that's good enough.  We'll take it. Thank you. Thank you. For being here. He's stepped away from the  media stage. You were presenting a moments ago, so. Yeah, but the news integrity

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  initiative we talked about last week. Ah. So that's over. But there's a lot of interest in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I hope so, yeah. Facebook's a partner in that, of course. Yes. Also with us, of  course, Stacey Higginbotham. Stacey on IOT.com and IOTpodcast.com from Austin, Texas.  Which is where Jeff's going to be tomorrow, I guess. So you're going to invite  Jeff over and have a barbecue. Breakfast tacos. Oh, yum. That sounds good. And from  fortune.com, Matthew Ingram is also here from the northern regions of Canada. And  we're all here to talk about, of course, many, many things. But let's first get a  report from F8. We covered the keynote yesterday and a lot of attention paid to  a couple of things. Mark Zuckerberg and company announced a new platform in the  Facebook app for augmented reality using the camera. A platform in the sense that  developers will have a way to access the camera and information and add filters  and things to it. Some people said it was, you know, really a catch-up to  Snapchat's filters and world filters, which Snapchat announced the day before.  They also announced the VR spaces, which is a beta version of an Oculus Rift  program that allows you to finally be in the same space as somebody else wearing  Oculus Rift and interact with them. So what do you think, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I think Farhad Manjoo in the Times this morning had the best piece that I've read  and probably the best thing I think he's ever written about Facebook today.  And he starts off, and they're probably not going to like it very much, he starts off  saying, yeah, okay, so Mark's a thief. So they took this stuff from Snapchat.  They took other stuff from other places. They bought other companies. But then by  the end he says, and so what? Steve Jobs stole, Bill Gates stole. This is where it  is. The power of Facebook is the network. And I think he was really right.  Chris Cox showed a good slide yesterday in the keynotes where he showed one axis was  how they go from one-on-one relationships to your community up through your geography  to government to media to government. And on the other axis was all the tools they  have from text to photos all the way to AR, VR. What really struck me is they  missed a third axis. And the third axis is what Facebook really is, which is that  it connects people to people. And that's what Farhot is really talking about.  That's the power of Facebook. That's the, that allows them to do anything they  want. So yeah, they took, they took features from Snapchat. Tough.  It's a competitive world. And maybe they weren't the most innovative in the world.  Maybe they're following, but they have the network that is phenomenal.  And so, yes, they have the power to bring Rainbow Puke to the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. Well, you know, it reminds me of, Matthew, is Microsoft in its heyday in the  90s. They embraced and embraced and extended. Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. That's exactly what I thought of too. And, you know, to be fair, I think they,  they did copy stories, right? They copied it whole. It's bolus.  They've copied lots of other things. But what they are talking about with augmented  reality, they didn't just develop that stuff a week ago because they saw that Snapchat  was working on it. This is, these are things that Facebook and just about everyone,  I think, has been thinking about for quite some time. So it does look as though, you  know, they're duplicating things that Snapchat is doing.  I think they both seem to be moving along the same track, which is to use the camera  as the easiest sort of interface to a virtual world. That just makes sense.  They've also, their vision, I think, goes significantly farther than Snapchat's has,  or at least has so far. So are they duplicating each other? Yes.  But I don't think it's just Facebook is out of ideas. And so they're copying whatever

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Snapchat does. Farhad Manju quotes Miranda Carr,  Evan Spiegel's fiance, in an interview with the Times of London, she said she couldn't stand  Facebook's behavior. Can they not innovate? Do they have to steal all of my partner's ideas?  She asked. When you directly copy someone, that's not innovation. To which I say, writes Farhad,  Meh, there are lots of different kinds of innovation in the tech industry.  Coming up with something first is not the only kind.  One of the reasons Microsoft got dinged for this, or is it dunged for this?  Dunged is because it looked like they were being a bully. They used their market share to  approach companies, say, we'd like to see more of that, and then steal it.  Or they'd buy companies that were competitive and engulf them.  And to some degree, Facebook's done this. But I don't think Facebook's being a bully here.  I think you're right, Jeff, that they had to have been working on this all along. It wasn't like,  oh, we like this WorldViews, can we do that tomorrow?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The innovation they showed today in the keynote, where they talked about  direct connections to your brain and AR glasses in our lifetime that are comfortable and really  work, and other things that show that they are truly innovating in gigantic ways. Snapchat,  bless their soul, came up with a mechanism that young people like to communicate with each other.  They did a brilliant job of it. But in a competitive world, you see the best ideas and you use them.  How innovative is Facebook? We'll see over the next 20 years. It's only just had its bar mitzvah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You mentioned that today's speech, that the CTO of Facebook was there and did a good job of  mapping out the future. But there also was towards the end, and this is a little bit of flying car  stuff, right? But we have a clip of, I'm not sure who it is, but I'm sure she'll be identified in  the clip, talking about typing with your mind and listening with your skin. Let's take a look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the head of building eight, who's the wowie lad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Regina Dunn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Regina Dunn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She cannot move or speak, but she is typing with her mind, not with eye blanks, with her mind.  An array of electrodes, the size of a pea has been implanted where her brain would normally control  her motor functions. The electrodes record her neurons firing when she imagines moving the cursor.  Then the computer learns to move it for her. Using this system, she can type eight words per minute.  Eight words per minute. She is typing at eight words per minute directly with her brain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That is pretty impressive. This is Regina Dugan. She also talked a little bit about  listening with your skin. This is not, by the way, she was at the ATAP group at Google  and the director of DARPA. She only joined Facebook recently, right? I think fairly recently,  maybe a year ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did mention that I'm not sure people typing with their mind exactly what they're thinking  on Facebook is going to be a great development for humanity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a little too close to that already.  Yeah.  Nothing in the, no inhibition whatsoever. You, Jeff, were talking today about the Tau  initiative that you're doing along with Craig, Newmark, and Facebook, and a few other partners  to improve integrity in the news. What was the reaction to your talk today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know because I ran out of the room to come here so it looks like I'm suspiciously  escaping.  He's dressed in black and he ran out.  Yeah. I hope they knew that I was not escaping the wrath of the media. No, there were shakes  of head and other things. And Facebook, to its credit, is trying to be more open about its  roadmap with publishers. The session I was just in is off the record, so I can't say anything.  One thing that I know that we publishers have been asking for, they just said they're going to do.  They're listening to publishers more. There's a long way to go still, but I think we see progress.  I remember, and give Google credit too for starting this path and setting the way. I think both  platforms are trying very hard to make friends in media and, you know, proofs in the pudding  we'll see, but it's also up to us to collaborate with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, I mean, some of the, so we have a broad mix of stuff from today's keynote. You said today,  unfortunately we chose to cover the first day keynote. Maybe not unfortunately,  because that was the announcement of some big new Facebook technologies that you can use right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love Facebook's forward-looking stuff. They really do a good job investing,  much like Google. Remember back in the day, we were like, Google's infrastructure is really

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  its competitive advantage. I know. Google Island. They all want to move to Google Island.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but let's face it, Facebook has a lot of failures under its belt too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Far more failures than successes. Yeah, I think they deserve credit for that. They try stuff.  For a big company. Yeah, they try and fail at stuff all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. And they invest so much money in the hardware infrastructure to get it right and to  think about not just their platform and the software side, they invest in the infrastructure  and they're going even further down with their broadband efforts. And not all of that's going to  work, but the way they look at the world, they see that we're moving to this massively distributed  computing architecture or infrastructure. And they're like, okay, how can we make it  even extended further and make it more resilient? And if you look at it in cheaper, I should say,  in cheaper, those are kind of the three things. So Facebook handed out 4,360 degree cameras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did you get yours, Jeff? Actually, I'm not sure. There's a bag that gave me a thing yesterday

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that was back in the hotel. I looked at your bag. It's the geroptic. There's one of two kind of very

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  popular 360 degree cameras. This one attaches to your phone. It came out in December, $250,  1920 by 960. Anyway, get ready for an onslaught of 360. They also showed a new 24 camera and a six

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  camera rigs for VR for 360, where the 24 camera is high overlap of pixels, which enables them to  basically, they did a lot of work on this with AI and even even 2D photos of being able to navigate  around the photo and understand that. They showed a lot of AI stuff, understanding people and their

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  actions in a room. Pretty impressive. So it's, this today was obviously a little more VR than  yesterday. Yesterday really was about AR and it almost felt like somewhat of a pivot. Of course,  they acquired three years ago, they acquired Oculus Rift, nominally a VR company, but as many  have pointed out, VR is just a subset of a total of what AR can do. And they really talked a lot  about AR yesterday in more than just Snapchat style filters, although I imagine the first things

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  we'll see will be mostly that. And I think, I actually think if Facebook got anything from  Snapchat, it was my sense is, I don't have any inside information on this, but my sense is that  what they got was in the short term, and particularly for augmented reality, we should  just stick to the camera. Like everybody's got one. It's relatively easy to do. So instead of  leaping forward to headsets and eyeglasses and so on, even Zuckerberg said, you know, we decided  some interesting stuff is happening with the camera. It's right here in your hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's see what we can do with that. He even said the camera box is more important than the text  box and input. And that's clearly another Snapchat view, but you're right. The camera is the  mechanism to augment the world. Well, it's something in everybody's hand right now. I suspect this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Apple's plan to this fall with the next iPhone. So this is, I mean, it's clearly kind of entry  level tech, just as Oculus Rift, frankly, is entry level VR tech, but everybody has it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I don't plan to be puking rainbows soon or putting headsets on. Stacey, what do you think  your daughter is going to think of this AR stuff on Facebook? Is it old hat? Is it new?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, so my daughter, my daughter won't be on Facebook is my guess. It'll be like her equivalent  of LinkedIn or something. I don't know for old. You know, I thought that too. We had a bunch of

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  high school kids from Perth, Australia in yesterday and Megan thought as I did, probably most of them  are using Snapchat. Maybe they're using Instagram, but they're unlikely to be using their parents'  social network. Every one of them is on Facebook. And this is, I think to Farhad Manju's point,  which is the size and scope of the Facebook network is such that even if you don't like  embrace it because your parents are there also, you can't not be on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Our teenage daughter quit, deleted her account. She was, I think, 17. And within a matter of months,  she had started her account again. Yeah, everybody hates Facebook. Yeah, she said she didn't want to  be there, but she felt like she had to be. So it's like email is for us. You have to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. So I suspect, and I don't, you know, this is the very interesting question. You're supposing  Stacey that in 10 years, while your daughter's what, seven? So in six years, she's 10. 10. Oh,  well, sooner than you think. There'll be something else just as Facebook replaced MySpace. But I  think you do get to a point with the network effect where when you have two, nearly 2 billion  monthly active users, it's pretty hard for somebody else to come along and steal them away, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think what'll happen is we'll graduate beyond these fake social networks that are like Facebook.  So what'll happen isn't that there'll be another Facebook. There's gonna be just something  that's a better evolution. And maybe it's like, and I think Facebook's right to focus on the camera,  if only because there are plenty of times when, think about how voice evolved. You started out  just asking for, I remember trying speech to text kind of commands back in like 2008. And they were  clunky and lame and you just say something and it would happen. I think you're gonna get to these  points where, yeah, you see something and you're like, if you hold your camera up in front of it,  you're gonna be like, oh, look, there's something there and it's more information. And then it'll  gradually envelop more and more things. And then it'll become instinctive to, at some point, to  look up and be like, oh, hey, look, info, cool. And that's when we're gonna see the glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think if that, if they shipped those today, wouldn't they sell  like hotcakes already? I wouldn't buy some glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, wouldn't. I would.  Yeah. A lot of, so people outside the tech world,  like, I mean, think about Snapchat's glasses and it sounds really cool and you and I,  and we would all buy them and be like, nifty, but real people have limited income and they  may not want to spend it on what feels like a gimmicky device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What if when you're buying sunglasses, which you're going to wear anyway,  it happens to have that capability that you can see Yelp reviews or other kinds of information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought that's gonna be, that's gonna be a few years down the road, but yes,  that's exactly how it's gonna play out. I think that's what people want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, Mark Zuckerberg mentioned one of my use cases, which is you're in Italy,  you know, you've read about the Coliseum, but you know zero about it. And you look at it and  information pops up about it. That would be hugely useful. Do you need to buy it? Maybe not. Maybe

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  rent it, but it's still be hugely useful. Well, the argument today from, go ahead, Stacy. Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was gonna say that gets to this idea of innovation. Who's copying whom? Because  this is not a new concept and the key is figuring out the right time to launch something and the  right form factor that people, right. That will get people to adopt it.  Right. And Facebook has a lot of those advantages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. And I think there is one argument.  No, go ahead, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, go ahead.  No, Jeff, you're our guest of honor because you're leaving soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, no. I apologize and I apologize to everybody for being worse than usual  interruptions because I can't, there's latency. So I'm trying to call a picture of the things  that are needed for AR glasses to really work. And let me call it this picture because it was  a really interesting line. Well, I said one thing is that today the pixel density that we can get  is 15 pixels per degree. In the near future it'll be 120. Field of view is about 90 degrees.  Future it'll go to 220 to 330. The depth of focus is fixed at two meters in the future.  It'll be variable from 25 centimeters to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Uh oh, we're losing.  Oops.  We lost the signal. That's all right. We'll continue on and we'll get them back. Yeah,  it's clear that you need better batteries because obviously this is going to have to be detached.  You need high speed connectivity everywhere. One of the things that bothered me a little bit  in Mark's presentation yesterday is the notion that you could leave little messages and notes  around as you're going around, which is going to really open... I mean, if we think we have  problems with trolling with Twitter right now, at least it's constrained to Twitter, imagine...  You're want... I mean, it's going to be like digital graffiti everywhere.  Right.  We have to solve that issue.  And yeah.  I'm not sure that that's a great thing is to be able to graffiti the world in augmented reality,  no matter...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and actually Matt Honan, I think it was, was writing about how Facebook  paints these beautiful pictures about, oh, you could leave public art in public spaces.  You could also paint a swastika on a famous painting. I mean, this is going to happen.  Right. That's one of the lessons...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's face it. There'll be penises everywhere.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. That's one of the lessons, I think, of the Facebook killing, if you want to call it that,  is Facebook continually sort of releases these gee whiz technologies and then has to catch up,  oh my God, human beings are doing horrible things with our service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, this is the kind of the blind spot all technologists, and I am one of them, have,  is we get excited. We look at the potential for these new technologies and then we forget that  there are many bad humans that will inevitably find a way to twist this and make it unusable.  And so maybe augmented reality is only great in our dreams. I mean,  I guess we now have to be worried about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you have to think about, you have to be prepared not to get depressed and think,  well, we shouldn't do this because people might do bad things, but you have to think it through,  at least consider what could be some of the bad things and what could you do to prevent that.  And I wonder if maybe Facebook doesn't do that second part as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, maybe. I mean, it feels like I know we want this maximum internet freedom to do what we want  and leave our messages. But what's more likely is that, especially initially, we'll have,  maybe it's software platforms or packages that you buy.  So if you're going to Italy, maybe you buy the Lonely Planet's Italy AR software.  Yeah, there you go. Yeah.  I'm not so stressed about that because I don't see something like leaving messages for people  actually getting implemented anytime soon. Maybe I'm crazy and stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Remember, that's what Facebook offers though. I mean, that's what Facebook does. So naturally,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that's what they're going to show. You know what that reminded me of was  Microsoft Bob. Do you remember? You could actually leave little virtual notes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, post-its on people's documents.  See, that was the reality. Opportunity missed.  I think it's really interesting. The timing of this is poor from Facebook's point of view,  but this Facebook murderer brings home exactly this issue, which is you can create live video,  you can create postable video, but when you have that many users, it's very difficult to create  the safeguards that prevent it from being appalling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And if you go back, you look at what Mark Zuckerberg said when Facebook Live launched.  Someone had a quote. He said, this allows you to be unfiltered and to create experiences that  are raw and visceral. Well, that sure is true. That sure is what people are doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I wonder if he feels like he's learned his lesson or if he's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. I doubt it. I still think he's fundamentally optimistic about these technologies  and that's good. I just don't know. How do you stop someone from uploading those types of videos?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Jeff, are people talking about that Facebook murderer at all there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, Mark... Yeah, they are. The interesting thing is that I think there's a big difference  in expectation. I think that frankly, some people thought that they actually did a good job getting  that video down in moderately short order. About half an hour, right?  Other people thought, of course... Yeah. Some people said that was good.  It wasn't reported for an hour. Oh, okay.  I heard people say that maybe all video should go to a small group, but then the chances of  someone reporting something bad are far lessened. I think those who criticize Facebook on this...  Yes, Justice Ofsky wrote a very good post that went through the TikTok. It was exactly what  happened when. I think they're honest about saying they need to get better and that's fine.  But the extension of the complaints is nobody should have live because one horrible person  came along and did this. I think we wouldn't agree with that. So we live in an imperfect world and  the features that reflect this world will be imperfect along with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry, go ahead, Stacey. Correct me if I'm wrong, but there have been one or two cases of people  attacking news anchors while they were doing live reports.  Yes. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not just that. YouTube has had this kind of stuff for how long now?  That's true. It's not just Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's true. But the difference is Facebook live, although YouTube now has YouTube live.  But this wasn't even live.  Right. No, it wasn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was reported at first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. He did go on live later talking about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The thing I thought was interesting was that video of the killing was up for an hour before  anybody reported it according to Facebook's timeline.  Isn't that strange?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And the issue there is the public. Who does he know? What are our norms? How does this operate?  Facebook, I think as soon as they're alerted, will act to alert them.  What I don't see the data on is how many people saw it.  More than the time is what was the actual exposure of the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So the first video went up at 11.09 a.m. with the intent to murder, not reported to Facebook.  Second video of the shooting went up at 11.11, two minutes later.  11.22, the live stream where he confesses to the murder.  11.27, the live stream ends and the live video is first reported shortly after.  So it wasn't a half an hour. It's 16 minutes after the shooting video.  The first reporting of the shooting video was more than an hour later. It was at 1 p.m.  It was posted at 11.11. It wasn't reported until 1 p.m.  And it took them after it was reported 23 minutes for Facebook to disable the account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which is pretty good. Is that a pretty good or is that wrong?  I don't know. It seems a long time. I think that's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I guess. Well, they get a lot of review, I assume.  Yeah, but how long does it take to review it? I guess there's a queue of things they have to review.  We now know it's a 23-minute queue, I presume, because as soon as you reviewed it, you'd take it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, could they do better? Obviously. And I think there's a big debate. Certainly, journalists  would like there to be a group of editors who view everything and then say what should go up  and what shouldn't. But the fact is Facebook is never going to do that in a million years.  That's ridiculous. That's not scalable. Human beings don't scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And AI is never going to really be good at this because, you know, it's just...  So it goes for 23 minutes and 15 minutes. How is it going to tell whether it's a joke?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's the real difference? This is the world we live in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A lot of people saw it tweeted. I mean, I know people who had Twitter autoplay video turned on  and were horrified because it was tweeted. It was on YouTube as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But who would do that? And it actually took YouTube

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  longer to take it down than it did Facebook. Who would do that? This is the point really is

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  problem. People. It's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's been demand on the internet and availability on the internet of,  I guess, snuff films or things. Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But this is what happened. We knew this would happen with the internet. Everything that was  hidden under a rock in the hard to get to places is now easily available. And that's the good,  the bad and the ugly. And that's just... Right. And we know that every feature like

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Facebook Live is going to enable some incredibly wonderful things. And it's also going to enable  some horrible offensive disgusting things. Because it's a tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because that's what the internet does. It's a tool. It doesn't have any particular...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So here's the other thing today. I was really surprised. I imagine there are German lawmakers  writing laws right now because Facebook went over the line that Google has tickled and not  gone over. In today's keynote, they showed AR glasses and they said, and really put up a picture,  you see a face and it puts the name next to it. So I use face recognition.  Uh-oh. No, no, no.  Boots? No.  Well, everybody next to me, every old person next to me said, yeah, I can't wait. I can't remember  names. Yeah, me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no. I can't remember names. Google deliberately didn't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't want people to be able to have computer aided access to who I am. Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In their defense, Facebook does have your social graph. And so it would be trivial for Facebook to  say you will only identify people you already know. Two friends, right?  Right. That's true.  If you could ask them that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because Google had the tech to do that, what, two years ago?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. And they explicitly said, we're not going to turn it on.  I mean, sad to say the FBI also has that tech and whether you turn it on.  They sure do.  Yeah. So also today they showed Aquila. In fact, they showed a couple of ways to get internet to  people who don't have it. They showed helicopter emergency internet access. And apparently,  Aquila, I'm sorry, not Aquila. Aquila.  That's a way better name.  Yeah. I think Aquila would be great. The drone has really using a millimeter wave technology  has really improved the bandwidth. They now are 80 gigabits per second.  Wow.  And it's also been able to establish a 16 gigabit link between a ground station  and a small plane circling five miles away. Watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A few hundred kilometers of in the atmosphere and try to connect that way. So fiber connects  to a microwave dish, a millimeter wave dish provides connectivity to the first plane.  And then other millimeter wave systems or lasers can interconnect and form a network in the sky.  So it's a cool idea.  Sky net.  But parts of it we've actually started to do. So this is our Aquila system. This is a flight from  last year. And to me, this was one of the most incredible moments in my life where I got to see  an aircraft, roughly the wingspan of a Boeing 737, the mass one third of a Toyota Prius running on  the power of three blow dryers flying in the air. But this is not a communications network yet.  It needs connectivity. It needs a millimeter wave system. And so we've scoured the earth and tried  to find is there a technology that can go in this aircraft today? And there wasn't. So we had to  make a system that was 10 times faster and roughly 10 to 100 times less in terms of mass and power.  So I'm really excited that last year we announced that we achieved over a 13 kilometer link,  a 20 gigabits per second millimeter wave link. It was a pretty awesome achievement by our team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay. That's not as impressive as it sounds.  That's old stuff. This is the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay.  Wait for it.  And I'm really pleased to announce that using that same link, the team almost doubled that rate  and achieved 36 gigabits per second over that link. So we beat our own world record.  Is it half duplex? Is that why it's not impressive?  So it's not impressive.  We then flew it in a Cessna on the path to getting it into an Aquila. And we achieved 16  gigabits per second in that system. And then I mentioned optical links that may exist between  aircraft. And we actually have built an optical link also on the same 13 kilometer path. And we  achieved 80 gigabits per second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right. Pause this for a second. So why should we be less than joy over joy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's great. But the technology they're using with the millimeter wave, that is a wavelength that  is affected tremendously by things like rain and clouds and plants.  So most of the people in the satellite world that I've talked to who've looked at these plans are  like, this is awesome where you don't have cloud cover. And we have a lot of cloud cover. So that's  your moment of, that's my Debbie Downer moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Reality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is still cool. I'm just like, there's some constraints. And like, I talked to  Jay Perique at Facebook about like how they're doing this and the technical accuracy they have  to get with these lasers is freaking awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, they have to be pretty accurate, right? Because you're aiming from one plane to another.  They're moving around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He said it's like hitting a dime with a gun from miles away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. They also are talking about a small helicopter, almost a drone  that can be deployed in emergencies to provide internet access.  They call it Tether Tenna, instant infrastructure in time of crisis.  I'm glad, I think it's wonderful Facebook's working on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of amazing. Google has scaled back a lot of the similar types of projects like Project  Loon. I mean, I think it's great to see Facebook continuing these kinds of efforts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They scaled it back?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Loon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they scaled it back.  It's another casualty of Ruth Porat.  Chainsaw Ruth Porat we're calling it.  Budget cuts.  Yeah. What else, Jeff, did you think? I mean, you're there.  What else are you seeing that you think is interesting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think we've hit most of the high points. I think the VR stuff kind of fascinates me  because they're still hot on it, obviously. Oculus is here, but it just didn't... I think  you said it right earlier that VR is just a subset of AR and they're now concentrating on  AR. I think they recognize the difficulty of the equipment problem. So I wonder about  the uptake of VR just because of a slightly less enthusiastic world for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're going to set up... We have two Oculus Rift systems and in the next couple of weeks,  Nate, Oliverus, Giles and I are going to set up spaces and meet each other in this virtual  reality space. My initial reaction to this is just pathetic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I can't get my head around the Valley of Goods. That's where you can just do a Skype call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, there's so many other ways. Of course, it doesn't make any sense if you're anywhere  near another person. But I guess if Matthew's in Canada and I'm here and we wanted to kind of  play ping pong, we could. We'll see. It's an interesting...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I continue... Every time I see these technologies, the first thing I think of is people who are  hospitalized or bedridden or shut-ins. I can see this type of thing being a fantastic experience.  Yeah, just incredible. But for people who can walk around and leave the building, I'm not sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  why would you do that? Here's what I worry about. I already see this with younger kids,  our 14-year-old. He'll play with his friends, but they're at home playing a game or in our  Minecraft server or whatever. They're all in separate places talking to each other. It makes  me a little bit sad. Well, that's us. That's us old folks. Maybe it's just because I have this  preconceived notion about mean space. Those damn kids should go outside. Yeah. Get on my little  way. Certainly, they're socializing. They're thrilled. Yeah. We have a neighbor. One of his  best friends is literally next door neighbor. Next door. He'll come over and play and say,  okay, I'm going to go home and I'll see you online. Here's my bigger conclusion of coming to this and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the lately the hoo-ha over fake news and hate and divisiveness in America and the world.  I don't know if I've said this on the show before or not, but I think that Facebook may be losing  a little bit of a site of its real value, which I said earlier. It's that third axis. It's the  connecting people with each other. Facebook's been accused of creating filter bubbles and the  argument is made that they should expose us to new ideas. But Facebook is not an ideas platform,  nor is it an information platform to be clear. It is a people platform. What I want Facebook to do  is introduce me to strangers and make them less strange. The power that Facebook has is to bring  other people's lives together, to bring communities into connection together. There was a great  project by a company called Spaceship Media at AL.com in Alabama where they bought 20 Trump voters  from Alabama and 20 Clinton voters from San Francisco and brought them together. The journalists  convened their discussion. Yes, they got into arguments, but then they went and asked the  journalist for information. They tried to find as close as they could get. They understood each  other's arguments. They didn't agree, but that's democracy. That's what Facebook can do. It can  convene people. It can make strangers less strange. It can show us other lives. It can allow us to

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  show our own lives. Should it do that though if people don't want to do that? I mean,  people want to do that. Do we? Yeah, we always do. That's what I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's an ex-human. We love other people's experiences if it's packaged the right way.  I mean, think about how well profiles do of people in how-  And reality TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And reality TV.  So they could facilitate this in a way that would appeal to us. I think the natural tendency  is just to hang out with people you know, and that's the filter bubble itself.  That's the perfect picture of it. That is the architecture of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think that when Mark Zuckerberg talks about community and he talks about it religiously now,  and he made a joke yesterday about his huge essay in many pages, community isn't just about  replicating the communities we're already in. Community is about enabling us to find new people  and indeed that's what happens. So I was talking about this recently with Dave Weiner  in Perusia where I said, Dave, what happened to blogging? In the early days of blogging,  it was so wonderful. I met people from Iran and Iraq. I talked to conservatives for whom I now  turn off the TV if I see them on there. We were able to have civil conversations. What was it?  And Dave said, everything's nice in the beginning, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's really the bottom line. Everything's nice in the beginning, period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are we doomed to that? Or is Facebook just a small,  nascent beginning of what it could be in a truly social platform where it does enable us to create  new communities and even new societies? Do you think that big? I mean, to me, that's bigger  thinking than drones and AR is rethinking the human connections. And I think that's what Facebook  may be losing a little bit and that's what its real focus should be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think Mark Zuckerberg talked about that in the keynote, right? That's one of the things  he said they are trying to do. Yeah, that's his new manifesto, right?  That's the community part of it. Community together, breakdown walls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stacey, you were starting to break in. No, I was just going to say, doesn't Twitter  perform that function for lots of people? I mean, I know I meet lots of people in different  communities I've created on Twitter. Yeah, me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Twitter is also kind of a cesspool. Can you say you really

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  have an interaction at 140 characters per? I mean, is that-  Yes, yes. You can. I think you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have met lots of the people that I communicate with on Twitter and I was definitely friends and

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  knew them first. I do actually remember in the early days of Twitter meeting people and thinking  of them as their Twitter handle, you know? I didn't know their name, I knew their Twitter  handle. I still do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stay with the early day blogs. Here's the problem. I think Facebook could be falling into a media  trap where what they see themselves doing is constantly creating new ways for people to create  content. They're not content. They're people connecting with each other in communities.  And if you truly imagine what that looks like, then you rethink the nature of communities and  connections. So vegans from around the world could get together. No, you can't because that's  that's highly engaged. It's just you think content is just a tool, not the end.  I think Facebook in its soul knows that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I wonder whether- I mean, I think Mark Zuckerberg is sincere-  You're laughing, Stacey.  ...about what he wants to do. But I think it's going to be a whole lot  harder than he thinks it is to actually do it.  Stacey, you laughed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was just laughing at your belief, your optimism here in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, Jeff.  Oh, Jeff, you're so naive.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stacey says, pop to your optimism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Back to the media track. Last year they had a room with about 120 seats. It was for just media people,  but all the non-technical people who come to F8 went there. So they couldn't even get the media

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  people in. I can understand this new stuff. I don't understand the VR, but I understand the new stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, new stuff. So this year they had a room that I don't know was a thousand people and that filled.  Wow. And now there's a private track for media executives and such. They're really putting a  big emphasis on news and media here. Are they attempting to solve the instant articles problem,  the exodus from instant articles? Yes. They emphasize that in the beginning of every talk.  They emphasize how they're trying to increase monetization in instant articles. Number one,  new ad opportunity, more ads in it. We'll see what works. New kind of ad units. We'll see  what that goes. Second, they also recognize that a lot of publishers who have paywalls and paymeters  really want to convert and that they're working on that. The problem for some like the New York Times,  instant articles does not work well with a paymeter. Either it's available on Facebook or it's not.  So they know they've got to work on that. They're working on that and trying to figure out a  mechanism. AMP has worked on that separately. And I think that, yes, they're taking it seriously.  There's some skepticism to be true. And here's the problem I have with instant articles. The  thing that I say about it is that the fundamental problem with instant articles is it plays to our  worst egotistical notions that everything is an article. And it stops us from innovating in news  in other ways and stops Facebook from helping us monetize by using Facebook properly to bring  journalism to the conversation. And so instant articles is great as far as it goes, but it's not  to be all and end all. And I fear that media are going to expect it to be that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pete Slauson I actually don't think, maybe I'm wrong and Jeff, correct me if I'm wrong, but  I feel like instant articles was something Facebook kind of cared about a year or two ago.  I mean, so much has happened since then. Video is now the big deal. Facebook has its eye on lots of  other balls. It doesn't feel like helping newspaper articles load faster on mobile.  Jeff Slauson No, Matthew, I'll just

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  agree to this. They're still investing in it. It matters to Facebook because they think it's a path  to helping publishers monetize and sustain. And so they think they've got to make it monetize equal  to the web, basically is what they say. And I think that's fine. I got no objection to that  whatsoever. But again, I think that it's not the only path and we in media tend to often to  think there's a false messiah of tablets will save us. Meters will save us. Native advertisers  will save us instant articles and Apple save us. None of those will save us. They'll be a bit better,  but we have to rethink journalism fundamentally. And that's what I really want Google and Facebook  to do. And that's what I hope that the thing I'm working on the news integrity initiative  can inspire some collaboration along those lines. Facebook is also caring about local.  They recognize instant articles does not serve local terribly well. It's more for national media.  They don't have a plan for local yet. They're quick to say that. But they are thinking about  how to start to think about that. So no, I don't think instant articles is by any means,  in their view, getting dust on the shelf. But what I hope is that they learn to create more new things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ben Thompson writing today in Strutechery says quite an indictment. This is kind of harkening  back to our earlier conversation that Facebook can steal from Snapchat and win because of their  monopoly. He does liken it as we did to Microsoft. And he says they should be worried because  Microsoft faced some very vigorous antitrust action. And I think Facebook is in Europe as well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  maybe not in the US, but Europe is definitely thinking about it. And just from a point of view  of a consumer in a monopoly situation, he writes, there's no competition. The monopoly provider makes

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  decisions based on profit maximization. So they don't have to worry about the demand curve. They  just consider the marginal revenue is gained from some of the things that they're doing. And so  revenue is gained from selling additional items. They basically win by winning. But look at the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  graph that he has for Facebook, because the marginal cost, that's the curve. Marginal cost  is effectively zero. Is zero. Right. So all they have to care about is demand. Yeah. The hard part,  and the only thing I would say to Ben is, what does Facebook have a monopoly on?  So does it have a large chunk of the ad market? Yes. Does it have a huge number of users? Yes.  But if you were to go after it sort of from a legal point of view, what is the monopoly  that Facebook has? What is it on? What is the market?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no. It has a monopoly on access to data that is going to improve the way  everything that we have is being delivered to us. So this is actually a really interesting.  Okay. So I read random papers, because academic papers, and I read one that talked about how  we're going to look at monopolies in a digital world. And it's really smart. I'm looking for  it right now so I can tell you. It's from Chet and Sharma. I don't know if you remember him,  Matthew. Yeah, I certainly do. So he has an entire paper called Competition Rethinking  the Regulatory Framework. And the whole idea, he looks at how we have failed. So data is the market.  Yeah. To look at how connectivity, like our ownership of different levels of connectivity,  and then how the influx of data that companies are gathering about people  change the question of monopolies. Because with AI-  And I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think he's right. I mean, that definitely is the problem is you're going to have to rewrite  competition policy. Is that going to happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, maybe.  I know, but-  I mean, okay, when?  Europe's trying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, no, they are. And I agree that that's the market that we should be looking at. It's not  the market for likes or clicks, or it's the underlying data about us as individuals and  our social graph. But how you define that in such a way that you can apply competition policy  is a really big, it's just a really big question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we say this all the time though in tech, and I get very frustrated with us because  we're like, wow, that's a big problem. And there's a lot of innovation coming out.  Let's just step back for a while. And I think we need to start really talking about it,  because tech is only going to become more essential and more-  I agree. Yeah, I agree.  ... in gait or entwined in our lives. And we can't afford to step back anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And if Facebook continues to do all the things that they're describing,  that monopoly, if they have one over those things, is going to become even more powerful.  I mean, all you have to do is look at them providing internet access to  underdeveloped countries. That effectively puts them in a position that no other company has  been in, I don't think. So how do you-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The interesting thing is with our data, we don't actually have-  It's not a monopoly in the sense that I can grant my access to my data, to Facebook,  to Google, to all of these other companies. So there are some kind of crazy fun legal  things to think about. There should be user control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You should be able to extract your data and export it wherever you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Sir Tim Worsley is doing for just that. We've talked a long time about the vault  and having your own data stored locally and you give permission to it. So Sir Tim is thinking  about- Have you talked about it on the show, Leo? Sir Tim's efforts to rethink the web  around just what you guys are talking about is that you have control of your data.  Now, it's hard to imagine separating the data from the experience, separating the data from  the transaction, separating the data from other people. Nonetheless, I do see,  if Sir Tim's working on it, I'm hoping that people will pay attention,  we can start experimenting with this. So tomorrow-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead. Oh,  tomorrow I have a guest on my show that actually is doing- Don't hate me, you guys, I'm going to  say the magic B word. He's doing a blockchain-based way to track this. I don't know if his solution  is the right one, but this is a way to deliver that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've heard some interesting stuff around that. Yeah. As a way of tracking, it's certainly a sort  of low, I think it would be an efficient way of tracking things, whether it's information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Incidentally, to get back to the instant articles, Ben also points out that instant articles problem  is because Facebook's a monopoly. He said, yeah, they monetize, but they weren't incented in any  way to really share it with the publishers. They kept-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, come on. They give the publishers 100% of the revenue that the publishers sell and 70%

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  of the revenue that Facebook sells. Well, apparently it's not enough for the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  publishers, right? Well, okay, but hello. The job here is not to replace what the publishers used  to have when they had monopolies. Well, and Ben's point is-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a fair point. It doesn't matter whether the  publishers are happy or unhappy because Facebook has a monopoly.  As Facebook doesn't care. It doesn't care. Facebook is so dominant,  he writes, when it comes to attention, that it doesn't have to do anything for publishers at all.  And if said publishers leave instant articles, well, they'll still place links and the users

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  aren't going anywhere regardless. And I have to say, I don't want to say anything.  I know, Jeff, the News Integrity Project is a great idea. I hope Facebook is working on all kinds  of things to help journalism and so on. But I wonder if for all the things they say about it,  media, journalism, whatever you want to call it, is a tiny fraction of what happens on the platform.  It's never going to be the thing that they care about the most because it doesn't generate a lot  of revenue and it just isn't a huge part of what people do. They come in and-  Right, but that's the point, Matthew.  ... accidentally while they're doing other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not core to what Facebook really is and Facebook says that.  That's fine. It's not, nobody says that it should be. Their number one job is to connect  you with your friends and family. Now they add to this, Zuckerberg adds to this, this says,  well, we're going to move past that to also connect you to your communities and to larger  communities. That's job number one. Job number ... they don't put it on this list, but I will.  Is to entertain you, to amuse you, to engage you. Job number three, almost coincidentally,  is to inform you because that's what it does do. They recognize that. They didn't build it for that.  It does that job. Fine, and they'll improve how it does that job. But no one at Facebook  would ever say that's job one. No one. It's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ben concludes that the real problem with monopolies is monopolies basically just don't innovate. It's  hard to think, he writes, of any example where established monopolies produce technology that  wouldn't have been produced by the free market. That's why Facebook's theft of not just Snapchat's  features, but its entire vision bums me out, even if it makes good business sense.  Which is a point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm actually, I'm a little more optimistic about Snapchat's potential to survive than I  Ben is in that piece. I wonder whether ... I don't think Snapchat actually is competing  against Facebook in any kind of fundamental way. Snapchat is doing something completely different.  Snapchat is all about private communication. Facebook is all about public. They're two very  different things. Everyone I know who uses Snapchat has no interest in sharing things publicly, no  interest in how many followers or likes they have, no interest in ... it's all about one to one or  one to a small group.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's funny too because when I use Snapchat because I have a different bent, I'm not young,  I'm always thinking, how can I get this great picture app and put it on Instagram or Facebook?  Me too. Me too.  But you're right, my kid doesn't use it that way. No, my 22-year-old doesn't use it that way.  It's only the older people, the adults that you see their Snapchat filters. You don't see

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they're the ones moving to Instagram, right? They're the ones saying Instagram's better  because I can see how many people read it or saw it or watched it. Snapchat too.  So if you're Evan Spiegel ...  That is not what Snapchat's about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you're Evan Spiegel at Snapchat, do you just sit back complacently and say,  well, let's Facebook have these old farts. I've got the future. I've got the kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is what I was talking about. It's a new way to use a network.  And it's how Facebook gets replaced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There was a good piece, Mashable had a great piece. I forget who wrote it now, but  looking at the old Facebook's going to kill Snapchat or Instagram is going to kill Snapchat  because it's copied everything. The two are fundamentally different. And so I don't see  people who are hardcore Snapchat users suddenly deciding, oh, I guess I'll just use Instagram  instead. They operate in fundamentally different ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I asked those kids, these Australian teenagers, they all still run Snapchat.  They hadn't moved to Instagram. So Stacey, you think for your daughter and her generation  Facebook isn't going to be the monopoly it is today that Snapchat will,  or somebody like it will supersede them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'll just have a different interface paradigm with your friends.  Okay. I cannot believe I just said that. Those words just like those real words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is how those words happen. They just come out.  I'm sure that's what your daughter talks to.  No, but that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  An interface paradigm for your friends. Let's just swallow that for a moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the new timeline.  What is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Excuse me. You're my new friend, but I still have yet to decide on our interface paradigm.  Maybe we'll do a VR thing for you to try.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I think you're right. But I think what it is is she'll use both though, right?  She'll have a public, Facebook and a private. Maybe not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To be honest, I think Mark Zuckerberg is terrified.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you steal from somebody, as they did with Instagram and they're doing that with Facebook,  it's because you see them as a threat. Very famously, he tried very hard to buy Snapchat.  He was able to buy WhatsApp and Instagram, previous threats to Facebook's dominance.  He was not able to buy Snapchat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think when he lies awake at night, he is afraid of what Snapchat represents.  Maybe not Snapchat specifically, but the change that Stacy's talking about.  Those changes in the way people behave and the way they interact  and whether Facebook is going to miss the boat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, they can't really change their fund. Public is kind of fundamental to Facebook, right?  You can't really...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly. I wonder whether... If you look at Instagram or WhatsApp or everything Facebook tries,  in a way is a way of reinventing Facebook itself while still keeping the original Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which was Farhad's point. The power of the network.  I'm trying to think of a future. What is the future?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But doesn't the power of the network ultimately depend on keeping those people?  Haven't we seen in the past how the power of the network can just evaporate like mists?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It can, but they also said yesterday that they are... I'm sorry,  there's a stairwell here that goes nowhere. I see people going...  They should put a sign up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a metaphor. There's a metaphor there.  Maybe that's the Facebook stairwell. Oh, and we lost him.  Let's take a break while we try to get him back. I think we're almost done with our conversation  about F8. I'll give you all three of you a chance to say some final words and then we'll  talk about some other news of the week on This Week in Google.  Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage from Quicken Loans. Quicken Loans,  one of the best, most innovative, most interesting companies, home mortgage lenders in the nation.  I mean, not only are they, I think, number two in the business,  they're doing some of the most interesting things and they're very trustworthy.  They're beloved. If you look at the website, you'll see all those JD Power Customer Satisfaction  Awards, number one year after year for financial services for mortgage origination and for mortgage  servicing. And they know that there are people like us who want to apply for our home loan or our  refinance entirely online. So they created a product just for us called Rocket Mortgage.  It lifts the burden of getting a home loan. You got to work with someone you trust. Someone's got  your best interest in mind. But if you're going to do that, do it with Quicken Loans and make it easy  on yourself with Rocket Mortgage. Rocket Mortgage is a mortgage approval process you could do from  your phone, your tablet. You could do it anywhere you are. You could do it in an open house. You  could see a house and say, I like this house. Let's buy this house. Let's apply for the loan.  Because it's all online, you submit everything online including whatever paperwork they need,  pay stubs and bank statements typically. They allow you to play with a slider to see what your  payments would be depending on the rate and the term of the loan and get it just right and then  push the button and apply. Now I think back to the last time we bought a house, it took me more than  a month. Lisa and I took a month to get our home loan and they kept coming back to us for more  stuff. With Rocket Mortgage, it's minutes not months. Minutes to approval. You could literally  do it as I said at the open house and show the realtor. It says, look it says we're approved.  We'd like to buy this house. Whether you're looking to buy or refi, lift the burden of getting a home  loan with Rocket Mortgage. Skip the bank. Skip the waiting. Go completely online. QuickenLoans.com  twig. Let me see if I can do the legalese. Normally I would do it really fast. That's  what they do on radio. Equal housing lender, license in all 50 states. You can't hear it.  Equal housing lender, license in all 50 states. NMLS consumer access dot org number 30 30. That's  Rocket Mortgage. Go to QuickenLoans.com slash twig. Stacy, we've all decided that the name of  this show will be a new interface paradigm for your friends. This is why I'm better in writing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because I can look at things like that and go, oh God, what was I thinking? I would look at it and go,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  yeah, good sentence, Leo. Stacy Higginbotham's here. Jeff Jarvis is here. Matthew Ingram's here.  I'm surrounded by journalists. I feel out of place. Jeff is- You sound horrified. I'm terrified  that you'll catch me out. I probably should go. Are you going to take off? I'm going to take off

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the band with this band, but thank you for suffering my sound and everything else. No problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Any final thoughts as you go back to F8? Anything you want to say?  No, the bar opens in two hours. That's all I need to know. Thank you, Jeff Jarvis. Buzzmachine.com.  He's going back to the media room where they're talking about- Say hi to Mark.  Yes, say hi to Mark. Talking about news. Yes, about you. How's that Matthew doing? Matthew with  one T. I always liked him. Yeah, I like that guy. I always liked that guy. See you, Jeff.  Actually, I don't know if there's a coincidence or if it's real, but didn't Google had a social  network called Spaces, which they announced in February they were going to kill, and they killed  it on Friday. And then on Monday or Tuesday, Facebook announces its own Spaces. Do you think  they had a deal? And it's Easter. Is there a coincidence? Maybe Facebook Plus is coming.  If Tom announces my Spaces, then we'll know. Facebook Plus, that would be funny.  All right, I'll see you guys. Thank you. Take care.  Actually, it said that Facebook responded to Google Plus with a batten down the hatches,  all hands on deck, kind of close, lock the doors. We're going to respond. They did, yeah.  It said they did the same exact thing with Snapchat. How are we going to respond to this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it was like a three-month, 24-hour lockdown.  As it turned out, Google Plus was not- Nothing to worry about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Big competitor. I think those people were locked in there for three months,  Phil, when they found that out. Maybe they declared victory. They said, see what we did worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was going to say, maybe they only stayed there for one and a half months.  You know what, guys? Y'all can come out now. This isn't-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, not a big deal.  No big deal. All right. Let's see. I'm trying to- But there's so much Facebook material. I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  we covered a good set of it. I feel like we got a lot. Matthew, you have- Because Matthew's

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  the Facebook guy. So- Yeah, I did say I'd let you guys offer a final coda  on what we saw in the last two days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have my new interface paradigm. That was my addition to this combo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have to say, I think I always enjoy seeing what a company operating at this kind of scale  it can do in the way of being nimble. Yeah, you could say they copied, but I agree with Farhad.  All great artists steal, as Steve Jobs famously said. Everybody stands on everybody else's  shoulders. I like seeing the kinds of innovations that Facebook's doing. I think this is  encouraging for a monopoly. On the other hand, I do feel like  their dominance is threatening. It's threatening to the internet, to the open web that we know,  to media consumption because whether they admit it or not, they're clearly a media company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's always a worry. That's definitely my- I enjoy the GWIZ stuff and I enjoy the  thinking about the future of interface paradigms and whatnot. But I'm fundamentally a media guy  and I've been arguing, banging the drum for years that Facebook is a media company, the biggest  and most powerful media company that has ever existed in human history.  They still do not admit that, do they? I mean, they just-  Well, I mean, Mark Zuckerberg's kind of tipped out around,  we're not really a media company, but we're kind of involved in it. So at least he's-  they were there in Perugia at the journalism festival, which they had not been. They threw a  party. They talked about the news integrity initiative. They're setting up things like the  journalism project. So at least they're trying to do things, but I'm still concerned about  the fundamentals of the kind of control that they have over the information that people consume.  And that power is really frightening in a lot of ways. If you look at the fake news  issue, they came out with some tips about how to make sure that the news you're consuming is  not fake. And one of the things they mentioned was you should look at the URL, which-  And the first thing I thought of was Facebook has spent years basically hiding and obscuring  the URL as much as possible so that you will not click on it because that would take you outside  of the network. So that they're fundamentally trying to suck and blow at the same time.  You know, you can't say, check the URL, but we're going to move it around and you won't be able to  find it. So fundamentally, some of the things they've done to keep people in the platform  and to boost engagement are the same things that they're now saying they're going to fight.  So I wonder about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Mike Caulfield wrote a very good piece on Medium. He is  actually part of a web literacy program at WSU Vancouver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it was a great piece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Facebook's news literacy advice is harmful to news literacy. He says, we've been working in this  space for a long time. We know what works and doesn't. He says, most of what Facebook's media  literacy campaign contained was bad advice. He lists the various things and says exactly what  you said, which is, A, there's no evidence that any of this works. And B, they actually make it  harder to do. He says, this process is fine to recommend it, but nobody's going to do it  because it takes too long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so what they suggested was basically, what they did was effectively the least possible  thing they could do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it was almost trite. It was almost like the obvious.  Not almost. I think it was.  It was the kind of thing I've been saying for years. We need critical thinking and you've got  to check the URL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Think more critically. Okay. So problem solved. I mean, the reality is if you remember, there was  an interview with a Facebook newsfeed staffer, former Facebook newsfeed staffer who said,  all Facebook cares about is engagement. And you know what's really engaging? Bullshit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. Fake news works for Facebook's business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly. The structure of that machine depends on things that make you engaged, not on things  that are true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that's really why they had this problem because their algorithm favored it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Because people engage with it. The faker it is, the more people will engage with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that's why Mark, I'm glad to hear he's coming around a little bit, but was reluctant to  say they're a media company because really their business model is at odds with being a media  responsible media company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And unfortunately his manifesto, if he wants to follow through on lots of the things that he said  in there, it's going to sort of run headlong into the things that Facebook is already doing  because of its business. You know, you can't, so some of that is either going to have to change  or he won't be able to follow through on the type of stuff that he's talking about, about  bringing people together and helping people with their community information needs and  stuff like that. That's just not the kind of machine that he has built.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What does Charnett say about digital monopoly? Because it does strike me that, yeah,  Microsoft was a monopoly and perhaps the Department of Justice brought it down or the EU  actions brought it down, but more likely just the nature of the world, the nature of the  digital economy brought it down, the business cycle. Time moving on. Time moved on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the most persuasive theory I've heard from someone who followed the antitrust case was that  the case slowed Microsoft down. So it didn't really fundamentally change much, but it sort  of slowed it down and that made it easier for other things to come along and disrupt Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it's like the Germans having to fight Russia and Europe at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It just slows you down. And so, but for, there's no question in my mind that innovation and new  developments would inevitably have done the same thing. So maybe the case just kind of sped that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  process up. And the reason I bring it up is maybe we don't have to worry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I still think we need to worry. But you can't, as a government, you can't say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  oh, this will solve itself over time. Well, I don't know what the government is going to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm just saying if you're a regulator looking at this from an antitrust perspective.  Well, then they're not going to do anything. Certainly not the current government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not going to wade into Facebook and its monopoly on, that's just never going to happen.  I still think we need to worry and I still think we need to point these kinds of things out  and put some pressure on. It feels to me like Mark Zuckerberg is genuinely concerned about some  of this stuff, or at least he does a good job of pretending to be concerned. So maybe we should  build on that if we can. I don't think he's a bad person. He's not doing wrong things deliberately  because he wants to kill the media or make people share fake news articles. It's just a function of

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  how Facebook operates. What is that paper you read? What was it? Charnett?  Oh, Chet and Sharma?  Yeah, Chet and Sharma. What does Chet and Sharma say about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I knew you were going to ask me. No, I didn't think you were going to ask me. I went away from

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it and didn't see it again. Well, we have his website, but I also have an article I think he  wrote in The Economist a few years ago, Trust Busting in the Digital Age. He says there are  good reasons why governments should regulate internet monopolies less energetic than offline  ones. The barriers to entry are lower in the digital realm, so there's more competition.  And I think this is him. He says, finally, the lesson of recent decades is technology monopolists  may be dominant for a while, but they are eventually toppled when they fail to move within  times or when new technologies expand the market in unexpected ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And definitely research shows that. I mean, all the research I've read shows that innovation and  certainly internet-powered digital innovation happens much faster. By the time the government

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  takes action, it's too late anyway, usually. Yeah. I mean, you look at the DOJ case, which began  in 1998 and concluded some four years later. And I think by the time it concluded, the whole issue  was including the browser and the operating system. The whole question was moot. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the risk is, and I know Tim Wu has talked about this and written about this, the  network effects of the kind that Facebook has, particularly over information and connections,  the social graph or whatever, is something unlike anything we've seen. So Microsoft's control over  your operating system wasn't anything like what we're talking about. And it's a monopoly that  feeds on itself in a way that requires no effort on Facebook's part, because we do it, users do it.  And that creates such a huge barrier. And yet it's a barrier that is almost impossible to dismantle  because Facebook didn't create it. Users created it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You may remember changing the subject a little bit. Three years ago, the Wall Street Journal  reported the FBI was considering loosening its restrictions on marijuana. James Comey implying  he was having a hard time finding hackers who hadn't smoked weed. Well, Motherboard reports  this week, the FBI says it can finally find hackers who don't smoke weed. So it still has  a ban on hiring anyone who's used marijuana. How did it do that? I wonder. Yeah, I don't know.  And how good are these hackers? You know? Yeah. You know what I'm saying? I was wondering about

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  what kind of lame drug tests are they using now? Or maybe they're not smoking weed. They're using

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  other drugs. I don't know. Is it okay for microdose LSD? Oh, that's trendy. Yeah, that's fine.  That's totally fine. Since they don't have a test for that anyway, yeah, that's fine.  But weed is right out. I loved the Jim Sensenbrenner, who is a Republican member of Congress from,  I think it was Ohio. Remember talking about this net neutrality, or I'm sorry, internet, I'm sorry,  he's from Wisconsin, the internet privacy rules. He was talking at a meeting of his town hall  meeting of his constituents. And they pointed out, they were upset that he voted to roll back FCC  privacy. And they pointed out, you know, he said, well, it's like Google or Facebook, you know,  we want a living level playing field, which is what the Republican response has been, you know,  have to use the internet. That was his answer. One of his constituents said, well, you don't have  to use Google or Facebook. And Sensenbrenner says, yeah, well, you don't have to use the internet.  Fair enough. Fair enough. He says, if you start regulating the internet like a utility,  if you did that right at the beginning, we would have no internet. I don't know if that's true.  I don't think it's my job to tell you you cannot get advertising for your information being sold.  My job is to tell you that you have the opportunity to do it. And then you take it upon yourself to  make the choice that government should give you. Facebook, a woman said is not comparable to an ISP.  I do not have to go on Facebook. I do have one provider. I live two miles from here. I have one  choice. I don't have to go on Google. But my internet service is different. That's what his

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  whole argument that in fact, the whole conservative argument about, about it's just that it fails  because they're comparing Google and Facebook, you know, using your completely different information  for ads. Yeah. And by the way, you have one choice. Well, really, this was you're right. This was the

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  line the ISPs fed them. This was in all the briefings. But really, can we raise the bar,  not lower the bar? I don't mind 11 playing field. Let's raise the bar. Not only that,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  they're not similar. My choice to use Google or Facebook is not the same as my choice to use  the single ISP, you know, that I can get access from. That's not comparable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, wait, I had a Google related story. A Google related story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That I didn't see on the rundown. Bring it up. Okay. Google yesterday made their cloud speech API  available and you guys may be like, but this is basically Google's version of Amazon Echo's voice.  Yeah. Yeah. So this is actually a big deal because when I talked to developers,  probably eight or nine months ago, they're like, Google has great stuff, but you have to like beat  them over the head and beg them to get access to it. It's completely opposite of the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Amazon treated AVS. So there you go. Competition. There you go. It's a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Good point. So you can, and by the way, this is a business for them. They're not giving this away.  Oh yes. You know, but so great, you know, you, so you, so speech recognition,  convert audio to text by applying applying their neural network models,  an easy to use API that recognizes 80 languages. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow. I like the inappropriate content filtering in text results for some languages. I thought,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know if the Echo or AVS has that. Wait a minute. Let me, so it has a button on here.  Start now. What happens? Hello, my name is Leo and I am a technology show host. I don't think  it's hearing me. Anyway, you can, you can, you can do this for yourself and return text results in  real time. So it's basically okay. You know who, but that anybody can use. I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. It's, it's the backend for Google assistant. It's noisy audio from any environments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it does the recognition, but it doesn't do the artificial intelligence understanding part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It just sends you back text. Right. It's speech recognition. And then it doesn't, it tied back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay. Yeah. Oh yeah. So it is. So yeah, I don't know why they put this on a page because you could  do this on your phone. It's exactly the same thing. It's doing the recognition in real time as I'm,  it's talking and that isn't doing a very good job. As a matter of fact, I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I'm going to just go on Matthew. I'm super excited about the sort of future of,  you know, universal translation. Like I don't care if it's that's what this is.  I guess. Yeah. I mean, I'm, I haven't just spent a bunch of time in, in Italy. Yeah. I'm looking  forward to being able to say something and have, you know, it instantly translated into something.  That's what you're another feature of your augmented reality glasses. Don't you think?  Cause you have to look at your phone and talk into it and then it talks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I really think that augmented reality earpieces will go along with those glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or Apple's air pod type. You'll have some sort of thing in your ear. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A Babel fish. I forget who wrote it, but somebody  wrote a fascinating kind of near future potential for the wireless headphones like the, the airpods  as a control mechanism for all sorts of things, you know, just as something you keep in your ear

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and it understands you. I read that once, once upon a time, it probably wasn't my version.  No, a lot of people have written this, but I know I have to, but I think that's a really compelling,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you know, if speech becomes one of the primary ways that you interact, you're going to have to  have something like that. You're not going to want to hold your phone in front of you all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So yes. And I will say for all the people who are sad, because universal translation means that  your languages you've learned are rendered useless because that's my daughter. My daughter's in a  school right now that is teaching her two languages. So I'm like, Oh, I'm paying a lot for that. I hope  it works. And Mandarin. Cause I'm, I'm a type A. Is she not getting confused by learning two different  languages at the same time? She actually dreams in Spanish. So she's been learning Spanish. It's

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  an immersion school since kindergarten. Okay. So she's like, so she's now really a bilingual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Research shows that kids are, their brains are a lot more flexible than old people. Like they're  capable of learning multiple things and the more languages you learn, the easier it gets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. But simultaneous, it's tough. I think, I mean, I see Mandarin. Yeah. Mandarin's one of  the hardest languages to learn. That was my major in college. It is. Wow. It's actually surprising.  Well, it's actually surprisingly easy to learn the spoken Mandarin. If you can handle the tone  structure. Tonal shift. The pronunciation is hard, but the language itself is one of the simplest  languages. Cause it's old. The older the language, the less declinat- you don't have declinations,  conjugations. You don't even have past and future. That's true. But the thing that's hard for people

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to learn is the tonal shift. Yeah, but that's like singing and I bet your daughter's good at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's just, it's, you know, it's not, it's just learn each, you know, there's, there's just different  tones. Once you learn that, it's not that complicated. I'm telling you, I have a hard time.  We need to go for them some, some time. The hard thing is the written language, which is-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yes. Probably. She is, that is, it is beautiful and complicated and I feel sad for her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Calligraphy. It's something completely different. And they can't, you can't, you're not, when you're  writing a, drawing a character, for instance, there's an order to each stroke. You can't make  up, you can't say, well, I'll do this later. You got to do it in exactly the right order. And they  can tell if you don't do it right. And those Chinese teachers are mean. They, yes, they,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  they put the fear of God into my child. She is- They take it seriously. You need, you need to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  teach her Heptapod. What's that? Which, from, from the movie Arrival. Oh, yes. Did you see?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That was an interesting language because it looked like Wurzak, Wurzak inkblots. My daughter took

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  linguistics and she was fascinated by the way they constructed that language. Because it's real,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  right? I mean, they attempt, it's not a real language, but they attempted to follow linguistic

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  rules and grammar. Right. But they thought, they thought it through. How would you have a language  where the whole thing is a sentence? It's not structured in parts in the same way that  our languages are. Yeah. It's like German times a million. Well, Chinese is like that where one

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  character is, is, you know, many- Is a thought. Is a thought. And this is, Heptapod is-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was fascinating. They did a really good job. I don't think it's, it's a spoiler anymore,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  right? We can talk about it. I hope. I've never seen it. Oh, go see it. I'm okay. I'm not going

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to hold you to it. I'm just like, I haven't seen it. It's fascinating. It's not really a sci-fi,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it's not really a sci-fi movie. I mean, there's aliens, but it's much more- It's really well done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I thought it was very good. I will, I will check it. I just haven't gotten to it. It reminds

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  me, it's more like Inception in that sense. It's more like- Oh, no, I hate that. I hate that movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, it's not. I hate movies who are like, I'm going to mess with you. Yes. A lie. Okay. Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  there is a little of that. Yes, there is. But the language is very well done. I think, you know what?  I'm going to predict you will like it, Stacey. Me too. I am. I'm going to predict you will like  it. That's your- I will endeavor to watch it. Now, Matthew knows you much better than I do. Plus,  the star is a nerd, a nerd lady, so. Yeah, it's nerdy and it's intellectually interesting. I  think it will fit. Yeah, it's really well done. Yeah. Heptapod. If a JITPY moves too fast,  this is a really interesting article in the Wall Street Journal. If the chairman moves too fast,  he risks a court fight in an attempt to kill things like net neutrality. But if he goes too  slow, it gives the opponent's time to organize a SOPA-like protest. And you know how that ended.  So, kind of a challenge, apparently, politically, to kill net neutrality.  Kill net neutrality. I'm glad to hear it anyway.  You want the death of net neutrality? No, no, I'm glad to hear it's a challenge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yes. That whole thing is just a minefield. Like the whole thing is just-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why? Why go there? That's exactly their words. Whatever path Mr. Py chooses, his road is studded  with possible landmines, including vacancies on his commission, a continuing court fight over  current rules, a new Supreme Court justice, the coming 2018 midterm elections, the potential for  the kind of widespread protest only internet activists can organize. I do believe that  Congress is a little bit, post SOPA, and of course, the net neutrality laws or regulations  were instituted after an extensive comment period where they received more comments than  they'd ever received on anything since Janet Jackson. Net neutrality has been going on since-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Since the internet was invented.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So 2005 is when we first started fighting over it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But remember, I think we convinced Tom Wheeler to change, to kind of change his tune.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it was the millions of comments. He was not going to do Title II.  Right. That was like the third rail of this policy. And then he was like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  okay, I guess this is how we're doing it. Well, he didn't really have any other way to do it.  He had to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The court told him he had to go with Title II.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In order to achieve what he wanted to achieve, he had to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And this actually is a larger and really, I'm going to be fair, a much more complex discussion,  which is that the FCC can only do what the Congress mandates it to do. And there are those in  Congress who feel like whatever Jim Sensenbrenner says, that choosing to regulate internet service  providers like normal utilities, in other words, invoking Title II of the Telecommunications Act,  wasn't Congress's intent. So that while it was available as an option, many in Congress thought  this is not what we meant when we wrote the Telecommunications Act. And this is a  misinterpret, a willful misinterpretation of this to get a certain, and what really should happen.  And I may have to-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a rewrite of the Telecommunications Act.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly. I may have to give Ajit Pai credit. He may be saying, I think he is saying,  this Title II really wasn't what the people who wrote the law envisioned. We should go back to  Congress and have a comprehensive Telecommunications Act that addresses all of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if we do that, that's fine. But just leave what we have. Don't go back and take the vase  that was smashed on the floor and we tried to tape it all together and then it got smashed again  and we taped it again. Don't go back to that. Say, okay, let's go out and make a new vase.  And that's a terrible metaphor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There is some evidence, as the journal points out, that the new Justice Neil Gorsuch  is really a strong believer that federal agencies should have much more constrained  rulemaking capabilities, that Congress is ultimately responsible for this,  and that Congress should tell the agencies what the rules are, not that the agencies should make

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  up the rules. And I think if there's a path, if they're one of the strongest parts of Ajit

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Pai's argument is that. But the risk, and this is part of the risk, is we've got midterm elections  coming up not so far off. And the complexion of Congress could change. If you could get into  Congress now, before the midterm elections, well, you'd be assured that you're going to get some

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  rules that favor big business. And if for Ajit Pai's, if all these-  You're not going to be able to rewrite the Telecommunications Act in a year or two.  I mean, that's not going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And if what Ajit Pai is saying is, well, let's just turn it back to the FTC and we'll just  let them handle it, that's not really a solution either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I disagree. Yeah. And he has said that as well, that this is not something the FTC should be  involved in. The Federal Trade Commission should be involved in this. But that may be a  disingenuous point of view because the FTC, even though the FTC doesn't have an enforcement arm,  they also have a lot more cases, including whether diapers give babies rashes and all sorts of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The FCC has an enforcement arm. They have an enforcement bureau. They march down and find  people all the time. Yeah. Well, okay. Did you not see that Christian Plato movie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's like four vans in the whole country. And I don't think there's an FCC police.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's one guy in each van. It's the FCC Bureau of Enforcement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I understand. But I don't think it's really more about making sure radio stations don't exceed their

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no. They find people. They find AT&T. They find people for cramming. They do a lot.  And they also come down hard on the people who run cell phone jammers and movie theaters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I agree with you. I think they would do a better job on this than the FTC,  which has way too much on its plate. Yeah. Well, and this is hard. And

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  say what we will about Tom Wheeler. He listened very closely and had a deep  technical understanding of what he was doing. Ajit Pai, I swear to God, is like,  he parrots the ISP line in a way that makes regulatory capture look too nice of a word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I think we, as geeks, agree that the internet,  we don't agree on is what the government's role in the internet should be, but that we would like  an internet that is free and open to all. And certainly I made my living competing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  ISPs are not the internet. So we should talk about regulating ISPs as a monopoly player.  And this is you're falling into the trap that, sorry, Leo, I get so passionate about this.  Good. But ISPs want you to think that they are the internet. They are your access to the internet,  which is why they should be under common carrier with forbearance, which is what the FCC tried to

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  do. And that is all, that is it. Yeah. No. And I don't disagree with you. And then we did win that  fight briefly. But I think that it's not completely unreasonable to say, well,  we need to go back to Congress and get a real authorization for this, if that's what you want  to do. That would be the best. Yeah. Yes. Well, you know what would be the best? Would be no  government interference, but just a really good competitive market where you could have choose  as a user, you'd have more than one or two choices. Right. Which we don't have. You don't  have it in Canada. We don't have it in the US. Right. And there's no sign of it coming anytime.  Well, no, it's quite the opposite, isn't it? Right. Google gave up. You know, like Amsterdam

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  has such a great, I wish we hadn't punted on 21st century infrastructure because like if you look at  Amsterdam, what they've done is they put, they laid conduit and they said everyone has access  to this conduit. Just run your pipes through it. But also Amsterdam is the size of, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  like downtown Brooklyn. It's clearly the right way to, I mean, not clearly, but I agree with you.  It is my opinion the right way to do this is to have the governments which have the right of way  and have put in the infrastructure and then let others. But even Google didn't want to do open

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  access when they talked about it initially and then they were like. That's because there's such

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  an outlay to put this in. That's why it has to be governed. It has to be public. Right. This is what

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  government does because I mean, the economic benefits of having fast internet access. But remember,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  we have an administration that wants the highway system to be privatized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. I get, I just, I'm, there is a role for government and I get so frustrated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I completely agree. And you know, even, I think even a conservative and in some respects I'm a  conservative understands that the government has, the government represents society's interests and  sometimes society's interests are encountered in the interests of businesses. And that's in  cases of monopoly, for instance, it's all monopolies are great for business, not so good for society.  And that's an appropriate place for government to weigh in. And I think that it's appropriate  for government to build infrastructure that includes roads. And I think you could argue  water, electricity, and I think you could argue reasonably internet access. And what's great is  there's a way to make this viable for government and for private industry, have the government  build the lines and then lease it to private industry, thereby defraying the costs so the  taxpayers don't have to pay for it in the long run and giving, having some real competition on

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  top of those lines. And yet even when, when municipalities and regions have tried to do that,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  they've been fought by ISPs and carriers. Mostly now I'm going to get political here. In my opinion,  that's because we have the best Congress money can buy. And that's not political.  Yeah, that's just a statement of fact. And so money wins and they're paying more money for  your camp, your member of Congress's campaign than you are. And so they get to do what they want. And  that's just really a shame. It all comes down to Larry Lissig has always said this, it all comes  down to campaign finance reform until you get big money out of politics, you're never going to,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the people are never going to win. Unfortunately, I think Larry just exchanged one unsolvable

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  problem for an even larger unsolvable problem. Well, but he was right though. That's the root.  If you don't solve that, you can do anything you want about DRM and, you know, and IP and all of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that, because it doesn't matter because. And all we have to do to change it is to fundamentally

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  change human nature. Yeah. Yeah. I'm on it. Can you work on that? I think we need a new paradigm  for internet human, new interface paradigm for human interface. Get on that Stacey.  Interaction done. The Galaxy S8 is emerging. This is in my opinion, it's going to come out this week.  We're already seeing reviews from all the big tech blogs. We've had it for a couple of weeks  embargoed. In my opinion, this is going to change what we expect a smartphone to look like.  Bezel is the future. And I'm sad to say. Yeah, I think it is. Yeah. Bezel is OLEDs. Apple's going  to do it. Samsung's going to do it. And while I love this Pixel, it's going to start looking like  a 1950 Ford Fairlane because. It's a classic car, man. It's a classic car. Come on. Those things are  worth a lot of money. It's a classic, but yeah, you know what? Bezel is. Maybe it's going to look  more like a 1980s Volvo. No, you don't. This has all been solved. Yeah, it's all been solved.  And what you really want is just a big ass screen with controls on the screen. I had to come around.  I did not like it when Android started using on-screen buttons instead of physical buttons, but  this is Samsung's abandoning it. Supposedly Apple's abandoning it. They're going OLED,  curved displays, infinity displays with the smallest possible bezel. And people are raving  about this phone, although. Oh, I thought, yeah, I thought I heard that. Although the camera is  terrible, is it not? No, no, the camera's the same as last year, which was superb. Oh, okay.  Sorry. I thought it was in that case. Well, what I've seen. I'm getting mine on Friday. Okay.  You know, but it's as far as I can tell, it's the very, it's a new Sony sensor, but very similar to  last year's sensor, which was the S7 was very, very good. Before it exploded.  And this one. You see the problem. You see the problem. You're right. This phone is not going to  explode, right? This phone. Well, I think you could make the argument that this is the phone  least likely to explode. Okay. Right. After Samsung spent more than $3 billion on the Note 7. You  would think. They have, they announced, you know, we're going to X-ray every phone. We've got all  these new technologies. They're putting smaller batteries in these things. I think that they're  probably good. I would guess going to bend over backwards to make sure this phone does not.  I would think so. Smaller batteries. Isn't that going to be bad?  3000 milliamp hours in the eight, 3,500 milliamp hours in the S plus.  Android's doing a lot these days to make, make these phones last longer. I'm very curious.  So far battery tests look pretty good. It's, it's up at the top, which isn't saying much  because almost all phones batteries are not enough. The biggest problem Samsung's going to have is  Bixby. They, the highly talented voice assistant that for some reason Samsung felt like, oh,  it needs another one. Unfortunately, when it ships, it is not shipping with Bixby. It's not  ready for prime time. There is a physical Bixby button and one would hope that you could map that  to Google assistant. In fact, early reports were that you could map it using software that lets  you change a keystroke actions, but we're now hearing stories that you can't. I, again,  will let you know, this is something I'm going to want to do. Cause if you've got a dedicated  voice button, that's nice, right? That's a nice idea. Or if it were like the tap. Yeah. But,  but if Samsung prevents you from doing it, even though Bixby is not ready, that would be  really, really annoying. That seems mean. That would really be annoying. According to a post at  XDA developers, the new galaxy S8 firmware update that you'll get when you get your new phone shuts  down the ability to remap the Bixby button. Hmm. It was a, you, it was, the trick was  accessibility could intercept it. You could map it and you can have it do something else, like make  it maybe launch the camera or the calendar or, you know, Google's assistant. Well, I have soft

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  buttons if you can't program them. Yeah, I agree. Yeah. I agree. See, I think they're afraid that  no one will change it back. That's exactly right. Well, yes, that's exactly right. Once you don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  use Bixby, you'll never use Bixby. Right. That makes sense. That's why you got to launch these

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  things with the features intact. Yeah. Yeah. Well, if only it was that simple. Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Everybody wants to, I'm sure they didn't think of it. Hey, this is really good news. Amazon  has announced that they're going to, you know, the Amazon Echo has a very sophisticated seven

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  mic array. Oh yeah. We talked about this on the podcast this morning. They're now making that  available to third party device makers. Yep. So this leads to the big obvious question, which is,  okay, everyone can build their own Amazon Echo. Right. This is great because this,  if voice is the next UI, Amazon is going to be, that they, they have built the vocabulary that  right now is positioned to be everywhere. So it's the pinch to zoom for voice, right? They've built  that and you can put it anywhere and everyone can have it. But how many devices do you want to talk  to individually versus having one device be the butler for all of your devices? And that's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  big question, I think. Right. To me, it almost says that Samsung, I mean, Amazon isn't too tied  to making hardware that they make more money from the voice services and they would love everybody  to use it. And that's, that's pretty exciting. Contrast that to Google's slow reluctance to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  let other people use the system. Right. But think about how Amazon makes money there. They've never  made money from hardware. Hardware is just a way to get you into the Amazon ecosystem. That's where  they make it so that you will pay for prime. Right. Well, and I believe homes, homes with the Echo

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm trying to find the data, they, those people spend a significant percentage more. Yeah. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. I believe that. I know I do. I order stuff all the time. It's got to the point where I'm in  the bathroom and I've run out of something, you know, shaving cream or whatever. And I'll,  I'll, I'll just tell Echo to order it. It's just easy. Like a dash button. Does anybody use the dash buttons?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I had the dash button and then, or was that an interim? My 14 year, no, no, they're still big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're all in on the dash. Okay. Oh yeah. Yeah. Okay. But my 14 year old found our dash button  and we got a lot of toilet paper in a very brief period of time. And so I had to hide it  and I forgot where I hid it. It's somewhere in the pantry, but they're actually, no, in fact,  there are appliance manufacturers making dishwashers and washing machines with the built in dash button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, dash is not the, the dash button was never the exciting thing. The dash button is just  the front end for the service, which is the automatic fulfillment. Yeah. DBS is something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting. So there, oh, that's interesting. So there is a whole technology  beyond the hardware. This isn't just like sending an order to Amazon. No, it's, it's a fulfillment

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  service. I think it is the dash automated warehouses and drones and whatnot. Oh man. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  in, if you are a manufacturer, you can actually build that into your product without ever having

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  the dash, which is the look, look, look here. Dash replenishment, DRS connected devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's an extension of, of Amazon's warehousing, right? They handle all of your  fulfillment and logistics. Running out is an extension of everything Amazon does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So these are the companies like Whirlpool that are building this thing in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Brita, there's pet food companies and this is Amazon has within it to be  the massive IOT company. If you imagine IOT as cloud data in touching the physical world,  Amazon has that chain down pretty much packed and they're automating it quickly. So  if you want to see what the future looks like in terms of like socially, what AI and automation

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  means for the economy, what's happening there. Yeah. But the good news is it's not going to  impact jobs because all of you grocery clerks, all you truck drivers, you're going to be going  to the Amazon warehouse and pulling drone repair, right? What else robot repair? Because in fact,  the robots will be doing the picking anyway. But yeah, so I mean, so at some point, and I  don't think it's more than a year or two off, no human will intervene at all in this process,  except maybe the UPS guy who gives you the package. Yeah, because the drones may not be

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  launching from their truck just yet. Soon though. Yeah. Are we going to actually have it at the

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  point where a drone goes to the shelf, gets the object and brings it to you? So there literally

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is no human involvement at all. You will always have to have, I shouldn't say always because  that's like never. But for a significant period of time, there will be odd shaped things, there  will be weird wackadoo situations. Oh yeah. But the dash button is not for everything, right? It's

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  for those not so odd shaped things that are easily. Right. Wow. What a world we live in.  I'm just glad that I can't be replaced by a robot. Voice recognition is getting better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, not a robot. I was going to say your competition is just a more enthusiastic,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  young person, young person who's on Snapchat. Well, we always can get replaced by a young person.  That's always, that's always been the way of the world. That's the way of the world. Yeah.  That's how it works. That's how it works. So you're going to get replaced sooner or later anyway.  Any other, any other IOT news? I don't see any IOT news here, but Stacey, this is your beat. Any

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  other IOT news we should be aware of? Let's see. It's all pretty small this week. I'm trying to,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm like, we really, I mean, we got to take advantage of your IOT expertise. You don't have

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to. I mean, I talk about it a lot on my own show and I don't want to like overlap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, we, and we, yeah, we, and we don't want to steal people from your show at all, but,  but I think as a, as a, as a kind of a high level look at what's going on in IOT.  And then if people want the deep dive, they can go to your show. Yeah. If you want to go crazy.  I'm trying to think if there's anything new that I've seen. Last week, I talked to people about

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the Google Home versus the Amazon Echo, because I did an experiment where I swapped mine out for a  full week to see if that Google Home was ready. Which did you like? It's still the Echo. Google  Home still has some issues. So that was, that was a little bit of a bummer because Google Home is  so much better. So for, for home control, its grouping is weird. So it, it groups things  based on, it puts things in a room. So you have the name of your particular device. So living room  left table lamp would be one of my devices of the four lights in my living room. And then I put that  in the living room group in the Echo. I have those two classifications, but then I have a future one  or a further one called downstairs that encompasses every light downstairs. Google doesn't give you  that next level to, so it was kind of irritating because I'd be like Google turn off living room,  Google turn off dining room, Google turn off kitchen. Right. As opposed to all that. So that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  was question and answer like vocabulary and the way it handles and remembers the thing you just

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  asked is better than that. That is so much better. And it has great things like, you know, being able  to tie directly into a Chromecast, but I can't tie it into my Amazon prime account. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. So there's, there's just like silos. I think Amazon is a two year lead and I think we'll probably  maintain the lead for some time here from a, thanks to a CEO bra in our chat room is, you know, the  future is happening already in China. This is a Chinese factory where robots sort packages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I watched that yesterday automatically. And the only thing humans do is put the thing on the  machine. Well, the only job is to put it on top of filling job. Isn't that great? Well, they have to  do it just right. You put it in the right way. Oh my God. You know, what happened? We were moving

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  away from the Henry Ford assembly line and now we're going right back to it. Humans apparently only  real skill is, is our ability to, you know, spatial and physical recognition of odd

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  shape packages. And that feels like a bone they toss to the, like you couldn't get a claw or  something to just pick the thing up and put it on top of the machine. Come on. They could get a claw,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  but how do economies survive where, you know, I mean, we just, and they sell free charge too.  Oh my God. 200,000 packages a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And eventually they'll be manufactured in automated plants covered only by  wait till the way till we start injecting everything with self-replicating nanobytes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Then we're done. I read about that. Just two words. Gray goo. Yeah. Gray goo. It's not going  to work out. I read science fiction. What are you reading these days, Stacey? What's,  what's your favorite fiction? What are you reading fictionally? Fictionally? Oh, oh, hold on. I got

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  my Kindle right here. I'm like, my daughter and I are reading the hunger games aloud to each other.  Oh, perfect. She's the perfect age for that. Isn't she? Yeah. So go dystopia. Yeah. I did read  lab girl, but that's nonfiction. So what's that about? Oh, it's a great book. It's a female  biologist who wrote about just, it's a memoir of her time in science. And it was great because I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  learned a lot about trees, which I am going to give this to my daughter who wants to be a lab girl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah. It actually doesn't. Her experience is very, it's a woman's experience, which you don't  hear a lot about, but she never actually talks about it for like, like that should be any  different. Right. And every chapter begins with like this great piece of knowledge about how plants  grow. So you learn a lot and it was well written. I'm just trying to think of, I started reading the

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Northwater. Stacey is an awesome mom. Yeah, no kidding. Thanks. They get to an age though. I  was reading, my kids are of course older and so I was reading the Harry Potter books to them.  And we got to about book five and Abby, who was about, I think 12 said, you're reading it too slow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just give it to me. Well, we make deals with each other that we're not going to read ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. She just read it. Yeah, that's a good deal. That's a good deal. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Every time

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  we stop, she gets, she's like, no. And I'm like, sorry. Mommy's voice is giving out.  Yeah. So, oh, but I am reading the Northwater, which if you're a guy, you might like, but  I was having a real hard time with it. I'm finally getting around, speaking of guy books,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm finally getting around to reading Blood Meridian and Carmack McCarthy's amazing book.  Yeah. He'll really like Northwater. That's a guy. Well, that's what it reminded me of. I thought,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  yeah, that sounds, yeah. Ooh, The Sympathizer. That's a good book. I just read that. What's that  about? It's about Vietnam from the perspective of a Vietnamese soldier. Oh, this won the Pulitzer  Prize. Yeah. It won a Pulitzer. It's a good book. It's good enough. It's good enough. But it was a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  really good book. What you reading, Matthew? I'm reading Seven Eaves. Love that. I was just  thinking about that. Neil Stevenson. Yeah. Matthew, is that your daughter? Yeah. Megan,  wave to the camera. Hi. Hi, Megan. Stacey says hi. Taking care of the cat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know why I'm saying that because she can't hear me any better than she can hear you.  I know. I'm just so excited. I'm like, I've known Matthew for so long. Everyone is saying hi to you.  She was a little girl, I bet, when you first met. Yeah. Little Ler.  Neil Stevenson's Seven Eaves is a very good science fiction book. Fascinating. Really well done.  The premise is, and it's not spoiling anything to say, it begins with the event, the moon breaking  up into pieces and the consequences on Earth. And you don't really know what the name of the  book means until really almost the end. Until the end. Yeah. And then it's like, wow, highly

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  recommend it. Very good book. Yeah. I thought it was fascinating in the beginning when the moon  explodes and everyone thinks, wow, that's really cool. Look at all the little pieces of the moon.  And even the guy who's like the chief scientist of the US. There's a Neil DeGrasse Tyson character in  it. Yeah, exactly. And he's thinking, wow, that's pretty amazing. And he's going on talk shows and  he's talking about it. And then he has this horrible realization that eventually all of  those pieces are going to come falling down. And it's going to be very, very, very, very bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that's all we need to say. Audible has it. I listened on audiobooks, but boy,  I love Neil Stevenson. He's had some misses. Reamedy was not great. He's had a couple of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  near misses lately. I went back and read Snow Crash, actually. I think it was last year.  And it's funny how William Gibson, who knows a thing or two about science fiction and the future,  had a tweet the other day. Do you remember a guy sent an animated gif to a Newsweek writer and  triggered his epilepsy? Yes. And this William Gibson said that was the first thing he thought  of was Snow Crash because that was the closest that he could think of to a sort of virus that  is replicated and distributed basically on the net. So I thought it was interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  William Gibson is great dismal on Twitter. He has one of the best Twitter handles ever.  Must follow. Yeah, that's a good one.  Yeah. We're big fans of his stuff. He's Canadian?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, sorry. I'm like, you guys are producing all kinds of great...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's in Vancouver. No, no. In fact... Pretty sure he's Canadian.  Yeah, he is. At Paul Allen's Experience Music Project, they have a... I can't remember which  novel it is. And maybe it's not... Maybe it's Neil Stephenson's Cryptonomicon.  Another great one. But it's... Gibson types it. Neil writes it,  handwrites his novels. And so they have... So it must have been Neil Stephenson. And it has a pile,  like five foot high pile manuscript of the handwritten manuscript. And then all the pens,  the pilot pens, the pen pens he went through. It's the best display I ever saw. It's awesome.  Amazing. I don't know. You know what? You're two of the smartest people I know. I thought,  I wonder what they're reading. It's not a normal feature of the show, but I just thought, what the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  hell? No, it's a great feature. I'm going to go look for those books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, right. Exactly. I will recommend a great book. I don't know if our audience will  like it or not. It's kind of a fantasy. It's by a guy who's very famous for his short stories,  but he's 57 years old and he had never written a novel. And his first novel just came out.  His name is George Sanders and the novel is Lincoln and the Bardo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you and the New Yorker. Good Lord. This is an amazing novel.  All of the intelligentsia is like, this is an amazing novel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This novel is so different and weird and brilliant. And this is actually a good one to  listen on audio because they recorded it with 186 different voice actors, including Nick Offerman,  who has a large part in it. Of course, Ron Swanson from Parks and Rec, David Sedaris,  Kerry Brownstein. There are just, it's Lena Dunham's in it. The cast is 186 characters  because there are a lot of people and there's a lot of dialogue in it.  I don't want to say a word about what it's about and don't read any of the synopsis because  it's much more interesting just to not know what you're reading and then figure it out as  you're listening. Highly recommend that as an audible book. And of course there's the whole  Bill O'Reilly collection. Yeah. Available now. Remainder bins everywhere. Yeah. Actually Bill

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  will come to your house and read it to you. He's got, he's done with his day job. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have a lot of time on his hands. Yeah. I had to share that video clip, which you probably  don't want to play because they're swearing, but I'll do it live. Yeah. Yeah. We'll do it live.  I kill myself laughing every time. It's very funny. I've seen it a million times. It is so

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  funny. But anybody who's worked in my business recognizes it. What does that mean? I don't know  what it means. It means he's trying to record something for you to show. Oh, he's saying,  what does it mean? And when he's saying, I don't know what it means. Let's do it live.  It gets funny. I just going to do it. Yeah. We'll do it live. Oh, so good. It's a little  too close to home for me. I can't really. Yeah. You know what you did? You guys did such a good  job in your book reports. I'm going to get you snacks. What? What we get snack time, snack time  and then we have time right after. Yeah. I'm sorry. I can't really thrust these down the  wire to you, but it's time for nature box. These snacks arrive at your door. You used to be monthly,  but now you can, you know, and it was a fixed number of snacks. Now you can order as much as  you want as often as you want. There's no minimum purchase. You can cancel anytime. And these are  the best snacks ever. This one's already open. The blueberry almond quinoa bites. And one of the  things I like about this. Yeah. They're really good. If you have a desire for a salty crunchy snack,  but you don't want to eat like Cheetos. Which I do. Yeah. I don't. This is healthy for you.  Roasted cashews, crispy rice, pumpkin seeds, roasted almonds, dried blueberries, rice syrup,  cane sugar, quinoa, palm oil, sesame seeds, natural blueberry flavor and sea salt. And you're  incredible. And they satisfy, you know, they check off all the boxes. You're killing me. But,  but one of the things you can do is they all have, they all have resealable bags. So you don't have  to overeat, right? And they're nice. They're usually very healthy size. These are not like the,  you know, the eight chip bags you buy in the grocery store. Naked trail mix, nuts, raisins,  seeds and dried fruit. And when I say nuts, raisins, season, listen, listen, what's in it?  Peanuts, raisins, almonds, roasted pumpkin seeds, dried apples, cashews, peanut oil, salt. That's  it. That's all there is. And that's what I love about nature box. They are making, there's over  a hundred snacks to choose from. Sweet, savory, spicy. You pick the snacks you want. They'll  deliver them right to your door. If ever you get a snack you don't like, they'll replace it for free  in your next box. It is awesome. High quality ingredients. Sriracha, roasted cashews. Oh,  they do a lot of Sriracha stuff. That's so good. Highly recommend it. Actually, one of the, one of  the favorites, and I was listening to another podcast, I think it was Joe Rogan's or something  he was talking about nature box. And he said his favorite was the big island pineapple. And that's  my favorite too. It's the best dried pineapple you ever had. That's all that's in this. No sulfites,  nothing. In fact, all of nature box snacks are free from artificial colors, flavors or sweeteners.  So you can feel great about snacking. Your daughter would love these. And you know,  snacks are an important part of growing up, but let's not go to the vending machine and  stack up, you know, stock up on things that aren't going to be.  How about this nutty power clusters, nut squares with walnuts, almonds and cashews. Of course,  if you have a nut allergy, you don't have, there's, they're not, they don't all have nuts in them.  Just great stuff. Nature box. Here's the deal. Right now you're going to save 50% on your first  order. So there's no reason not to. When you go to naturebox.com slash twit, naturebox.com slash  twit 50% off your first order nature box. It's my favorite part of the day. Nature box snack time.  Now everybody get out your mats and we're going to take a nap. No, we're not going to take a nap.  We're going to get your pics of the week. Did we do the Google draw thing? We did it last week.  We did do it. Okay. Yes. I want to make sure that we did not miss that because that is so much fun.  Well, I'll let you guys have another Google new thing from Google, but I'll let you guys go first.  Yes. Is that yours? Oh, sorry. Damn. That was going to be mine. Yeah, that could be yours. That's fine.  Okay. Let's do it right now. Okay. And then we'll get Stacy's pic of the week.  So Google earth rolled out brand new. Tell us about it, Matt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's amazing. I, I saw somebody tweeted a link and they said, oh, there's a new Google alert,  Google earth. And I thought big deal. Like we've seen Google earth. What's, you know, so what?  I think it's great and everything, but it was, it stepped it up. Like there's much more. I had just  been in Italy and I went to a bunch of places that, that I had been and zoomed in and panned around  and looked at the, it's, it's phenomenal. Like it's significantly more. Well, let's go to,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  let's go to Perugia right now. Zooming in. So what, so you've got your knowledge cards.  Yeah. What else is, what else is different here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's, I found the, the motion in this, I don't know if this part is new, but it was much more  seamless. Yeah. It's really, really nicely done. Yeah. The panning and zooming, the, the kind of  not scrolling it, but however you call it in a sort of 3d.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Stacey and I, by the way, are extremely jealous. Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We want to go to Perugia. Yeah. You, you should. It's so fascinating. I, I, I had no idea.  Like it was the capital of the, the, the Truscan empire. I mean, it was a big deal.  It's so medieval. Back in the day. Yeah. Yeah. And it was a war at one point with Assisi.  In fact, if I remember correctly, St. Francis was in the war and then he got injured. And that's  when he went back to Assisi and became a monk. I've always loved Google Earth. It's amazing.  Yeah. Like I, it was like, I saw it for the first time again. Yeah. And I was amazed all over again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. This is like looking down from an airplane. I mean, it's, it's really great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it's fast. Now, have you seen lion yet?  Yes. That's a great movie. The story of an Indian, Indian orphan who gets lost when he's only,  I think five years old or very young, gets on a train, loses his brother, ends up thousands  of miles away from home, completely lost, becomes a street urchin, is adopted by an Australian  family, but still can never get over the idea that he lost his mother and his brother and his sister.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then Google Earth comes along at just the right moment and someone tells him about it.  And I remember that news story. I remember reading about it thinking that's incredible  because it was such a powerful story and it's an amazing movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So he uses Google Earth because he can only remember, you know, he remembers some,  he's got the name wrong of the town. He can't really, he can't figure it out. So he just  figures out what the radius would be of his, you know, how far the train went.  It took him months, years, I think. Really a neat story. In a beautiful movie that was

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was so incredible. I remember thinking that can't possibly be true. Like it's so,  it seems almost fictional, you know, it actually happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Ooh, we just zoomed in on the 12 Apostles Visitor Center  off Port Campbell National Park in Victoria, Australia. This is really remarkable. You really  feel. So this is the dice over on the left. There's a die and you click it and you get a  random spot. That's fun too. I think for a kid. And there's some guides. There's like, oh yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  as a kid this would be incredible. My daughter, when she was young, she loved Google Earth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like she would spend hours just playing with it on a tablet. And we showed her this and she's just

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  like, wow. Wait a minute. She would, maybe she would like this. Girl Muppets Around the World?  What? Okay. Oh, I get it. So here's an Afghanistan. They're different nationalities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Different Muppet nationalities. It's just so seamless. Like before, you know, it was laggy or  blocky or, and you would kind of lose the illusion in a way. Right. It's just so seamless.  This is, this is, this is technology. They keep zooming to that level. Yeah. This is technology  that's just. And I remember Google Earth, the original, when it was Keyhole, I remember seeing  a demo and it was one of those things where I actually told somebody from Google this in  Perugia. It was one of those moments where I felt like I was living in the future. Like where all of  a sudden, you know, faster than light travel appears or something. Like it just felt so different  and so futuristic and yet there it was and it was free. It's pretty incredible when you think

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  about it. It's just remarkable. You want to explore Paris? Well, we'd all like to. No, dude,  lost civilizations from above. Oh, wait a minute. We're going to Machu Picchu in a couple of months.  I wonder if that's a lost civilization. I was like Paris is cool, but lost civilizations.  How about Nabata Playa? Between 7,000 and 6,500 BCE, an urban community arose. And what is currently  the Egyptian? Now, what do I do to see more of it? Do I click this? I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just click indiscriminately. Zoom in. That's all you get. That's it. That's it. Well, boy,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  that's fascinating. I don't know. You might. Let's double click. It looks like an abstract painting.  Yeah, it's pretty. You can in parts. I mean, there are some amazing things like camels  and their shadows trekking across the desert that you can see. More lost civilizations. Let's do

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  another. I remember we used to look for the glitches or the hidden things or, you know,  there was a woman sunbathing or something. Everybody in the newsroom, just like work stopped  while everybody looked for all the little Easter eggs in Google Earth. There was one where cars  looked like they were levitating in a parking lot because of the way the shadows. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is my dad is on Google Earth. Your dad is. What's he doing there?  Is his art? No, I'm sorry. He's on Google Street View. Oh, he's standing outside the house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, he's just he's driving another great one. Yeah. Street View. Actually, when it came out,  someone I won't name who I worked with was shocked and horrified and screamed  bloody murder. And I said, what does the matter? And she said, if you go to my house,  the car was driving by just as she bent over into her car to get groceries out. She's hanging  out. So literally all you see is her butt. And she said, it's going to take like a year for them to  go back and re-index. So I said, you could send an email and beg them to like come down your street

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  again. You're actually seeing Tulum. See, look at that. That's yeah, this is the Street View. So  the street view. So it's the next step, right? Yeah. Wow. And you know, with all these 360 degree  cameras and stuff out there, at some point, this is just you're going to be able to go anywhere and

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  see anything. And you already can. I mean, there's not even just streets, but they've got guys  who are carrying them on their backs and people on scooters and like unicycles. Like you can get  street view almost anywhere. Right. Inside shopping malls. Is it a Scottish island that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  has them on sheep or something? Is that? They have way more sheep than they do people. That's for  sure. Yeah. It was like street view cameras on sheep. I want to say street. So it's sheep view.  Sheep view. Cameras on sheep. Someone help me out here. Cause the Faroe Islands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. There's nobody there. Yeah. They have to use sheep. There's like four people in a bunch of

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  sheep. This is neat. One of the most mysterious human structures ever built. Sheep view. So it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  wasn't Google. It wasn't Google that did it. It was. Yeah. That's funny. Ah. That's funny. Sheep view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right, Stacey. IOT. So this was both Matthew and my pick. What's your pick of the week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you know how we have this punch Leo button that we've been joking about? We really want to  make. Yeah. Yeah. The virtual. Yeah. Here is now this is not, this can't be done over Wi-Fi yet,  but it would be simple to add a Wi-Fi shield and program it. Yeah. So this is a Haxter IO project  to create a fist bumping robot. And Leo, I don't think you want the punch to actually be that hard.  So we just have to make the fist bump instead of the punch is more like a fist bump or we could  put a stronger servo and make that work. Wait a minute though. Here on Instructables,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  the instructions for building a desktop fist bumper. I think this actually would do the job.  There you go. That would work. The idea being, I mean, it needs to come out faster. Yeah. We could  probably, we could probably step it up. Spring load it. It's an Arduino. Look at that. Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  actually if you spring loaded it, you wouldn't need the servo. Oh, you're right. It just does

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  something to release the release the fist and then it would just, you'd have to rely on different  Instructable things. You'd have to rely on my staff to shove it back in, shove it back in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And to not replace the spring with something really, really powerful. Yeah. This is,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I wouldn't actually have to rely on yourself. You would. This is 3D printable. You can print this  and then of course there's a lot of, you know what? If you, yeah, I searched for fist bumper,  but there's a lot of this stuff. Arduino. That's a powerful human need. To either bump or to bump  fists. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for being here. We thank of course, Jeff Jarvis,  who had to leave to go on to other things at F8, but he took some time out from his very busy  schedule there to join us.

How jealous we are of that. You got to have, I can't talk now. I'm in

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a canoe on the lake. There's lots of room. It's a big lake. I'll come up. We'll come up and visit.
