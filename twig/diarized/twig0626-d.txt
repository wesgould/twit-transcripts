Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Guess we should do this. I you know, it's funny  Because I don't use Facebook. I don't I often issue the Facebook stories just because they don't they don't matter to me  But I guess they might matter to other people so I think we should probably do them  They matter to Jeff they matter to Jeff  Well, sometimes it matters that we don't do them just because Leo's gonna yell at me, but no go ahead

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh this one. I have no I've literally no opinion on it. Actually. I'll tell you it is kind of interesting. Okay. I thought you might

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so Facebook says  That it was really one post  That cast out on the Vaxx.com  Post  That cast out on the vaccine that was the most popular in the first quarter of  This after a long struggle over whether to share the data at all with the public  But here's the thing that's fascinating and I think it's the reason probably Facebook  shared it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The article or it or didn't share it at first because they knew what crap would ensue but go ahead. Well, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is interesting  Um this the article was uh  Seen by um  Was it 2.8 billion people? Oh, no, that's the facebook's total user count. So that's confusing  That's confusing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The most popular things are seen by like 0.01 percent, but keep going it was um

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh the most shared the top performing link in the united states on its platform january through march  But it was from a legitimate news organization the south florida sun sentinel was distributed by the chicago tribune  Which owns the sunset. Yeah, and it was uh, it was a completely legitimate journalistic story about the cdc  Investigating the death of a doctor who passed away two weeks after getting the coronavirus vaccine  um  now  Months after this was widely shared on facebook the medical examiner's office found  That there was not enough evidence to say whether the vaccine had played a role in the doctor's death  You know people die whether they get the vaccine or not. It's not necessarily cause and effect  However, it was I think it's safe to say shared widely shared on facebook as evidence that the vaccine

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kills. Well, I shared it with people. I I showed it to people  It was it was a an uh-oh story in any case and it was early in the vaccine days  Uh, but it was as you just said that you shared health misinformation jeff charvis  Well, that's exactly the point is that where is that line and how do you decide this is misinformation?  So the story of the facebook report got presented as facebook didn't reveal information about the most popular thing on the platform being  vaccine misinformation  And then it was buried in all the media stories that this was a story from the chicago tribune company

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, they say we'll take down outright false information, but but they argue conversations about factual articles

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Shouldn't be surprised right up and people were perfectly legitimate to be curious about it and read it and share it. There's no

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's no issue there stacy and i'm curious jeff what you think about this, but I feel like  Media right now we're in this weird era where we don't know how to deal with stories that change over time  So if we think about like the scientific uncertainty around covid  You know, it's one thing when we used to have  You know  You printed it on paper and then it was thrown away and so you could change that and people it was harder to go back  And look for stuff, right?  You know, you were a universal source of truth you and your morgue with all your clips, right?  But now right we put stuff out there. It gets shared out of the context of the date or whatever  Uh, we're learning new things. We don't necessarily update everything. So how do we do journalism?  When things can be ripped from the context, how do we try to I really don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is a conversation I had with the doctors and scientists  I interviewed out of my covid list in the early days of the platform and I asked them just this question  And the problem that i've learned about journalism and I I was guilty of this in my day  And i've said this like on the show before is that we take the latest word as the last word  There's a new study that says coffee will kill you and then a week later  Coffee will save your life, right? And we never put it in the context  We don't understand the process of science and it's not just the process of science  We don't understand the process of politics like look at the look at the coverage of nancy pelosi. Oh my god. She's lost  Oh, she won look at the process about the the withdrawal from from afghanistan. Oh, it's a it's a horrible thing  oh, we got 80,000 people out and and  We want to declare, you know this line that we write the first draft of history means we ignore history  We ignore context we report the here and now  And surely we should have learned better than that by now, but we haven't  Journalism is awful at reporting process whether that process is that of learning in science?  We should have warned everybody. We don't know what the covid vaccine  Covid virus is yet. We don't know what it's going to do and responsible journalists did at stat news  Uh really good reporters there helen branswell people like that really explain this  Kai kupfer schmidt is a great scientific reporter out of germany, uh who writes for science  There are some very good examples, but there are also tons of terrible examples  And and just this story kind of illustrates that right?  It was one episode one thing one fact that in and of itself doesn't teach you anything  But is of interest it is of legitimate interest and legitimate for explanation and discussion  and and the funny thing about this one is the reason I think leo did the story is because  It's not about media at the time nor is it about facebook at the time  It's more a story about media's reaction now because they wanted to go after facebook  And oops turned out to not be the best

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Indictment of them facebook spokesperson andy stone said it considered making the report public earlier  But since we knew the attention it would gather exactly as we saw this week  There were no there were fixes to the system. We wanted to make they didn't say what those fixes were

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You got to think that facebook  Must have wanted to make this public because it really does kind of thumb its nose at this criticism  except

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But leo look at the look at the coverage that came out of the new york times the washington post they buried the fact that it was legitimate  Oh interesting wasn't until the next round of reporting that said, uh, uh big guys you kind of buried the lead there

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This was a legit article and uh, yeah, I mean you can't  No one I don't think at this point could say facebook should have blocked that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, absolutely not if they did they would have gotten holy hell, right?  But that's the better what they did they get holy hell now  I think facebook handled this badly. That's usually my preamble i'm talking about facebook stuff these days  They're not as bad as they're screaming, but they could have done a lot better, right? They could have released this report and  Used as an opportunity to say look folks. This is process. This was legitimate media  You can't knock us for doing this. Yes  It was popular because people were talking about this and they were scared now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you ask a question of both of you had the article been published in?  Let's say the epic times which has been very aggressively, you know anti-vaccine they're a full  Falun Gong sponsored kind of uh  Less than credible source had it come from the flu from those guys with the same set of facts  Would that have changed?  Stacy, what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  um  Yes, I tend to  Actually the first thing that came to my mind when you mentioned that it was uh, uh the sun sentinel  I was like, is that a shuttle sheldon adison paper? Right, right. Is that legit or not? But that's a good question

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what everybody should ask. That's what your daughter should ask. What's the source, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So so yes, the source does actually matter I would say yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And yet the facts if the facts are the same  the facts are the facts  uh  I guess you could say the article might have used them to uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, yes, you can say advance an agenda. Like I actually I was tweeting about this but i'm i'm seriously i'm  thinking about volunteering slash taking over my local paper because

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa back into leads speaking of backing into leads. What is the way? Wait, wait, wait, wait  Stacey Pulitzer Higginbotham stacey  Randolph Hearst Higginbotham. What's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm frustrated

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or more more like who is roger ale's wife who took off for their local paper because she didn't like yes exactly i'm like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, this is this is just as a journalist living in a place and I have there's an island newspaper and it's it's not a bad  newspaper, I just  I'm not getting it's very much  The loudest person driving it. There are very few facts and a lot of opinions boy some good journalism in a local newspaper

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What a concept

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, and I don't I want you to do this stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll kick in 10 grand to help you do this  I'm just gonna

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm gonna start by seeing if they'll let me write for them and maybe cover something  Um, because I have an actual job too, but i'm just like as I look at this, this is an actual journalist  This guy is an actual journalist the guy who runs the paper is an actual journalist  I think he's probably he's like all one person. He's like a one-man newspaper. He's like i.f stone kind of  Yeah, well or like  Or nosy neighbor or gladys cravitz. Probably more like this cravitz. Yeah, whoever pick pick your favorite small town newspaper  who's got like a part-time photographer and it's probably pictured in a grizzled old man who  You know runs around all over the place or yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But we all loved i.f stone when he did that because he was well we all we lefties loved it because he was progressive  I'm sure there were plenty of people on the other side who said this crack pot who has his newspaper is driving us crazy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think I think actually if I report things with less  We have a real issue on the island with um  Big nimbias on big opinions. Sure. Everything is like evil. I mean there's it's very polarized  so I i'm wondering if I can  Put facts first  And then like he leads with the most inflammatory quote, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, he probably has some experience on what sells newspapers and paper. Well, exactly. So i'm like  This may be a good business man as opposed to exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, yes, so i'm i'm gonna just see what I can do here and maybe I won't be able to do anything  I'm not gonna like take over the paper  I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Seriously, what would you need to do? First of all, I guess a print newspaper is a recipe for disaster

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have a web  It's on the web. Yeah, I mean this serves 20 the island has a population of 24 000 people, right?  So  I mean this is and it's part of a chain

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Local perfect hyper local it is yeah, it's always been my fantasy to do that with a radio station because that's what that's the medium  I know  Uh and to have a because radio stations have become less and less local more and more  Nationalized and all right broadcasting the same stuff and I think small town newspapers and small town radio stations are vital  um  Not that anybody would ever listen to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Petaluma radio station if you want if you want that vision of the small town paper  There was a there was a great episode of the twilight zone called printer's devil in which burges meredith  Played the devil as a watch out for this lanotype operator  And what he typed into the lanotype affect have changed the future  So this is my vision for stacey is that she becomes the all-powerful

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um print mogul of the island. What would you do stacey to keep yourself from becoming that which you currently abhor?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  ah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow, I don't have whore like I mean I abhor like super  I don't abhor the local paper

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, maybe i'm overstating it. Uh, i'm like good lord, but but you you want you have some curative purpose in mind. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do. I well, I think I would I would lead with the facts right now  He's leading with the most

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And if you did that, I mean, do you think that would protect you down the road from becoming an advocate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do so here's the deal  It's very easy for me in the tech world because I can be an advocate  I am a consumer advocate  Yes when I think about and i'm i'm totally comfortable with that. Yes, if I am reporting on city council  especially at the local level, I can't report for  consumers because  You know, it's meaningless for that and I can't say  You know i'm pro  You know pro-environmentalism because then you know, the thing is your anti-development  But really what I want to do  I mean I want to do I want to straddle the middle that I try to straddle here and bring the  Nuance to each of these ideas and this is probably terrible for journalists

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The reason I ask is it feels like it would be hard not to have some mission creep where um  And I admire both of you as real journalists who are able to  Put their feelings aside and do good journalism  And i'm i'm always fascinated by how you kind of keep on the straight and narrow with that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to recognize that there's no such thing as objective reporting like who gets placement and where even even as long as you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cover story is uh an editorializing in some way

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, you know, but I I do think there's room for improvement in things like our city council debates and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you can't so we'll see you can't ever it's a it's a it's a  Specious to say that there is a perfect center that where you  You can't do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's worse than that. There's there's a wonderful and I think i've mentioned the show before but I have so many things to mention  um  Oppen of the new york times by wesley laury peeland surprise winning washington post reporter who left the post because he disagreed with the editor about  social media  And the idea of objectivity and he argues that that objectivity is a power structure and power structures come from race  That's right weight person is the editor in charge who looks like me who says that's right that's objective that's biased  That's right, and you can't cover that because you have that bias  Um, so that's a power relationship  And and he said and so this is I just said in other words. It's impossible

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's impossible not to have that in some way

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I argue and you can be aware of it. Yeah, certainly awareness. Oh, yes, and you and and you be transparent about it  uh, but also it's also about  Valuing lived experience lewis raven wallace who's a trans journalist who got fired from npr because he wouldn't  Toe that line says that when they fired him they lost his experience. They lost his perspective  They told him that no you can't cover these things because you're biased  Well, the other way to look at this is who better to cover this because of your experience

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's a bias to say you can't cover. This is a bias exactly. So exactly  This is but you know  This is that um famous  Risk of situational ethics  But I think the argument is all ethics are situational  Is that kind of what you're saying?  Um, there's so there's well not all ethics people who use the phrase  Situational ethics use it to just kind of say well there there is an actual ethical truth  And then there are people who hedge it because they say well the situation means that you can't adultery is okay here  And but but are you saying that so you say sounds like stacy you do believe that there is a  Ethical truth that uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you should attempt to report an ethical truth. Like that is what I try to do. I recognize that you know  There are probably more than two sides to lots of issues. There are sides that are  worth highlighting there are sides like  Random troll guy that probably does not get highlighted, you know, and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You would agree with locations in our chat room that the effort alone is worthy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and you're never gonna get it all perfect, right? I mean that's the other thing and with community  journalism and community like local news  A journalist is very much part of the community. You can't be objective about the place where you live. Yeah, so  You know, you've got to be the type of person who's willing to meet people where they're at and like  Be a part of that community and that will influence your coverage

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're actually very fortunate in petaluma town of a little larger than bainbridge island about 50 000  Well, not a lot larger, but you know twice the size that we have a local paper the argus courier, which is  uh  Of run by the the big city paper the santa rosa press democrat  Which is owned by the really big city paper the new york times company  but I  Not anymore. Did they get did they divest divest? Yeah, I don't know who owns it then but um  They've done a really good job. I I feel very fortunate that we have a small town paper  Because they do a they talk they cover the city council meetings  They cover the controversies in the town and they take letters to the editor that say things like you're so full of it  Which is great  Um, I feel very fortunate, but I have a feeling there are a lot of towns in this country  They don't have anything like that. Who's going to cover the city council meetings?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  God, they're so boring slash crazy. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But stacy, you know because we know how stacy thinks on this show. She's going to come at this and say  Have you thought of this angle?  Uh, we should really discuss this part of it. Uh, here's a different perspective that you should see  I mean, that's what's going to be really valuable

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you're right. We were we were bought by something called sonoma media investments

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  after halifax media bought it from um from the times company

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a group of old white guys. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, hey, we're shinoma media investments, but actually they look like middle-aged white guys. Sometimes white guys can yeah, there's a yeah  Sometimes they can do a good job  Um, anyway, I think they are they they I think they are doing it  They bought the press democrat the argus courier the north bay business journal from halifax. That's right. How'd you know that jeff?  I googled. Oh you googled  Because i'm impressed

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's a journalist. He looks up facts

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, here I am living in the town where five years ago or something the times sold it off  But uh and didn't even pay attention  but I have to say there it's um  I would love I know that's what craig newmark's all about right is is is trying to preserve this this tradition of journalism

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  um, well  Preserve what's worth preserving but also challenge what's not worth preserving and make it better  I mean craig pushes for trust in news and I think he recognizes that that too often we've lost it and that's what I recognize too  Yeah  So my sister is is we're in my father's apartment right now  And she just brought me she's going starting to go through his stuff as we pack up what's necessary for him

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And she just came across this take five on page five daily with jeff jarvis  The man with the beard is that the what is that the examiner?  That was the examiner. That's a little bus card that uh, or a subway card. In fact, it's still got the curve from being on the bus  Yeah, that's awesome. That's awesome on the san francisco muni back when the examiner was not a rag  Yeah, now it's a real news pick now. It's a giveaway. It's a gimme newspaper. It's not  I don't I think I don't know obviously i'm not up on local media anymore  Uh, but obviously not san francisco used to have a morning paper the chronicle and an afternoon paper the examiner  And they were arch rivals and they were both great  And they had columnists like jeff jarvis  It was her cane herb cane the legendary herb cane. I missed that and they by the way, they probably had sudoku puzzles both of them  God bless him. Hey speaking of uh journalism  Our favorite, uh, uh columnists zainab tufici has joined the new york times as an opinion columnist  Congratulations to zainab  um and the time and the times I think she's i've  been kind of a religious reader of her  Opinion pieces both in the times in the atlantic because she was the first person as the times points out  To tell people in march of 2020, you know masks might actually be a good idea  Back when the surgeon general was saying don't wear masks  Save them for the medical personnel

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's that's a question though. I wonder whether when when the history is written presumably we all survived to write it  I wonder whether  We might find out that that was a strategy just to save the masks for the doctors who needed it  Oh, it was

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was but what they should have said is don't wear n 95 don't wear medical quality masks  But you know what that mask you make yourself  Is better than nothing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But even at the time doctors were dying to get any kind of masks. They had no ppe

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but I but I think of uh, I think it was croatia  Where they started an on the ground effort?  To get all the grannies to sew masks and they would keep them on the streets on mask trees for anybody to take  It had a huge impact on the spread of the virus  We could have we could have done that by the way  But this is an example point points out that a month later the cdc reversed itself  Because partly because they said one senior scientist at the agency said saneps essay was key to that decision

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, so she had some this goes back to what stacy was talking about before and you were talking about too is the process  We didn't know we legitimately didn't know at the time  and  Um, and as evidence came out and as people like to say that talked about this, uh, it was reexamined and the opinions changed  Uh based on different evidence and data not based merely on emotions

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you we've talked about the idea that you know, maybe it'd be best if you have a covet 19 twitter list  Which is made up of epidemiologists and physicians people who are experts in the field  And and I think you've always made the case that those are the people who we should listen to and  We should really be careful about listening to people not like sociologists who are not experts in the field  But there is or journalists or journalists, but I think there is and this is where journalism has an important role

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what a journalist can say is, you know, there's a lot of different opinions even in the medical community  Here's a summary of them and why it's you can't make a decision based on  That's a that's a good role, right stacy. That's a role for a journalist should be playing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the role for a journalist and I would also say that I mean  Experts are great  But you also the value a journalist should provide doesn't always  Is the ability to understand those experts and translate what they're saying to something normal people can understand  That's what you do in technology. No, but that's what you do  It's trying to come up with like and then put that information into context  But to do that, you need to have a historical understanding of like in this issue. I may not be an epidemiologist  But if I learn enough about it and talk to enough smart people  I could I could play one on tv. No, I would have the context  I have the content no because listen to me  Having done this with incredibly technical fields. So like software defined networking semiconductor manufacturing  freaking wireless  I I cannot build you a network. I understand  At a really fairly technically deep level how those things work and happen  And I built that up over 20 years of talking to people who are way smarter than me  and  That's the context that I bring to talking to those experts  And it is inherently valuable because I can compare what two or three other people say about something  To what I know in that doesn't make me  less  Important or valuable than that particular expert because i'm an amalgamation of a bunch of different thoughts  And all this context that even they might not have because i'm old I would use the word synthesis, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go ahead. I certainly agree with that. But my butt is this we are also  bombarded with cyber boys becoming armchair  Epidemiologists with their hot takes your butt and then the next they're they're experts in in evacuating war zones  And they're the next week  They're the experts something else and so and so the and the hot takes spread not just from social media  But they spread into media  Itself into proper media where some journalists I think get too taken with themselves

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a problem in our field in technology reporting as well. There's a lot of people on youtube  Who are not expert?  Uh who may even you know be on the take so to speak from companies that they cover because they don't have any  Journalistic code but there are also some very good people  Isn't that always the responsibility of the reader to try to fair it out?  Well, who's responsible is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I agree it is but I think that's where we get that. No, we're hearing people say no this goes back to your first story  Um, the platform should get rid of that bad stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But then well, that's just as bad as I mean, that's just somebody else  That's some other person telling you what to think. So yes in the end it is the responsibility

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I agree, but I don't think right now the commentary about that agrees because media feels as if they're being displaced  Yeah, I agree with every statement that absolutely. Yeah, but um, it's it's in an ecosystem that includes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh cyber boys and their hot takes so we get back to that thing that i've always felt was a little pat  But everybody always says well, you just have to teach people  to uh have uh critical thinking and have and I would argue that you have to fund journalists so they can I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of the reasons why we don't have this is because  There's not enough to like  I have a deep knowledge of peering it only comes up  And is relevant  You know maybe three times a year for a major everybody gives a hoot story, right?  And the rest of the time i've got to work on other stuff  But I still have to keep sort of up to date on peering if I ever want to use that when it next comes up  And those are the sorts of things we don't fund I mean i'm in it i'm a hugely expensive writer to have on your publication  And it's true and the stuff that I know about and can add value on  Is it it's not  It's not large right for the mainstream reader. They don't care they care right now because the chip shortage  So I would be really valuable for like the next few months and then poof i'm gone again

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Transcript:  I'm just saying they can't afford to pay for the context that older beat journalists provide like  You can't afford to become an expert. There's definitely an issue with that. Yeah, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you're not a beat why you've got you're not a beat person and you end up doing every story  you can possibly get assigned and then you're  As thin as as a dollar bill on everything you cover and that's where it is now you're expected to do eight  Log posts a day as we used to split it and yeah, it's not easy.

Please use that url so they know you saw it here crowdstrike.com  Slash twit  Well big turnaround for only fans  We are sex positive now  This is just the weirdest story. You may remember only fans, which really I think started  uh as a platform  For sex workers to sell direct to their customers  uh  Not sexual acts but videos pictures that kind of thing  um  Then because of pressure it turns out from the credit card companies and rules changes that were imminent announced last week  No more porn you can put new tasteful nudes up  But no more explicit  content  um  I mean there was a hue and a cry  I think somewhat legitimately i'm i'm not I don't have an only fan subscription  But I think somewhat legitimately from sex workers  I don't think sex work should be illegal. I think in many places it's not from sex workers who  Said look this was a safe way for us to make a living

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And all of a sudden we're cut off and being in control of our fate and not and not in the hands of certain bad actors  Pants and such yeah, uh same with the campaign that went after craigslist it went after other platforms. It shoved it back underground

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I you know adult content's not going away  And it's not illegal by the way in in most jurisdictions  But there's still a very big stigma against it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And so elissa jerry is one of the best writers on this she she's on a book leave now, but she's she's really taught me about this  uh  that  Air is an important, uh provider of rights. Yeah  And uh, I saw the I don't forget. Can I say this this this tweet safely on our air?  Say it and we'll bleep it if it's probably no no, it's just um when they when they took it down  somebody said that they that they thought that uh, the founder of of uh of uh, only fans must have um,  Taken it down in a moment of guilt after a moment of rapture shall we say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Inevitable guilt that one feet yeah, but that and that's a puritanical point of view isn't it that yeah?  Oh my goodness. I'm enjoying this this must stop  Um  The credit card companies  I and I think I understand this  Don't want to be liable. Uh, they did this already to porn hub because porn hub was uh,  Accused of in a very famous think talk about opinion pieces very famous opinion piece by nicklas christoph in the new york times  uh pretty much  Ended porn hub because he said there's revenge porn on there. There's non-consensual stuff on there  Uh credit card companies immediately cut them off and that was that  Uh, and it's now kind of I guess what they're gonna do  um  Somehow i'm not sure how  Uh, only fans has figured out how to get around that. I don't know  the uh,  You know, I I think the credit card companies aren't changing their tunes. So

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't know what they're going bitcoin might be bitcoin. Why are the credit card companies? I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People use credit cards to buy porn all the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but when yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know. I we wouldn't know anything about that stacy, but I don't know. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's that's a legitimate question. I is our credit card company is going to decide  Uh, you know, they're gonna be the new laws pressure

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, I I you know last week I think we're talking about the postal service and and how  The comms talk that was the pressure point at which you could bring by the puritans against  Sex and the things that were seen as bad and and the credit card companies are just a a pressure point  So the parents television council people like that can go after them and they make them nervous about their business  So it's a much who's going to stand up in favor of porn at a major banking company. They're going to say, okay  Okay, okay, we'll we'll but there are I have to say plenty of sites out there

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Scooter x has an explanation

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He does he says banks now have to ensure that sellers have documented consent as well as age and identity verification

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So entity verification, I think that's a requirement for that pressure came in part from this. Yeah  Yeah, legitimately, you don't want underage  performers  Maybe that's a problem on uh, maybe maybe maybe only fans is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Decided they don't we can do this they have policies in place  To document people but they're probably not as rigorous. I don't know. Oh, I mean, I just saw a study that said

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That uh, you that 13 year olds and under know easily how to get around pretty much every

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Every restriction on all the platforms. Well uk has been is going to is going to require  Um identification for the purposes of age which which has a horrible chilling

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now I think they overturn this but initially the the way you would get this verification is by going to your local pub  And showing up with id  And they would stamp your card  Uh, they because they needed local places people could go to verify their id  I don't know. I think that did not make it into the final version of the law. Well, let's see here

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Age verification law explained  Um  In 2019 they would introduce a new law. So I wonder what happened. This is bbc  I think it did that this is rob's plan for online pornography age verification system. You're right. That was october night 2019

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, anyway, I mean  I don't really have a opinion one way or the other as I said, I don't have any only fans accounts. I think  Platforms like patreon, but I think patreon also might have some adult content on it  Platforms like patreon are fantastic. It's what we use for our club too. We use their memberful  Service, I think they're fantastic for for people who create content to go directly to their audience  There's no reason why people who create adult content should somehow  Be eliminated from that group of people arbitrarily. I agree. There should be ways to verify  Consent and verify age. That's obviously something that has to happen. Maybe I think tumblr got got

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know kicked in the groin so to speak  uh when because of its corporate owners it took down just simply nudity and tumblr had a lot of  artistic expression  That used that and then suddenly there was a fear about there was there was a there was a chill on the naked skin there

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's too bad  I mean, I think it'd be nice if society just kind of accepted that sexuality and nudity is part of life  and not something  To be uh, especially since we we celebrate violence in all its forms and fashion

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think the I mean if the issue is stopping kids from that's fine. I agree

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That should not be that they've got to prevent that if that's an issue  But I don't think I don't maybe it's a big issue. I don't know  I think most of the people on only fans are adults

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who have decided most but if there are some kids getting on there and doing that that is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's my hope that that's exactly what only fans did is is come up with a system to prevent that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is there other um, there is stuff besides porn on only fans. I've never really i've never gone on no in fact

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Earlier this year only fans known for porn. Yeah  They kind of started to really and and there are some big celebrities on only fan only fans  Uh, I don't know what they offer probably, you know other stuff but  um, yeah  so  anyway  The biggest turnaround in history  Uh, hey we were talking before we before we end the journalism topic we should probably mention the passing of  Uh the guy who put the new york times on the internet  Richard or yeah, richard meislin. He was a times editor  Has passed away at the age of 68 which is I can tell you right now far too young  amen  He was it says according to the times instrumental in the newspaper's embrace of digital technology the times is  Among a handful of newspapers who've really made this  transition to digital successfully  Um

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you know rich was the editorial yeah, I knew some I knew martin nissenholz who was the business side equivalent better  But but martin and rich and some others at the times vivian schiller were among the early leaders  Uh, and the times of course remember was times on aol  They created a local times thing. They experimented a lot. They were early in on rss. Thanks to dave whiner  they experimented with with  Advertising models the times was the was the leader for so long

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's one thing. I appreciate  The new york times cooking app introduced in 2014 which I have subscribed to ever since  Drew on mr. Meislin's vision 20 years earlier of digitally organizing and sharing our wealth of recipes  Uh, I subscribed to that too. It's a great app. In fact, that's probably where you got your

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We were a little far ahead of them when it came to to connie and ask nepa curious. I just want to say

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, fine  But where did stacy get her corn pasta recipe new york times recipes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Last year cooking cooking

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I I by the way, I subscribed to epicurious as well or I did I don't think I still do but for a long time  It was the most beautiful  Of all the recipe apps. It was just gorgeous as good as the as beautiful as the magazine last year new york times cooking attracted  113 million users  Pretty good success. So  Anyway, I thought we'd we'd pass that r.i.p rich r.i.p  Uh, yeah, we're getting to the point point in time in the internet revolution where some of many of the pioneers are getting a little  long in the tooth  And we're all we're all starting to make our way towards the western havens

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So my sister my sister was asking today because i'm down here in a town sun city center florida  Where you by law you have to be 55 to live in the town not just the building the town  Um, and and my father has a world war two veteran hat and she and I talked today to a  Guy named bob who's 99 years old who flew  Air force jets over china. I mean, it's amazing. So what they talk about here, especially the complex where my folks have been  is  world war two and the korean war and being veterans and  My generation certainly stacy's generation is not going to have that commonality  You know, what are we going to talk about leo the grateful dead when we're in the old folks home. Yeah  i'll be talking about

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, I lisa and I went to see billy idol on saturday  And  It's really when you when you go to see a concert like that  You you see immediately that the people were billy idol fans are now in their 50s and 60s  and it's really interesting it was a  a  elder  audience  Some kids parents bringing their kids and stuff, but for the most part people my age and older  Uh, because billy idol was huge in what the early 80s. He was an mtv star  And there was even a guy probably in his 60s who was  Complete head to toe dressed like billy idol and leathers with studs and chains  and I noticed his uh his uh,  Lexus car key hanging from his belt as well. It was a very interesting scene  I have to tell you I wish I got a picture of that because it was kind of his star. I want to envision now

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  leo in the old folks home  Hey  Do you I used to be on radio? I wish I remember radio. I often

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I often radio I often thought i'd be in the skid row with a sign saying will announce for food

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did not stay for the white wedding encore. I did not how did you know that scooter x?  Oh, the wrecks knows everything we we left right before uh rebel yell  But it was fun  Yeah, well and that's the other thing I noted the the entire band which also was getting on in years  Instead of the traditional jack daniels bottle they were all drinking gatorade  so  You gotta keep your energy up for  For jumping around on stage. Hey speaking of the new york times in the new york times  recipes, uh, this makes me sad the new york times crossword puzzles for the longest time supported a  Format dot puz scooter x is reminding me the times has decided to no longer support  This open standard the puz format. They're going to  Basically say no one else can publish new york times articles  I subs you still had to subscribe to get access to the content  But I use a very nice macintosh third party program, which will no longer work  Starting august 10th  Oh, no, i'm just getting into crossword puzzles. Oh, I love crossword puzzles. The good news is  Yeah, right the times has an excellent, uh crossword app itself  But there were even better third party apps plus is there a dot so d standard  I'm sure there is

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually sudoku is a much easier thing to you know  I mean all it is is a nine by nine grid and you say where the numbers are  I think it'd probably be fairly simple to do  Uh crossword puzzles are more complicated because you got to include the clues and so forth  So the the across light dot puz format  Sorry to say  Is no longer. I mean it's going to continue but the new york times is no longer going to support it  Uh, so be that way be that way. Yeah, see I  Not sure. I think that's a good thing  You know another thing that we'll be talking about in the old folks home jeff remember when credit cards used to have a  Magnetic stripe across the back that you would swipe

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I remember my chart my mother's charge plates charge plates. Remember that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They'd run this big thing across a carbon  Junjun  Magnetic stripes  Are on their way out  MasterCard will be the first payments network to phase it out. Of course, they've shifted over to chip and pan or chip and sign  Microprocessors that are in so much better. Yeah, you know, they're not 100 secure. They're a little easier though  I mean they're a little harder to reproduce the  The chip that's in the credit card so that I guess gives you some more security  Based on the decline in payments powered by mag stripes after the chip based payments took hold  Newly issued mastercard credit and debit cards will not be required to have a stripe starting  2024 in most markets by 2033. So you got a little time

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No master what happens when the power goes down or the internet goes out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They just have to write your credit card number down for later. Oh, I mean that's that's happened to me. I mean, I just like oh, yeah  That's interesting. I don't know  I don't know. Yeah, you're right. The mag stripes probably didn't work then

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they just pull it like a couple places have literally pulled out the little credit card plate things and just kept this slips  But yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's pretty clear to me that this was an attempt to  With a little bit of hand waving and charleston dancing say pay no attention to the national highway transportation safety administration  Yes, that's why it's insulting

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pay no attention to that instead of caring about your safety  We're gonna just troll you with this dancing robot person in a robot suit  However, I will say  Halloween costume of the year go on

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So my view is if robots are like mimes i'm going dystopian and I want to destroy all robots  Mimes are bad, too. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Clowns mimes and robots. That's those are the big three now, aren't they?  Yeah  um  the  Htsa or nutsta as some nutsa  Some people call it  We'll be probing the autopilot software  Since 2018 is logged 11 incidents including 17 injuries and one fatality in which the vehicles  Autopilot features crashed into stationary emergency vehicles 11 times in the last three years  Most of these incidents took place after dark with the software ignoring scene control measures including warning lights  Flares cones and illuminated arrow board

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, this is a case where i'll i'll i'll surprise you perhaps  um  I can't think of a better field that requires regulation than this  And that hasn't been completely agree with you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Agree with you. Although here's what it what I don't understand  Is the first two times this happened? We're like, oh man, these things are confused by  You know our emergency setting put up a sign with a freaking qr code  I mean, we know how to make things legible to robots  It is very simple to give someone some sort of waterproof avoid this area. I mean it really is sure  So just like it's just software to put your cone up. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In fact, you you don't even probably need a qr code

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You probably could just say look for flashing warning lights. That might be a sign apparently

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I meant I meant like some sort of instead of just putting it up like they put the flares to talk to humans  You need to put up something to indicate robots. Stay away. It's no charlestoning here

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, that's all  Uh  I don't know what else to talk about  Let's talk about the new fitbit the charge five. Do you have one?  No, no, it's just launched today. Oh, you wouldn't have one so soon

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you like it? Let's  I do but i'm frustrated because google's pulling let's call it a google messaging situation here with their fitness stuff  Yeah, because i'm like fitbit. They've got their weird ties and stuff, which there's news out on that and then they've got wear os  And they've got the fitbit app and the fit app and I don't know where anything fits anymore

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is just like messaging. Isn't it? They just can't yes, they just can't make up their mind. So  Samsung said we're going to stop doing ties and we're going to merge with where we're going to make a ties and slash wear os  That will probably be mostly wear os because it's going to use the wear os store  I have ordered and I will get friday. I'll have it for next week  The classic four from samsung their new watch along with the flip three because I figured I should have the two together  I'll let you know. I've liked for a long time. I had a gear three frontier. I liked it quite a bit  But that the wear watches just were terrible they they they had slow chips in them they had bad battery life bad software with google  It ignored them for years  So at least samsung's putting re-energizing the wear os. They're going to use more modern chips

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It should who's in charge of that os now. Is it samsung or google? Who's going to be the primary developer? It's got to be google

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's got to be google. Yeah, I feel like samsung has capitulated thrown in the town

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google screwed it up  That's what I don't understand. I know and then google buys fitbit  and  Continues with the fitbit line, which i'm sure fitbit fans will be very happy about

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, and the fitbit app and the pebble. Oh, I mean the underlying os on the fitbit  I don't know if it's still they bought pebble pebble stuff  Yeah, I know that you can actually the pebble stuff may be still a ui thing now still because you can still have your watch face  Look more like a pebble  but yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You do have to unfortunately with fitbit you have you know, there's you subscribe right 10 bucks a month 80  A year for the premium you don't have to subscribe. You don't have to but do you in fact, do you want to originally?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, originally i'll check it out again  But at the beginning of the pandemic they offered it for free. So I was like, I will check it out  And it was so bad. I gave back my free version. I was like, this is worthless  It's just cluttering up my screen and has no point. So they're gonna offer  so like  I get many options on my current charge three  I don't know if they're going to pull back features as they launch new watches to make the  Subscription more exciting but right now I get everything I want without a subscription. I have to say it's it's pretty attractive

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  180 dollars, um, it's kind of all soft and rounded  Uh, you know and it it sounds like this is a fairly  Competent competitor to the apple watch which is the king of the hill in this  Uh, at least in the non-specialized fitness watches

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I think they're yeah and they're adding things that they stole like the whoop band in their their heart rate variability score  They're calling it daily readiness experience. So they're they're pulling that from like the garmin in the world. So that's pretty cool  Yeah, you do have to pay for that  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Saturation they're gonna do uh sp02

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And i'm interested because amazon has this and it was actually one of my favorite features of the halo  Which is you could access  Through the halo subscription, which is only four bucks a month  uh all kinds of like  Content from other places and it looks like google's actually doing that here with bar three daily burn less mills workouts  so  Because originally with the google plus the fitness. Sorry originally with fitbit plus  You got really stupid fitbit coached  Workouts and they were terrible. I mean like the whole experience was confusing because you had to open up a separate app  but then you had to talk to your fitbit and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there's a couple of features mix missing from the five that your charge has like the  Uh floors climbed altimeter. It won't have that  Oh, I love my I think that's a good thing to know and it won't have the relaxed guided breathing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you do that? I I never do that. I will say I actually  I bought one a couple fitbits back that didn't have the floors climbed and I missed it so much that well don't get the fives then  Well, I  Now I won't that's kind of a shame. I don't understand why they didn't include it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But maybe that was to make room for other features. They do a lot of other things  Um, and seven day battery life i'm going on a hike. It's fun, right? I don't think anything has battery life apple watch  Samsung watches wear os that none of them have seven day battery life. That's one thing fitbit really has down  Um, I just charge mine every night. I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really? I charge mine like every 10 days. I I have my charger next to my bed and every now and then i'll  You know just stick it on my mind being the apple watch requires

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I charge it every night. Uh, it charges up pretty fast though. You could  Uh, I think quite reasonably wear it all night  It would be still enough battery and then put it on the charger while you got ready  For work in a couple of hours. It would be fully charged again  So I think there's people who do that. I don't like to wear a watch to take you a couple hours to get out of the house  Um john does he wears it a bit? Well, no, so  What do you wake up and go out the door half an hour later? Don't you want to have breakfast? Yes  Yes  Where are you going? Why would you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anytime I leave I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I get out of time. I have a nice cup of coffee. I read the paper  I shower I shave  Brush my teeth

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, we're up to 20 minutes so far

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My I set up my day to begin at 11 a.m  So that I can get up at eight  And still have plenty of time for work and i'm often late. So there  I just things you know what if you it's work expands to fill the time available  If you have three hours to get ready and get out the door, you're going to take three and a half  It's just uh, it's leo's law

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, this is not a democracy. It's just leo's law. It's leo's law  Yep, leo's law

Transcript:  Uh court we talked about this extensively, uh on twit a court has ruled  That proposition 22 the gig work worker initiative in california was unconstitutional  And lift and uber will have to  Have to hire their drivers no more no more  Faking now, of course lift and uber will will appeal and this will go on for years, but  Uh, the reason prop 22 is unconstitutional. There's a little  bit of it in there, which i'm sure the  Folks at lift and uber were very serious about saying the legislature could not  Change this law  And the judge said, you know, you can't limit the power of a future legislature  To change the law that's unconstitutional. So the entire ballot measure is  Unenforceable, which is a bit of a blow for uber and lift

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um, it was also it sounded like it was indeed a constitutional ride too far  It'd be like donald trump saying everything I done. I I i've done is can't be overturned. Yeah, can't overturn it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I think it's I think the judge is right  That was a little bit overreaching on the part of uber and lift tried too hard, yeah  i'm always torn about this because uh  You know in fact, i've voted yes on prop 22 because I was convinced by the ads that uber and lift spent hundreds of millions of dollars  to run  Saying, you know featuring uber and lift  Workers saying look i'm a mom. I got kids. This is the only way I can make a job  I set my own schedule and it works for me and I always think well if people didn't like it  Couldn't they just do something else?  It must work for some people  Or is it the case that the job market is so inflexible that you just got to take a terrible job because there's nothing else you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can do if we've re we've reinvented feudalism  Yeah, where you're so desperate and you have to is that the case you think I mean, that's the same thing with amazon warehouses

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I I wonder like do you have to take we have those?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you have no social safety net, right?  You have kids you have rent due you have to do whatever you can and  If there's enough of you out there and there's a lot  I mean your only option otherwise is just to  Starve and be homeless and plenty of people are taking that option. They're not taking it willingly. Yeah. Yeah  Yes, I know i'm a socialist we move on

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I you know, I I just don't know I mean, um  I understand that  And I guess i'd like to talk to people who say yeah  I had to be an amazon warehouse worker because there was nothing else I could do or had to take a job

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Talk to my brother. Really? He has to be I mean he couldn't like say just go down the street and get a better job like  I don't know. He has a he has a gd and the ability to work as an auto mechanic, but he  Has adhd that's not  uh  What's it called medicated and so he'll  You know he crashed some cars  So now he can't really work in many places that have that and then he has an ethical issue with a lot of the garages

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Shouldn't he be glad then that there is a job that will hire him  Yes, he's glad but he's also like and it pays well

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't pay him well  And he's putting he had to go buy a separate car to put the miles on like he's he's fronting this company that has raised  Hundreds of millions or billions of dollars. I mean so  It works for him is it an ideal job for him  It's probably the best job that he can get at this moment and you know amazon warehouse  He could do that for a little while, but it's pretty grueling work and  He doesn't have health insurance, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I understand it's completely legitimate if you have a job to say I want conditions to be better  Uh, you know, I want more pay that's all of that's completely legitimate  But if it but if a job really like uber and lift driving doesn't or door dash delivery does not make sense  For you economically. I guess there I guess they're just people who have to have to do something that they they lose money at  I don't I don't get it. Um  You know, I confess I voted wrong on that but I was persuaded by the ads that said oh, yeah  This is this is a job that works for me and I wanted those people to be able to take that job

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But well we talked about this before i've talked i've talked to drivers who who would insist that still  Yeah, but work is going to change  Completely, right completely work is going to change profoundly and I don't think we know where it comes out yet  And covid obviously had a huge structure there and I saw somebody complaining  Well amazon was unfair to its competitors by paying  higher salary  well  T.s competitors, so that's good  Yeah, that's a good thing. Yeah  And they changed the marketplace and they changed labor now. They did they have a lot of other things they do badly  And it's grueling as as stacy says and and their health their their safety  Cares aren't what they should be  Uh, nonetheless they raised they've kind of single-handedly  Raised wages around the country. That's important. Yeah  And and and with with you know  One thing we have with my father is trying to get help from him here  You can't get anybody now partly because that's these companies that do it don't pay well and it's hard work  um  So wages are going to have to go up and then we're going to have fear about inflation, but it's time. It's not just

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wages so I was actually surprised because there were a bunch of articles about like  The ferry system here is having a hard time hiring like other places  And they pay really well  But then when you dig into it you realize that to get this job  You have to have like two weeks of training on your own dime to work in the ferry system  And then you have two years  Yeah, then you have two years where you're basically on call where the the ferries  They will call you wherever they need you and that could be anywhere from like near seattle all the way up to like  Bellingham which is like two hours away from seattle and you just have to show up  You don't have a set schedule or anything  you just are

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Basically on call so you don't have a structure, right? Exactly which you have to take your dues

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When you understand that you're like, oh that would be really hard. Like if you have a family for example

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have to point out though  that's how unions worked for years is you had to work your way up through the union to become a  First an apprentice then a journeyman and and there were that was the same kind of thing if you wanted a good union

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Then you had a job for the rest of it. Well, that's true. There was a reward when you were young. Yeah, like well, that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry, stacy  No, go ahead. Go ahead  Well, I just listened to box the the the the the book that leo made fun of me for for uh buying last week  by the author of how is that  It's well, I enjoyed it, but it's really wonky so watch out  Yeah, but it's about the creation of this different economy around the container and it's fascinating  But what I didn't know stacy to your point was you thought that as a longshoreman, let's say  Yeah, you got sent for life. No, you were you were your seniority meant you got hired before the next schmuck  But it wasn't until containers came in that they actually got  permanent jobs because it was the way the union fought  For protection from the technology and said well if you give us real jobs and real guaranteed wages and and benefits  Okay, we'll let you do this  Because you protect our current members same in typesetters unions  Um a lot of this with technology they didn't become  wage paying jobs  Until that was the price that they got for the disruption that they could see was imminent  I was I didn't know that especially about longshoreman

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But once you got the job you could be a longshoreman philosopher and then the world is your oyster  Yeah, yeah  Our show today brought to you by a brand new podcast from red hat and i'm really enjoying it called compiler  They only have two episodes out so far, but i've really thought it was  Uh, uh really great compiler comes to you from uh from red hat. It's hosted by angela andrews and brent simoneau  They're great together  uh, it's very nicely produced  and it it's it's fun because I I you know they say in the in the copy they say  It's a podcast about technology and and how it's changing our lives and big and small and strange tech topics  But really what I gather from it at least from the first two is questions people are asking us around here at red hat  and answers  For instance, I listened to the first episode was should managers code and it was fascinating  They talked to everybody from the cfo  At red hat who says no I manage I only get to code 20 percent to another manager who said  I don't I don't code at all, but  Uh when i'm on vacation, I do the advent of code and I solve those problems. It was really  Fascinating you hear a lot of perspectives from the diverse communities behind the code and it's really fun  Compiler brings together a curious team of red hatters as they call them to tackle big questions in tech like what is technical debt?  That's coming. What are tech hiring managers actually looking for?  And do you have to know how to code to get started in open source?  It's really  Fascinating. Uh, it's fun. It's a quick listen. They're not very long. They're about 25 minutes. I'm jealous  But I think you're going to really enjoy it  Like the first episode as I mentioned should managers code  talks about well managers maybe should manage but then some managers really love to wade into it and  you know, uh it started as an internal email discussion at red hat and  Became a very interesting, uh much more  In-depth topic than I thought it would and what's great is it's very well edited very well produced  So it's fun to listen to and you really get the information in there in a very quick and digestible  manner  Red hat has done another great podcast compiler  A demystifying tech one question at a time  The first episode just as I said just almost just came out august 5th came out now  They have a second episode  You'll find it everywhere apple's podcasts or wherever you get your podcasts  Of course, it's on the red hat site as well  It's really a great show.

Transcript:  Big news for san francisco's  Starting august 24th. You can ride in a waymo  Their first ride is they won't take you downtown  They won't go they won't go anywhere. If you've ever driven in downtown san francisco, you know why you need to be a trusted tester  So I don't I don't know how you get to be a trusted tester  But for the first time san franciscans will be able to hail an autonomous ride  In one of their all-electric jaguar. I pace vehicles equipped with the fifth generation  waymo  Driver, they've been doing it in phoenix for years. In fact, i've been watching videos and people pardon me  Where is downtown san francisco? So down by the financial district where the high rises are at least I looked at a map  I may be wrong. I should but I looked at a map of what they were serving  Actually was an interesting map because it compared that to where most uber and lift rides are  And it's neither the ever the twain shall meet almost everybody going in uber and lift is going down to the you know  Pier 39 the wharf the financial district the embarcadero and the waymo  By the way, I don't even like driving down there and i've driven that for years. No, I I was just like, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder I wonder where like i'm thinking about like oh soma or

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somas on the market's fine. Um, I don't know you'll have to I guess you'd have to look at a map. I'll look at the map. Yeah  But if you want to go to uh, golden key park, no problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's buses the bums the construction. Yeah, it's not easy. Although I haven't been down there in two years. Presumably. It's different

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, well, there's more of all of the above  I guess is the answer

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you ever this the ultimate answer to prop 22?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe it is  Maybe it is do you ever get to san francisco anymore jeff?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do they do they require a test or anything? No, because you're flying it. No, no to go into hawaii  Yeah, but when going to hawaii we had either have a test or a vaccination uh proof of vaccination  Really? Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, well good. Yeah, good. Yeah, i'm still having fits that my university  Is not mandating vaccination for staff and faculty and other universities like lehigh and columbia and places that care about their entire community

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They should mandate that I understand there should be exemptions for people who can't for medical reasons get a vaccination  Always a case, but jeez it's pretty close. Yeah  Google is shutting down the android auto phone app  Good, it's a pain in the butt. Yeah  I love the android auto experience in my car on the screen of the car  But I using it on your phone is I think it's dangerous  There is an assistant driving mode  uh in the google assistant  And so that is to replace it  But uh, and that's a little I think a little bit more, uh judiciously designed. I didn't never like that android. I don't know how i'm with you  Google meet  Will now warn you when you're echoing  I love it. That's a good feature

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  called the slammer the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Slammer b feature jammer b jammer b. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you're you're not going  here's the uh  Here's here's the the warning you'll get they'll say the sound from your speakers is picked up on your microphone and causing echo for other participants  So here's the recommendations  Use headphones, that's my recommendation lower your speaker volume or mute yourself when not speaking  Um, so good. Thank you google for adding that no more echoes in your google meets we use google meet a lot  We use it for all our staff meetings our editorial meetings all that stuff. Really? You're not using zoom for that. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't I think we're you know, we're we pay for google workplaces workspace whatever they call it  So figure it's part of the deal. You gotta use google stuff. We use I mean we have slack  We could do with slack. We pay for slack  But I have a jitsi server. I set up which no one uses

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm intrigued by like what the rationalization of workplace tools would look like, you know  If you have slack and teams and a good I mean a zoom account, right?  And these are not uncommon like how sure how is that going to happen too many choices post pandemic. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's gotten it's a little complicated because when you're dealing with  You know on a sales call or at outside agencies or  other people  There's a little bit of a tug of war between who use who sets up the meeting and who which set you're going to use  So we have to support everything because sometimes they want zoom. Sometimes they want crazy stuff, you know  Like blue jeans like blue jeans, baby. I've done blue jeans calls. Yeah  I like blue jeans. No, I think blue jeans is actually pretty good  I like gypsies terrible. Okay  It sucks so bad. I just didn't want to say it out loud  Um, no, I don't I don't have it. I don't have a strong opinion.

I don't use chrome. I'm using firefox  But everybody you I know jeff you do and you love your tabs  Of course, I do now you can save tab groups  In one quick option and save group toggle would be added to each group's drop down menu  So you can save the group so after reboot it returns

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How prevalent of an issue it really is google. So google does a trans regular transparency report  This time I think for the first time  They first time they published their oh, sorry. Yeah. Well, go ahead. No, that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the first time they published their uh data  about geo-fenced warrants

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The figures reveal that google has received  Thousands of geo-fenced warrants every quarter since 2018. In fact, it's one quarter  Of all us warrants that google receives. What is a geo-fenced warrant stacy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is when they ask basically for people of interest in an area where like where  Send us the people who were in this area a crime that a crime occurred based on their

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Self-own location data. So if there was a robbery of a  As there was just the other day of a local beauty store  In petaluma  The petaluma police might go to google say tell us everybody who was in five within 500 feet of that store  At the time of the robbery and that would net in everybody innocent and guilty alike and maybe not even the guilty

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and  When you're a victim of such a or when you're  When your data has been compelled google will let you know that the police in this area have  Sought data on your phone  Here's my my daughter's home, but they don't tell you why or what they just give you the police information police department's contact  And then you're like, uh, what is happening? Am I in trouble? What? Oh, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can see on the the graph on the transparency  Report this just shows you the growth in this the graph starts at zero in this first quarter of 2018  Ends of course in the fourth quarter of 2020 and it's just stunning growth  um just  And by the way, mostly local  The red is state jurisdictions. The blue is federal jurisdictions  So the the states have really number one state for geofence warrants, california followed by texas  florida michigan georgia virginia illinois  um  yikes  yikes yikes yikes  So i'm glad thank you google for being transparent about that  One quarter of all the u.s warrants they receive thousands a quarter

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so now we need apple to publish this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah  But I don't think apple has the same kind of uh, in fact, I don't think apple  Could respond to a warrant like that google has mad I guess

Looks like the old nest cam  It does this is uh, i'm trying to give y'all here's a can of lacroix for context  Oh, they actually this is heavier than the lacroix how does it compare to a waffle?  Oh, that's a good question so a couple things to note  And I also have the doorbell but I didn't bring the doorbell in because i'm going to show you the pictures that the doorbell  Showing me so you can get some some image quality action happening

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what's what's improved on this higher resolution something like that or um

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this is their first refresh so these oh batteries. That's the big deal. Sorry  That's the new news. You don't have to plug it in anymore. These are all battery powered  You can plug them in and they will have wires, but you don't have to they are 179.99  Google also added this you see how this has a green light right now. Yeah  Um, it flashes when i'm actually so it's the green light says it's processing something  And then it'll flash when you're looking to let you know that i'm looking at it directly  So i'm i'm about to go look at it directly and we'll see it flash

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I always take that over so the bad guys don't know i'm watching them

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's rude

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what do you mean here? I am watching they're on my property  The hell with them  I have I have a lot of these cameras. I actually like them quite a bit

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they're really great. Um, so here now you can see  The inception that is oh neat my office  that's nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's actually looks pretty good. That looks like good quality. It's really nice. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, it's a little there the motion sensors in the bottom  So if you have your this there is a definite up and down in this camera  Down here, you can see where you plug it in

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although if you want there is a setting that you can say I mounted it upside down  So that is a setting which is good. Yeah, beat me to it. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the other thing that is notable here is that it has more on-device ai  So locally it can recognize nine object classes including people pets  packages  Cats dogs other stuff. I don't remember the others. It would be great if it could say hey

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I spotted a waffle at 12 o'clock. That'd be so cool. Can't recognize waffles. Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Of how big that lens space is stacey. Is it bigger than a waffle or smaller than a waffle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's smaller than a waffle

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It depends on the same size as the old nest cam because it looks bigger

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think that's just an artifact of it. No. No, it really I think it's bigger than the original nest cam  This is there. So this is an indoor outdoor cam. Okay, so  And you know, here's the kachunk

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know I love that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's how does it not get stolen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you got a video of somebody stealing it basically

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you I mean people could steal it if they wanted to they just steal this part  But then they wouldn't have all kinds of other things they need and you'd have video of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they'd be in your yard doing it. Plus you could also just knock it down from the side  And you just you know, I thought about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If somebody were going to invade my home they could go around and unplug it although now with the battery that wouldn't work so well  Or they couldn't you know knock it down. I put them pretty high so they're not

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know easily reach. Yeah, you don't have them too high with the battery ones because then you got to recharge

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no, no, that's why yeah, but I might have mine are the old ones that I'd be plug in

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is the same design that is not attached

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The bird that knocks on the wood of my on my house

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, this would be good for that just stick it up. Hi, um, and you can always put them inside  um, I found the app experience  a little slow I found the  The actual design of the app a little weird like, you know, you've got your history  You've got your live view. You've got the current view and then you have to like  It's not exactly as intuitive as i'd like it to be  I thought actually seeing  The camera to my google displays was actually super fast. It was like two to three seconds and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah  How quickly if you get a notification, I mean  Does the notification come right away if somebody comes up to the camera or whatever? Is it pretty quick?  Like if you turned on the if you got a notification and immediately went to the camera, would you see that act in process?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here here we'll set because it's not on right now i'll do okay i'm i'm motioning the camera now it just turned on yeah  And it's confused now i've stopped  And i'm not getting a note of hey, oh it's because it's not a person hold on sorry  I have a different setting up. You're not a person  All this time. Well, it only saw my hand. It doesn't know that i'm a person

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  boy  She's a mom i'm the tesla bot. Okay, here we go. I'm gonna tell it it's a person

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We  Let's see if that worked  The last when I was testing it like in life  I was actually walking in front of it as opposed to just doing this thing. So this is not the most accurate test  Okay, it's not giving me anything. It doesn't recognize me as a person at this moment  but it was

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can you see yourself in a mirror stacy? We've wondered

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm just looking and I can eat garlic. I'm looking at my front yard  I just saw somebody walking in my front yard and just checking  To see you get sound you can talk to them. It's nice. I like it. I'm a fan  You can have zones so you don't get notifications like this is a good example  This is the street that goes by the house. I don't want notifications people drive by but if somebody's in my drive  I want a notification and in fact, they even have different notifications through different parts of the driveway. I like it  Now this is the old one  I presume the new one's even better

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, I don't know if you should I mean like I get frustrated by the the subscription fees and all of that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they've fixed that a little bit because you get one now one fee and I have many cameras  And you just get one giant fee. This is where the cats usually  Walk around nice. Yeah, that's the backyard pretty. Yeah  You have a nice backyard my friend. Yeah. Well, you can't do anything on that hill is too steep, but uh,  You can look at it and then actually this camera we was the first one we got because that right there is our neighbor  Who used to come down here and kill these trees? So I want to make sure I had a video record  Of the guy why did he kill those trees? I think they thought they were blocking his view or something. I don't know  But we didn't know it was him  So I wanted a camera but somebody stripped the bark off in a strategic fashion on some of these trees up here  And we figured well else right?  Did you stop them? Uh, yeah, we uh, yeah, we stopped him  Let's say mr smith and mr wesson stopped him shall we put it that way  We live in uh  In the wild west wild west  You threatened your neighbor with a gun. I didn't actually threaten him with a gun  Lisa said I have a gun  And i'm not afraid to use it  Okay, you know what it's not the first time our neighbor said oh, yeah, we had to call the sheriff on him  He kept coming on to our land, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just I just don't know, you know how much uh, these ceos and president biden are going to be able to do  But I guess committing 10 billion dollars is probably  A good idea they're gonna expand zero trust programs help secure the software supply chain very important  Enhancing open source security. They're also pledging through google's career certificate program to train  100,000 americans it feels like it support and data analytics  Including data privacy and security  So good good for google for doing that  They've got the money.

Transcript:  Um jeff, do you have a number yes, I do so last week we talked about how  Wendy's was opening up all of these ghost kitchens. Yeah, and the power of real estate related to junk food goes  Well this week my friend rafael ali skiff reports  that  Among vc funded startups  There's a soaring  cost not of rent  but instead of airbnb  As their leases are expiring they're getting rid of their office and they're instead doing meetings and they're spending money on  travel  Wow  And it's and I think it was somebody I forget who now argued that this is a um  Portend of things to come real estate business  The option ain't over there man after after a code bit who would have thought that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It wasn't we work that had capitalized on this but airbnb

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly what what skiff says. Yes, you would have thought that a bit about the the workspace, but no  Instead they're going to save a fortune on rent. They're canceling leases. Why spend all that money?  Yes, we'll get the team together and we'll make it fun. Actually. I hated those kinds of  Events. I think we had to be ready to work, but that's fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If they had a conference table on a little airbnb on the beach in hawaii, I would probably be

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We did ours in carmel and that was very nice. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. What do you mean? We just you and andrew had a conference. No, no, no, no, like a giga. Oh, oh yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When we did the we did the corporate retreats for like fortune. They were just in new york and they sucked. Yeah, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mine's not a pick but a little bit of a warning. I remember when I was a little kid  I got lost in the woods my sister and I got lost in the woods. We  We got very thirsty and  It was getting dark and we finally we found a house  And we knocked on the door and we said I can help us we're lost in the woods  And the lady pointed the phone. She said yeah, just go ahead and use the phone to call police  And I said, what's the number? She said six seven four five  I thought well, i've never heard of a four digit phone number, but I guess it was a small town and that's all you needed  I've always dialed seven digits, you know  three three three one two one two  Well pretty soon you're going to have to dial 10 digits  Uh, in fact, you should start today getting used to it  FCC is announcing this and it's kind of an interesting reason  They want to give the suicide prevention hotline a three-digit number  Easy to remember easy to connect it will work everywhere. But as soon as you do that  It means that dialing an extension is going to be you know, 988 and four digits is not going to work in a lot of areas  So beginning april 24th, it says you should begin to become accustomed to 10-digit dialing  Start dialing the area code for years. I thought we had to  Well, you might know it's because you and I were in places that yeah, because in texas we had to as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I know it was new york. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah in here in here in petaluma you could dial the seven digits you'd get somebody even on your cell phone you could  It worked fine party line, too. Wow  I didn't realize you city slickers had it different  however  You should start dialing 10 digits because october 24th  All consumers must dial 10 digits for all local calls  Uh on and after this date local calls dialed with only seven digits may not be completed a recording will  Form you your call cannot be completed completed as dialed. We've heard that you have to hang up and dial again using the area code  And then the 988 number  Isn't going to actually be in effect until next year july 16th 2022

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, uh, is it possible to put things in your phone book with only the seven digits? Yeah  Really? Yeah  Because I was going to say that means you have to reprogram your contacts for the contacts. I don't have that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're right  Well, the other weird thing about this is that everybody having cell phones and people moving around area codes have been meaningless for a long time

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so now basically every phone number is a 10-digit number now. I don't know if this is everywhere  The fcc acts like it is these are the 82 area codes that currently permit seven digit dialing  But they also use 988 apparently as a central office code and that's why they have to  Change and so I see california 707 is in that that's our area code  But you know many states welcome to the future  You guys have been dialing 10 digits all this time and you didn't tell me  Well, yeah very

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't know about this. I feel like this is gonna be very poorly understood for it to show up on october 24th

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why haven't I seen more? It's a public service announcement from leo laporte and the twit network job leo  ha  You're gonna  ha  So phoenix warp one says I never dial it any more than seven numbers and I live in new jersey  Let me see if new jersey's on the list. Yes, it is in the 856 and 908 area code only. However, 908  That's mine. Well, guess what you didn't have to dial 10 digits, but now you do  All those wasted digits  Hey, thank god. We got to push push button dialing. You don't have to go  That was slow  Sorry, stace

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, no, I was gonna say if you tried to call anyone in new york though  You would have had to do it regardless. That's right two one two seven one eight or seven eight
