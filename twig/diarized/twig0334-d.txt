Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Facebook comes out with a year end top stories of the year.  And so we go through your status updates, your post.  See if I mentioned it.  See if you mentioned it. Yeah.  Yeah. Doing very primitive matching.  And you didn't. I'm proud of myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is this is a award worth winning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, on Twitter, it looks like you mentioned a couple of them.  Oopsies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oopsies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Star Wars. Star Wars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that was I was I was mentioning when they sold the digital collection,  not the movie.  Yeah, that's true. That's earthquake.  Paris. Paris. Yeah.  Well, yeah. OK.  And what do you guys think about 10,000 character tweets  coming soon to a Twitter near you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Weird, weird, weird.  It's not the Twitter. It's medium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it changes everything.  It changes everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do you think it's Ev Williams envy on the part of Jack?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or no, I think it's I think it's content and article and advertising, thus envy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What does that mean?  They they want to how would this help that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They want a place to get more engagement and time to put advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're not going to get 10,000 character advertisements.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, well, actually, oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No advertising. Yeah.  More time spent with content.  I think instant articles are like inside Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. If the art if it carries,  if if it's like AMP and instant articles and the publishers content is  the way the way. Oh, if I click on a link and it's right there, because  then then I'm OK with it.  But the AMP should do that without without this.  If instead a tweet is replaced by this, they don't want you to link off.  There was another link dead  because links should seem instantaneous.  But AMP itself would do that without the need for this change in format.  So I don't get that.  But I understand the need to say when I click on a link, baby, I want there.  And I don't want to feel like I'm leaving Twitter just like Nuzle.  When you use Nuzle and you go to AMP content, you don't feel like you're  leaving Nuzle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, but Twitter has isn't Twitter part of AMP?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, it is. That's why this puzzles me,  because AMP content should appear like that.  Now, if that's what this is, if it's just just open a page,  I'm cool with it because the publishers ad is there and brand is there  and everything is there.  And the experience for the user is better.  But I don't that's not what this is.  So, in fact, we're still specular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We don't really know what it is.  Yeah, we don't. Willow Ramis, who's been doing really  knocking it out of the park lately at Slate, said they're not raising  the character limit.  They're becoming a walled garden.  And his point being, which I think is a good point, similar to what you just said,  is instead of people could always post long articles on Twitter.  You post a link.  But what it's encouraging you to do instead is not post a link,  but in fact, put the article on Twitter.  And that becomes then part of Twitter's walled garden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if it's like instant articles and if I get an ad there and if I get some data  and if I get some other things, right, as a publisher, I wouldn't be opposed.  If I'm expected, however, to publish my stuff separately  and and to publish it on Twitter and I and I can't put my ad up there,  then yeah, then I'm unhappy.  So we don't know yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So according to Jack's tweet, the only really know is what  what Jack tweeted, right? Right.  And he compared it to what people are already doing, which is posting pictures of text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, see, that's what I really like.  Will's taken Slate the idea that you're not, you know, clicking on a link,  that the link just kind of gets sucked in as whole articles there.  But to me as a user, there's a big difference between me,  you know, containing an entire tweet storm into one post  and me linking to one of Lynn's articles.  Right. Like one is something that I've written  and one is something that someone else has written that just kind of got sucked in  or is being displayed there. Right.  I mean, as soon as you get into a place where someone, you know,  the user can type 10000 characters, you're looking at an editor  with formatting and placing photos and video go.  I don't know. I don't know.  I mean, you're looking at a full blown.  Editor like a medium.  I don't know if they're going to do that.  That seems weird. It seems strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  On Twitter, as Lynn said.  That's what Jack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, Jack seemed to indicate like, hey, instead of taking a screenshot of this text,  you could have written this text right here on Twitter, which is different than  I'm just going to, you know, instead of linking this article,  I'm just going to pull it in right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This I have to say that Jack's tweet, which I'm showing here,  which is a which is a picture of text so that you can do a long tweet  is strikes me totally a spin.  Not not really  to the point, but merely spinning it.  What if the text that people are already putting in here as pictures  were actually texts that could be searched, could be highlighted?  That's more utility, more power.  A platform, more platform, more well, more prodigy, more.  He says, and I love tweet storms, those won't go away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love the little autocorrect red doodle under there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, no such word. Sorry.  That's one problem with that, by the way, as screen capping  text, you get you get the operating systems complaints about your spelling  and the cursor and the cursor. Yeah.  Well, we know he's using a Mac.  So. So what, Lynn, do you think you kind of this is not Twitter anymore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it becomes a publishing platform, right?  And not just, you know, because when Twitter started, right,  the argument was always is Twitter about what I'm doing now  or is Twitter about sharing news? Right.  So but this takes it in an even entirely different direction,  where it's more of medium, like Gina said, right.  No publishing platform.  I don't I don't think it's just about getting instant articles.  I think it's about adding more context to content  and having more SEO power and more of a wild garden  and doing doing more of a Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is a more of a this is a big pivot.  This isn't you know, Jack would have you believe.  Well, no, it looks the same.  You still have 140 characters.  Now there's a more button or a dot dot dot something to indicate.  There's more text you can open up.  It's not it's going to be the same but better.  No, this strikes me really as quite a pivot for Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, Lynn, what would you tell your clients about how to exploit this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, good question.  That's a that's a that's a tricky one.  I mean, for brands, I mean, it could be.  And the thing is, is if people spend more time with people,  going to spend more time with less stuff,  that's what definitely ends up happening.  Like now, when you look at Twitter feed, you go through things really quickly.  Right.  So now you'll be spending more time with less stuff  so that less stuff has to resonate in a better way.  And influence is going to change what influence works on Twitter, too.  So I think what I would recommend to brands is  it's not even like, I don't know, it just changes things so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You have to think of Twitter as something different, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like I don't I can't even think of what the strategy would be at this stage.  I have to really see it because is it is it like when you see it,  will you see 140 characters and then if you want to see more, you click to see more.  You know how some sites now to see the rest of the article,  you click to see the rest of the article.  Is it an instant article type of thing?  Is it is it really is it going to be like medium?  And if it is going to be like medium, then brands do definitely have to start  thinking about being more content publishers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I in my opinion, if.  So it's just no question that Twitter is 140 characters, period, that's Twitter.  It's defining. So this is the defining character.  It is the defining characteristic period.  So if you're going to be a brand, you're going to I would say continue to use Twitter as you had.  I mean, I as a Twitter user, I don't want a 1500 word article from a brand.  I want a short tweet, a picture.  That's what Twitter is.  On the other hand, if you're a new it depends on the brand, doesn't it?  So I'm thinking Kraft cheese.  But if you're a news property, Jeff, if you're Washington Post,  how would you use this? Would you put an article there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. I mean, I think, well, again, depends on the business deal,  depends on what your ad and your data and your brand looks like.  But people are going to come to our sites anymore and we have to go to them.  So this is like Facebook. Use it like medium.  Like it's an article.  I think it's maybe instant articles jealousy.  Now, if I'm Google and AMP looking at this, you're right.  Twitter was a partner in AMP.  AMP does this with a plain old web page.  It doesn't create walled gardens. It keeps the open web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How would so if Twitter wanted to support AMP, how would they support AMP  and still accomplish this with a link to an AMP page?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To an AMP page and the AMP page just opens up.  It won't open. And you can do it modularly.  You could create an AMP module so it opened up in a Twitter client.  Oh, it could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it could Ajax in an Ajax fashion kind of swoop open and then you'd read it  and then swoop close. I would like that as an interface.  That would be nice. Maybe that's how we don't know that that's not what we don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's not it. And that's just a but that's the reason that we know that's not  AMP is because it's not just a there's not a 10,000 character limit on.  Oh, it could be a web page. Web page.  Period. You know, we've got we've got a confluence of a lot of things happening here.  Right. A lot of this is about people aren't linking off because they're just going  through streams. You know, the like and the link and all that is being less in some measure.  We have ad blocking causing huge issues. We have just plain too much effing content.  There's just too much, too much repetition, too much of everything.  And so, you know, the confluence and mobile mobile changes the experience.  You don't want to link off. It changes that.  So we're seeing some struggling with trying to figure out where the web goes.  And this is this is a fight of different visions.  None none very well gelled, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you look at what Twitter does with embedded tweets, it seems to me like what Twitter wants is for the news to happen on Twitter.  Right. Like they want the comments from the sources to happen on Twitter.  So, you know, sometimes 140 characters, it just isn't enough to say what you need to say or to have that clarity.  So, you know, one way that they could they could support AMP is to amplify the tweet pages.  Right. Like the pages themselves are the source.  And I think that's what that's what Twitter wants.  And I imagine, you know, if I was a news publication, if I was still running Lifehacker, I could imagine, you know,  having the headline and then in the more the like three bullet points of the story, you know, the summary points, you know,  and then the link off to the story. That could be one way to do it.  But I think there's going to be a lot of different ways to use that extra room.  I think we're also going to see a lot of click baiting, up worthy, you won't believe what happens next.  Try to get people to tap on the more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's such a such a departure. Maybe we shouldn't be I shouldn't be quick to complain about it, because maybe it'll be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It really depends on what the experience is going to be like.  We don't know yet. Right. We haven't seen it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mike Elgin just wrote a really good piece on how to use Twitter.  See if I can find it in in which he said you create three accounts, you continue your existing account,  you create an account that is a news feed account and then you create a third account that you pump news feeds into using if this than that.  And then you use tweet deck and you're going to have a live updating news stream.  I mean, it was a clever idea. I'll find the link.  And but I think this might all be this might be up for grabs now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a different. What is the problem that Mike is trying to solve?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He wants to make a dashboard. He says you can basically here's the premise.  How I want to make a news dashboard where I just could keep I can have this open on my screen and and know what's going on in the world.  You can't just put your Twitter feed there because it's all mashed up. Right.  You get everything you get sandwiches, you get up, you know, you get news.  So you make two new things. It's a little it's better than I'm describing it.  But the idea is to create this live stream dashboard of news information.  So you use these accounts as a way to curate that.  And it's a really I think it's a really good idea.  But I don't know. I think that that's based on the idea that Twitter is kind of an enunciator like in a railroad station,  a short enunciator of, you know, like of news stories of headlines.  And then you click those and you go to the headline, I guess.  And what about TweetDeck? Because that's all the Twitter clients are going to have to be redone, aren't they?  Yeah. They haven't updated TweetDeck in 100 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I don't even want to think about what we'll have to do with think up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do you feel like this is Jack Dorsey putting his stamp on Twitter or and maybe his response to the markets?  Being unhappy about Twitter's growth.  That's why it feels like a pivot to me. It feels like desperation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's kind of like let's just let's just really shake things up.  Yep. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It does. It seems like he wants to prove that he's willing to explore.  He wants to do something radical. He wants to make some news.  It was interesting how the market responded to that announcement.  What bums me out is that it just feels that this like all the different social networks are converging upon this like one experience.  You know, everything now is likes, right? Not hearts and likes.  You know, everything the news feed is now curated with while you're away or moments like Twitter, you know, at Twitter and Facebook.  And even to some degree, a little bit medium, we're all sort of converging upon this one particular feed experience and like expression of like or dislike or responses.  And I don't love it. I don't either. I like a diversity of options.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. See, this is an opportunity to be the anti Facebook.  Facebook carefully massages your feed in unpredictable ways. You never know what you're going to get.  Twitter, everything's there.  Let's use that. And that's why I love this.  Mike's article was in Baseline magazine, Driving Business Success with Technology, Baseline Mag.com.  And it was exactly that was like here you go.  Here's what Twitter really is, is kind of the signaling system for what's going on.  And here's how you could use this. And I think an effective way.  But but maybe he did this a few days ago, twelve twenty nine.  So it might be obsolete immediately by the new Twitter.  It's a clever idea. I wanted to set it up.  I was I was ready to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But more characters doesn't solve the organization problem.  I mean, it's still a problem of organization. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, in fact, that's what Mike's solution is, is to create other feeds because your main feed is all this crap is everything.  So you create special specialized feeds and then use them in tweet deck, which allows you to have multiple feeds live updating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't that something you can achieve with like lists, though, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Lists would do the same thing. And I use lists on Facebook for that reason. Right.  Although I think I'm one of the three people that does that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People don't like you. No. Yeah. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  On Facebook, it doesn't work well, I don't think.  I mean, on Twitter, I think it works a little better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think people don't even use this on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I have several lists on Twitter and I don't use them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I made when Twitter came out, when lists came out, I made a ton of lists and yeah, rarely, rarely use them.  I made lists. I made lists because on Facebook, because Robert Scoble said I should.  And he actually I subscribe to some of his.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now he doesn't use them anymore, does he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I don't know what he does. Who knows what Scoble does?  Tech people who aren't dummies is one of the lists that he made for me.  And I'm sure you are all on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was going to say, I hope I'm on that list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's actually some guy named Jason Kincaid, but he hasn't updated it since March.  So how good is that going to be?  Lyndi Johnson is here.  She's what is a Lin Lava?  Lin Lava, Lin Lava on the Twitter.  You still use the Twitter. You're not going to give up.  Oh, this is a good question.  Will you start writing longer articles on Twitter, Lin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't write longer articles on LinkedIn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know. That's right.  You could do it on LinkedIn, could you?  And I know people who do that.  Right. I know a lot of people.  Yeah, I don't care for that too much.  I don't want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, just because you can write a longer tweet doesn't mean that a lot of people will.  I would in a situation where I felt like the 140 just wasn't enough.  I mean, we've all been in a set spot where we have to edit, edit, edit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But this is how you get creep.  And one of the things that's great about Twitter is that you have to edit, edit, edit  and really make a succinct tweet.  But it's also a problem, isn't it?  Because sometimes what happens with Twitter is...  I think your mic is hot, Jason.  What sometimes happens with Twitter is that you look like you had a stroke  because you're so succinct that you have to spend hours.  I have to spend time going, OK, what does he say?  It's like reading a license plate on a car.  P-R-T...  Bright.  It's not fun.  So but here's the thing.  It's creep because what will happen is you'll start writing every once in a while  a longer post and then you'll write longer and longer posts.  You stop doing that thing.  Let's see if we can make it more succinct.  Yeah.  Twitter, do we all agree Twitter needs to do something?  I don't think so.  Maybe about harassment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well, yeah, that's for sure.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's work on that Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And again, organization.  I mean, I don't mind the  the deluge of like everything at one time, but  and yeah, you can use like some of the new new features, the moments, right?  And and being able to dig into hashtags a little easier now.  But sometimes I do wish I had  even the way the threads work, I still wish there was some more clarity to those.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, Patrick and our  our one of my great staff members in the chat room is saying  we need an edit button on Twitter.  And they gave us moments.  We ask again for an edit tweet button.  They gave us 10,000 word posts that maybe you can't even edit.  Imagine trying to prove free to 10,000 word  10,000 character tweet before you press send.  Guaranteed you're going to have a problem in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can't do 140 character without an error.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I sent out a tweet today that got retweeted  and I wanted to edit it so too late.  But yeah, too late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you can't really delete it because by then it's too late  because it's already gone out and it's been retweeted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's been retweeted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're stuck. Yeah.  I have learned to to Twitter is one of those things  where you really have to pause before you press a send button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Definitely.  Many big following.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I would have saved myself so much hassle so many times.  Because what happens with Twitter and we've talked about this before  is you tweet in anger.  Yeah. And repentant tweet and haste repentant your leisure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  These are the problems of entrenched power users with followers.  What Twitter's Twitter's perceived like what they think  their problem is that there is onboarding people, right?  They want people to come in.  So for them, moments was like, we're going to contextualize  all the stuff that's happening on Twitter to make it easier  to understand for people who are just coming in, because when people  first sign up for Twitter, like if you don't know what Twitter is,  you're not comfortable with it. It's weird.  It's a weird experience.  I mean, even even as a power user, there are times  they're just like, I have no idea what this person is talking about.  Like, was it a joke? Was it sarcastic?  You really have to follow people for a while to get a sense of like  what their style is and what they mean.  And I think that's really off putting to new users.  And that's Twitter's problem is bringing in new users.  So they don't care about our problems, right?  They're trying to solve the problem of equity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You have just come upon a huge insight.  No, seriously, that companies  are often asking the wrong questions or solving the wrong problems.  Instead of solving the problems of their users.  In this case, they're solving a different.  They're solving for a different X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're solving for the potential problems of potential new users,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  non users that are coming in.  Yeah. And that's probably probably mostly because the stock market  is pressuring them to have big growth numbers.  Growth growth. So Twitter is solving for why when they  from our point of view as its users should be solving for X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, right. Well, we're experiencing X.  Yeah, exactly. But they have us already, Leo.  They have us. We're engaged. We're there. We're not leaving. Right. So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So maybe that is the right question.  There seems feels like there's a business school case study here of of of of of  what questions, what problems should a company be trying to solve?  Should they be trying to make a better experience for the existing users?  Or can they just ignore that?  I mean, Amazon would be out of business if that's what they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, you know, well, yes, you got to be doing both in parallel.  You got to be doing both.  It's just that when you, you know, introduce new features for potential new users,  the existing users are going to be like, what is this crap?  Which is what we're saying. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, and developers are going to be saying, what is this crap?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Developers. Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Didn't Jack kind of reach out to developers a little bit?  And even implying that maybe they would support third party clients again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, they're definitely right.  At Chirp, they did a lot of outreach.  Jack said in his screenshot tweet that he would they would let developers  know well in advance, you know, to stem any sort of developer freak out  at the, you know, the idea that that everybody's got to make their database  fields, you know. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, with this, you're a Twitter developer.  Yeah. I mean, that's what think up is.  Would you expect and want an API modifications to support this new feature?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I would expect that they made the announcements,  you know, that they gave me a heads up about what the API changes were going to be.  So the day that they turn this on for everyone, my app doesn't break. Right.  And Jack hinted that he would do that.  So, yeah, I would definitely I would definitely expect that.  The API is defined as like when you when you request a tweet,  you're going to get up to this many characters. Right.  It's a complete change.  And you write your app, assuming that, like according to the rules of the API.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So overflow buffers everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. They're not going to change the API without giving giving people a heads up  or versioning. Usually version them out. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's an interesting and they implying or the this  the stories are implying that this is going to happen in like in the next couple of months,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  like more next few months. Although Jack seems as that's  Jack said that they're exploring internally and they'll let people know.  Yeah. Right. Like so this could be just like a labs thing that never sees a light a day.  But read the report was pretty occurred.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Got it pretty detailed.  I think that maybe what's going on right now is Twitter's listening carefully,  I hope, to people and their reactions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, the thing is, though, the whole thing with how startups work in this focus  on acquisition versus retention, I mean, it costs so much more.  Twitter's no longer a startup, Lynn, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Can we treat this as a startup that's still after eight, ten years, whatever it is?  Ten years now. Ten years this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, Jeff's back.  This Leo. What is Jeff saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He's rebooting his pixel. Oh, he's going to go to Skype now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm not. No, I'm not.  I'm now on I'm on a little Asus book that I got.  It's working. This is my my brick.  Borked can't turn it off.  Can't do anything. Pixel C. Oh, no.  Yeah. Jason said he was hearing something.  So I pulled out the audio plug, or if you can see it.  And all it says is all it says is waiting for fast boot command.  I can't turn it off. I can't do anything.  OK, anybody watching?  And I hold down the power and I hold down the volume up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We need to reset Jeff's pixel.  See, we need a hard reset.  Matt Cutts is in the middle of his run right now, and he's there.  He's calling you. So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Those salesmen just what I needed now.  No, I don't want your car now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can remove data from your pixel, see, by resetting the charger.  Pixel C plug it in. God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right, Jeff, restart it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So 800 bucks down the friggin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, no, of course not.  You're the you're the host of this week in Google.  You're the author of What Would Google Do?  And now about a town experience gifts.  And you're on the road and you depended on your pixel.  See, and now you had to use some Acer crap.  Thank God you had that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Asus, thank goodness I have it.  So the foot book, which I got before.  And I as a demo unit, I kind of set it back to a little too slow.  Yeah, I tried it again in the store and I thought, well, it's really light.  It's really kind of cool.  So I got one because they're cheap. Yeah.  That's what I'm willing to.  So I thought I'll carry the pixel C for Skype and I'll carry the  foot book for Chrome.  And it's just not making sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There were some wonderful CES announcements about Chrome OS.  We'll talk about that.  Oh, we can't wait. I think.  You know, I think I think.  But first, a word from Squarespace.  You know, Squarespace, we all know Squarespace.  We all love Squarespace.  There's my favorite part of it.  That's the cover page.  And you know what? That's a good I didn't even this was interesting.  So this is their cover page feature.  It takes animated GIFs.  You can use the arrow key, left arrow key, and I'll go back to that.  Jeff and Gina think that was an animated GIF that was created by  Google Photos of just we had three photos taken of us  at Google I.O. a couple of years ago.  And I love having that there.  And I love it that I can use animated GIFs in my cover page.  The cover page has links to my Facebook, my Twitter, my YouTube, my PGP key.  My blog is also Squarespace.  My photo album is Squarespace.  Even my calendar.  And that's just me. If you're a musician and you have a band,  you could put your sell your CDs or your DVDs or whatever it is.  You sell USB keys there, digital downloads, because, yes, every year  a Squarespace template has e-commerce built in.  You can they have a for they have templates just for bands that have  their calendar and sales and it's so great.  They start with these incredibly well designed templates, state of the art  engineering, state of the art design, customize is very easy to do.  You do not have to be some massively skilled person.  Although if you're a real, you know, you like if you like to tweak it,  you can do that, too. There are hundreds of settings.  And if you are a developer, you can do CSS, JavaScript, everything.  So it's all there. They've got a great developer platform.  They have an ID and everything.  But the point is that anybody can create a great site.  And you all should have your own site. Everybody needs to have their own site,  whether you're an individual or a business or a band.  You're you got a newborn.  Edda should have her own site.  You need to have a Web page because that's your place on the Web  that you control. Nobody else. That's your place on the Web.  Squarespace pricing is easy. It's simple, very affordable,  especially when you compare it to how much it costs to like I did,  spend a lot of money to create a website.  Plus, you get a free custom domain name with an annual purchase.  Mobile is automatic.  You don't have a separate mobile site and a separate desktop site  because all their sites are responsive.  They work great on any size screen.  Squarespace dot com. You could try it.  No credit card needed.  Squarespace dot com.  Two weeks free and you can even import content from your old site  so you can see what it would look like.  If you decide to buy all I ask, use our offer code TWIG.  TWIG and you'll get 10 percent off and show your support for this week in Google.  Squarespace dot com. Use the offer code twig.  Yeah, I love that cover page.  Lindy Johnson is here.  She's a digital strategist, weekly columnist for Ebony dot com.  Gina Tripani making her regular visit.  We love her. We miss her.  So nice to have you, Jeff Jarvis. He's in Miami on.  On assignment.  When they say that, Jeff Jarvis is on assignment.  In my trench coat.  Yeah, he's actually puking his guts out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You guys want to switch back? It started.  You want to switch back or no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, good. You got to restart it.  What did you do? I got to restart it.  I just hold it down for a very long time.  Yeah. Yeah, that's been my experience, too.  You have to hold it longer than you think.  Now, let's stay on this.  And then if this fails again.  Look at my... OK, fine. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry. Sorry about all that, folks. I really apologize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did you have to say everything you had to say about Twitter?  Because we can move on.  Yes. Yes. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I only have 140 characters to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's it. You said it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We just we just spent 10,000 characters talking about frigging Twitter.  See, it's too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know what? Yeah, it is too much.  It's starting Twitter's starting to look like twit.  Bloated, big, fat, heavy.  Two and a half hour tweet.  We're going to throw we're going to throw Twitter off the plane.  I was kind of interested.  You know, the boat that we were on,  Royal Caribbean, has very high speed Internet.  They're using a really interesting new technology that gives you like  land like Internet for how do they do that?  They they're using this O3B technology  that is a new satellite.  It can be used for maritime O3B networks dot com.  And they I I gather that the satellite is aiming at the ship.  Like it's a dedicated.  Satellite service, I don't know.  I measured 24 megabits down and five, 10 megabits up.  Of course, it was the middle of the night.  She's wow.  It was amazing.  And but but the point being, I had plenty of bandwidth.  I bought it was $15 a day, unlimited.  And so I bought it for my my phone and my laptop.  And you know what?  I ended up almost the entire time on Facebook.  I was kind of shocked.  Facebook has has won, in my opinion. Yeah, it has.  I'm not wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree. No, I agree.  Talk me out of it.  You killed Facebook, but no, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And in Messenger, too.  Because all my messages were by messenger,  because it turned out it was predictable because I was at sea.  I didn't know if I had SMS.  Wasn't going to use Apple's messages program, which is really unpredictable.  I had been using Telegram and WhatsApp, but Messenger, Facebook,  message, everybody I know has Facebook. It's just easy.  The only thing I found it did a lot of butt dialing.  It was a little too easy.  If you leave Messenger open, it's accidentally it's very easy  to accidentally call somebody.  The bubbles, the bubbles are irritating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Chat heads. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you can turn that. That's because you're Android users.  You don't get it on an iPhone.  You could turn that off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I should turn that off. Yeah, you could do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And actually, it was weird because my daughter's on an iPhone.  I was on actually this was earlier.  I was on an Android phone and her chat had had snow in it was snowing,  which I thought was kind of cool.  And I said, your chat had a snowing.  She had no idea what I was talking about.  I was on an iPhone. What are you talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't. So I don't understand.  Was it snowing where she was?  No, no, no. That's Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just you know how they do the Christmasy thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it was just a Christmas.  It was a Christmasy like snow globe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It made her chat bubble a snow globe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Your chat had a snow. What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's exactly her reaction was what?  Dad, are you stone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like speaking English. What? What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I what? And then imagine trying to describe  on Messenger a chat head  to somebody who's never seen one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. It's like, OK, now this doesn't happen on your phone, but on my phone.  Your face is basically suspended above every other thing that I have going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Again, Dad, are you stoned?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not creepy at all, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I actually like it.  I feel like I have  I'm I'm the most embarrassed to admit it,  but I think Facebook has kind of won me over.  Oh, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't want to. I don't want to.  One of the things I want to do this year is just stay in better touch  with with friends of mine. And it's true.  I sort of gave it all on Facebook.  Facebook app installed at all, but I installed Messenger because there  are just certain friends in my life that like they're just they're there.  They're on Facebook and they message me and then I don't get it.  It goes into my other inbox and I don't see it.  And I'm like a dumb. I'm a bad friend.  So I finally came in and was like, I'm going to be a better friend.  And I'm going to, you know, you know, communicate with my friends  about their life events, their marriages and their kids and whatever.  On Facebook. But it was just it bummed me out that that was happening on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you called your Twitter. Friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did. Well, yeah, that was the beginning of 2015.  I just unfollowed everyone because I realized I was following.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, that's a good idea. Oh, that's a really good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was following a thousand people.  And then all this like terrible stuff was happening just in the in the world.  You know, shootings and police brutality and all this stuff.  And I realized that every time I went to my timeline, I was just,  you know, tore up, you know, it would be like somebody's chubby cat  and like this horrible, you know, injustice like next to one another.  It was like emotionally, like really jarring for me.  Like and I found that I was I was looking in bed and I was trying to go to sleep.  It was just bad for me. So I unfollowed everyone.  And then over the course of the year, like slowly started to follow.  I think I follow like 20 or 30 people now. What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, I'm following 2422 people.  And it's right. It's just a created over the last eight years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't use that. I use I use a list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. See, I was doing that, too, but the list is just too far in the UI.  Like it just takes where are they?  They've moved them to the feed, you know, the black homescreen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But if you. Yeah, but if you're using something like TweetDeck  or Hootsuite or something, you can break those lists out.  Exactly. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Make that and say like this is this should be the view, the default view.  When I log in, this is the other thing I just installed my Twitter app.  So I forced myself to use the web version of. Yes, that's what I've been doing.  And mobile. Yeah. So I wasn't getting notifications.  I think I was like, you know, hanging out with my family, my kid.  And I would get like a tweet notification and I would get riled up about something.  You know, and I was just like, no, no, I don't I don't want push notifications.  So, yeah, I kind of went minimalist and it was good.  It was it was it was good for me.  The web based mobile version of Twitter is, you know, is really like the worst  experience. So it made me tweet less, which I think was a good thing.  I mean, you know, and a bad thing, right?  Like there's probably stuff that I didn't share that I could have and should have.  And then there's probably stuff that I, you know, maybe was ill advised and I didn't say.  So, you know, both ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, hmm.  See, this is again, going back to Mike's idea that if you had separate,  you should have maybe a personal Twitter feed, a news Twitter feed.  Maybe it lists would do that, but they're kind of opaque, hard to reach.  You could have separate accounts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I could I could just, you know, I was using the default Twitter clients.  I could find a client that let me that said, you know, hey, just default to this  personal chill, low volume list of people.  And then when I'm feeling like I want to dive into the news and see what people  are saying about things, you know, switch to to the other list.  I could have. But I just was like, I'm going to detox for a while.  And then I just kind of. How about Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do you find it toxic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, Facebook, I really wasn't looking at at all.  And then until I realized that like stuff was happening in my, you know,  sort of friends and families lives that I was missing.  So I asked. So I'm kind of like, you know, and I was piping on my tweets to Facebook.  But that was that was kind of bad.  And so I'm trying to figure out, you know, how to use these different things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wish we had another choice. Yeah.  It's really shaken out to just a couple of social networks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I really like Instagram.  I still have a lot of time on Instagram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There are other choices.  If you're younger, there are definitely other choices.  What are the kids using? Snapchat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  But Snapchat is a one to one thing, right?  Or no, I guess some you could.  You can do it to many. Yeah.  Can you do it like Twitter where like you?  I guess you can. You can have you with stories.  You can have followers, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mm hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Instagram, too. I spent a lot of time on Instagram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Love Instagram because a picture never really makes you sad.  A picture makes the thing I have a very bad.  Jealousy factor.  Yeah. And so and this is a total failing on my part.  But when I see people like you having a good time, it makes me jealous.  It's human nature. It's human nature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When I see other people's perfectly manicured homes, I'm like, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And the thing is, we now know  that everybody's faking it on on Instagram and everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Instagram, Instagram's like a first date.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It lies. Yes, it's a lying liar of lies.  It's a first date.  You comb your hair, you put on lipstick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  First date is a lot of good looking young people.  Let's let's say that.  But there are also like a lot of, you know, cute little kids and pets and.  Yeah, no, I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have to just force myself to be happy for my friends.  This time of year is great because I see all my friends  pretending to have fun at CES, and I know they're lying.  I know they're actually miserable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a happy time of the year.  I'm so happy I'm not at CES right now, you guys.  I have never been at CES.  This probably makes me a terrible tech reporter.  No, no, no, no.  Thank you to everyone who is on the ground at CES doing reporting  and figuring out what the good stuff is so that I don't have to.  Thank you so much.  It just seems like such a crazy circus.  I'm really happy that I'm not there.  And I'm sure that you have some great people from Twitter there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We do. We have quite a few.  We're doing a lot of coverage.  But note that I am not.  Yes.  So I'm happy.  One of the things, though, I would have been looking at is Chrome OS  laptops, of course, a lot of Windows laptops.  And Apple's not a presence at CES, but there are a lot of Windows laptops.  But I think there's some really interesting  new Chromebooks, including these Acer Chrome bases.  It's all in one.  And these are running big Intel processors.  They're core processors with lots of RAM.  Some of them have eight gigs of RAM.  This one has a twenty three point eight inch screen.  It looks like an IMAX.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does look like an IMAX.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I'm really in.  That's one of the things I have to buy now.  I know. Well, but it's cheaper than a lot cheaper than an IMAX.  How much is that?  I don't know.  I'm sure it's better be a lot cheaper than an IMAX.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's got to be right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It has tiltable display from negative five to 30 degrees.  Oh, specs and pricing will vary by region.  But, you know, you know, it's a Chrome OS.  I mean, one hundred seventy nine bucks for their Chrome 11 inch Chromebook.  So, you know, it can't be that expensive.  But I just I feel like that I'm really pleased to see Chrome OS flourish.  I am to lord knows.  And finally get some variation from basically netbooks with Chrome OS on them,  because that wasn't a good solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but I still don't have a perfect machine.  My perfect machine is has as as almost as much power as my pixel.  Not as much as it'd be very expensive.  I don't have to have quite the killer screen.  I do like touch screen.  I want LTE. I want a really nice keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think this Acer Chromebase now it's not portable.  Do you want it to be portable?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, because what I do now is I have to I have an old pixel and a new pixel.  So what I finally do is I put the old pixel in my office at work and my new pixels at home.  And then I was going to carry back and forth the pixel C.  But now I might carry the Aces back and forth because I really need Chrome.  I need a keyboard and Chrome to do what I do for work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So this is a update refresh of their last year's model, which was only about 400 bucks.  So I don't I don't think I mean, it's 20.  It's it's 24 inch screen.  Touch, multi touch.  Yeah.  I have classrooms and stuff, eight gigs of RAM, which on Chrome OS, my experience has been  is fine, makes a big difference.  It's fine, but you need more RAM.  Nineteen twenty by ten eighty.  I I want to see more of this stuff.  I think this is great.  So that's what I were there.  Were there others to it?  Yeah, there were there were a lot of.  Lenovo has a new. Yeah.  Yeah, all that was the usual suspects, right?  The company's Samsung has a Chromebook three.  We liked this Chromebook two from Samsung.  Eleven point six inch display.  Yeah, not so it's a Celeron two or four gigs of RAM.  See, I want to see these medium powered.  I don't want to see the low end.  I agree.  Think pad, third power one right now.  That's the problem.  How about this one?  Let's you choose between Windows 10 or Chrome OS.  And it's it kind of looks like a standard Lenovo.  I mean, it's got the you know, so think pad.  I think that's kind of intriguing.  Thirteen inch thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  An underpowered Chrome OS.  Well, yeah, who wants it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  These come with an I-5 up to 16 gigs of RAM.  That's because, of course, with Windows, you'd need that.  But when you run in Chrome OS, you get all the benefit of that.  I guess two different versions.  It's not like you can do a boot or can you?  Let me look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I came within an inch of thinking, oh, hell, I have to buy an Oculus Rift.  And then I see requires a Windows machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, not only. Yeah, this is really pissing me off.  So, yeah, I ordered, of course.  OK, I guess numerous upsets on this.  First of all, I immediately ordered one.  Six hundred bucks comes in May.  And then I found out I get a free one anyway,  because I was a Kickstarter supporter way back then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, can you cancel the order?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm going to try.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is really great of them.  That's amazing that they're doing that.  I think that's cool. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they didn't need to.  And I think this is kind of response to all the people like me.  Kickstarter people were pissed off when they sold to Facebook for billions of dollars.  Hey, this is our company.  We put money, good money in there.  So this is kind of a thank you.  It's only a few thousand people.  But so I'm excited about that.  But then, yeah, you they you can download a  tester to see if your Windows machine is fast enough.  None of my Windows machines fast enough.  No, you?  None of them.  No. But they're mostly laptops.  So you need you need kind of a gaming desktop is what you need.  You need a Nvidia GTX, I think 790 or better.  You need I-5, but not any I-5.  You need, I think. What is it?  The 4950 or better?  You need it. You need not a monster, but you need a fairly hefty machine.  So I'm going to have to go out and buy a PC.  $1200 PC to go with my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was this. It cost you two thousand bucks.  This is like Google Glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  Basically, it's going to cost what glass cost.  And it's going to make me throw up and I'll use it once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you're doing it in service of the viewer.  No, I have to do it. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have to do it. Yes.  I want to do it. Take them on for the team.  Yeah. Take them on for the team.  But you saw that I didn't bring I did bring a good camera on my cruise.  And I did. I took a lot of iPhone pictures, but ultimately most of my pictures  were that Ricoh Theta S, the 360 degree camera.  I'm really excited about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you see using that just in general life?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's well, I think I did.  You did. Yeah, that's true. You did.  This is general life. Yeah.  I'm using quite a bit.  And I posted on YouTube.  If you go to my Leo Laporte YouTube channel, you can see you can see all the videos.  But what I what I this is it's still not very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now I'm going to friend envy your life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Will you please?  Will you please just envy my life?  Definitely. The quality is not great.  What's great is, though, that you could put this on Facebook or Google.  People were I was loving the reactions in the comments.  People would say, wait a minute, I turn my phone and the picture turns.  Because if you have an up to date phone with up to date Facebook,  your picture will follow your phone's angle and you can look around.  It's very easy to shoot these.  You don't have to pan or anything.  You just hold this stick and you just take it pictures as you walk or whatever.  And I wish the quality were better.  I wish it had an external microphone.  But you know, the next this is the third generation.  The next one will get this guy bumps me over here.  It gets better.  This is the robot bar with robotic arms,  the same arms that are stealing the jobs of American workers everywhere.  Steal a cruises, steal a bartender's job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Two bartenders had to work like that.  Although I'm thinking somebody's got to fill those bottles  that are hanging from the ceiling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. So those arms are reaching out for those bottles and pouring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. So watch, we're going to you order a drink.  This is I loved this.  It looks like an iPad. It's an Android device.  It's running a dedicated app.  Well, we'll turn here. I'll jump ahead a little bit.  We'll turn around and I'll show you.  So you can order you tap it.  By the way, you're wearing an RF enabled bracelet called a wow band.  Wow. It's like jam.  It's a wow band.  And you tap the wow band to the which I did about a bunch of times.  And then and then you can enter in your drink.  And that will be sent to the robot bartender.  So there's the drink that I non-alcoholic, of course.  By the way, adding insult to injury is a four dollar drink.  And then he add an 18 percent tip for the robot.  No.  No. What the hell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Listen, robot rights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Robot rights.  So watch, the robot now has a cup in its hand and it's going to  it puts it down.  This is going to be my cup.  And then it contains it has a container and it goes around and it fills it up.  There's a soda in the back and it's going to get some juice from the  those hanging bottles or booze bottles.  And the woman is showing me that my name is up here and what drink  and what stage the robot is in with the drink is is over there.  And who buses the tables?  Humans have the menial jobs, of course, because they aren't  they don't allow the robots to roam freely.  That would be dangerous.  You gave me 18 percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a regular Royal Caribbean cruise.  Leo, this is this is like this is top drawer stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the reason I went on this boat, because I had to go to New Jersey  to be on this boat, which is crazy, because I went to New Jersey  to sail to the Caribbean.  But the reason I went on this boat is because this is a new this is a brand new boat.  This is like this is their state of the art technology.  Gotcha. And it's very exclusive.  There are only five thousand other people on this boat with me.  But the robot bar, you know, it's not too crowded.  You know, it's not it's not jammed with people.  I love it that you can look around.  Isn't that amazing?  Yeah, that is amazing.  And then you tap your wow band on the bar when the robot's done  and the drink comes sliding out to you.  That way, nobody could steal your drink.  Oh, is that clever?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, very nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I enjoyed it.  Oh, that's a good way to carry there.  What was that? What was what Virgin Mary?  Yeah, I didn't. I was not alcoholic.  It was a spritzer of some kind.  Four dollars spritzer plus 18 percent tip.  Why are you tipping robots?  Is this a bad precedent?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is. It's as bad as as the damn tip jars that are everywhere now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't mind tipping.  I tip very well because I used to work in food service.  I understand.  But a robot is not going to spend that tip wisely.  I'm just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I assume the tip would go to the bus people, but I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I will.  Actually, you every OK.  So this is another fun, fun fact.  And the Royal Caribbean, everything has an 18 percent  gratuity attached to it, and then they distribute it evenly to the staff.  Yeah, that's nice. Yeah, that's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that that works. Yeah.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because, you know what?  There's a lot of people that you don't see that wouldn't normally get a tip.  Like the guy in the bay, but the bottom of the ship shoveling coal  is not going to get a tip.  So you got to give him it.  You know, I think it's appropriate that they spread it out.  Evenly that way.  OK, oh, there's so many stories. I'm sorry.  I shouldn't be talking about my my vacation.  We love hearing about that. I want to hear about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, vacation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ten most important moves Google made in 2015, nine to five Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's an impressive list, you know, alphabet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why are we still calling it Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It isn't because no one knows if we said alphabet this week in alphabet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What this week in alphabet? What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But alphabet was, you know, probably the biggest event taking Google  and splitting it up into smaller companies under a umbrella called alphabet.  Sundar Pichai, I think this is something I think is even more important.  So the Pichai is the CEO of Google.  Yeah, that's huge.  It is absolutely huge.  And I don't think people really pay any attention to that.  Android Pay, this is the year Android Pay came out.  Not such a big deal.  It's a me too product.  Google Photos, though, we have to agree is huge.  Huge, huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was huge. But Photos was around in Google Plus since like 2011, right?  And no one used it.  I think it's a year that they split it out.  Yeah, but the advances.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You know, it's really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The advances in search were amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And where and where Google Photos really shines is ironically is on the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That, yeah, I found that out recently.  I've been I Google found an iPhone that I got to test recently.  And I mean, to me, a lot of the Google products work better on the iPhone.  Oh, yeah.  Except for Google Now.  Google Now doesn't work really well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, because it's not it's not it's not a peer with Siri.  You have to run it in an app, which is too bad.  That's Apple, though. That's not Google.  Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But other than that, I mean, Photos Photos is huge.  Photos Photos is great.  The organization.  It's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I love it.  I wish, though, that they have a search term like for photos.  You'd be embarrassed if anybody saw.  So you could just get them all in one place and delete them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or first date photos and put them all on Facebook.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, that's a good idea.  They could they could refine those search tools.  Android Marshmallow, new version of Android, which isn't I I'd have to defer to you.  Well, yeah, I'd have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I have to.  The Star Wars man.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It wasn't a huge leap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it wasn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wish I had it on my Nexus seven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But those is good.  Two two nights in a row.  I've left my Nexus six P on, you know, on attached to the power and it's only lost like  five percent, ten percent overnight.  Yeah, that's great.  That's huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Flow permission.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Do you think that's do you think users normal users notice that instead of doing the permissions  all at once when you download an app, you get it as kind of like the iPhone does as  you're using the app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think that normal people care or notice it.  It makes me feel better when I'm like, oh, this is what this is trying to do now.  I understand.  I just think it's just better transparency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It makes sense because it's in context.  So you're you see what the permission applies to.  Yeah.  Project five, which I'm loving them using five on this phone.  Good.  It's a good deal.  You get the cheap calling, the free texting, the free data, slow data.  And that data is fast by the way.  It's 3G now pretty much.  At least it wasn't the Bahamas.  So it was you very usable.  It wasn't like this really slow edge stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so I can't remember.  We did the data story on five.  Can you can you have a data only five account or you have to have a phone?  That was something they announced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In fact, it's interesting to mention that that they have a SIM that is data only now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you have to have a phone account to add the data to it.  Or can you have a data only five account?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My sense is that it was for tablets and that you just you just could get a different SIM.  Let me see.  How to set up a project-fi data only SIM with your tablet.  This is an article from Android Central.  You have to be a file.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to have a file account.  So you're in for the 30 bucks a month or whatever it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I see what you're saying.  You have to have an unlocked tablet compatible with T-Mobile LTE.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You have to just have a yes, you have to have your phone first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're right. You can't just get it to only a tablet, at least right now.  Yeah, you have to have a phone.  But you put 10 bucks per gigabyte and fractionally.  Oh, it's good.  It's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just had to check my karma to make sure I had enough to do the show, but it's it's sipping.  Incident. Yeah, this is the karma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like.  Karma's not same idea.  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  These do a moment.  These ficking, ficking, ficking phone companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right, let's get to it.  We've been holding off.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I've been putting it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jeff and Verizon.  Never a love story.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  The saga continues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Never. Never.  No, they never did.  So I had my wife's iPad on it and I had my old Pixel Stereo.  Still on it.  But I had two things on it and I was paid 50 bucks a month for those two things.  30 buck data plus 10 bucks per line.  And suddenly I'm getting it was Christmas time, so we weren't using either.  There was some dormant.  We're at home and suddenly I get data warnings.  You're going over data.  You're about to go over data.  You went over data.  What the hell?  You added or switched the two lines to two iPhone 6s.  Brought a gig of data.  Immediately used 2.6 gigs of data.  Sigh.  Hour and a half on the phone dealing with five different people at Verizon.  Stupid sandwich.  Just amazing.  They have no good process for this.  It's their problem.  So they changed my password.  This is not going to happen again, Mr. Jarvis.  We're all fixed up.  Third time I try to kill the Chromebook.  I can't kill that.  It's back again.  I finally said enough.  I want a divorce.  I put my wife's iPad onto our AT&T account.  I saved a net of $60 a month by doing this.  And I waved goodbye to Verizon.  Well, two points for this.  So at one point in this I had to go on my online Verizon thing and set up the account.  And I had to come up with a frigging password.  So the password I wanted was F spelled out Verizon.  And it honest to God, I swear to truth said bad password too easy to guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Too obvious.  Too easy to guess that our customers would feel this way at the point at which they're setting up their password.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And by the way, screw Verizon, same answer.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  How hard was the pushback when you said I wanted to cancel everything?  How hard did they push back?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, they didn't cry or anything.  They just didn't do it.  So then I got a call because I went to Facebook.  They don't have to push back.  They just ignore you.  There's one nice lady who works in Verizon HQ.  And when you're in big trouble on social media, don't we know, right, Lynn?  Don't you advise your people?  She calls you and says, Jarvis, what can we do to help you?  And I said, what you can do to help me?  She said, very nice.  But your company is the spawn of Satan.  I want a divorce.  I never want to see you again.  The account hasn't died.  I want you to kill the account forever.  Why is it so hard to have that be the standard for customer service?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And why do you have to have half a million Twitter followers to get it done?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  So bye-bye, Verizon.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye, Verizon Mobile.  Bye-bye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nice lady, big guns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  I got the nice lady from Comcast a couple of years ago because I was tweeting and really  unhappy with the customer service, as you know.  And the funny thing is I thought the nice lady was going to take care of me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just please stop tweeting about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I thought, well, this has really changed.  We're from Frank Eliason and Comcast Cares.  When they really did, you know, like they said, OK, let's see if we can fix this.  They've really come full circle now.  All we really want you to do is to stop talking about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do we have to do to get you to stop tweeting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're not going to fix anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We just want you to stop tweeting, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The nice ladies don't get paid enough.  No, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She's very nice.  No, they actually hire people who sound nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, incredibly.  And I didn't want it with no one in this.  I went psycho with no one.  But I did say, I'm at my edge, folks.  This is obvious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you went to AT&T?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was already on AT&T.  It's one of my unlimited accountants.  And I had shared stuff there.  So I just added it there.  And I reduced a gig and I saved money and it's wonderful.  So I'm happy.  I showed Verizon Fios and I'm happy with that all in all.  But Verizon Mobile is just spud of Satan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think they all suck.  Come on, can we just admit this?  It's not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In the AT&T story, there was one friend of mine named Hugo  who's been very helpful through Twitter.  A friend of AT&T.  I just found them...  Yes, they're all problems, the companies, but all in all,  the AT&T people I've dealt with have all in all been nicer  and more competent.  There's a different culture there.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  The Verizon culture is we're number one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  AT&T was nasty until they got the iPhone.  I think that they somehow were influenced by Apple,  whether explicitly or implicitly, to be a little nicer.  And then T-Mobile used to be really nice.  But then...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But then we have a story of the rundown, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  By the way, they had a very big year, added a lot.  I think 8 million customers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've never had a problem with T-Mobile.  I've been a T-Mobile customer even before they were T-Mobile  back in the days when they were OmniPoint.  Wow, Grandma!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I remember Singular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Singular became AT&T.  Oh, right. Singular was AT&T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But of course, T-Mobile is Deutsche Telekom,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  now fully owned and operated by Deutsche Telekom.  For a while, they were kind of a partially owned subsidiary.  Well, I don't think there's anything wrong with T-Mobile,  but I think that they've quite successfully painted themselves  as for the little guy, and John Ledger is so good at  being the Donald Trump of cell phone CEOs.  Telling it like it is, sticking it to the man,  and now we find out, now you know what, he's the man.  Because what did he do, Leo? What did he do?  Well, you remember that T-Mobile offered this Bin John service,  which seems on the face of it to be great.  I mean, it's a complete violation of network neutrality,  but I can understand why no one's ever going to say that,  because they're thrilled because they have no bandwidth,  no limit on bandwidth caps on Netflix and a lot of video sites,  music sites too, like 20 music services.  And I have to admit, as a T-Mobile customer,  by the way, five customers do not get this,  but as a T-Mobile customer on one of my phones,  I freely listen to Google Music and Pandora and Spotify  and not ever think about it,  how is this going to impact my bandwidth caps?  It's not.  There was fine print in this Bin John thing.  One of the things they said is that if you're one of the services  that we provide as a Bin John supplier,  we're going to down sample your bitrate streams to the 480p,  which would be fine on most smartphones, that's fine,  480p is kind of DVD quality.  But the EFF has confirmed now,  and they published an article on their website, EFF.org,  that in fact, there's no special treatment for Bin John providers  that every video stream is now being down sampled to 480p.  So, by the way, this thing is a terrible term for this,  it's almost as bad as net neutrality,  which is called zero rated.  Zero rated means you don't count against bandwidth caps.  Don't know where that term comes from.  So even if you haven't become zero rated by T-Mobile,  you're still going to get downward sampled.  So they, EFF actually tested this,  and they really went through some effort  to make this test fair and objective.  And in every case,  no matter what video you were watching,  you, and by the way, it's not really optimized  or even downward sampled to 480p, it's throttled.  What T-Mobile actually does is just throttle all video streams  and counts on the provider to notice  and offer a lower quality stream.  So all HTML5 video streams, if you're on T-Mobile,  are throttled to one and a half megabits, period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's not just YouTube?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Everybody.  Everybody.  And if you were a provider that didn't pay attention to that,  it would just stutter and stop and buffer  because they don't do any optimization.  They're counting on Netflix and YouTube to say,  oh, I see you're only one and a half megabits  will offer a 480p stream.  Ah.  Which we all probably do.  So what that means is if you're trying to watch  an HD stream of ours,  actually our HD stream, it's 720p,  if you're trying to watch our HD stream,  if you're watching an HTML5 stream,  one and a half megabits,  that's it, that's all you get,  and our stream is going to buffer and stutter  because we don't, it depends who you're watching,  which of our providers.  Ustream, I think, handles that well.  Some others don't.  So it's up to the customer, in our case,  to choose a lower quality stream.  So maybe if you're a T-Mobile customer  that's because of what T-Mobile's doing.  There's no optimization.  The only thing Bin John does is it throttles all  HTML5 video streams down to one and a half megabits.  Period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So how evil is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, how evil is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, okay, I'm going to make an exception.  I'll speak on behalf of T-Mobile.  So, of course, one of the big threats to a mobile network  is heavy bandwidth use,  because you're using the bandwidth that goes to the head end  of the LTE that you're using on the LTE.  And that costs some money,  out to each cell tower.  that cell tower's not going to perform well.  So they have to put more bandwidth in it.  It costs some money.  That's fine. That's plenty.  And just leave it at that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  They're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and they're especially not.  I mean, I'm a T-Mobile customer who has unlimited data, right?  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's also a lie, because they do limit it.  They say...  They throttle it.  Oh, they throttle you at some point.  They don't say, oh, you had too much stop.  They just slow you down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I used to notice it before.  It was really explicit, like once you reach like five gigabits or something like that.  Get really slow.  Right, but I don't notice it quite as much,  but again, with the unlimited, I'm expecting unlimited.  Why am I getting 480p?  I know you can opt out, but they didn't make that really clear at first, up front.  And on the website, it's not that easy to find.  So I mean, for the customer who has the quote unquote unlimited plan, it kind of sucks, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's exactly...  EFF says what T-Mobile should do is make Binjohn opt in instead of opt out.  And they should also disclose that if you opt in,  all your video traffic from every provider will be throttled.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, I'm a devil's advocate.  If I were like...  I have T-Mobile, the coverage isn't great.  It's not very fast in some places.  It doesn't exist in some places.  It's not like being on a smaller network.  There's a difference between the video just stopping cold and the video being lower quality.  I mean, there are some conditions that we're in where the quality is not good.  Jeff's in a hotel room and he's on Wi-Fi and the quality is not great on Skype.  This is kind of part of being in the world.  I may be being a T-Mobile apologist here.  I do think that they should be upfront about that the optimization is actually throttling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think what happened was, if you kind of dissect it,  is they sat down and they said,  John, people are using way too much.  Everybody's watching Netflix now.  It's 40% of our traffic.  We've really got to do something about this.  What we would like to do is just throttle video.  Yeah, but that's going to...  If we say to people, we're going to throttle video,  that's going to be a huge black mark.  And that's the way they invented Bin John.  Bin John is a fabrication to cover up the fact that  which is to protect their network.  But it makes people feel good.  Oh, I'm getting unlimited bandwidth on my Netflix.  That's awesome.  That's what's really happening.  So that's where I have a little bit of a problem.  I'm still a T-Mobile customer.  I love T-Mobile.  You know what's interesting?  If I'm using Google Fi and I'm using T-Mobile,  Fi switches, and by the way, switches instantaneously between Wi-Fi, Sprint,  and T-Mobile depending on which is better and transparently.  So you don't know always what you're using.  I don't know if I presume I'm not a Bin John.  I'm not getting that happening.  I should do some tests.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can you see what cellular network you're on?  Yeah, you can.  Really? It says Sprint, Verizon, T-Mobile?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not in the status bar.  In the status bar, it always says Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you could go into the cellular settings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think so. Let me check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought you tried to and couldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe you're right.  Yeah, I don't think you did.  Why did I think I knew that?  Maybe I don't know that.  You're right. It's not there.  I thought I knew that I was on T-Mobile most of the time.  I guess I don't know.  Yeah, I don't know where I am.  But my iPhone is T-Mobile.  My iPhone is T-Mobile. I like T-Mobile. I'm very happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In Twitter, Brett Schulte says that Bin John is optional  and also says that the unlimited plan is truly unlimited  and not throttled unless there is congestion.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay.  Brett, who is a nice guy, does also work for John Ledger.  Or work with John Ledger.  Consider that a PR response.  Although I don't think he's officially an employee of T-Mobile.  Anyway, I think this is important for people to understand.  Thank you EFF for doing the test and figuring this out.  Are you going to buy a Ford, Mr. Jeff Jarvis?  Oh.  I know Jeff is in the market.  We should set people up if they don't know.  His car is dying. He needs a new car fast.  Well, I think I'm giving up.  Ford says their 2017 models will all have CarPlay and Android Auto.  If mine will last that long, I don't think it will.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, because that's the fall, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  All 2017 Ford models sold in North America

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  with the company Sync3 Infotainment Platform.  I guess they don't all have Sync3,  but if it has Sync3, you will get CarPlay and Android Auto.  And this is really good news.  You could buy a 2016 model now  and you will be able to upgrade later in the year.  Well, I think it's a good thing.  Some people have said that about some models

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I want to see that in contractual writing.  But that's, you know, you can upgrade Teslas.  Why can't you upgrade every other car?  But why?  Well, you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ford will give you, bring it to the dealer.  Actually, I remember my old Ford Sync3.  You could download an update, put it on a USB key  and plug it into the Ford.  I liked my Ford.  I know you did.  Yeah, I'm thinking,

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm thinking about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My Audi lease runs out in the fall.  I'm on the list to get a Tesla.  But Tesla doesn't,  why doesn't Tesla do CarPlay and...  Because it has its own Android, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's got its own thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But see, the story that amazed me today  was that the Ford and Android,  I mean, Ford and...  Did that happen?  Did they announce it?  No, Ford and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google.  Alexa, Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  That Echo over Google  and Echo coming in to be a major part in cars.  That's really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, okay, but...  Okay, I have to read this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that's just the Alexa technology  or you actually have to have that device?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, you have to have that device.  It's not putting Echo in your car.  You can say to your Echo,  so if you have an Amazon Echo, I do,  I can say, start my car.  From in the house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  From in the house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I already can,  because I have automatic on my car,  I can say how much gas is left.  I can do that now.  I can say, hey Echo, how much gas is left?  And it'll say you have half a tank.  So this is just extending that to say,  hey Echo, start my car.  What is the range of my vehicle?  How many miles can I go?  While in the car using App Link,  which means you have Alexa on your phone, I guess,  you can control the house.  But it doesn't sound like the voice recognition  in the Ford is going to be Amazon Echo.  That's what I was originally thinking.  I thought, hey nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I see.  I thought it was like Amazon was going to become

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  the voice OS of your car.  No, there'll be an interface to the Echo, I guess.  Oh, I see.  Well, here, let's see.  Let's see if we can get the video.  Okay, now everybody who has an Echo, turn it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hello.  Alexa, ask my Ford for range and charge status.  You currently have an electric range of 10.3 miles,  gas range of 386.7 miles.  Alexa, ask my Ford to start my car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The start command has been sent to your vehicle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is if you live in the winter areas  when you want to warm up the car, right?  Yeah, sure.  Now, she has the Alexa app on her phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Alexa, ask the garage to open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ask the garage to open?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Please open.  The garage has said no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The garage said no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm sorry, Sally.  I can't do that.  I'm sorry, Jeff.  Are you happy that Mark Zuckerberg has declared  that his goal in 2016 is to add a Jarvis to his home?  You saw my response?  Yes.  You've come right over.  Yeah, that's a pretty cool project.  So, tell me, what is the deal with this?  So, it's every year, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He wants to play with AI.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Go ahead, go ahead, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He picks a project that he's going to do, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He learned Mandarin, he shot chickens, right?  Like every year he does something,  he's like, whatever, he killed his own food.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I like shot chickens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's good.  Right, he produced his own chicken nuggets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's an armed Matt Cutts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, Matt Cutts does every 30 days, Zuck does every year.  So, he announced his 2016 project is to build  an Iron Man-esque Jarvis assistant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  And he said he talked about it as Jarvis.  By the way, just to put this in perspective,  he also says, I'm going to run 365 miles this year,  which is a mile a day.  I don't think that's...  Well, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait, you don't think that's it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You and I should talk, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, well, it's not like I'm running a mile a day.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  But...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, and he's going to, I gather, going to code this himself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He wants to learn.  He wants to learn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Talk about jealousy about other people's lives.  I mean, he also has like a team of some of the smartest engineers in the world.  Could help him out a bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know what's cool about this, though, is that,  so he posts this on Facebook and people respond,  and then he responds to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did he respond to you?  He, within 30 seconds, he liked my comment,  which that was all I wanted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So how big is the team that's liking comments?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's his team.  I know, I think it's him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Come on, Lynn, you consult companies on exactly this.  It's a team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's not going to be able to handle all of that traffic on his own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, but he does it.  He does it very sporadically, is the thing.  He answered a lot of people.  The mistake I make is when I respond to a Zuck post,  it's just killing me for days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, because you get notifications of people liking your response?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that and everybody else who responded to it,  somebody else responded to the same post.  So it's disastrous.  So that's a tip.  Of course, you immediately get the Scoble response.  Scoble was right in there after I was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  See, I would never in a million years think of responding to a Mark Zuckerberg post  like he cares about my response.  You at least know him.  I've reviewed him. Same with Scoble.  You guys know each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Scoble is actually his Facebook friend.  I'm not.  He befriended him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He befriended Scoble, yes.  Wow.  Who on his team did that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We love you, Robert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We love you, just to be clear.  Robert does his own tweeting and Facebooking, I promise you.  There's no team for Robert.  And Jeff as well.  Or me. I don't have a team.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Gina has a team.  Oh, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, my minions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, your minions.  Let's just say I was not building a personal assistant the first year of my child's life.  So kudos to you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, that's a good point.  And he even mentions how the personal assistant is going to help raise Max.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, he said, let him know if something's going on in her room, which I mean, you know, there's like monitors for that.  Like regular people use baby monitors.  Max appears to be drawing a picture on her wall with poop.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, if I could have a smellometer for my daughter, that would be amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That could be done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know what? If Mark Zuckerberg would devote a year of his life to that.  Because you never want to be a baby monitor.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I had the worst day.  Our beloved, wonderful cat is diabetic and not feeling well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  So I walked down.  You don't want to hear the story.  I walked down and she shat on the shit colored floor.  Oh, so you can't tell.  OK, so here's a little tip.  It was a bad, bad, bad way to begin.  Don't buy poop colored linoleum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Does Ness have a poop alert?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pampers should have somebody saying that Pampers Internet of Things.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Seriously.  Google is going to have a Internet of Things Dev Summit this month.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  The Ubiquiti.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would love to go to that.  Geez, with Brillo stuff going and starting up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would be very interesting.  And Weave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like that they're kind of doing separate Dev Summits around like particular things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have this Chrome Web Summit and they're doing the Weave stuff.  It seems like going to one of those might be more productive for a developer who's deep  in the stuff than Google I.O., which is this giant bonanza of everything.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there's a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Would you go to...  You're a developer.  I mean, would you go to something like this?  Would you be interested?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If I had a product that I was hoping to incorporate, would I go for fun?  Probably not.  I would go for fun for something like the Chrome Web Summit.  If I were building a piece of hardware that I hope to incorporate this technology,  I definitely would go.  See, Google I.O., I would go for fun because it's a press event and it's a show.  These things are like they're down and dirty.  You're building something here.  You're going to get early access to stuff.  You're going to have access to Googlers.  I mean, sure, I would go for fun, but I wouldn't book my trip for sure unless this was something  I was building in my life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You could talk to Crispy Uccello, developer advocate.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Look at this guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  His name is Crispy.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nice.  I'm so jealous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wouldn't love a name like that.  Crispy Uccello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That may have been a change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You too can have that name.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Crispy Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mom, Dad.  This would be fun.  This is January 11th.  It's coming up next week.  And there is a live stream.  So you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could watch it.  I would check out the live stream.  If I want to sit down with a human being and say, help me debug this problem, I'm stuck on something very specific.  That's when it's really useful for developers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google paid a board member $149 to buy her company and she's giving it all to charity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  $149 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now I'm impressed.  And her husband is too.  What did her husband say?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  He's giving his money too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's a Stanford.  She's a board member and they basically acquired her to head cloud activities.  So her name is Diane Green.  She's impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She created a startup called Bebop Technologies.  And she in the acquisition, which was $380 million acquisition, she got about $149 million in Google or Alphabet stock.  But she's donating it to charity.  Amazing, huh?  Yeah, it's incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, she had already made her money, but it's incredible that she's doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is, but it also alleviates any confusion because she's also on the board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, there may be reasons why it's a good idea.  But still, I don't want to take away from you.  It's just upsetting all around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by Gazelle.  Our show today brought to you by Gazelle.  If you're getting a new iPhone, getting a new Apple phone, getting a new Android phone, maybe you want the new Google.  I know, I still know a lot of people have a Nexus 6, that big old way-level phone, the Shamu.  And they've got to be eyeing the 6P or the 5X.  This is a great way to sell your old phone, get cash for it, and get the new phone.  It's at gazelle.com.  Trade in your old device for cash or buy a certified pre-owned device.  Now, you can't get a Nexus there, but they will sell you iPhones, the 4S through the 6 Plus.  They'll sell you iPads, standard Air and mini models, and you can get Samsung Galaxy phones there for a good, good price.  In fact, this is a really good time to do it because they're being flooded with old phones as people buy the new phones that just came out.  So you're going to get the best value on certified pre-owned devices.  And there's no risk here.  They run them through a 30-point rigorous inspection process that everything from phone calls, data, everything, but also checking for scratches on the glass, stuff like that.  So they're always in perfect working order and great shape.  Actually, you get to choose what shape you want if you want to save money.  You get a little bit more signs of wear, but nothing serious.  And even then, you still have a 30-day return.  So you're never at risk.  The nice thing is, if you're getting a device at gazelle.com, you're not going to extend your contract.  There's no carrier contract, but they of course will work with all the major carriers, AT&T and Verizon and T-Mobile and Sprint.  I am a fan. Gazelle. I've sold many a device there. It's a smart thing to do.  Why throw those devices in a drawer where they gather dust? You wouldn't do that with $100 bills.  Why would you do it with an old device worth more than $100?  Sell it to Gazelle.  Gazelle gives new life to used electronics.  Trade them in for cash or buy certified pre-owned.  Or both.  Gazelle.com  Jeff Jarvis is here. He's in Miami, visiting the nice warm day in Miami, I'm sure.  Yes, it is. It's nice.  I like the tropics, I've decided. I like humidity.  I like heat. Especially in the winter.  Gina Trapani in Brooklyn.  Thank you for being here.  Her MakerBase has its new URL. You told us this last month. MakerBase.co.  Thank goodness.  No more .se.  I thought that was clever though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was fine for the first month. It was good for lunch.  Then you got to get serious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Then you got to get serious.  Wendy Johnson, consultant, columnist for Ebony.com.  Great to have you back here again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Great to be here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're talking about Google and Facebook.  Project Sunroof has been expanded, which is really nice, because this was a very limited area, but now more areas can do it.  This is Google's way of finding out how much money you would save by solarizing your home.  I've just done this in my house.  1,740 hours of usable sunlight a year.  Lots of space.  They do 3D modeling of my roof and nearby trees.  4,919 square feet available for solar panels.  I could save $13,000 over 20 years.  I already knew this because we'd gone to Solar City.  We have solar panels in our house.  They used a version of this that they only had access to.  Now you can do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a really cool use of technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thank you, Google, again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's in Google's interest.  They're heavily invested in solar, so let's say that.  It's also such an interesting use of their aerial shots.  They calculate whether the trees are in the shade.  They'll tell you if you're not going to save money, which I heard they saw an example of.  Someone's house was in the shade of trees.  I tried my house.  I'm not in the area.  I tried my family who live in North Carolina.  I'm just outside the Raleigh area, so I just want it everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it's not everywhere yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, that's too bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a small matter of data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and what's interesting is that they also have a sponsored listing of solar providers in your area.  And I notice our provider, Sun City, is not on this list because they didn't apparently pay.  See this sponsored right here, kind of hidden away?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  But that's useful still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you should know that that's an ad as opposed to all the solar providers in your area,  because it's leaving out the one that we used.  Still, I think it's great.  If you can unite commerce and public benefit, that's a great thing to do.  Why not?  Think with Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is Think with Google?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's like an insights marketing kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So they do market research and they look at different consumer behaviors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is an article on Think with Google.  Why gamers should be part of your audience strategy?  Do you know how many gaming devotees you have in your core audience?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  So you can, I mean, is it just an article or can you actually find out some of this stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They probably have a PDF report.  Usually they do it with, they do these studies with market research companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, and this is for YouTube.  Yeah.  So the Ipsos says that YouTube gamers are more likely to purchase certain goods than others in the general population.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what they're calling a YouTube gamer is even someone who sits and watches game videos all day.  Like my five-year-old son, he doesn't do it all day, but he does watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Our 13-year-old does it all day or would if we allowed him to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Watches, watches other people play games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  On the cruise ship, I had to take away his iPhone.  He's like, we're in the Bahamas.  You're going to kiss a dolphin.  What are you looking at Minecraft videos for?  But it's just, you know, it's, they don't watch TV.  They, I mean, I was watching Gilligan's Island.  Which is better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is interesting.  So if you, if you're a brand or you have something to sell, this is probably a site you want to know about.  Thinkwithgoogle.com.  Hmm.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hmm.  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it tends to be Google properties.  It looks like this is like YouTube.  Okay.  Okay.  Google has invested in a Berlin startup called Factory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a, it's a, it's a, it's not a big story.  It's, it's a, um, incubator of space.  Okay.  So I've been, I've been there with Lufthansa, their, their innovation hub.  And it's very nice.  It's amazing space.  It's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This was a slow year last year.  It was a slow year for investment and acquires from all the big, all the majors.  Yeah, that's true.  What is that?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What do you think that means?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's nothing left to invent.  I mean, money's not tighter than it was.  I don't think.  No.  Um, did you like the Google doodle?  I didn't see it on New Year's Day.  I missed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was busy.  I didn't either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Tending a hangover.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, I was away from the, from the screens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I didn't get to see it either.  Get it?  Uh, that looks kind of like an angry bird.  That's it.  They're just dancing.  Is anything else going to happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you could click a video.  No, that's, that's the turtles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hmm.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's cute.  Uh, what are the other CES news?  Google partners with speaker makers to put Google Cast in big brands like Bang & Olufsen,  Harman Kardon, Philips and Onkyo.  Um, that's good.  I love seeing Google Cast everywhere.  Uh, I use a Chromecast, I use Chromecast audios on all my systems and of course Chromecast  video on all my TVs.  The audio adapter is really cool.  So this means you don't have to buy an audio adapter.  If you have one of these powered speakers and they're already attached to your wifi,  you'll see them and you can spend, send audio just right to them.  Watch out Sonos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got my first Sonos and I was just really surprised that I can't use Chromecast.  I can't cast here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What is up with that?  Google Music, you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, right.  They support Google Music, but I'm just saying like they're just the cast button, you know,  from anywhere.  And I was like, why is this so clearly very possible and not, not working?  Then I thought, well, I'll buy a Google Cast to plug into the Sonos.  Cast to it and that seemed insane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is insane.  So now really, I think this is a real threat to Sonos because they're very expensive.  Now you can just buy speakers of whatever quality you want.  You don't have to spend $600 on a speaker and put a Chromecast audio on it and it's  great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There was a startup that had a really big kick startup push, a startup called Rocky.  I don't know if you guys know that.  Yeah.  And they were doing something like that.  And I know that they have a great partnership with Spotify.  Yeah.  Helping companies, helping speaker companies to be able to integrate with Spotify.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it's like a little rubber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Little rubber.  And then so with them, what their big deal is, is the data that they get on the other  end that they could probably package up and sell to music companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  See, I mean, in the long run, I think, I mean, so this is very similar to, but it's more  expensive.  It's 49 bucks to the audio Chromecast, which is 35 bucks.  Yeah.  And this works with two things, Spotify and Deezer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Deezer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I would guess that, I would say you're probably better off at this point.  Sorry, Rocky, buying Chromecast audio.  Because it really, I think it's going to be just like Chromecast video where it's going  to expand rapidly to a lot more players.  Why not?  But that's interesting.  So you think that's why Google does this kind of thing?  There's analytic value.  There's useful information they gain from this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I hadn't really thought of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, it's like, how long are people using which services?  What are they listening to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do you think it knows what they're listening to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It might.  But I think it's more about what services they're using and how long they're using them.  How much are they using Netflix?  How much are they using YouTube?  How much are they using?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If your surgeon came into the operating theater wearing Google Cardboard, you might want to  think twice about a surgeon and yet...  I don't know.  And yet, Google Cardboard is now being used by surgeons to perform heart surgery and actually  save somebody's life.  Baby Tegan.  What the hell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What?  Because they mapped it was a tiny baby that had only one lung and a heart that was malformed  and it went into the other side of the body and very tiny, very difficult to navigate.  And so they did a virtual model of the space that the doctor could then...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So kind of like tour where he's going to go during surgery ahead of time.  Exactly.  That makes sense.  We had on the new screensaver is a really neat project to do 3D modeling.  Same thing.  3D printing a physical heart and lung for before infant surgery so that the surgeon  could see what it's going to look like and plan his attack.  I think that's actually very clever.  Wow.  And this is Baby Tegan.  The operation was a success.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So not during surgery.  This is before surgery.  No.  This is one situation where I want glass over cardboard.  I want him to see what he's looking at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, this is really cool.  This was at Miami's Nicklaus Children's Hospital.  And four-month-old Tegan Lexen was successfully operated on.  Wow, that's really great.  I'm excited.  I have to say all of the VR things.  Even just these videos I shot on the ship which work with cardboard or Gear VR or just your phone.  It is a different experience.  The immersive video really is a different experience.  I had kind of had hopes.  I had this fantasy with this Rico that I'd be able to do vlogging.  And if you're somewhere where there's more to see than just you, it's great.  Like on the trip, it was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you would be talking to the camera and people could look around or you'd be just talking.  Instead of just staring at me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The funny thing is you have to get used to it.  You want to aim the camera at what you're talking about and you realize you don't have to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You just hold the camera and then what I eventually said is if you look over there,  see over there, and you just keep holding the camera and they can look over.  It's like you're talking to somebody.  It's kind of cool.  I really like that.  Speaking of Brillo and the Internet of Things, there are finally some products being announced.  The CES is, every year we go to CES and we'd go to the Smart Home Pavilion  and we'd look and it would just be, there's a lot of great stuff.  Nothing talks to anything else.  And you just have to pick one and use that.  But Brillo, which is Google's Internet of Things,  and Weave, which is their language, announced at Google I.O. last spring.  But there are some announcements at CES apparently.  This is from an article in The Verge.  Asus is announcing a Smart Home Bridge built on Brillo.  So presumably it would do more than talk to other Asus products at some point.  Lutron and Insteon.  Oh no, this is Apple's HomeKit.  So Asus says they're going to do more Brillo-powered stuff as well.  Quickset is making a Smart Door Lock.  It connects over Weave.  Marvell is making a Wi-Fi chip that speaks Weave.  That's actually huge.  And Harmon is working with other companies to build Brillo and Weave devices.  So early days yet.  The problem is of course it's not compatible with HomeKit.  Everybody's got their own platform again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sigh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At least Google is opening up the protocols.  But that doesn't mean Apple's going to use them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Home automation is kind of like video editing.  When people start putting video editing out on desktop and eventually on mobile devices,  I thought as somebody who's spent a lot of time professionally doing video editing  and hating every moment of it because it's grueling, grinding, boring work  that takes forever, I thought nobody's ever going to want to video edit.  And I kind of feel the same way.  It's too much trouble to get a smart home working.  But you know what?  Eventually people do.  Now they do video edit.  A lot of kids do.  And I suppose this is the same.  It'll be like that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  As if it can get easier enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm going to get you out of here in 15 minutes.  Is that right, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A little shy of that.  Between here and out.  I'll tell you what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's get you out of here.  Let's get everybody out of here.  We'll wrap it up in a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's cool.  I just got an email.  Charge your Karma battery soon.  Oh, I love the Karma.  We should mention that.  It's charging now, otherwise that would cut off.  It's really an interesting idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's basically a MiFi, one of those credit card sized internet devices  that uses your LTE to become a hotspot.  But it's a pay-as-you-go, which is nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pay-as-you-go never expires.  When you're in an airport or someplace and somebody else uses your Karma,  and don't worry, it's not your data, it's going off elsewhere,  you get a 100 meg gift for the fact that somebody else used your Karma being on  to encourage you to keep it on in public places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I didn't know that.  I've been using it a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's very cool.  Just today at the airport, I got 100 megs because somebody used it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So how do they use it?  There's not a password protection?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, they have a fence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And they have to have a Karma account?  They have a Karma account.  Got it.  And if you buy a head, you can get as low as $10 a gigabyte, if you buy enough of it.  But if you just buy a la carte, it's $14 a gigabyte, and it's based on Sprint,  you can get eight devices on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the Karma app is telling me the power and the connectivity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I really like.  Yeah, I get emails and lots of information.  Yeah, I really like that part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, right now, it says that I'm charging.  And I have, let's see here, I have...  Oh, no, don't do that.  No, my Karma's not off, it's on.  I hope it's on, because if it's not...  So, I'm now down to 16.81 gigabytes.  I started the day with 18 something, so the show is...  To do a show of our length...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  12 gigabytes. Well, I'll send you a check.  No, no, no, no, 2 gigabytes.  Oh, 2? Oh, that's not bad.  It's not that bad.  $150 for the device. It takes a while to get one.  I think they're caught up now.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I think it was worth it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We like Karma. Karma is very smart people, very good people.  It's a social-based company.  I bought it because of you, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm very impressed.  Oh, good, I did have a guest connection.  Look at that.  On October 4th. I didn't even know I had one.  Yeah.  I bought a bunch of data, so I have 12.94 gigs left.  But it doesn't expire. That's the beautiful part.  Yeah, and you only pay for what you eat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you pay ahead...  And if people buy...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And there goes his Karma.  Such a recommendation.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Frozen solid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But first, a word from Thresh Books,  the super simple cloud accounting solution  that saved my life as a freelancer.  It's going to save yours too.  hate the most?  Formatting and sending invoices.  Collecting receipts, tracking expenses,  following up with clients that don't pay you on time.  All of these things are not only a pain in the butt,  they're also the thing that gets you paid.  So it's a weird thing.  If you don't do it, you won't get money.  And that's why you work, so you've got to do it.  Thresh Books makes it easy.  It's like you breathe a sigh of relief.  Oh, thank God.  At the end of every month, I was just going,  I don't want to fire up Word and Excel  and do all this and send out the invoices.  I'd put it off. It means I wouldn't get paid.  Thresh Books was a lifesaver.  I started using it in 2004.  You can mail invoices, but you want to mostly email them  It's a chore for everybody.  They even have this new thing I love.  I wish I had this.  It's called, well, you can request a deposit.  So I was out of pocket on my airfare, my hotel,  Well, now you can actually ask for a deposit in Thresh Books.  Thresh Books will be the escrow  and you don't have to cover costs out of pocket  or wait till the end of a project to get paid.  This is nice.  If you're the kind of person that goes around  doing services and you bill people,  You clean the gutters or you wash the car,  whatever it is you do.  You show your invoice to your customer.  You pop in the Thresh Books card reader,  which by the way works with chip or swipe.  Your customer dips the chip, swipes the stripe,  and you get paid instantly right out of the box.  It's so cool.  and they pay you.  I love this.  And of course, if you ever need help,  they've got the Thresh Books support rock stars.  They are nice people.  They're Canadian.  Of course, they're nice.  And they told me about Thresh Books.  ThreshBooks.com slash twig,  and you'll get 30 days free.  If you mention this, we can Google  in the How did you hear about a section.  ThreshBooks.com slash TWIG.  30 days free.  But I warn you,  you use it for one pay period  and you will never go back.  I mean, you're going to be a customer  and you'll be glad you really will.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  ThreshBooks.com slash twig.  Jeff's unfrozen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't see you, but it's fine.  I think I'm probably going to die again.  Can I give you my number?  Yes, number.  because I pushed so many people to go to Chipotle  and we know the story that's happened since.  And so as a number,  the in-store sales fell 14.6% for the quarter.  Quarter over quarter.  December over December fell 50%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Make your customers sick.  Half of them won't come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And now they're being subpoenaed  in an impossible criminal case in one case.  I mean, who knows what's going on?  The conspiracy theorists came on and said,  well, it's the GMO forces when they killed the GMO.  No.  It's not that.  And they have a good plan  of what they're going to do would look like.  But this is companies,  every company on earth,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  whether you're...  And there goes his karma go.  Aww.  We've committed Chipotle to people, but...  Yeah, we all love Chipotle.  We did, but...  And we also loved Lee, and now they're both gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, now they both have big jumps, the shark.  Yep, they have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But Jane Lynch continues on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She does.  God, we love her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Can't stop her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  they need to take.  I do too.  I ain't going back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and I don't think you're alone.  Yeah, that's why they're...  That's sad.  That could put a company out of business.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thank you, Jeff Jarvis.  Have a great time with the Knight Foundation.  Enjoy your dinner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thanks, Jeff.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Never, never...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I ain't going to Chipotle.  Nope.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Take your boss to Chipotle if you don't like him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  By the way, somebody said,  Chipotle this year, Oculus Rift next year.  If you make people sick, they don't come back.  Thank you, Jeff.  Have a great day.  We'll see you next week.  Wendy Johnson, your tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not a tip.  It's a tool, I guess.  It's called Sorted.  S-O-R-T-D.  Sorted.  And it's kind of like a Trello-like interface  for your Gmail.  2016, I'm all about getting things done.  GTD, productivity, all of this.  I could care less about inbox zero,  but what Sorted does help me do,  it does help me to get out of my inbox  and kind of look at things in lists,  like what I actually need to be doing  with those emails, right?  So, you know, it takes a while to get used to.  It takes a little bit to set up,  but once you get it in motion,  it's really helpful.  And you can move things around.  That's why I say it's like Trello,  It's quite similar to Trello,  but it's with your email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Email is so broken,  and there's so many, you know,  attempts to try to solve this.  I'll give this a shot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love the columns in Trello.  I could drag my email around like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's kind of agile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Agile email.  Definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you can change your labels around  as needed as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't have to try this.  It looks good.  I just tried something called MixMax,  and I don't, have you guys ever heard of that?  No.  MixMax.com, it works with Gmail.  It's actually a Chrome plugin  that completely kind of changes Gmail,  and it apparently works with inbox as well,  but I'll show you real quickly  what happens when you,  I'm going to create a new,  and now I have  some additional things like I can track.  I always don't like this,  but I think in business sometimes  we want to know if the,  can you take down the lower third  because I can't move these here.  Actually, I think I can.  There we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it disappeared.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Where'd it go?  Did you shift compose?  Yeah.  It has, you can turn on tracking  and you can link in the email.  You can send email like HootSuite.  You can send email later.  You can schedule email,  and if you put, it has slash command,  so you've entered slash in the email.  You have all of these things.  You can, for instance,  put in a share availability calendar in there  and say, hey, let's get together.  Here's my calendar, and it does it automatically.  Lots of stuff.  You can insert Giphy  because that's my new thing is Giphy.  I want to put animated GIFs everywhere.  You could put polls in your email.  So if you send out emails,  hey, where should we go to lunch?  You could say Chipotle anywhere else,  and you can make a little poll in there.  There's a lot of these.  It's really interesting.  I know, Gina, you've written skins for Gmail.  It's a really interesting idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really cool.  This one is very advanced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like crazy advanced.  It's like a whole new product.  Anyway, MixMax, you can try it for free.  I just did it this morning,  so I have no idea,  but you made me think of it, Lynn,  as another way to...  We've got to fix Gmail somehow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, definitely.  True.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, Ms. Gina Trapani,  you have a pic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got excited about bubble level,  It's a Google search.  I was so excited about it,  and I was like, no, okay.  It's an exciting tip, Danny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Meet me too.  Tell everybody, though,  just for...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google search for bubble level on your phone,  and you will get a bubble level.  The thing that will tell you,  using your phone's accelerometer  to tell you whether or not something  is having degrees to the left or the right.  It's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It turns your phone into a bubble level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google, is there nothing they can't do?  It's kind of a really cool use  of quick search.  In lieu of that, my New Year's PSA is  go to myaccount.google.com.  Go through your security settings.  Change your password.  Turn on two factor off.  Make sure that you're sharing the information  that you want to share, how you want to share it.  Just make sure your settings are up to date,  because we all store stuff  and are even passively sharing  but particularly Google.  Make sure you got everything locked down.  Pick a hard to guess password.  Try two factor off.  It's a little bit of a pain, but I recommend

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Authy to deal with your code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do too. You like Authy? I love it.  Love Authy. Love Authy.  Just take a cruise through your settings  as a kind of New Year's 2016  online hygiene checkup.  That's my not as exciting as bubble level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I love it.  I'm going to recommend something.  I've got it.  I've got a purse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You have a man purse?  You have a man purse?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can't believe I just said that.  It's a satchel.  It's manly.  It's made out of thick cowhide,  so it doesn't look like a purse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're red. So great.  It's very Indiana Jones-ish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That just came out.  Is it not there?  Is it not hanging on the hat rack?  Where you put, when one would put one's purse.  Maybe it's on the floor.  All right. It doesn't matter.  Inside it is my tiny hardware firewall.  I had mentioned this.  I wanted to bring this on the cruise  because we were using open Wi-Fi.  See, this doesn't look like a purse, does it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Own it, baby.  That's a nice looking bag.  That is a purse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is definitely a man purse.  It's very masculine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It looks like I'm a man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I ride horses.  It does.  things like this all the time.  But I do carry this around all the time now.  I was a little bit disappointed.  This costs, I think, $91, but you get a year's worth of VPN.  Actually, it's the other way around.  You buy a year's worth of VPN service.  The hardware is for free.  It is really clever.  If you have read up lately,  I mentioned an article a couple of weeks ago  about the dangers of public Wi-Fi.  If you've read up recently on this,  you realize that just by being in a Wi-Fi access part  with the Wi-Fi turned on, you really expose yourself.  This thing is fantastic.  So the deal on this is ...  At first, you have to configure it with Ethernet.  It does everything.  It can do hotel Ethernet in to your laptop Ethernet.  It can do hotel Ethernet to a Wi-Fi access point  that can do four devices.  It can do Wi-Fi in at Starbucks to Wi-Fi out to four devices.  It acts as a firewall, but it also has built-in VPN  from the hotspot VPN.  So you can turn it on in the interface,  and immediately you're in a VPN.  It also has Tor built in.  So if you want to be both secure and private,  you turn on Tor.  It handles it all automatically.  It's extremely flexible.  And I have just fallen in love with this thing.  I'm not going to do a full review of it.  I will do a full review on security now,  and I'll show you how to set it up and everything.  Or maybe on the new screensavers on Saturday.  But you've got to check this out.  tinyhardwarefirewall.com  If you use open Wi-Fi access points,  absolutely worth at least considering  this thing doesn't need a battery or doesn't have a battery.  It just runs off the USB power from your laptop.  I made it always wireless because I don't have any laptops with Ethernet.  So basically what happens, I can even show you.  It's kind of cool.  I'll plug it into the port on my laptop,  and now it's powering up from the juice there.  It takes a couple of minutes to power up,  but once it does, you'll see its access point.  It generates, by the way, auto generates new access point name and password,  so everyone's unique.  You'll see it as an access point which you can then log into.  And then you surf to the little web browser in the thing,  and you can configure it.  You can use it to get onto the open Wi-Fi access point and all of that.  Turn on Tor, turn on VPN, turn it off.  It is simple, and you carry this around,  and from now on you never will be at risk in an open Wi-Fi access spot.  It is a great way to do VPN where you don't have to do any software on your computer at all.  The computer just thinks it's surfing.  Oh, it also has malware and adware blocking through a proxy if you want to use it for that as well.  That's also optional.  tinyhardwarefirewall.com  The hardware is free if you pay for the VPN service,  which I think is, let me get you the exact price,  I think it's like $91 or something like that.  And they do have battery powered devices.  This would actually run off of a, $91.25,  this would actually run off of one of those battery units.  You could keep it in your MERS and just have it and then just log into it.  And you have a little access point in your MERS.  Nice.  Or for you ladies, your purse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're owning it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I am owning my handbag.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love it.  It's a nice bag. I'd carry that bag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's very, it's horsey. I'm from the horsey set.  It's not bad. Yeah.  It's very Indiana Jones.  You know what happened?  I got shooting pains all up and down my leg.  I got a little sciatica.  For the longest time, I finally realized I had this massive key chain in my pocket.  And it was causing it.  So I just started carrying my keys in a MERS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Whoa. Huh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then when you have a MERS, you have more room for things like your little firewall.  I've got Tampax in here and all this stuff.  No, I don't.  That ain't right.  Gina Trapani, I love seeing you. You got to come back more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I will. I will. It was a lot of fun. It was really good to see you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Happy New Year to you.  You find Gina in several places, of course, on the internet.  She's on Twitter, Gina Trapani. She's also on Google+.  But really her businesses are great. Think up, which everybody should be a subscriber to.  And MakerBase, which is free, MakerBase.co.
