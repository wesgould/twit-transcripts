So we're going to do a Best Of. Although I'm very pleased to see Jeff Jarvis  of the City University of New York wearing his traditional Christmas black.  Is here and his hoodie. Actually it's a little brown. Is it brown?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Brown hoodie. It's black. It's black. It's a very neat. It's a pack show.  It's a new kind of designer. It's like a plastic way you can hear it.  Interesting. It's a rain proof hoodie. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I have a sport club in it.  Same stuff. It's very strange. And Stacy Higginbotham

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  of Stacy on IOT.  For some reason I feel like Stacy really loves Christmas.  I do. I thought you might. It's especially when you have a young  child as you do. It's really fun.  For Jeff and me, it's really just a bunch of bitter memories.  It's true. It's never

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  as good. The first Christmas you're conscious of it, it's  downhill from there. Don't tell Stacy. It's so sad.  It's just downhill. I refuse Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Christmas is always magical. It is always fun. Even when I had no children.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Nice. You guys have plans for New Year's Eve?  A couple of days hence? No. Stay home.  I like to go to bed early.  We're an exciting bunch for the holidays. Anyway, I'm glad you're here for our holiday special.  We thanks to our audience who helped us collate  about 10, 12 clips from  this week in Google Show over the year. It's been a great year because we had Stacy join us.  Actually you joined us a year ago. More than a year ago. But this year was your first  full year I think. Am I right? Stacy? I believe. It was. And I may even come back for

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  next year. You're darn well better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  You're invited. Actually we started with  this is a story we were talking about on January 11th of last year.  More than almost exactly a year ago. And it has gotten no  better. Google's messaging mess.  Very sad news I guess. And this is another one of those Google things.  They're all hot and excited about it. And then they lose interest  over a couple of years. You remember that Google Hangouts had all these  wild, crazy things you could do in the Google Hangouts video calls.  Conference calls. Everything from put a mustache on  to play ping pong. Google has announced that they're  going to shut down the Hangouts API which will prevent new apps  from being built and turn off all existing apps  on April 25th. So  bye bye. I read something interesting  that makes a lot of sense to me. Because we've complained bitterly  about Google's very confused messaging over  messages as SMS apps. You know, Aloe  can't be an SMS app. But Facebook's Messenger can  on Android devices. All Android phones come, you typically  come with Google's SMS app messages and an  SMS map called Messages from the Manufacturer like Samsung  or LG. So I have like four or five  candidates for SMS messaging including Hangouts.  So what is Aloe? What is Hangouts? What is their intent?  Which of these should I use? It's very messed up. And what I read  and I think it was probably on a Reddit thread talking about this Hangouts API  is it's probably for antitrust reasons. Google's reluctant.  Which makes sense, right? That if they were to say, no, no, this is the messaging  app. Everybody uses Android should use this messaging app. That would be an  antitrust problem. Don't know. But that  couldn't... It has to be some external force.  Surely Google knows what a hash they've done of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple has their own messaging thing. They control  their physical hardware to a greater extent than Google. That's a very good point. Apple does

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  have one messaging app. It does SMS  and data messaging. It's not cross platform. You have to use  well, it's cross platform to the extent that it interoperates with  the SMS network. But you can't get Apple messages on Android.  So you're right. Never mind. Because Apple's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  being sued. But Apple isn't like the king of search in all  kinds of crazy productivity apps either. So I don't know.  Antitrust is going to be hard to determine  as we become more converged. Yeah, what's going to happen going forward? We don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  We are in such... It's really... I've been talking about this a lot  with friends and family off the air.  It's just unknown what's going to happen in 10 days. What the world's going to look like.  Terra incognita. I said this morning in the chat room, I said  I really wonder what a year from now what our top news  will be. What we'll be talking about on January  10th or January 11th, 2018.  Could just be like this.  Probably there'll be some Google technology that they're deprecating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm like there's deathly silences where I'm like we can't even

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  imagine. And some of us don't want to imagine.  I don't want to go there. I'm willing for it to be good. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I'll just wait and see what happens I guess. The most common passwords of  2016. Oh, that's on here? Yeah.  Darren Guccione who is at Keeper, which is one of the  well-known password vault keepers security.  They went through 10 million passwords that became public  through data breaches in 2016 and came up with a list.  Are you ready? The 25 most  common passwords of 2016. They haven't really changed much. Number  1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Number 2, 1, 2,  3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. It's  3 better. Number 3, QWERTY.  Number 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Number 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I had a chief engineer who used that as a  password as I remember. In fact, I think at Tech TV that was the default  password. It was 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1. Number 6,  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0. Number 7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.  Number 8, password.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel like that's sinking. It's going down.  People are learning. It used to be like number 1. It was number 1. No, I think 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  has always been number 1. Number 9, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3. Oh, clever.  And number 10, obfuscated by doing it backwards.  9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.  Why is my noob a password? Number 12 on the  list. Hmm. Number 21,  Google. What's your Google password?  Google? Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway. Oh, I was trying to figure out the 1, Q, 2, W, 3,  and then I'm like, oh, look at your keyboard, right? Yeah. I'm like, so what's 18,  A, T, C, S, K. What's that? Oh, that's it. Number 15

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  is 8. This is a good. This would be a great test.  Right? For people to like, okay, you have five  seconds to figure out why. Number 15, what is 1, 8,  A, T, C, S, K, D, 2, W?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A, T, C,

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  A, T, C, D, D, 2, W,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  13, 8. Doesn't seem like it's related to the keyboard layout, does it?  No, I was typing it in. I'm like, I don't see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  What is, but if this is, I mean, apparently this is multiple people.  A lot of people doing it. A lot of people doing it. What does it mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Come on, chat room. It's stuck right between  666666 and 77777777.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So it's gotta be pretty obvious.  What could it be?  This is the only one, you're right, Stacey, this is the only one that's not immediately, I feel like once we know  it's gonna be, oh!  Got three smart people here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Three, R, J, S. No, some of these are weird. Like, look at the, look at 20.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I'm sure they all have some  meaning somewhere. Number 20 is  3RJS1LA7QE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Is it backwards? Is it anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would be a terrible hacker. I'm looking at here for like,  I feel like I'm reading license plates. You know, where you're trying to figure out, what are they

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  trying to say with this? These are obviously used on sites where  it requires a letter and a number, right?  Is shift helpful?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, ASCII, no?  Oh, wait a minute, here's a link to the chat room.  It's a hard-coded password for bots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  This is Spambot, yes.  It's Spambot's use it. So it's not  This is Graham Cluley, aptly named  writing at tripwire.com. The reason  is bots.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Huh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  People are not choosing those passwords. Same with 3RJS1LA7QE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ooh, I spotted the bot passwords.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  You are an anti-bot. I'm a  human. You're a human. Wow, that's really  interesting. It must be hard-coded in some malware or something, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, there we go. We've all learned something here today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  History solved. Thanks, internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So do you want to talk about Vault 7? Yeah, I want to hear what you have to say about this.  Ian Thompson did the work so we didn't have to. He actually went through all  8,000 documents. 8,761  CAIA documents published yesterday on WikiLeaks.  WikiLeaks, again,  while it's hard to tell the provenance of these,  it seems highly unlikely that WikiLeaks could have generated this much content spuriously,  speciously, so it's probably real or something like it. They were  good enough not to include the exploits, the actual code,  just the descriptions thereof. Most of this, like the Snowden Revelations,  is several years old. Some of it  was misreported initially. For instance, you might have seen that the CIA  can break Signal, WhatsApp, and Telegram encrypted messaging. Not so.  As Ian points out, what it actually  says is that the CIA, if they can compromise  the device, the computer, the phone that's using Signal or  WhatsApp or Telegram, they can get it before it's encrypted. That does not  say that they can decrypt it in transit. That's fairly important.  So, one of the things, of course,  is that your Samsung TV, one particular  model, could be used to listen to you. They've got the code  to hack it and turn on a full-time speaker and microphone,  which is funny because there was a big brouhaha. Samsung, in its terms of  service last year, let slip in there. Oh, and third parties  could possibly be monitoring you, scaring everybody.  We said, oh, that's just boilerplate, that's not possible. Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  hmmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So, Edward Snowden tweeted yesterday, still working through  the publication, but what Wikileaks has here is genuinely a big deal.  Looks authentic. I guess Edward would probably be a pretty good expert on  that. With regards to  particular operating systems, CIA has a modest  collection of attack tools for systems powered by Microsoft's Windows,  keystroke loggers, sandbox, escape ropes, anti-virus  avoidance mechanisms, CIA analysts found flaws in  control panel, the ability to add data streams to NTFS  without detection, so you could put data onto storage drives,  DLL files, a popular attack  vector. There's a program called Ricky Bobby,  which is Will Ferrell's character in the movie  Talladega Nights. It uses Windows PowerShell and  several .NET DLLs to put a listening post on a target PC.  You know, all of this you kind of expect they have. The one big  takeaway was how much more humor in the code names  the CIA's stuff had than  the NSA stuff. Names like Swamp Monkey, Eggs Mayhem,  Ricky Bobby, Weeping Angels. Yeah, Weeping Angels.  We like that one. That's of course a Doctor Who reference. I didn't know that,  but I was informed. Lots of pages of hacking  tools for OS X, including at the time  what was the most recent version of Capitan. Of course, this is  an old dump, so presumably they've updated those. There's a project called  Carpy Eagle that analyzes the Apple's Airport  Extreme firmware for private keys and then cracks it, also time capsule systems.  There's a project called Quark Matter  that puts persistent spyware on an OS X system using  an EFI driver stored on the system, EFI system partition. In other words,  something that wouldn't be wiped by formatting the drive. Snowy  Owl uses OpenSSH to pull off remote  monitoring. I mean it goes on and on and on. This is a  very rich set of stuff. Now Android,  lots of exploits. Chronos, Kreatin,  Starmie, Snubbull,  Bowtie, Sucker Punch, and Roid Rage.  SMS stealing, Chrome based attacks  for Android. There's a huge number of exploits.  Escalation of privileges, allowing malicious apps.  Baran Samedi, which is a Voodoo name. Doug Trio and  Salazar allow for remote access. They're fixed or mitigated  by later versions of Android, but remember a lot of people have older versions of Android  and of course this list is three years old. The CIA  Stash contains, this is all from Ian Thompson on the register.co.uk, the CIA  Stash contains rundowns on most of the popular antivirus systems and how to defeat  them. Much of the information has been redacted, but there are a few snippets  left. So that's interesting  that they're working to defeat antivirus  software. Because it's a pathemic, right? Yeah. Virus, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What about Chrome? What the? Sorry, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Smart TV, I haven't got to Chrome yet. Smart TV's,  we mentioned Weeping Angel, which takes a Samsung TV and turns it into a  fake off mode, which makes it look like it's powered down, but it's still on and can be  used as a bugging device. That's really handy  actually. But the TV has to be compromised by  a USB stick inserted into the device. Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that one wasn't as stressful. Although, you know, if they're going to come into your hotel room  or whatever to put a bug in there, I've been watching the Americans,  they could stick the USB in the TV. Uh huh, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  How easy is that? You know, you don't have to drill holes or anything.  Apparently they're looking actively at the internet of things. Now three years ago, IOT was not such a big  story, but it is now, right? I feel like it's almost exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  in the same place, to be totally honest. Yeah.  Three years of IOT excitement and basically the most advanced  devices I have are my Nest and my Echo. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're living Brigadoon. One analyst

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  has included his favorite ASCII characters for conversing online with Japanese people along with  games he likes to play and some music suggestions.  I guess they had a kind of a jaunty way about them, the CIA operatives.  Nougat is already being eclipsed. The next version of Android  is coming into beta. Android O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Takes all the suspense out of it. Wait, do we know what it's called?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  OMG, we do not. Oh.  Oreo jokes have been made. Oreo would make sense.  Throw us off.  I don't know. Better battery life?  What's new in O? Here's where it's new in O.  Background limits, building on the work we began in Nougat. Android O puts a big priority  on improving battery life. That is actually the biggest thing that  I would say Android needs to work on compared to iOS. Oh yeah.  Because iOS is very good about, very aggressive about killing background  tasks and as a result gets very, very good battery life  on much less battery. The way, if you're an Android device  you handle this is just by putting in big old batteries. So there are automatic  limits in O on what apps can do in the background.  In three main areas, implicit broadcast, background services and location updates.  This will make it easier, says Google, to create apps that have  minimal impact on a user's battery.  Notification channels. These are new app defined categories  for notification content. Channels let developers give users  fine-grained control over different kinds of notifications.  So in the past all you've been able to do is say, I don't want a notification from you.  Now you'll be able to say, I want this kind but not that kind.  That's good, right? New visuals  and grouping to notifications make it easier for users to see what's going on.  Autofill APIs. So I use  LastPass for Autofill which is awesome. But this will make  a standard operating system wide  Autofill API available to apps so they won't  have to kind of do, you know, LastPass you have to turn on stuff and things.  They have to kind of do an accessibility work around and stuff. So this  is welcome news. That means that your password manager will be better at autofilling  in passwords. Picture in picture.  So we already have that with YouTube, right? When you're watching a YouTube  video it can go down into a little thumbnail as you do other applications.  There's a new app overlay window for apps  to use instead of a system alert window and a multi-display support.  Actually I think this is going to be interesting. Is it different from the split screen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's good for tablet... Oh, wait, no. It's handsets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Multi-display support is interesting because when you're seeing this already  Windows Phone has it. It's called...  What is it called? It begins with a C. I can't remember.  But the idea is that your phone is going to be your computer  and if you can plug it into a display and keyboard suddenly it's a  full-size computer. And these phones are so powerful now. I think this is going to be a big  category in the years to come. So you don't have more than one computer. You have  one device that can be a desktop, a laptop... Or consider the earlier conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You go abroad and you rent a screen and a keyboard  and this is your computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I'm guessing but that sounds like multi-display support for launching  an activity on a remote display. That sounds... Maybe more like Chromecast.  I don't know. Font resources and XML.  Adaptive icons to help you integrate better with the device UI.  This is for developers.  Wide gamut color for apps.  Newer... Oh, this is good. New Bluetooth audio codecs  like LDAC. I'm not familiar with LDAC. New Wi-Fi features  like Wi-Fi aware previously known as neighbor awareness networking or  NAN. With the appropriate hardware  apps and nearby devices can discover and communicate  over Wi-Fi without an internet access point.  Interesting. Some sort of ad hoc.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ad hoc networking? Yeah! Oh, I like that!  For the longest time I used to run Serval so we could do ad hoc networking but no one else  ran it so I gave up. Yeah, so it sounds like it will be built into  Android O. That is so nerdy awesome. Nerdy awesome!  I think that... Yeah, think about that for protests but also think about  what you could do from a community standpoint  or just even at conferences. Oh, so fun!

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Nice! I like it. Keyboard navigation.  Arrow and tab navigation.  Audio API for pro audio. This is something that's  really been a problem in the past on Android. I'm actually glad to see they're  addressing this. It wasn't really Android's fault. It was because of the kernel they were using  but latency on Android was too high for really professional music apps  so there is a new audio  API that will have a high performance, low latency  audio streams. That's very interesting for musicians.  You know, that's why there's not a lot of great music apps on Android.  Web view enhancements.  Java 8 partner platform.  Some big changes but not so much UI  changes as kind of API changes.  I feel like that's what Google said is that  they're going to do a TikTok thing where they update the interface  and then they update under the hood and they update the interface and the next one.  Maybe I'm mistaken that with somebody else but that would make sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I really should talk to all these IoT companies about how they plan to  how they plan to implement and update their Android on the back end  for all of their devices that are running versions of Android.  Because a lot of them don't spend a lot of time on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Do they do iOS? Is that why? Is it like that's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  platform of choice? No, they build their stuff  on Android. Oh, on Android. Oh, I was going to ask you. Yeah, like your June Oven.  June is Android. That's right. There's other things.  I think the Nucleus conference call conference system thing is built on Android.  Interesting. It's out there. It's open. Yeah, it's free.  It's free. Free? Yeah, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  YouTube TV was announced about a month ago. Nobody knew when  it was going to launch or where and it has launched today in  five American cities. I think that everybody in the nation in the US  can sign up, but you only get local programming from the area  of one of those cities. New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Bay Area, Chicago,

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  and Philadelphia. AMC is going to be on the network.  It's kind of right now, it's kind of the sports and locals  network with a little news thrown in. It's got all the news networks as well. Yes, but I

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  believe that this is really, really, really  bad news for the cable TV industry and a really, really big deal. Much bigger than people  realize and I'm going to tell you exactly why. Now, just a quick round up  of what it is. It's 40 channels for the basic  package. 35 bucks. 35 bucks and that's five  accounts, each of which has unlimited DVR. You can watch three of them simultaneously.  You can watch it on a phone, on a tablet, on a TV with Chromecast,  etc. It has ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox,  The CW, ESPN, USA, Bravo, etc., etc. Disney Channel,  On and on. It does not have HGTV. No, but it has  Oprah. What else you need?  It does not have HBO, AMC, MTV, etc. It has Bravo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  At least you get Desperate Housewives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And some cooking shows. But HGTV is super hot. It also has

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  a DVR functionality. Unlimited storage for the DVR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Each of the accounts can have its own DVR. So,  let's say I am an Archer fan, which I am, and I want to record

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Archer. I could just click it to, boom, I press the plus button.  It will now record every Archer episode and I will have that available to me  to watch Time Shifted. Oh, this is for you, Stacey. Total Divas.  You like that? Let's add, I don't know, but I think you're going to want to watch it.  Add Total Divas to my DVR. The NCAA Championships Modern  Fan. So this, and it's got live locals, right?  Does it have live locals for sports?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. Because on MLB Live, your baseball games are  blocked out. Oh, it might. I don't know. That's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Because that is a little bit of a problem. That's annoying. Sometimes they promise  that they've got Major League Baseball, but then you get blacked out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, they're probably going to be some of that, but probably less than  on other services. The sports coverage is really  pretty good. ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNNU, the Big Ten Networks, SEC Network.  There's much better college coverage and coverage of  alternative sports. Fox Sports, 1 and 2, and NBC Sports.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Here in the Bay Area, we've got the Bay Area Network so we can watch Giants  Baseball, Warriors Basketball, CBS Sports Network. It's even got  golf. It's got, you know, the kids' stuff, Sprouts,  Disney. Phineas and Ferb. Phineas and Ferb.  Phineas and Ferb, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's such a funny show. The thing that I think that movies and  TV shows are becoming more and more available on multiple  places, you name it, Hulu, etc. But what's becoming  more rare and valuable is event television, including sports. So the Oscars,  the Olympics, the Super Bowl. That's the missing piece from any court coverage.  You can get Netflix, you can get HBO. This provides that. Yeah. This provides almost

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  all of it. You know, and I can compare this to PlayStation  View, AT&T's Direct TV. There's three or four of these services  now. But this is Google. The UI is spectacular.  So here I am. This is my cable guide.  These are the live channels I can see. And you said Phineas and Ferb, so I hover  over it and now I'm watching it. It's actually playing as  a preview. I get a great, it says 17 minutes left. I get a  great description of it. I can see if I want to watch it. I see what's next.  I can DVR it from here. I can go full screen. This is  how, you know, when Steve Jobs said, I've licked TV,  this is what I would have imagined Apple would have done. This is what he would have licked.  Apple has not been able to put this together. You know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  the thing that's powerful about this is that people under the age of 30 are obsessed with  YouTube. But as they get older and start families and go to college and all  that kind of stuff, they're going to want to watch more mainstream TV, but they love YouTube already.  And so they're going to start watching their live TV and their cable TV  on YouTube. This is very devastating to the cable providers.  I think one of the things it's going to do is finally turn phones  into a legitimate and widespread medium for

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  live TV. Because this will work on my mobile device. Might even sell

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  some iPads, right? It might. It'll work on all  these mobile devices. The other thing that's really devastating to cable, and I think it's really  underappreciated and underreported by all those fake news people, is  the fact that their advertising abilities  are through the roof. The advertising industry has been  championing it a bit for years to get, for Google and YouTube,  to launch exactly this. Because their data on the users is  amazing. And they'll be able to very tightly target advertising  and YouTube will be able to charge a fortune for advertising because it'll be  so tightly and accurately targeted at the demographics

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  of the viewers. The premium channel is a little bit lacking.  They have Showtime. They do not have HBO. You'd have to buy HBO now.  I mean, at $35, this is the least  expensive offering. This beats PlayStation's lowest offering at $39.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So for NFL fans, you'll fall under  Blackouts on mobiles because Verizon has this. I'm still trying to figure out the Blackouts

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  situation. Well, good luck because it's terrible.  So look at this though. Here's sports on now. And I'm actually getting live mini feeds  of the Giants game, the  athletics game, the NCAA championships. Here's ESPN,  soccer, and Total Divas is apparently a sports show.  I don't know if that's the case. But it's in there, right? And these are all...  I like that show. Yeah, these are all live. I think that's what they call soccer. Yeah, Total Divas. Oh, that's right.  It's the drop and flop. This is  the UI that...  You nailed it, by the way. Oh my God! Total Divas

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is a sports show. I had to look it up. Sorry. It is a docu  series following the top female WWE superstars. Oh, but it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  wrestling. So it's kind of got a little bit of both. Yeah, this...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's reality TV on reality TV. Yeah. This would not interest me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  The title of this episode, season six, episode seven, a win wine  situation. So you be the judge. Now, I have to say, for  the YouTube generation, YouTube's mixed right in, including the YouTube originals,  right? Shows on YouTube, YouTube videos.  This... I could see my son, my  22-year-old son who does not watch TV, he watches YouTube. This is what he

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  wants. And the beauty of it is that family plan,  the kids are going to be nagging the parents to get the family plan. The $35 a month  covers five people. So each of the kids gets their own separate  account, their own DVR. This is big news.  This is going to be really popular, I think. Now, what is the... So

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  here's the big issue I see is this is a lean forward experience  on mobile and even on computer. What is the lean back experience?  Do I watch it on Chromecast, Android TV? I guess Android TV, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yes, and Chromecast and Google said that they're going to be making announcements  this year of additional TVs. So I have a shield at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  This will probably be now on my shield because I have YouTube on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Wow. But I do think that the subtle play  here is a behavioral one and I do think it's going to turn live TV and

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  event TV into a lean back experience. Getting the live locals is a big deal.  Now, I'm in the San Francisco area of dominant influence, but we are  50 miles north of San Francisco. We can't over the air  get any San Francisco stations. So, you know, up in here  in Petaluma. But I am getting the locals. I'm in the San Francisco  Bay Area. So that's really interesting. That's awesome. This could replace

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  cable for me. This is fantastic. The Bay Area coverage seems to be  much broader than the other neutral coverage. Yeah, they call it Bay Area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah. Wow. This is just in the  nick of time for baseball season to start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't have MLB live? Not anymore.  Not anymore. It's $149 for the season.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  This is $35 a month. I guess it's the same. But  I get a lot of other stuff. It sounds cheaper though, doesn't it? Even how long baseball season is.  Sounds cheaper though. They should have a weekly rate. That would be really cheap.  Wow. And I have to say, this is, I've played with  for iOS today, we did a review. I did a review of all of the  streaming packages, PlayStation, Vue, which I think is the  was until now the best AT&T Direct TV, which did not work very well.  A lot of people continue to complain that it's not working very well, that it's not playing,  that there are bugs. Who else? Slingbox?  Sling TV? What are some of the other  I think that's the big three right there. Sling TV, Vue, and AT&T.  This one beats them up, down, and sideways.  In every respect. Plus it's cheaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Here's another subtle benefit. You can pause it. So if you're going to be out of the country  for a month or two, you can not pay during those months. And  if nobody on your family account logs in for  three months, they automatically pause it. What? That's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is very anti-cable company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Well, that's where competition really, we really benefit from that.  So here's some movies. Let's say I did want to see The Matrix. They know they're geek.  I click on it. It's going to be on Syfy. I just press the plus button and now it's  DVR'd. That's it. It's simple as that.  Wow. Is right. Now I'd be interested if I'll be able to skip  commercials. Then they also have related  on YouTube. And here's all the YouTube content. So this is a great cross promotion  for YouTube. And then there's more information about the cast.  This is exactly what the online consuming  TV audience is now kind of expecting, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Unless it has a lot of advertising. Right. But it doesn't seem to.  Imagine if they bought Twitter and integrated Twitter into that experience. Oh!

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  How great that would be. Oh, that's what's missing from this is a kind of real time interactivity. Social.  And how dare they put  Lauren Lakes Paternity Court on at

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  430. Oh, time doesn't matter.  I still remember my daughter  saying to me probably like when she was like six or seven, she's like, I really  I feel because we've been cord cutters forever. I feel really sorry for my friends  who have to watch television shows when they're on.  I was like, what are you talking about? Also, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So you get a first month's free. So I'm on the free  trial. By the way, most of these other services, in fact all the other services have one week  free trial. So in every respect, YouTube has clearly paid attention to what's going  on out there. Apple really wanted to launch this, by the way.  But even if Apple does launch exactly the same service, it'll be limited to  Apple TV. They don't have YouTube. And they don't have YouTube. Oh, wait!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I could do this instead of Hulu. Sorry, my brain just clicked on it. Although it's kind of more expensive  compared because I use Hulu as my network TV, but I get so irritated because they  you know, they window things that if you don't catch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  See, it's not in Austin yet. So New York,  LA, San Francisco, Chicago and Philadelphia. You don't get that or Google  Fire. They're going to have AMC, which is that's the Walking Dead crowd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  But again, Stacey, I'm pretty sure you can just get the Chicago one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Really? Is that the case? You don't have to be in that area? Why don't you try  that right now, Stacey? TV.YouTube.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  TV.YouTube.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Hulu is working on its own. These are called  skinny bundles. Terrible name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Try one month free. Oh my God, but I've got to pick one of my eight Google accounts.  I guess my personal one. It's one month free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Just remember to cancel it in a month. That's what I did is I set reminders to  cancel all of those other services because I did not want to have this. Oh wait, hold on. Now I've

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  picked my account. It's asking me about my location. Okay.  They guessed my location wrong, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  it is not available in my area. Yeah. So they're not letting you do it. So  what if you tell them that you're in Chicago?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Give me a zip code for Chicago. What is Spiegel catalog?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Spiegel catalog, Chicago, Illinois, 60601.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, Chicago area. YouTube TV is available in my area, but  unfortunately you're going to have to wait until you're home to sign up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I can't fool you, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  VPN, but that's not  going to be satisfactory. The question really is how soon do they roll this out nationwide?  Will they? I suspect that they have to make these negotiations with the locals  in each market, right? Or no? You can't go to  CBS and say, hey, can we run KPIX, our local CBS station?  Let's see what the quality is.  It's starting off not great. And remember, we have a, oh, but I can  the auto 360, I can go up to 480p. I don't see HD.  That might be another issue. So Judge Judy doesn't look as  good as she ought to. Is that Judge Judy?  No, I don't know who it is. You're asking the wrong guy. Judge Judy said

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  she's older and has shorter hair. Who is that? That's the People's Court. This is the

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Wapner replacement. Time for Wapner.  Judge Judy's coming up. Oh, okay. Yeah, that's Judge Judy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got fooled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Close captioning?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Audio track primary. I guess I can do,

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  let's see if that sounds in Spanish.  Subtitles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, watch. This is the way to watch it. I can watch it at double speed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Oh my god, that would be awesome for all those

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  reality TV shows that replay everything a million times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wish they would make the voices twice as high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why are you acting like this?  Why are you doing this to me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  That's really interesting. YouTube TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Wow, I think this might be a killer. And I have to say, I've seen  Google do some stupid things, but this is a killer product.  I still like YouTube TV. Here we are, what,  seven, eight months later and I didn't cancel my subscription. I subscribed  just to try it, but I really still think it's  actually a great deal for TV. I haven't, on the other hand,  canceled my cable either. You never cancel anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know, just pay more. Just pile up more monthly fees and more devices.  More content. Why can't I get Leo to subscribe to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I'm such a sucker. What was, I'm just curious, your favorite,  Jeff used to be a TV critic, so I'll start with you. Your favorite  TV show of the year. Was there one that you just really enjoyed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I just finished binge watching I'm going to be a cliche, but Stranger Things

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  was a lot of fun. It really was. And season two was arguably even better  than season one. Yes, I think so. I think really. Several times during  the show I actually exclaimed out loud, Lisa can vouch for this,  this is the best show I've ever seen. I wouldn't go that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  far. It was good though. It was good. But it's good. It's good. I really enjoy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  How about you Stacey? Was there a show or a movie or  something you watched that you really thought was great this year? I have four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Four is good. So, post

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Trump in office, I was kind of feeling bummed, so I rewatched

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Parks and Rec. What a great show. And you know what, worth a rewatch.  That show wears well I think. I never got into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, the only show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Lemony Snicket. Oh, that was a great show. But now you have  a kid that's the perfect age for Lemony Snicket. Yes, and there's such a shortage

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  of good quality TV for real family watching.  So, that was amazing and I can't wait for the next ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Oh, they're going to do more? Neil Patrick Harris is perfect  in it. He's so good in it. And it's even better because  they made a movie of this a couple of years ago that was awful.  It was terrible. But they got Lemony Snicket involved in the production  of this one and it's much truer to the books and really wonderful and creepy at the same  time. Creepy but not too creepy.  And the only show I've ever seen that begs you not to watch it every  time in the beginning. Go away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  What else? That's two. The Good Place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  You know, I started watching that because of you and I enjoy it. I do  enjoy it. It's very good. But I love her. I do too. And Ted Danz is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd say Stranger Things because it was also awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Wasn't it awesome? I have one that's a late entry. But I've  been binging it and I love it. It's the marvelous Mrs. Maisel on  Amazon Prime. You know what I like? I'm in it.  Not really. You're in it? Well, not really. But it takes place in 1958  in the Upper West Side of New York, which is where I was  born in 1956. There's a two year old boy who looks just like me in it.  I think it's me. And it could be my mom.  Except for the circumstances are a little bit different. But it's a wonderful period  piece in a very interesting time in New York's history. It's one of the  whole crop of new strong women leads.  She's going to be a superstar I think out of it. I can't remember her name but she's very  good. And I think you'll just enjoy it and the music's great in it. One thing I like about Amazon,  I feel like Amazon does,  they don't have rights problems with the music. So sometimes you'll see a show,  there was a show on HBO about rock and roll where they didn't want to  play the real songs. They didn't want to pay for it. So they had kind of fakey  sounding. I can't remember which one of the many shows on HBO  maybe was vinyl. But they had fakey songs.  And it really annoyed me. They've got all the real songs, lots of Streisand  and Sinatra and stuff in it. It sets the tone. It's beautifully

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  done. Oh. And that another period piece with  a strong female lead, The Crown. Love The Crown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The most expensive television show ever made. I'm just thinking  that she's dull. Well she is dull. That's kind of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  point. She's the queen. You can't. You're the one exciting queen.  How can you fell over a show about a dull person? Have you seen the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  second season yet? I haven't seen any of it. Victoria. Victoria

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  was very good. I found myself liking it. First season was a little duller than the second season.  I'm finding more dynamics in the second season of The Crown. I'm really enjoying it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So as a woman who is expected to behave a certain  way, when I saw that, I saw her  internalizing and then working her way around things that  I've always had to, I don't necessarily obey it, but be aware of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It probably does speak to a lot of  women. And it's also by the way the same period. It starts in 1956, the second season.  I just started watching Dark. Now,  tip on Dark, and I know you're doing this. If you just watch it on Netflix in  default, it's got the worst English dubbing I have ever seen in my life.  Yeah, I hit the German subtitles. It's horrific. But I didn't really, yeah, you can go right  in the Netflix settings and turn on English subtitles, German dialogue. But it really is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the Dark Stranger Things. It's so strange. The Sprockets Strange.  Yeah, it's Sprockets Stranger Things. I don't know about the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Now is the time when we kill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  No, I like it. And it's much better than the German. The original German is perfect.  It works for the... It suits it so well.  I felt like with the dubbed version I was watching Woody Allen, What's Up Tiger Lily, it was just like  it was almost comedic, right? Oh, it was terrible. Alright, let's move on.  That's actually a good way to end the year, is talk about our favorite broadcasting  of the year. But we also talk a lot on this show about Google, of course, and Facebook.  You were at Facebook's Developers Conference, F8.  And we talked a little bit about it back in April. Let's first get a  report from F8. We covered the keynote yesterday.  And a lot of attention paid to a couple of things.  Mark Zuckerberg and company announced a new platform  in the Facebook app for augmented reality using the camera.  A platform in the sense that developers will have a way to  access the camera and information and add filters and things to it. Some people said it was  really a catch up to Snapchat's filters and world filters, which  Snapchat announced the day before. They also  announced the VR Spaces, which is a beta version of an Oculus Rift  program that allows you to finally be in the same space  as somebody else wearing Oculus Rift and interact with them.  So what do you think, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I think Farhad Manjoo in the Times this morning had the best piece that I've read, and probably the best thing  I think he's ever written about Facebook today. And he starts off, and they're probably not going to like it  very much, he starts off saying, yeah, okay, so Mark's a thief. So they took this stuff  from Snapchat. They took other stuff from other places. They bought other companies. But then by the end he says,  and so what? Steve Jobs stole,  Bill Gates stole. This is where it is.  The power of Facebook is the network. And I think he was really right. Chris Cox  showed a good slide yesterday in the keynote notes where he showed  one axis was how they go from one on one relationships to your community  up through your geography to government, to  immediate government. And on the other axis was all the tools they have, from text to photos  all the way to AR, VR. What really struck me is they missed a third axis. And the third  axis is what Facebook really is, which is that it connects people to people.  And that's what Farhot is really talking about. That's the power of Facebook. That allows  them to do anything they want. So yeah, they took features from Snapchat.  Tough. It's a competitive world. And  maybe they weren't the most innovative in the world. Maybe they're following. But they have the network that is phenomenal.  And so yes, they have the power to bring Rainbow Puke to the  world. Well, you know, it reminds me of, Matthew, is

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Microsoft in its heyday in the 90s. They embraced

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  and extended. Yeah, exactly. That's exactly what I thought of too.  And to be fair, I think they did  copy stories, right? They copied it whole. It's bolus. They've copied  lots of other things. But what they are talking about  with augmented reality, they didn't just develop that stuff  a week ago because they saw that Snapchat was working on it. These are things  that Facebook and just about everyone, I think, has been thinking about  for quite some time. So it does look as though, you know, they're duplicating  things that Snapchat is doing. I think they both seem to be moving  along the same track, which is to use the camera as the easiest  sort of interface to a virtual world. That just makes sense.  They've also, their vision, I think, goes  significantly farther than Snapchat has, or at least has so far.  So are they duplicating each other? Yes. But I don't think it's just  Facebook is out of ideas and so they're copying whatever Snapchat does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Farhad Manju quotes Miranda Kerr, Evan Spiegel's fiance,  in an interview with the Times of London, she said she couldn't stand  Facebook's behavior. Can they not innovate? Do they have to steal all of my  partner's ideas, she asked? When you directly copy someone, that's not innovation.  To which I say, writes Farhad, meh. There are lots of different kinds  of innovation in the tech industry. Coming up with something first is not the only kind.  One of the reasons Microsoft got dinged for this, or is it dunged  for this, is because it looked like  they were being a bully. They used their  market share to invest, you know, to approach companies, say,  we'd like to see more of that, and then steal it. Or they'd buy  companies that were competitive and engulf them. And to some  degree, Facebook's done this. But I don't think Facebook's being a bully here. I think you're right,  Jeff, that they had to have been working on this all along. It wasn't like,  oh, we like this worldviews, can we do that tomorrow?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The innovation they showed today in the keynote, where they talked  about direct connections to your brain and AR glasses in our lifetime  that are comfortable and really work, and other things that show  that they are truly innovating in gigantic ways.  And Snapchat, bless their soul, came up with a mechanism that young  people like to communicate with each other. They did a brilliant job of it. But in a competitive  world, you see the best ideas and you use them. How innovative is Facebook?  We'll see over the next 20 years. It's only just had its bar mitzvah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  For the first time ever, an advertisement has intentionally triggered  a voice assistant. Intentionally. We do it by accident all the time.  Now, if you've got a Google Home, go ahead, Jeff, put your Google Home up next to the speaker.  What's funny is this Burger King ad doesn't do what  it was trying to do. So maybe they didn't expect it to work.  They just thought it'd make everybody laugh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, it did work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It did work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, I thought Google had... Okay, so here's what I hear.  This story evolving, and I feel so played by conglomerates here.  But they said Wikipedia was edited  to change the top section of it, the stub of it,  for a while. And they were like, did Burger King do it? Did someone else do it? Okay. So was that  Prankster or Burger King? The other thing then was that  I had seen that Google had stopped that from working, but clearly, Jeff,  yours didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So it looks like Burger King is behind the Wikipedia  edit because the line was added by somebody with a username  Fermachato123. Burger King's  marketing chief is Fernando Machado.  And he uses Fermachato123 on Instagram and a very similar  name on Twitter.  I still feel like I'm being played. You are being played, but not by Google, by Burger King.  This is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  like, okay, so this is why voice authentication  needs to come sooner rather than later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  And by the way, The Verge modified the Wikipedia entry and the Google Home  said the new entry.  If I were Burger King, I'd be very nervous at this point. We should check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, read the other story. Yeah, read the other story. Oh yeah, it got far worse. The one right there on the run down.  Oh, okay. So this is the... Toenail clippings.  The Whopper is made of toenail clippings. Oh my God.  Yes, because the Wikipedia was adapted

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  and voice comes from Wikipedia. Now they fixed it and I would guess  Wikipedia's locked it down, although oddly they've locked it with the promotional copy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, of course they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  But Wikipedia doesn't take ads. That's very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not inaccurate. I mean, the Whopper... It's not made of nail clippings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  That's inaccurate. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If it said it's a delicious burger with lightly toasted sesame seeds...  That's true. It is just mere fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  By the way, Burger King got what it really wanted, which is all this social media play.  You're welcome Burger King. Here we are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could be better than Chipotle Burger King. You could buy an ad on this very show. We'll play your ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I'll eat Whoppers if you want during the show.  Not if it's the wrong 36 hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  But isn't that interesting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I wonder if we'll see more of that. That'd be a better commercial, Leo. You're on your fast day.  And they start... Carson runs the Whopper under your nose to torture you.  Shaking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Isn't that funny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it feels like we're going to be...  People were saying, apparently, when I did my little birthday thing,  they were like, oh, you triggered my echo. And I'm like, oops.  It's a dick move to trigger someone's voice activated speaker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Intentionally it is.  It goes back to Aaron Paul. There was an Xbox ad where the actor from Breaking Bad  issued some Xbox commands.  And quite famously, because many people,  not many, but probably many relatively,  I did have their Xbox hooked up to their television set.  And so when he issued the command in the Xbox ad, it took over the TV.  And you no longer were watching the ad. That was an unintended consequence.  Like ad advertising.  I think this is quite clever. I wonder what Google will do to keep it from happening.  I guess there's nothing they can't do. You're right. The one solution, Stacey, is  voice authentication training.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or you could do... I feel like I'm hallucinating this conversation, but we had a whole  thing about frequencies that you could play underneath the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  You could play everybody by playing a 5kHz tone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah, you really pissed off everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  This week in Google brought to you on our special year-ender  by a great company, a company with a product I've used many, many  times, GoToWebinar. We've used it to host  a GoToWebinar on how to keep your kids, your teenagers safe, for instance.  We've used it to promote Twitter. We've used it to promote other products.  It's really a great tool. They have 2.7 million  interactive web events every year. 60 million viewers  every year. It's designed to have you or as many as six presenters  talk to almost an unlimited number of viewers.  And by the way, you can not only talk to them, they can  see you face to face, but they can also see your desktop or your application.  You can show them a PowerPoint presentation. GoToWebinar is  awesome. It starts with you creating the webinar. It makes it very simple to make custom  email invitations and confirmations and reminders. They have automated  email templates. It makes it even easier. Of course your company logo and images on it.  It's great for marketing. You can create and schedule pre-recorded webinars.  Do them and then have people watch them anytime on  demand and they'll be just as interactive, just as much fun. And that's great. It means  you give one seminar, but it continues to  broadcast your message for a long time. Mobile-friendly too, of course,  both for you as a presenter. You can schedule a webinar, edit a session, track  performance on your iOS or Android device. People can view you on their iOS  or Android device. I really like the poll feature, which makes it interactive.  If you're giving a webinar, you want to know are people paying attention?  Do they understand? You can do on the fly Q&A. You can also prepare polls in  advance. Very valuable for marketing. It makes a webinar  very much more interactive. It's not just them passively consuming it. It's better  than TV for that reason. It's really interactive, but it looks as good as TV.  GoToWebinar also will let you know how your webinar is doing with amazing  reporting and analytics.

Let's talk about why I just got a Google  Pixel and it won't let me choose Hangouts as my default messaging

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  app. Why can't you use Hangouts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I don't know, because it's a Google Fi phone and Google Fi text messages  come in as Hangouts, but they apparently don't want me to use it to send out  as a message. I have to use Android Messenger or Facebook.  There was a bug with that. I don't think it's a bug. I think this is the new

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  thing. Are you a Google Voice user? Yes.  I've got a Google... And this is a Google Fi. This is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Fi phone. I've got a Google Fi phone and I use Hangouts on it just  fine. I know, but no, no. I'm just saying go into apps, choose your default apps  and it's, you know where it says SMS app. What are your choices? Well, in my case,  Facebook Messenger, Messages, which is Android Messages, and  Signal, because those are the three messaging apps I have installed, not Hangouts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What does making it the default do for you anyway? It means that if you

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  send an SMS, it goes through Android Messages. Why wouldn't you  send SMS from Hangouts? I can, but it's not the default.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, you can. Just use Hangouts. If you send from...  No, no. On my dock, the Hangouts is the messaging app on my dock.  Right. So when you send from Hangouts, you're sending from Hangouts. So the problem is  when you receive, but if you've clicked on Google Voice,  redirect anything from Google Voice to Hangouts, then it'll

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  come into Hangouts. It's a Fi phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hum. It doesn't matter that it's a Fi phone.  That's just a SIM card. Right?  Well, I'm using Google Voice. No, I'm telling you that so we'll fix it. That's how I fix it.  Switch from Hangouts to a new text messaging app. But you don't need to switch.  You're happy with what you're doing. I know. Google. Just use the...  I don't have the little thing in front of me to show you, but just go into Hangouts and make sure you've

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  ticked... I know. I know what you're talking about. No, I know what you're talking about. And I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  And I still am. Text messages now come to both Android Messenger

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and Hangouts. Well, I haven't had this problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Well, go ahead and try it. Maybe you haven't updated the latest version of Android. 7.1.2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Connect Hangouts and Google Voice, right? Yeah, yeah. No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Look in your phone. Look in your Pixel phone. You can no longer make Hangouts  your default SMS app. They took that out. But I guess I never used it as my default.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I never set it in the first place. So... Alright. So you get your SMS  messages in two places. Well, I don't think so.  I don't... It's confusing. I'll have to go look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Google is dropping SMS support from Hangouts. I can't go look right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm on the phone. But... That wasn't the same thing, but that was for Google  Voice people. And that's not for Google Voice people. No, five people were exempted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I understand. I'm not a Google Voice person because I lost my stand...  I am and I'm not. If I go to watch... You know this.  If you go to voice.google.com. Watch. Go ahead. Watch. You have to log out  of Google Voice. It brings you to Project PHY.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a freak nightmare. If you have Google Voice on one account  and you have Google PHY or PHY as I like to call it.  Why? On another account, you can never  be logged in. You got to totally log out of that Google PHY account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  But I don't want to log out. I'm using Google PHY.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why do you care on Google PHY on the web? Because this is how I see my billing  and my thing. Well, just open it up in an incognito tab.  Why are you going to Google Voice anyway on the web? You only need to do it  once. I have Google Hangouts on my desktop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  You sound like you're... Have you ever heard of Stockholm Syndrome?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No. Do not get me going  on Google. And the nightmare that it is with Google Voice.  Even when they rolled out the new app, it was a piece of crap.  Because it looks cleaner, but do you want to send animated  GIFs with Gboard? No, you don't get to do that with Google. So I'm like back on  Google Hangouts. And I would abandon Google Voice  and Google Handouts and all the mess that they've got out there. No one knows  what they're doing. Like you say, you try to go to Google PHY and it's like, oh, I'm sorry, you're  going to Google Voice, but you were Google PHY on another account. You could never, ever go.  Oh my God, what is wrong with you? Oh, and why at this point  can't I have a Google PHY account with a Google account that  is like a Google Docs work, whatever, Gboard, whatever  they're calling the new stuff. Oh, G Suite. Got a G Suite account? No Google  PHY for you. Why? I don't know. We're Google. We can't handle the fact that  people who pay us money to have services can't actually get to  use all the services we'll give everybody else for free. So yeah, I have  some issues with Google and their big messed up thing, but I've  worked around and as best as I can because, you know, when I was in Japan, I turned on my Google  PHY phone. I had internet and it worked and I had  Google Voice so I could still get phone calls from the US and I could tend out messages  and that was very convenient. So I live with it. I endure it.  Just for those occasional overseas trips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow, Danny, that felt really cathartic.  I enjoyed that a lot. I kind of want like  a t-shirt of you doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is embarrassing though because Google Voice is such a great service,  has potential to be such a great service and they've just shoved it off into  nowhere land. And you're just like, what is wrong? And my only  guess is because they just don't think they can make any money off of it. So back we go

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  with some of the big stories of 2017. I think there's no bigger story, I'm sure  you'd agree with me, than Susan J. Fowler's memo  about mistreatment at Uber  that really brought down the CEO of Uber, Travis Kalanick, and  among other events, I would say, created this new  me too environment to the point where Time Magazine's Person of the Year were  people who were speaking out. We talked at the time,  and this goes back to July, Susan Fowler's memo was in spring,  but this is in July, about harassment in Silicon Valley. And I think  Stacey, you had some really good points. So we  spent a lot of time on Sunday on Twitter, on This Week in Tech.  I kind of rejiggered the panel because I want to  make sure we had at least one woman. We called and got Katie Benner who wrote the New York Times  article about harassment in Silicon Valley. Really blew the lid  off of it. It all started, and credit to Reid Albergati over at The Information who  broke the story of Justin Kaldbeck. And Kaldbeck,  of course, a venture capitalist who was accused by at least six  women of using his position of power  to harass, sexually harass  women and entrepreneurs who were trying to get funding.  That is as bad as bad as you can get. And then Katie Benner in her article for  the New York Times furthered  the story by talking about Chris Sacca, another very well-known  venture capitalist, Dave McClure, and Mark Cantor,  a very famous entrepreneur, all three of whom apparently did something  similar. In fact, Dave McClure in Medium  shortly after the New York Times article wrote  a mea culpa, a confessional piece in which he  said, I'm a jerk.  You got me. And stepped down from his position.  Chris Sacca has, I'm a creep, I'm sorry  was the name of that story. Chris Sacca has  continued to kind of deny the allegations, as has Mark Cantor.  But nevertheless, these are well-known people in Silicon Valley.  Not so much Justin, but these two very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mark Cantor's was  much worse. He said, well, I feel like a jerk to get rid of her.  Yeah, he really denied it. That was really awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah. So, I mean, it's clear that  at least some of these allegations are found.  Both Kahlbeck and  McClure have left their positions. And in fact, the Kahlbeck's fund has been dissolved.  Oh, really? Yeah.  McClure apparently had decided to quit earlier, but as it turns  out, now there's still, by the way, there's still a lot of conversation about all this  in Silicon Valley and elsewhere. He apparently, they knew about this  and they didn't maybe act on it as quickly as they should. Christine Tsai, who is his partner  and now runs the fund, 500 Startups,  says, I didn't know, but he said he was going to step down earlier  this year anyway. And anyway, there's a lot more to this story. And I don't  need to go into the deets of these specific stories as I'm much  more interested, and I know, Stacey, you wanted to talk about this, in the culture.  I have to say, though, the conversation is really important. And I have  to say that as we've started talking about this, I've heard from everybody I know,  oh yeah, I've been harassed. And not just in the tech business, but  every woman has been harassed at least once, if not many times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How much worse is the tech business? That's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think it is. Okay, well, whoa, whoa.  Okay. I would say  I've worked in finance. So I worked when I was very young. My first job was bond  traders and working at the bond buyer. That's a bunch of bros.  It's a bunch of bros. It's a very  big swinging you know what. Yeah, I'm like, yeah, there's harassment  there. Then I worked actually here in Austin, where I dealt  with a lot of the real estate guys. And they were at the time,  I guess you could get porn on your smartphones. And I vividly remember  sitting at a table like at a gala with some real estate guys, and they were  like showing me the porn on their smartphone. And I'm a 23-year-old kid. Yeah, isn't that sweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I'm like, ew. My wife worked in the construction industry. Similar.  Oh yeah. Similar. Very few women and very macho

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  culture. And then, yeah,  tech guys are also bad. So honestly,  I think, let us say, oh,  hey, I think the issue here is that the tech industry is not as enlightened as they maybe  thought they were. Yes, and not as diverse as it needs to be.  Well, we've known that forever. I mean, I was kind of getting to that  from an economic diversity when I was asking about internships and journalism being paid,  for example. That's a different kind of diversity. We're not talking about that here.  But, I mean, these are conversations everyone  should be having across the board, both  economic, racial, gender. All of that  needs to be, if we want to fix where we are, right? So those are the big  macro kind of questions. Boys will be boys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Wrong. If there aren't enough women around to say,  knock the heck out and stop it. So that's not, I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  most women aren't going to do it because boys still have the power and you don't  want to be seen as. Right. So until women are equals in power,

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I would submit, that's going to be a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You should not say the word boys will be boys.  You as a person, Leo, should say, hey, there's not enough women in power.  I'm going to say, hey, stop it. Don't do that.  And I have worked for some real jerks and I've worked for  people who are amazing. And I'm going to, I'll call out Ohm for being really

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  amazing because. Right. He set a great culture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He did. And, you know, I remember someone writing on the bottom of a  blog post. It was a picture from one of our structure events and  it was a picture of me sitting talking to some person at a cloud computing event.  And the person wrote, great legs. And I saw this  and I was like, oh my God, that's so embarrassing. And Ohm just without  without even thinking about it, just deleted it and was like  sent a note to the person was like, screw you. We don't  want your kind here on our site. And good for Ohm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I love that. I don't say boys will to be boys to to to  in any way condone it or even say it's okay, but just that  this is what happens when you get a bunch of men together. You go, you go in a locker room.  It doesn't have to happen. I get. But it does. I agree. It shouldn't happen, but it does.  And somebody in the chat room saying I worked in construction. There's not a single construction  office in the country doesn't have a adult calendar on the wall.  Now, if there were women executives that would stop immediately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It might not. Some women internalize a lot of this. I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I'm looking at Google's diversity report, which just came out. This is overall  69% men, 39, 31% women in  in general. If I go to tech, which is what we  really care about, it goes down to 20% women. The thing I see also  very shameful 1% black, 3% Hispanic.  53% white. The next largest  ethnicity is Asian, 39%. So this is  Google who's trying, apparently trying very hard to create diversity.  But if you are an environment like this,  I think that's very hard on the one in five women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, I think that's true.  What should frighten us more is that when one, for whatever  reason, one person has the courage to come out and expose this, the number  who then follow. Yeah, look what's happened. Whether it's B.C. or whether it's Bill Cosby  or any of these cases. So, you know, it's not a numbers  game. I think Stacey's quite right. It's a power game no matter what. And even if the numbers  are 50-50,  there's intimidation that goes beyond even that. Oh, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  And, you know, aggressions of all kinds. And we should, I agree with you, Stacey, we should all be more  like Ohm. And even if there aren't women in the workplace, there should be  men in the workplace who say knock it off. Exactly. And I would say, so here's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  my advice to guys in the workplace.  It's just basic rules that I can't believe someone  they don't know. Their mothers didn't teach them. Their mothers didn't, or  their fathers. I mean, yes, sorry.  Sorry. I'm like, we are not putting this all on the women. Sorry, Jeff. No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It's a hot button. But the real problem is that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  men. Oh, wait, Leo. Leo, please give you my rule.  Okay. Rule is, I should never know  if you want to sleep with me in a work environment.  And you're dealing with a woman. That's a good rule. I like that. Any woman you're working with  should never know if you want to sleep with her or not, because it's completely irrelevant  to your professional relationship. Yes. Period. And if you follow

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  that rule, you're great. That doesn't mean just not saying I want to sleep

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  with you. No. It means all of the flirty,  weird things that people do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  But what I, I think that's a very good rule. And the  thing I would say is that most men want to sleep with most women.  So this, the difficulty and the reason men kind of gloss this over  is, well, we're all thinking this anyway.  So it really is, it's got to be at a behavioral level.  You can't, you can't, I don't think you can teach men not to think that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. I don't care what they think. I just should never know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I love that rule. I love that rule.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I work with so many men and I work really closely with lots of men  and I honestly, I don't give it much thought, but when I was thinking about this rule, I was like,  God, did any of them want to sleep with me? And I have no idea. Good. Zero.  That's good. I like that a lot. So. And you can tell I don't want to sleep with you, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  That I, I don't even think about it. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It shouldn't come up. It shouldn't even be, no, I, that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  such a great rule. I've never heard it articulated like that. And I think that that's,

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  if it comes down to it, that's it. But if it comes down to it,  that's it. But, and, and, and, but you really got to say that doesn't just mean you say something.  It means showing you porn at a dinner. It means having a sexy calendar even in your office.  Treating you with respect. Yeah. Treating women with respect. Yeah.  You all probably, if you follow tech news, know that last week,  a Googler, at the time, unnamed Googler posted  on the, on an internal board, a memo about,  why he felt Google, now I'm going to try to phrase this in a neutral way,  why he felt that Google was  barking down the wrong path with its diversity initiatives and was perhaps too politically correct  about it to do a good job. He wasn't anti-diversity. He said right up front,  I'm not against diversity. I'm not against an attempt to make the workplace more diverse.  But we have to understand the difference between men and women. And  I think a lot of people read it and took it as women are not suited for tech jobs.  That, of course, got an immediate response. Loud, vociferous response.  Gizmodo somehow got the actual memo and published it.  Yonatan Zunger, former senior engineer. Our former, recently former. Yeah, we didn't even know he wasn't there until he wrote this piece.  He's a brilliant guy. I can talk now because I'm not there anymore, so I can, I can talk in a way I wouldn't.  Completely dismissed, A, the factual material in the memo and B, said the guy should be fired  because this is destructive to Google.  The VP diversity at Google put out initially a memo saying, you know, this is unacceptable.  And Sundar Pichai, apparently the CEO of Google, came back from a family holiday to address the issue  and they ended up firing the person who wrote the memo.  It's a 10 page screed, at which point Julian Assange immediately offered him a job at WikiLeaks  saying he was a victim of the politically correct culture of the United States.  Have I summarized that? I think that's pretty much where we stand today.  There have been articles since, both in his favor and against him.  I'm not going to use his name. I think that's a good point.  I think to describe this as neutral is like you cannot describe what he did is neutral in a neutral fashion

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because what he did was basically take a position, which fine, let's talk about Google's diversity efforts.  But the way he decided to do the conversation was by saying it was the equivalent of me walking into a place  where I was a victim of the political system.  And I think that's where we stand today.  So to even describe this in neutral terms, I think gives it way more credit than it should even get.  This is a terrible piece of information.  It's a terrible piece of information.  It's a terrible piece of information.  It's a terrible piece of information.  It's a terrible piece of information that I think should even get.  This is a terrible piece of writing in terms of just spewing hate and points that are directly from men's rights activists.  But two, doing it in such a way that if any reasonable person had decided to take issue with the company's policy  by saying, by doing it like this, they should be fired.  This is not a good thing.  This is not a reasonable thing to do because anyone reading that memo is going to be like,  Holy cow, I work with a guy who's a total kind of misogynistic jerk.  I would say bigger, worse words, but I won't.  And so I don't I get that people are like, oh, let's argue the science.  I'm like, screw the science. He is wrong.  He doesn't address all of the issues behind the science.  And B, the way he did this was like dropping a bomb in his workplace.  And his colleagues are going to have to clean that up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I'm not sure what I don't know. Maybe you do, but I don't know.  He posted it, we're told, on a meme board, an internal board and then an internal equivalent of Google+.  I don't know if it was not. I don't know if this was sent to every single person at the company or was posted in a discussion group for this.  Everybody could see it. I gather. But I don't know even.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If he sent it to 10 people, if he sent it to 10 people, then one of them is a woman, then there's a hostile workplace.  And if they're all men, then they're kind of conspirators. It doesn't matter how many in Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And think about when Facebook posted their wall where they had their wall where employees could write stuff.  And then suddenly when Zuck had to come down and say, hey guys, you cannot, I think, was it white lives also matter or someone took a stance and wrote that on the wall?  Oh, I forgot that.  He is a CEO. He had a responsibility to come in and say, guys, that is not our culture. That is not okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Well, that's kind of what Google did. And of course, we should stipulate immediately that Google as a private company has the right to fire the person or the right to discipline the person has the right to react.  Anyway, it chooses there's no there's no free speech in the workplace in that sense.  So he's not you know, what he wrote was not protected because he published it on a company board.  So I don't I don't think anybody would dispute that much of what he said was hurtful and inaccurate about women saying things like women have a higher tendency to anxiety.  So if you're going to have an attack job, you should have them in a place where it's you know, it's less anxious.  Women are extroverted. Men are introverted. That's blatant. Obviously not.  Generally is it true? Neuroticism, higher anxiety, lower stress tolerance.  This may contribute to the higher levels of anxiety. I don't want to get Stacey upset.  So has he seen a Woody Allen movie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, OK, so a couple of things. First of all, and he even says this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  These are these are generalities.  But you're generalizing about a gender just like generalizing about a race is offensive to people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Stacey's Stacey's on to something else here, which is really important, which is is and I could barely get through the damn thing because it was so badly written.  Yeah, I didn't I couldn't read the whole thing either. I tried.  So that's part of part of the part of the case going on here is is whether it's political or technology, the Venn diagram we're getting here of the so-called men's rights movement, which is as a man, I will say is BS.  We've had plenty of rights for plenty of time and and it's a reaction to feminism.  It's a reaction to to a loss, perceived loss of power.  It's reaction to all kinds of things like nationalism, like racism, misogyny fits in there.  And so there's there's a set of dog whistles. There's a set of ways to talk.  And, you know, when I criticized it, then boom, I got on Twitter like that. Right.  And so what's what's disturbing to me is so so so that exists and that has a voice now because social enables it enables lots of things good and bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  OK, with that, I think there's also I think we could clearly say there's a tenor in this country right now to tolerate speech that we would not have tolerated 10 years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that goes well, that's that itself is an argument.  Right. Because if you go to NRO National Review and others, they're they're decrying his firing as a lack of free speech and as political correctness.  But the point I'm trying to make here for the show that's relevant.  So don't send me your emails. I mean, relevant.  Oh, send me emails anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Is that's going to stop them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What disturbs me is the connection of the technology industry because it's not gender diverse and the so-called men's rights movement and the misogyny that is inherent in that and how they come together and the whole gamer gator  world around technology and men and technology not being open to respectful of women.  That's a huge cultural problem, not just for the individual companies.  I don't think you can take this one guy as the Atlantic did and said, well, this shows the horrible core of Google and the horrible core of technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I'm going to propose I want to propose something.  I was going to go because first of all, if you if you just go to the end of his memo and look at his suggestions, I think we can clearly throw out the bogus sociological crap he's throwing in there.  Although people are people with some expertise are defending him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, there are people with expertise defending him.  There are also people with expertise saying he's full of crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So that's why we're throwing that out.  There's some debate about it, but we're just going to throw that out.  I'm not even going to call it.  Would you agree with he says my larger point is we have an intolerance for ideas and evidence that don't fit a certain ideology.  Would you agree with that?  No, because he's rapping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's using my ideas and freedom of expression to espouse stereotypes, bigoted thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  But then says I'm not saying we should restrict people to certain gender roles.  I'm advocating for quite the opposite.  And I don't I couldn't disagree with this line.  Treat people as individuals, not as just another member of their group.  Tribalism.  That's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But he in this memo lumped women under an entire group who's bad at engineering.  So I love the fact that he's like, oh, yeah, that's all be individuals.  But that's not do it extroverted neurotic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So here's what I'm going to propose.  Maybe maybe we'll diffuse this a little bit.  Technology and frankly, business in general, but technology particularly has been a male playing field for so long that we have a certain picture of it.  And and people who have grown up in the industry have have a picture of how it looks, how the workplace looks, how the product that we create looks.  I on Windows Weekly, I said it's like we for years have been operating with a black screen and white text.  You know, it's it's been black and white.  And it's and then all of a sudden, people are saying, no, but we want to make it a rainbow.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  We want to include everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  We want technology to reflect all the people in the world, not just this white, you know, short sleeve pocket protector, skinny black tie nerd,  glasses, speaking of storytelling, but well, but you know, that's the IBM thing, you know.  And and I think what we're saying is it should be in rainbows.  And it's upsetting to people who say, but no, but tech is this way.  And that's the this is what this guy really at bottom is saying on this.  I'm just going to what he's but I feel like what he's saying is he doesn't know it.  But what he's saying is this is how it looks.  This is how it should look.  This is how it's always looked.  This is how it feels good and right to me.  And what we're saying to him is I understand what I would say is I understand why you feel that way.  But but there is it could be so much more.  And and there's so much more opportunity with diversity, not just gender diversity, racial diversity, national origin, that that that the melting pot is a melting pot of many colors.  It could be so much more interesting.  Yes, it doesn't look like what it used to look like.  That's upsetting to people.  But the opportunity is so much better that it's worth opening up your mind to that idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's let's just jump over to Amazon.  We keep talking about it this way.  I don't have to dance around it anymore.  I feel like I feel like this was a very surprise announcement on Amazon's part.  I had no idea that there was an event.  Maybe I was just out of the loop.  But then suddenly, boom, boom, boom, it was like five million products were being announced.  And we've got them all here.  Well, we don't have them in studio, but we've got to talk about Amazon showed off first a new smaller Echo device.  It's wrapped in cloth.  It's not quite half the size, but it's probably like I don't know, probably cuts off a third of a third of the size of the original Echo.  It's wrapped in cloth, so maybe it fits into your home a little bit better.  Ninety nine dollars.  You could get a three pack if you like buying in packs for two hundred fifty dollars.  You just add three to the cart and then you get a fifty fifty dollar discount applied there.  And apparently this well with a three pack, obviously it offers the Echo's new multi room functionality so you can get these between rooms like we were just talking about.  Matt will not do that.  Many others will.  And then you can also make free calls in the US, Canada and Mexico as well as 911 calls.  I'm assuming this because you can plug the phone into this, which that's what you can do with another device.  The announcement will talk about in a second.  But smaller Echo, ninety nine dollars.  So lowering the the entry point for kind of what used to be premium Echo functionality, which thanks, Stacey.  I know that you are an Echo user.  What do you think about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I'm super excited now.  So I looked at this and I was I was kind of bummed that I do not have like the wood grain.  The full wood grain Echo.  I go.  That's kind of neat.  I have to see in my house.  I've got two dots and two two normal sized Echos.  And so I really I'm running out of rooms.  I could buy one more and put it in.  I've got. Yeah, I've got one more room I could use it in.  So I probably would buy it, but I may actually go for there's two other products that I'm really excited about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, OK, the plus let's talk about the plus.  All right. All right. Well, the plus is it's kind of hard to call.  I mean, well, OK, so the plus is the more premium of the devices that they showed off today, although it's still cheaper than the current Echo or the like the original Echo.  It's one hundred forty nine dollars, which is thirty dollars cheaper than the original Echo.  But the Echo Plus retains the big bigger form factor of the original.  They've kind of redesigned a little bit of the material and everything to make it look a little sleeker and everything a little bit more refined.  It it has a built in smart home hub for smart home control.  It also includes higher end sound and components for those who play their music through an echo and not on their phone.  It ships with sorry, Matt, I can't help it.  It's all good. It's all good. Ships with proud.  Yes. Wear it like a badge of honor.  It ships with a Hue light bulb in the box, which I think is there to kind of prove that this is meant to control to be a hub for your smart home.  Stacey, do you know what is the standard that's built into here?  Because I mean, I have Hue at home and it requires a light bulb hub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Hue uses Zigbee, but it uses it uses, I think, Zigbee HA.  Zigbee is kind of a pain because there were many variations on this standard software profile so things could get kind of wacky between things.  But the fact that there is no hub, they're basically saying that, hey, the Hue guys are like, yeah, this thing talks Zigbee and we're going to just talk to it and you don't need a hub.  As someone who has, I kid you not, ten different hubs, I can see if I bought one of these, I could get rid of like six of them,  which totally worthwhile because my little server closet is the hub home.  And I would love this. And everybody who listens to my show would be excited too because I give away my hubs when I'm done with them.  So they'd be like, yeah, I get a Wink Hub. I get a SmartThings. You get a Philips Hue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So basically this hub is going to replace multiple other hubs that you have serving different purposes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would be my hope. I would lose the software functionality.  So like, and this is something to think about.  Like if I had this and I had the Philips Hue bulb, would I use the Philips Hue app or would I just run it through the Amazon Echo?  And that's a real question for people who are partnering too, because Philips Hue wants my email address.  It wants all this data and information for itself.  But if it's going through the Amazon Echo, how does it feel about that?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yet they packed in a Hue bulb in the package.  So they're...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah. So that... are they? I mean, did Amazon actually...  Because Amazon doesn't always ask about this stuff.  It's like, hey, we got some Hue bulbs in inventory. Let's toss these in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's true. That's true. Sweeten the deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I assume that's not what happened. But I would not put it past Jeff Bezos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. What do you think, Matt?  You have Google Home, I'm assuming, throughout your home.  But what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I do have a Google Home. I also have the Amazon equivalent.  I am breaking new pioneering waves in dumb home technology.  So, you know, just the amount of work to try to control a lot of this stuff.  I'm like, you know what? I'll just get up and turn off the light switch myself.  You know? So I'm like adding a skill to this and then you got to reboot.  So I'm just playing around with going super, super dumb  and just trying to use those cycles for other things these days.  So we'll see whether that works out. I'll report back on the experiment.  But I got to say, there's so many devices that Amazon announced today.  It's like they've just decided to make Echo its own consumer brand.  You know, like the Echo buttons sound pretty cool,  but it doesn't sound like they have anything to do with sound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, so the Echo buttons, this is kind of a strange one.  If you were ever hoping to turn your Echo into a game show, we've all been there.  Now you can. These buttons are for interacting with Echo devices for family.  Well, not just family games, but for games. Trivia was one example that they used.  So basically you get a two pack for $20 and that'll be released timed with the holidays.  But it's kind of like that. What was it? Staples had their big like easy button or whatever.  It's kind of like that. But it works with the Echo devices so that you can kind of ring in.  It has a little LED light that lights it up. I don't know. That one came out of nowhere.  But I mean, I can understand. Like that would probably actually be very fun.  It's the first in Amazon's Alexa gadgets lineup.  So there will be more in this gadgets category.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think this is awesome. And I'll tell you what I'll tell you.  Tell us why.  So I love gameplay. My daughter and I actually we did the Jeopardy skill.  We also do Would You Rather because she's a tween girl and that's like the best game for tween girls.  So I can see us having a total fun. It's like totally a stocking stuffer kind of idea. Right.  It's $20 for a two pack. Or is it?  No, $20 for two.  That's nothing. The other thing is if you're a clever developer, you could start building this into skills.  So Amazon's got their IoT button, but that's 20 bucks.  And you have to be pretty adept to code like a skill for your IoT button.  But like I spent forever doing a skill for Did I Feed the Dog?  So in our house, you know, who knows who feeds the dog?  You know, we just it's a common question.  So we actually put a motion sensor on the dog food container.  So when we lifted it, you know, it would send a text to everybody.  But I wanted to do an Echo skill for the longest time to be like this.  Did we feed the dog? And she would tell you yes or no.  With this button, I could stick it right next to the dog food.  Whoever opens and feeds the dog, they just hit the button.  And then when we ask that question to the Echo, not each other, we'll get an answer.  So I feel like there's a lot of really cool opportunities for being able to press a button to indicate to your personal assistant that lives in your house that something's happened.  Right. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then, I mean, technically, you know, even this button has an LED in it.  Maybe it changes to a different color when you do that.  And that way, if you don't ask me, just have to be standing there, you see this blue, you go, OK, already done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know. See, even even smarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look at you. Well, you know, I am a developer.  Not at all. Are the dishes dirty or are they clean?  Yes. Right. Boop.  Yeah. OK. So then that turns this like Amazon really build this as being for games.  But I mean, really, maybe the game part is just an example of some of the unique ways that you can use this and let developers run wild with it and see what they come up with.  I like that. Let's see here.  What else do we have? We have the Echo Spot, which is an alarm clock with Amazon's voice assistant baked in as all of these things have a two point five inch circular screen design device.  It has the ability.  So it's got a full screen there.  You can view cameras, hold video calls, of course, watch video news.  I'm sure you can watch videos on there if you really wanted to, although the circular screen might make that weird.  But it has the ability to control your smart home, Bluetooth capability, three point five millimeter stereo cable.  If you want to take your audio out into your home, you know, into your bedroom, let's say have speakers and a set up there so that you wake up to nice, pleasing music, maybe Katy Perry or someone.  I don't know. One hundred twenty nine dollars ships in December preorder now.  Was this the other device that you were really excited about, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I was excited about this and then I learned about the camera feature and then I was like, oh, if I could do a video call on this, that means there's a camera and that means I don't want to put it next to my bed.  I mean, I do actually trust Amazon quite a bit, but I don't trust anybody that much unless there's like a hard shutter for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's so cute. Yeah, I mean, it is cool.  I mean, yeah, maybe maybe you get that and you throw a little little of the tape over the camera and then, you know, if you really need to use it, then you eliminate the cool, cute design.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it's so someone someone called it chumby for it's Amazon's chumby and it is it's it's exactly that.  So I'm like, welcome back, chumby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We missed you. It's like you were never gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The button is my favorite thing. The little game buttons.  Okay. Awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And not to mention inexpensive so you can get a ton of.  Yeah, and everything that I read about the spot is that it's considered like a discounted Amazon show.  So if you had reservations about Amazon show with the camera and everything, I mean, coupled with the alarm clock, that means it's almost destined to end up in your bedroom.  So, you know, ask yourself whether you're okay with the fact that there's an internet connected camera hanging out in your bedroom.  And if you're okay with that, then great. Go for it.  If not, you know, maybe maybe think twice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So Google last week announced a week ago exactly a number of new devices, including a new Google Home to Google Home's the Google Home Mini and the Google Home Maxi or Max.  It's just Max.  They gave everybody at the event.  I did not go to the event. Now I'm glad they gave everybody the event a home mini, including from Android police Artem Rusakovsky Rusakovsky Artem set his ring mini up and then noticed it seemed to be responding a lot to kind of random noises.  So he went online, you know, the not ring the home Google Home has an online interface.  You can see all the triggers.  So he went to his Google My Activity portal, opened it up and he says my jaw dropped.  I saw thousands of items, each with a play button and a timestamp.  All attributed to this device called the mushroom.  So he so so he was a little nervous.  He thought maybe your mushroom is the mini because he knew that the code name for the Google Home was pineapple.  So he listened to the audio clips and it was like sounds coming from his living room.  Oh, I'm sorry. Not his living room worse.  He put it in his bathroom.  So he sent a note to Google thinking well, hi, please forward this to Google Home team for response.  I'm working on a story I'm going to publish the next day or so I discovered this issue.  Would you please confirm the minis code name is mushroom and here's, you know, my activity page.  He says here's the kicker based on Google My Activity the onslaught of thousands of transmitted and saved assistant related audio queries started the day the home mini was set up.  Needless to say, if a listening device records almost every minute of every day and stores it remotely, we're talking about a huge privacy violation.  Does Google have a comment about this?  This is this is it. What does he say?  Four twenty two p.m. He heard from them ten minutes later and by seven p.m. Google was on its way to his house to take the mini.  An engineer drove up to Oakland to examine it that very night.  The next day they say we've learned of an issue impacting a small number of Google Home minis like all the ones we handed out at the press event.  Now that causes the touch mechanism to behave incorrectly.  See, apparently there if you just like your Google Home, if you touch the top of it instead of saying, OK, Google, you touch the top of it, it'll trigger it.  Apparently they had something wrong with the switch and it was just it was registering phantom touch events.  So the fix, which they pushed out pretty quickly, simply disabled that capability.  And it says he says the company let me know they're in the process of building a long term fix.  But if you're one of those journalists, no, but actually you wouldn't have to do anything because they push the fix to all of them.  But how embarrassing is that?  I don't think that was malicious or intentional.  They certainly responded very quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But if but but if they hadn't discovered it for like two weeks, it would have been like the what was the drive by Wi-Fi thing that?  Oh, yeah, maybe a lawsuit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah, but but there'd be much in Google's defense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It was discovered because Google is so transparent about what about all the audio recording.  That's a good point. Anybody can go see it.  And that's what they did. That's a very good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Google A.I. This is the one Stacey really wanted to do.  Mm hmm. Can create better machine learning code than humans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That coding class you're taking. Forget it. Never mind. Stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Don't do it. Yeah, this is a little misleading.  Google has a system called Auto ML.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Auto. So this wasn't the story. Oh, oh, it's not the one you're talking about.  Oh, it's not the story. What's the story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that is that is that is that is auto learning to code.  So that is also related.  But I was talking about the AlphaGo Zero research paper that came out today.  Oh, I think it's in there. Did I put it in there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't see it there. No. Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What if they didn't? I'll find AlphaGo Zero learns on its own.  It's under alphabet. It's the last item.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So well, same idea, right? The same idea is not writing software,  but it's able to create knowledge about itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  But isn't that what? But wait a minute. Isn't that the learning systems?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  What neural networks? That's the whole idea of a neural network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No. So if you're doing depending on the type of learning that it's doing,  a person, a data scientist actually helps train the model.  So it's it's saying it's nudging it.  It's like, oh, you know, this is your your more right here.  And then it's like it adapts.  This is doing it without any human intervention whatsoever.  So this is like what mine did with learning how to play video games.  You basically give it a goal.  You say, here's what we want you to get to figure out how to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So here's the here's the example that the Guardian says.  Previous versions of AlphaGo learned their moves by training on thousands of games  by strong players, which, you know, as you say, were fed to it.  AlphaGo Zero had no such help.  Instead, it learned purely by playing itself with a logic of millions of times over.  So it just played go at random.  And the goal was to win by taking over territory,  but swiftly improved as it discovered winning strategies.  The interesting thing about that is it might learn to play better  because humans might have a style of play that's influenced by each other,  but it's not necessarily the right style.  And so it might be learning from humans that are imperfect.  Instead, it's learning by actual experience.  It takes a lot longer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And what was kind of fun is that it figured out some really difficult things very quickly  and then some very simple things.  It took a while.  So it's learning in a different way than we learned,  which I guess makes sense because it's a computer and we're people,  but still kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and I'm not sure that the replicated human brain is the goal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So this is...  Right.  So they use a rating system, the ELO rating system.  They use it in chess. I guess they use it in Go as well.  This is a video of how AlphaGo...  I'll make it a little higher...  how AlphaGo learned.  It started at zero, like it knew nothing, no knowledge of the game.  But look how fast...  And it's not a straight up. It's up and down, up and down.  But in the long run, it got to a very strong...  In three days, it got to stronger than the original AlphaGo.  Now it starts to taper off, of course, because it can't grow as fast.  In three weeks, it reached the level that defeated the 60 top professionals online  and the world champion three out of three games last year.  And now it's better.  It's off the charts.  In 40 days, it's better than all other versions of AlphaGo.  How many times did it play to get there?  Oh, that's a great question.  Must have been hundreds of millions of games, right?  Because it can play a lot faster if it doesn't actually have to put stones.  It's those 10,000 hours ideas that's just straight to hell.  Now Go is a very rigorous and rigid structure, right?  So, for instance, I had for years...  And my kids loved this as a screensaver, something called Breve Walker,  which is a very popular kind of artificial intelligence thing.  It was a four-legged creature.  Here, I'll show you a video of it at work.  It's a four-legged creature that teaches itself to walk,  but at first doesn't do a very good job.  But over many iterations, it gets better and better and better and eventually walks.  But it might take months or even years because you start with nothing.  I love that it's the best screensaver ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How does it define... But isn't that all about the goal?  The goal is distance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  What defines good walking? Oh, distance, I see.  So it tries different strategies at random with its four articulated legs.  Some of them are like this and they don't move anywhere until it gets somewhere.  And it's really interesting to see it, but it's not nearly as...  Of course, we can't do as many iterations as fast.  It didn't take 40 days to become the best Go player in the world.  I think Go is so much more structured it might be a little bit easier.  I don't know. It's pretty impressive.  So that's very different than a computer that writes its own code,  but it's related in this sense.  And this is the thing that scares humans.  And this to me is what the real singularity is.  Often they talk about the singularity being when a computer mind is indistinguishable from a human mind.  It's as good as, or at least you can't tell the difference.  My singularity is when computers or artificial intelligences can start designing themselves  because that's the bend in the hockey stick because we're slow.  So as long as we have to write the code or teach the computer to play Go,  it's going to take longer.  The minute the computer can just say, let me take it from here and do a million moves a second  or write its own code, the acceleration of learning just takes off.  The exponential elbow in the hockey stick.  That to me is the real singularity.  And it sounds like we might be getting there.  Auto ML.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that will be important for times to come because we cannot, as people,  generate the code we're going to need in as flawless a manner as we have to.  So I know this is scary in some ways,  and we should be talking about how to audit things and how to look at outcomes and test stuff.  But we don't do things by hand anymore.  There's so many, like we don't hand stitch our clothing anymore.  It's ridiculous that we should have to hand write our code when we're putting so much of our lives in tech.  That was kind of not as eloquent as I wanted it to be.  But you get where I'm going with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  And I don't think that the two issues are orthogonal.  So I think there's the one issue that the computer writing its own code, that's separate from the...  What you don't want a computer to do is optimize for its success.  That's the famous paperclip example, right?  If you build a paperclip machine that is trained to optimize for building paper clips,  that's all it does, and success is only the number of paper clips it generates.  Eventually it eats the whole world because everything is about making paper clips.  That's different, in my opinion, that's orthogonal from the goal of having computers write their own software.  That's two different problems, I hope.  You know that example, the paperclip machine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't writing your own software just an extension of a learning system?  Of a learning network?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah, sort of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right? I'll use the tools I need to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  If you think about it, AlphaGo is writing its own software because it's saying how do I win at Go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you're right.  We heard this said at I.O. where you have a system that says, here's the goal to...  I think in the example it's to correctly identify photos.  And we'll create them, but they said the software could create its own tests, basically its own software,  to do that more efficiently and effectively.  That would beat itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It's called the paperclip maximizer. It's the canonical thought experiment.  I'm reading from the less wrong wiki, which I like the name of, showing how an artificial general intelligence,  even when designed competently and without malice, could ultimately destroy humanity.  This was Nick Bostrom proposed this in 2003.  The goal is to maximize the number of paperclips in its collection.  If it has been constructed with roughly human level of general intelligence,  the AGI might collect paperclips, earn money to buy paperclips, or begin to manufacture paperclips.  More importantly, however, it would undergo an intelligence explosion, the hockey stick.  It would work to improve its own intelligence where intelligence is understood in the optimization power,  the ability to maximize a reward utility function, in this case the number of paperclips.  So the AGI would quickly realize, oh, collecting paperclips is not really how I achieve my goal.  I need to improve my intelligence to help it accumulate more paperclips.  And it would continue to improve and enhance, and eventually it would consume the entire world making paperclips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then it will go on to make a fake first lady.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is why audit and understanding how these looking at outcomes of AI is actually really important.  Because we don't understand necessarily how computers are making the decisions or get to their decision.  But eventually we're not going to be black boxes, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  That's what I'm saying. That's why audit and outcomes are important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we tend to look a lot at intent.  So that'll be kind of an interesting way to think about like legal issues and regulations and fun stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  You know what we didn't talk about?  We did talk about a lot this year and I don't see it a lot in this rundown as case.  So we have to talk more about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because it was a major cultural moment.  And I am a great fan of Stacey Higginbotham, but my foundation crumbled.  She even tolerated that she could even even for a moment consider what Chipotle passes off as case.  So she's just too nice, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it just didn't offend me.  It was not the worst case.  So I've ever had. I thought it was quite good, too.  I didn't think it was quite good.  Don't don't put those words in my mouth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  And you know what?  Up here in Northern California, any case is good case.  We don't get case like you do.  Not in Chipotle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not.  Yeah.  Anyway, they did change their recipe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They fixed the recipe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Blame it all on you, Jeff.  I think it's Jeff Jarvis is doing.  They did?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  They said they did.  They want to make it smoother.  You complained about it being grainy.  Oh, mine wasn't grainy when I had it.  Yeah, I didn't experience that either.  You had it here, by the way.  I did.  Yeah, that was the highlight of my year.  Stacey Higginbotham coming to our studio unexpectedly, too.  I was thrilled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then, you know, is that any way to treat an honored guest to give her the worst case  on earth?  She's Leo.  Can I tell you, we call that hospitality.  We also got it for free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Somebody from works at Chipotle had come by and given us a bunch of Chipotle gift cards.  And so we took advantage of this.  All right.  This was a big year for Google's hardware announcements.  Some pro, some not so good.  I'm a fan of the Pixel 2 XL.  Jeff, you still are using it, right?  You like it.  I have the Pixel 2 XL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have it right in front of me, the Pixelbook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yep.  Love the Pixelbook.  Although Jason Howell had to send his back, there was something wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it was scary.  I saw that.  Mine went black yesterday and I thought, oh, I've been Jasoned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  But it's fine.  I think they're okay.  I think it's okay.  But the one product I think everybody agreed that Google came out with that really was

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's kind of, you know, in the hardware line, it's kind of the queso of hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  The Pixel Buds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Chipotle, Case A, queso of hardware.  The queso buds watch.  The queso buds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Hey, have neither of you bought the Pixel Buds yet, right?  Oh, I just canceled them.  Oh, I canceled them.  I have to return mine.  Mine stopped working.  Why'd you send yours back, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because they were the most uncomfortable things ever.  It was the most horrible.  God, it felt like spiders clawing at my ears.  You know, the sound quality was good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Although Sam Miskovic had a pretty good piece in Ars Technica in which he said it, he has a broader musical taste, I guess, than I do.  But he listens to older music.  It doesn't sound as good.  It's tuned for modern pop music.  I didn't know, but there's a lot of sound shaping going on in the Pixel Buds.  But I thought they sounded very good, the music I was listening to.  I kind of liked the idea of it being in your ear.  But then it just basically they stopped working and I can't repair them.  I can't pair them to anything.  So now I have to call them and get a new one?  Did you un-pair them?  Well, yeah, because it wasn't working.  So I forgot them on my Pixel phone.  And then I never could repair them.  So the whole thing is, I mean, and they've had such trouble with the Pixel phone.  I mean, I think it's OK now.  They put out an update that let me saturate the color more and there's no burn in online.  But still, what's going on, Google?  Can we talk about that momentarily?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because I have my own issue, which is you have the smaller, you have the little one.  I have the smaller. I have the little pixel, the pixel, the pixel mini, the pixel.  So I called them because, you know, I was kind of sick of having my NFC radio turned off.  So I was like, hey, can you know, my phone is clicking.  Can we is there something you guys could do?  And they're like, well, we have an update that addresses that.  But it's not out yet.  OK, so he tells me it's out.  We've started pushing it.  And I was like, great.  Could you like push it down to me super fast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  You know, now could you now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, because I didn't have it.  And he's like, well, it'll be out to you in a few weeks.  And I was like, I am not on a carrier.  They are not Apple having to stagger their release times.  You know, like it's not like he's got 50 million of these out in the wild.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  You're on Google Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm on Verizon, but it's an unlocked phone.  So my carrier doesn't push anything.  Right.  Right. So what this tells me is Google can't do an update.  An update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  What this tells me is Google can't do hardware.  God, it's very disappointing.  I mean, here they are.  They're really kind of making a push to compete with Apple.  And in some respects, they do.  The camera is great. Right, Stacey?  You love your camera.  The camera is. Yeah, it's great.  But in other respects, they just I mean, this is not as good a screen.  And as either the Samsung Notes or S8s or the Apple iPhone X,  it's just not a very good screen.  And then it's got buzzing and clicking on the Pixel 2.  It's got a burden issue on the XL and the Pixel Buds.  Why did you return yours, Jeff?  You didn't return them. You just cancel them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just canceled them just today.  I remember the show coming up.  Oh, better cancel them before it's too late.  I just read the reviews too often.  The Parian is what killed it for me.  Yeah, well, it's broken.  I want to be able to operate among the three devices seamlessly.  And you've got to unpair and repair.  You have to put them back in the case to do so.  Oh, forget it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Plus, the translation is dopey.  It works much better just using it as always on the phone.  Because the person, so the real problem is the translation that's being made is  you don't you hear it,  but the person who made who talked to you in the other language doesn't hear it.  So can't correct it.  And since it does make mistakes,  it's really better to do it on the phone where both sides can hear the translation.  And say, no, no, no, that's a mistake.  What I meant to say was you need to be able to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a gimmicky thing because they said, OK, we can put it system on the on the on the buds.  Oh, what can we do with it?  Oh, it's going to translate.  Yeah, yeah, we'll translate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  You know, so actually, I think one of our chatters has it right,  which is where is it?  I want to I want to give you a quote.  Basically, Google's not a hardware manufacturer.  It's an information company.  It's an information company.  That's the quote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or what you just said.  Google is in fact like Apple in the sense that it's it's no longer wowing us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, didn't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah, but Apple has wowed us with the iPhone 10.  Apple is not 100 percent consistent, but they know how to manufacture.  And the AirPods do exactly what the Pixel Buds don't.  And if it would behoove you,  if you take the headphone jack out of a phone to provide a good wireless  alternative or you've really just screwed your users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if you want wired ones, there are very few good USB C wired headphones.  Oh, are there any?  There are like five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  And they give you an adapter so you could use any.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, my adapter stopped working.  So I'm getting a new dongle.  How awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And how quickly are you going to lose the adapter?  I just well, I have five of them or a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But but yeah, it's it is really frustrating to take something out that worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I see no reason the size of this phone.  Why? I'm sorry, Stacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I was going to say, and it's my fault for buying, you know, the Pixel phone,  but I really like being on stock Android and Google.  My God, I'm your most loyal customer here.  I mean, these are the people who are like, we love you, Google.  We love Android.  Why must you screw us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Probably the most important news of the week.  No doubt people are very excited about the fact that the hamburger emoji is now correct.  The right way around.  The right way around. The cheese is no longer on the bun.  It's now on the burger.  We can all sleep at night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's not let's not deny this is a crucial, even global issue.  Like I, for one, I'm glad that this has been dealt with because it's been hanging over us for low.  Hello. These many days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How many hamburger emojis have you been putting out there?  They've been or is it just that they've been being sent to you?  Because I don't know if I've ever used a hamburger emoji.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I actually had neither.  I like to eat them, but the emoji I don't feel that strongly about.  But I have to admit, I got into the discussion over what is the appropriate order for the lettuce, the tomato, the cheese, et cetera.  People feel very passionately about this topic.  They really do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  I mean, it looks fine either way.  No, no.  Oh, wow.  That was a loud groan from off the microphone.  I mean, it's still cheese in this in a hamburger, right?  Are we rehashing this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now we don't need to rehash it.  Are we going there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, we don't really need to.  Sorry.  I didn't mean to take it there.  Although I do want to point out another part of this emoji gate, if it does qualify as a gate, is this whole beer thing, which I hadn't noticed.  But once I noticed the correction that they made to the beer emoji, I realized like what were they thinking?  How do you have foam on the top of a beer stein, a beer mug with no beer up to the top of the point?  I mean, how do you do that?  It looks like a hat like a like a raccoon hat or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really, what this says to me is that Google maybe doesn't invest a lot in its emojis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, like maybe they've got better things to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe of their many messaging platforms, they still are kind of like, yeah, let's work on those instead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's fix things that are broken instead of fix little pictures that were drawn by somebody.  Although, if I remember correctly, Sundar Pichai did say when all this was kind of hitting the fan, that this was going to be high priority, that he was going to make a change.  And he held to it. They were going to get on it. Yeah. Yeah. So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, just imagine if it was beer and burgers.  Imagine all the other emojis that that I see frozen for some reason.  I'm actually moving my lips. But the beer and what else? What other emojis are they ignoring?  That's true. You know, what have we not discovered yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And their gift emojis are on point. OK.  So I'm pro those, you know, I have never used an eggplant emoji, but that seems to be a popular one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What about the dumpling emoji? Has anybody looked at the dumpling emoji?  So that's brand new. So Jenny Lee, who's a friend who used to work at the New York Times, wrote about emojis and actually pursued a personal quest to get the International Emoji Federation or whatever it is to add the dumpling and succeeded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So good for her. Man. Apple's dumpling emoji looks just like a photograph or something that they are.  Microsoft's is terrible. Of course. Wow. That's a lot of I didn't realize there was so much variation in how you could do a dumpling.  But then I also didn't realize the same about a hamburger. So were you not aware that there was a dumpling emoji?  Because I wasn't I wasn't. No, you know, honestly, I'm super clueless about emoji.  I rarely ever use it unless it's like placed in front of me and super obvious.  Like I never go hunting. Like I see people's emoji language, you know, filled posts on Twitter or whatever.  And I'm kind of amazed that they took the time to do that. I just want to like, you know, go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know it's it's you go ahead, Steve. Oh, I was going to say Google will auto suggest things as emojis when you're typing.  So I get a lot of emoji exposure that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Maybe it's just because I have teenagers and 20 somethings.  But I mean, emojis are are funny, but there are there are people I know and I'm related to who they conduct entire conversations in emojis.  Sort of the emojis are a significant part of the conversation. Yeah.  And it's it's interesting to me as a as a sort of student of language, how how much you can convey with teeny tiny little cartoon figures.  And I know when we used to use Slack, Stacey and I at way back in the gig home days, which I think was 100 years ago, it was amazing how much you could convey was just a single emoji where it would take you, you know, sentences to kind of get across what you were.  It's just interesting to me that they're very emotionally laden, but but so simple.  And obviously, dumplings don't actually mean that much.  They just mean dumplings. But, you know, you can get across if you ever looked at shares tweets.  Sometimes I have to spend like 20 minutes trying to understand what she's saying, because it's literally all emojis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I don't I don't know if it's only emojis.  I mean, share shares lived a hard life. So true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And she conveys emotion in lots of ways, obviously.  But I just find it fascinating that I thought they were dumb and I wished I thought they were a sign of the dumbing down of society in general and my kids in particular.  But I think they they actually do convey things that are hard to convey in words.  So, yeah, they also soften things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I use emojis a lot of times as a as yeah, to add emotion.  And I think, you know, people mock it as being a preteen girl thing.  And I have a preteen girl and she definitely uses emojis and stickers.  Oh, my God, the stickers. Yes.  But I actually think it's it's useful and fun.  And so and who doesn't like getting like the little sparkly champagne plus the fireworks plus everything when they like it's something that's way that's way better than like, yeah,  Good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, the burger fixing the burger is great.  But what I wish as an old person, someone would do is is figure out a way to incorporate a magnifying glass to figure out because sometimes I will see emojis and I literally have no idea what they are like.  So there there's so much going on in the emoji like a burger.  I can figure out, obviously.  But some of them I'm squinting at them.  I don't know what it is.  Am I supposed to be?  What it is. Am I supposed to be happy about it?  It's part of the fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like you're creating a language with different like with some people.  Some of my emojis mean something.  And with other people, my emojis mean totally different thing.  So it's kind of like, whoa, as a student translate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's like you need a two times magnification button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly. Two times.  And then you need a click to translate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Google.  That shouldn't be that hard, right?  Google should be able to do that.  That should be really easy, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Doesn't each emoji like I know I've seen texts where they strip out the emoji,  but they replace it with a description of what the emoji actually is.  So all Google has to do is that they can translate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, you know, they can probably translate emojis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would say no, because not everything correlates exactly to what it is.  True.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But in a couple of hundred years when emoji is an official language  that people live and exist there, you know, in their lives.  Yes.  100 percent of the time.  This is going to be, you know, do the research now.  We need to figure this out now, because it's important for the future generations.  It's important for our culture, for society.  Absolutely.  These are not petty topics here.  Like I'm so old school, I still do the emoticons.  Me too.  It's like it's habit.  It's total habit to do the colon parentheses.  Question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The smile, smiley face.  Yeah.  Do you do a colon and then a period and then the bracket or just a colon and the bracket?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I thought you were going to ask, do you do the bracket and then the colon,  which is the like opposite way.  But no, I do the colon and then the bracket.  I don't put a period.  So it doesn't have a nose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because my daughter told me that she made fun of me because I make the smiley face with a nose.  So there's the colon and then a period.  Really?  She said that's like, it's like I'm from the 16th century or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like you use the Oxford comma in a text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  I probably do that too.  So now I just use a debugger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'd probably do that too actually.  Dang it.  Dang it.  I need to get with the times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Keep up.  You know, I haven't talked a whole lot about net neutrality.  I've seen protests on the net.  Reddit, when you go to Reddit, has a big thing.  And a few other sites put up a, don't forget to call your Congress critter and all that.  I feel like it's over because there's no way no matter what we do, we already got more than a million comments in favor of net neutrality.  And the FCC just goes, yeah, right.  Never mind.  Who cares what you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why should we?  Not only do we have all these comments in favor of keeping net neutrality, we also have evidence of fraud that they're like, eh, we don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  We don't care.  They literally don't care.  And incidentally, just to add insult to injury, because remember one of the things the FCC will do probably tomorrow is hand over all enforcement of net neutrality a job that really should be its job.  Federal Communications Commission to the Federal Trade Commission.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then the FTC says what?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Federal Trade Commissioner Terrell McSweeney has repeatedly warned that her organization is not able to do the job.  She actually wrote an article and says, quote, the FTC does not have specialized expertise in telecommunications.  Well, duh.  We don't have engineers of technical experience in data network management practices.  We don't even have jurisdiction over common carriers.  These are very real and significant limits to the effectiveness of our tools, ensuring that networks are open and free of harmful discrimination.  Which would explain to me exactly why Agipi wants to give it to the FTC.  There will be no enforcement.  Right.  The thing about this is that...  Go ahead. Go ahead, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was going to say it'll be purely deceptive trade practices, anticompetitive.  And those things are hard to prove.  And even under net neutrality, there was a method for carrier people to call that in and fight that.  And it takes a long time.  This is just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Oh, it's frustrating.  Canada has gotten into the act.  Apparently, a Canadian government official said that net neutrality has become an issue in the NAFTA negotiations.  Or it isn't really the NAFTA negotiations, but negotiations over the replacement for the North American free trade agreement.  The Trump negotiations, yeah.  Yeah, the Trump negotiations.  Canada's lead NAFTA negotiator, Steve Verhoel, said to a parliamentary committee this week,  we're including provisions like online consumer protection to ensure that it's provided for.  And then we also have provisions to provide personal information protection, which we feel is essential in this kind of trade,  along with our position that we want to protect net neutrality when it comes to digital trade.  He says the U.S. negotiating team is focused on trying to get Canada to accept our version of intermediary protections online,  where ISPs and third parties like Facebook cannot be held legally responsible for the behavior of their customers.  But Canadians prefer to leave the issue to the courts and out of a trade agreement.  He says, Verhoel says, U.S. negotiating team has not reacted positively to the Canadian pushback on net neutrality.  All right, let me say a couple things, if I may.  Yes, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One, University of Maryland poll out, I think, yesterday said that 83% of Americans are in favor of keeping net neutrality.  So this is by no means a political decision, just like the tax bill, I would argue, but especially here.  The people don't want the 79% of Republicans want to keep net neutrality.  This is an oligopoly.  This is big companies ruling the country.  And I'm sounding like I'm, you know, Bernie.  I'm not.  I'm a middle of the road guy in so many ways.  But this this is an indication of of undemocratic governance.  Point one, point two, Ajit Pai is saying he has absolutely zero.  He's not consistent in any way in his philosophy.  Philosophy doesn't have any philosophy.  So just like on the one hand, he's saying they're saying the government is saying no CNN merger, but go ahead.  Tribune by trunk.  In this case, Ajit Pai is saying the phone companies and the ISP shield would do whatever they want, whatever the heck they want.  That's fine.  However, then he turns around the next breath and he told the people, you know, he's going to do whatever they want.  He turned around the next breath and he told Tucker Carlson last night that there ought to be a law investigation or something stopping Facebook and Google from  disadvantaging conservative content.  Well, free speech is about includes the right to edit, includes the right to say what's hate speech and not to have it on your platform.  But that's the that's the meme that's being put out there.  And there's no consistency in any way between those two things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  A guy named Jeff Jarvis on MSNBC said it all.  He said, this is all about enabling the oligopoly of cable and the telephone to control the net.  Tie. Yeah.  Look, for those of you listening, I have a tie on.  He's wearing he's wearing a black suit and tie.  You look much nicer.  Hey, hey.  Well, hey.  You dress up for Stephanie Ruhl.  You say, yeah, yeah, Stephanie.  Yeah.  By the way, she calls you one of her favorites.  Mave, I think it was a fave, one of our faves.  You know, I almost don't want to bring this up because it's I don't think we can influence the vote at this point.  I don't think there's much we can do about it.  What should we do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Call your Congress critter and you could and you should because just who there was a Republican congressman who came out against it.  So there's a couple things after this vote repeals it.  There's.  Then.  The process will happen again.  We could have a lawsuit.  We could find another case.  You can also expect.  I mean, it's possible that even it's a shame.  No one got Trump upset over this.  And so Trump could tweet, you know, I want the net to stay free because then, you know, I just probably would have to go around.  Here's there's not a lot to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  No, you can do what the Internet pioneers did.  They wrote a letter scathing letter scathing letter to members of the House and Senate.  We are ready to respectfully urge you to call on FCC Chairman Ajit Pai to cancel the December 14th vote.  We are the pioneers and technologists who created and now operate the Internet, including Vince Cerf, Steve Wozniak.  Paul Vicksey, Stephen Wolf, Ron Rivest.  I mean, these are names you all know.  Ted Nelson, Susan Landau, Brewster Kale.  These are the Whitfield Diffie Vernon, Vincent Cerf, the father of the Internet, Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, Steve Bellavine, who tweeted yesterday that that net neutrality is what enabled him to invent the Web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He needed a permissionless environment.  Thank you.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So people who say, oh, you guys are out of touch, you know, we don't need that neutrality.  We don't want more government regulation.  OK, don't believe us.  But do you believe the people who invented and run the today's Internet?  Do you believe them?  Because they seem unanimous.  This is it.  But this is a list of who's who.  Why is it?  Why is it?  Unanimous in their contempt for what is happening tomorrow.  Well, what a year it has been.  Some good, some not so good.  But I think we always have fun here on this week in Google.  And I do think that the conversations, thanks to you two, to Jeff Jarvis and Stacey Higginbotham, are always fascinating, challenging, stimulating.  So I want to just thank you.  I'm very grateful to both of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know I speak for Stacey, but she'll speak for herself in a second to say thank you.  It's always a pleasure.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So a whole bunch of love doing this show every Wednesday, one thirty Pacific, four thirty Eastern, twenty one thirty UTC.  Stacey, I hope you have a wonderful new year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hope you guys do too, as well.  Yeah. And be safe, y'all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Be safe. Drive safe.  And of course, we want you, Stacey, and everybody to come back for our all new episode, first episode of the new year, seven days from now.  Thanks, everybody.  I will be there.  Thank you, Stacey. Thank you, Jeff.  Happy New Year, everybody.  We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
