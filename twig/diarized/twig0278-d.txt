Hey, you should learn this word and light students shoes tracked  Okay, I'm gonna forget it in like five seconds, so that's  Listen shoes cracked. Yeah, okay  I'm gonna give up on that for now and also joining us to fill out the panel today Danny Sullivan search engine land  How's it going sir? Good. How are you?  Excellent super thrilled to have you join us today

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Say something about you Danny sure so Danny and I were at the news Geist  Unconference run by Google and the foundation of Phoenix computers  well  I've always had immense respect for Danny but after we had the session about what Google could do for news and  Danny's insightful incisive comments. I just left saying damn that guy is effing smart. Oh  I've always been a fan Danny, but but boy you you know you when you sit down to analyze one of the issues at hand  You really just are amazing that that having the right?  Perspective the right way to say it. So I'm always happy when you're on the show. Well, thank you very much

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's good to be here and it was fun being in professor Jarvis's classroom  We all sat down in his like classrooms and he I'm like, wow, I get to call you professor

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, let's see here so I was kind of pouring through stories to fill out the doc, of course

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd say my I'm closest to Android content, but wow, there's been no Android news. So let's not start there  How about we start with the thing that literally I think I saw come through last week  I think I saw come through less than an hour ago, but it kind of caught my attention and that is that Google is going to  Kind of put their put their efforts behind creating products and products  Tailored products their most popular products for 12 and under for children essentially Pavani  Dewanji who's the VP of engineering at Google told USA Today the company is looking to create these tailored versions of their of their services  And she says the big motivator inside the company is everyone's having kids. So there's a push to change the products  to be fun and safe for children and  I mean it kind of goes without saying the kids under 13 in internet services have long kind of been considered off limits when it comes to  These services we she said we aren't looking to play gotcha. It's just about kids being protected and promoting business compliance  And she said we're not looking to play gotcha. It's just about kids being protected and promoting business compliance  Kind of an interesting effort. I suppose it makes perfect sense that Google would want to do this  Google's always looking to kind of broaden, you know their reach broaden their scope and everything  Does it sound like this might be something that Google's going to have to kind of fight for in order to pull off successfully?  What do you guys think?  It's so interesting that they said that they're doing this because lots of people at the company are having kids

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That really that really struck me right because I think that's the biggest reason why Google is doing this  Are having kids that really that really that really struck me right because like, you know  I mean Google is so grounded in geek culture and certainly there's this like, you know  Build the thing that you need scratch your own itch and we know that google has this 20 time where you can build  You know the products that matter to you  So, of course if if googlers are having more kids like they're going to focus more on kids  But but that means that kind of thing makes me really nervous  You know because what they're really saying is like we build the things that we need ourselves  And and if you look at google's diversity numbers  Like we all know that like people who work at google are very well paid and of a certain class and often of a certain  Gender and color so so that makes me it makes me a little little bit nervous. Um that said  You know designing project products for kids online gets a little tricky because of copa the child online privacy act  Um, there's a lot of pretty strict rules about what information you can collect which is like none  Uh and and and that and that kind of thing so I wonder how google's going to navigate that I mean  I I you know when I worked I worked on a social network very early social network back in the day called bolt  Which is no longer around but it was sort of like it was sort of like facebook for high school students back back in the day  And that was a big deal, you know, like the you know, not signing up kids under 13 and like kids lying about their age  Which is what every kid does especially now like on xbox  Um was it was always kind of a big deal and copa this looming thing that we were going to get you know  Going to get caught for doing something wrong was always kind of a big deal. So I wonder how they're going to handle that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I remember copa was changed about a year ago and and made  basically more stringent  Uh in some ways that I think were a bit silly one example was that if you tried to do an educational game for for students  uh with geography  Tied to where they live that would be pii just even knowing anything like what town they're in  And and you couldn't use that and and so it's hard to imagine how google can  can  target services  Personalized services to a young person without getting in copa trouble. I mean i'm glad I I think making young people more  You know more literate about about research and how to find things and all that is wonderful  But boy, I I do see danny. Have you heard any?  rumblings about whether that's going to cause trouble for google too  In terms of having copa stuff come in yeah privacy stuff and oh my god google's trying to uh,  exploit children

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I was skimming through the the article just now and and you could see the the epic was already coming in saying  Well, we don't want to sell them products or stuff or whatever and we don't want to so yeah  I'm sure that will come in as an issue for them. But

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I guess journalists would find one other person to quote than that made-up organization. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, someone's gonna do it and then if not, it's you know  In about a week someone in congress will send a letter asking seven questions for google to explain what their plans are but  you know, I think that  I think we're long overdue to recognize kids are are getting online and using products and services from all sorts of companies  And the idea that you know, I think you want to have them protected  But you know my kids have had facebook accounts and they you know  My youngest only just recently turned to the age where he could actually have one, right?  And you know, you want to get them going with google play stuff or you even want to get them going on the xbox or whatever  You know, you're just making up stuff  so we we've got protections that actually sometimes don't actually base themselves in the reality and it doesn't allow the companies to  To you know offer better things that they could do. So yeah, I think it makes sense  It's kind of amusing though because when I was skimming through it one of the things that was motivating them was like, you know  Her daughter was searching for trains. It didn't get tom at the tank and she had to come up, right?  And i'm thinking okay. Well, you know  It's not like google hasn't thought for years  They should have a kid search engine and it's not like we didn't have things like yahoo again  Which died if anybody remembers was yahoo's, you know thing and so  I suspect that what they're going to discover is what might be a great idea. It sounds like in in  It just makes me laugh like and we're now we're having kids like you the company is 15 years old  The company's been having kids all along. Okay  You know, it's not like they just discovered this sort of thing. But you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It'll be I just look up facebook said last year that they were going to  develop  Services for under 13s. I don't think we've heard anything about that since have we

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, but I suspect part of the problem is I suspect part of the problem is you it sounds like a great idea  And then you go and develop it and it's like well, how are you making money off of it?  Right, because if you have ads that are targeting the kids they come under a special scrutiny  Even if you're not  Personalizing the stuff to the kids all you need is a kid going to a kid search engine and doing a search and getting an  Inappropriate ad and it's even worse than if they used a regular search engine and they got the inappropriate ad

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, they have to have ads if you argue that this is a way to indoctrinate  A brainwash and and enslave little children as they know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't have to and that's in fact, that's what bing was doing with their bing for schools program, which is still running  And they I think had some gains with it where they were saying look  We're going to give you a search engine that's doing no targeting that's doing nothing whatsoever  It's just to be out there and you can use it  And in fact, they they poked back at google because google if you recall, I think it was about a year ago  Google's program that they ran for kids in schools  They'll do the same sort of thing give you like a google-friendly kid, you know filter search engine  But they had these these terms that sort of suggested that they might still build up profiles  You know at all like oh, you know, so you're still building up profiles of the kids or whatever  And that didn't go down well in some quarters if I remember it all correctly. So um, you don't have to have it  but if you want to have a child specific  You don't have to have it. But then the question is  What's your motivation in doing it? So like for facebook, what's their motivation in building out a child service for kids?  To capture them early, I suppose but then  You know, they may just feel like yeah, it sounds like a good idea  But the kids are already getting online already and so if we just sort of ignore all this, you know  It's solving a problem that maybe they don't necessarily have because the parents everybody else is just solving it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Anyway until someone sees them. I mean chromebooks have a lot of young users, right?  Because they're so popular in education  And I mean, you know apple I mean, I mean the max part of the max comeback had to do with the fact that it was  So popular in you know elementary schools  um, you know, I wonder if this is kind of a gateway or if this could be a gateway for google creating a no ad pay  For product like I think that there are parents who would pay five bucks a month or whatever to have a kid-friendly google  That doesn't track their kids and doesn't advertise toward their kids  But it gives them, you know kid-friendly search results and thomas when they search for trains  Um, but I don't know. Maybe that's that's a whole different thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't that a can of worms jina when you find kid-friendly across this country?  No, that's true  Evolution no evolution

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I yeah, absolutely. No, no it is though. It is a can of worms  It is a can of words  I'm wondering more about the pay for because I I know I think there was  We covered an article a few episodes back where I think it was larry page was talking about  You know different initiatives that they considered inside google and one of those things was  You know the option to pay for a customer pay for a google account without being  You know advertised to you know, was that was that an option?  And I wonder I wonder if google ever, you know really considers that as a different business model because they're just so heavily  You know their their main revenue is about advertising and that's got to worry them that their primary source of income is advertising  When a kid's product like that just isn't suited toward toward that business model

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe then it is just less about making money directly off the kids by serving ads and more  Just giving them the tool that they're already going to use anyways, but in the long term  You know like you were saying jeff kind of emboldened kind of attaching them to google services  Almost like you know advertisements for coca cola you see the billboard for coca cola  That's not necessarily going to push you out to go buy a coca cola because we all know coca cola at this point  But it kind of confirms your belief in coca cola. It's like yeah, that's up there and I see it and identify it with it  It's like confirmation that you're making the right decision  Uh same same could apply here  It's not necessarily a direct money grab at kids throwing ads at them or whatever  But kids are doing this anyways, right?  Like we're talking about parents are creating accounts for their kids so that they can get on  And you know send email like nowadays in school  Now more than ever the internet is intrinsic is intrinsically a part  Of how children learn and I have to imagine a lot of that starts before the age of 13  So how do you approach that with with kids that are younger than 13? Uh, how old are your kids danny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh minor 13 and 15  So, uh, so they're just in that transition age right now, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right exactly. I went to henry blodgett's business insider conference and he pulled the great trick that web 2.0 conference used to do  Have a panel of teenagers  Talk about their uses  Right. Um, so there are questions. Are they are they using facebook is instagram their social network  Where are they on on on what services they use?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Um, they're big on instagram, you know more than facebook  Um a little bit more on twitter. So, you know, their facebook is actually relatively minimal, which is just interesting  They don't use snapchat  Which surprised me?  um  You know because apparently everybody uses snapchat, but you know, they don't they don't do that much snapchatting or whatever  um  so  They don't use google plus  They do use they do use google and they do a lot on the xbox actually  You know and they connect with a lot of their friends on the xbox. I think xbox sometimes gets  Uh under credited for the amount of social activity it has on there  but I think that's also down to microsoft doing a really poor job of of  Bringing it off the xbox platform  But you know like my my son the other day we were playing and he's and I sent him a message or you know  I said, why didn't you answer me? He's like, why didn't you send me like an xbox chat thing? I was like  Because i'm really old. I don't think

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because I don't have an xbox right in front of me and I I thought just yelling really loudly from downstairs was going to be effective

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  so I I find those panels or those you know those  A friend of mine published an interview with his 14 year old niece about what I just I feel like it's really what you're never  Going to find  You know a panel of teenagers that represent all teens. It's just strange  I feel like adults you could get 100 opinions about what social networks they use and I feel like it's  The same thing with teenagers. I mean my 14 year old niece said she doesn't use facebook because like the old people took over  You know and her and her mom's really big, you know uses facebook a lot  You know and I have nephews who are huge like love facebook and also xbox is a big one  I just I just think it like really depends on the kid and the region and the age and what their friends are doing  And like what sort of caught fire in their particular class?  I don't know. I just I feel like when we're like, oh, what are the kids doing?  Like there's just no

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What about you?  mother of of young one does a does a  Kitty version of google sound appealing

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I I mean it does it does  um  I mean, I I don't know  I have it I really wrestle with like what's this going to be like when when atta starts experimenting and looking at things  I mean, she's already wanting to play play with all my devices. Um, and it only gets worse. Gina  It only gets worse. Sure. I'm sure and fast  Yes, yeah. Yeah. Jason is closer. It's definitely closer than I am. I mean your kids are downloading games and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, so I have a one and a four-year-old almost five-year-old and I mean, you know  She has you know, I have the nexus six with lollipop  It has a profile on it for her that I specifically use so that my youtube and whatever doesn't get filled with um frozen  you know

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  videos

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Barbie doll movies and everything  But um, yeah, so I I agree with you though  Gina it's a really tough question to answer when it comes to your kids because I feel like we're kind of in this weird  Zone where we're learning along with everybody else  What's appropriate for really young children when it comes to the internet on one hand?  You want to protect them from the dangers of the internet and the bad things that they can find in everything  But on the other hand the future lies and in the present very much the present but also the future lies  In internet technologies and I don't want to hold my kid back and deny the fact that these things exist  And that you know what chances are a lot of you know, most of your future at least in the near term  Is going to revolve around this technology. So embrace it versus fear it  Yeah, it's a different it's a very fine line though. Like, you know, I don't know. That's that's kind of how I feel about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's true. I mean my plan is really to have no plan  I'm gonna just let her show me what she's interested in but I but I realize that if I show her, you know  I showed her one elmo video on youtube, you know a few months ago  And now she all she wants is youtube and playlists on youtube and more elmo on youtube, you know  So anything I kind of you know, just give her a taste though  She you know, she wants more because it's compelling and the tablet is just laying around the house  And you know as soon as she sees the tablet also, we you know, we video chat with family members. So  But so, you know in my mind i'm like i'm gonna let her guide me  But I also realize that what I what I show her, you know, she wants more of so it's really i'm just kind of  Taking it as it comes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fair enough. Yeah, and jeff the way you were talking about it the business insiders ignition conference  Few interesting things just to just to kind of summarize that just real quick here  A group of new york teens that were kind of interviewed on on what we're talking about right now about productivity  How they work at school?  Uh, you know do their work at school and beyond a couple of interesting things that they pointed out  Of course, this could be regional kind of like what you're talking about. Gina, uh different in you know, different around different areas of the country  But they say collaboration and mobility all revolve around the internet for their work. That makes perfect sense say google drive dependency

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is huge google drive is it I think this is this this is informative of the story. We just discussed exactly because this is strategic

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google drive. Yes, exactly from from an early state. They are relying most most of their work is is dependent on microsoft  Exactly, they don't might just have no no word no office sadly

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I still have plenty of of demands that i've got to install word because you know, our school still wants things written in word. So  Yeah, I wouldn't count myself out as when the school changes  I wish it would because I don't ever want to have to install software again so they can write a three-page essay  Oh my god

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But wait dumb dumb question can't can't they use google docs and export it as a word doc or

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, my daughter screams at me and says the professor the professors the teachers don't want this and they want word and this reason  And that reason and you know, i've tried to convert it over and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, well it sounds like writing a book

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then  Finally because I think this totally relates as well some new data from idc  Uh are actually pointing to google's chromebooks  overtaking the presence of apple ipads in  us schools  They noted seven hundred fifteen thousand chromebooks shipped in the third quarter compared to seven hundred and two thousand ipads  Uh shipped to schools in the third quarter and uh, you know citing all the things that I know i've heard about on this week  In google anyways, and I completely agree. I'm using a chromebook pixel right now and I love it  Uh lower cost although the pixels not lower cost, but most of the time they're lower cost

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So bad bad comparison. Well, there were there were great black friday sales. There was 149. I think it was  I forget which brand but one of the good ones and I actually bought  the um  toshiba  Uh, it doesn't have the only thing that bothers me about it is it doesn't have uh lte  But it's it's it's um hd screen  Nine hours the reason I bought it was because when I go to europe and stuff  I can get more airplane time on it without plugging in so nine hours  Batteries faster processor than the pixel i'll see how it works, but it's just amazing  I got there for 267 with hd and it's amazing the price is now. I mean chromebooks are regularly

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nine hours without an internet connection

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I write stuff. Ah, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, exactly and there there are ways to work offline as well  um  Let's see here better security measures is another one which I think is  A pretty big deal when you're talking about schools. Um, you know all the different users which actually this this kind of uh,  You know harkens back to to our discussion earlier you almost need well, you need a google account to use a chromebook, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So but I mean you can have google accounts if you're under 13. I'm pretty sure  I can't remember if I fake the numbers or not, but um, you know, you you can have them

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google apps for education has to allow for that. Yeah, they they have to be some yeah  There has to be some way. I mean you can browse as guests. You can use a chromebook as a guest  You can use those guests, but you definitely would want want a google account. So I particularly if the drive integration

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nope  Below are the minimum age requirements to own a google account us 13 spain 14 south korea 14 netherland netherland  16 all other countries i'll put it in the chat  netherland 16

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wouldn't I wouldn't call that I would have thought I would have either I just put it in the uh, the doc chat

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Interesting chat chat, right?  Um also another reason full keyboard so, you know  Once the ipad kind of came along and the the tablet era began or rebegan depending on how you look at it  Um, you know a lot of people were kind of wondering hey  Our keyboard is going to be useless in 10 years when our kids who are growing up  Using devices that have touchscreens and everything  Uh learn, you know on that at first and continue on you still you still need a key. Yeah, it's it's it's more and more

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's it's proving to be I saw some country. I forget what it was a story last week  Some country was going to basically stop teaching penmanship and just teach typing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not surprising

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then interesting  Well, I might as well have not taught me because mine is the worst here's my penmanship  I sort of see you can read a word

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  One of those it's funny like I think I actually think cursive is a completely wasted complete waste of time  I print but I do it quickly. So it's a little bit scripty  I mean the lines, you know the words kind of move together  But I feel like if you can print and it's legible just skip skip the cursive and go straight to typing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wish I were a british journalist because you're forced to learn, uh, uh shorthand shorthand. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a superpower

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is it really is I guess you could take a shortcut and get a cursive font that you use

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or you could just you know, tap the record button on your phone. That's another idea. That's true. It's very very true

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, hey, let's uh, let's take a break and thank our first sponsor of today and this is actually a sponsor that I only got to play with  Only got to play with this morning for the first time  But I think it's awesome. It's brilliant. It's kind of you know, hearkens back to what we're talking about with children  It's called little bits. This is the  Deluxe kit. It's it's a a modular approach to learning how  How you know how to work with technology how to design technology if you haven't heard about them little bits is moving electric  Electronics design and creation from the hands of experts to everyone and they do so with this kit  Let's everyone use electronics and modular building blocks as you can see here. It's perfect for makers artists designers engineers students  Kids tinkers hobbyists musicians programmers. You've got all of these modular  Pieces that you can construct essentially  a bunch of different kind of components of different, you know, use cases this manual  right here actually takes you through you know walks you through the uh,  The process here on you know, some different projects a tickle machine a prank handshake a truck  Crane I was building something earlier and i'm going to test it for the first time on air here  This is supposed to be  A noise maker. So let's see here. So we've got  These different modular so modular pieces so they connect by magnet, right? So I can take this which is the pulse  Module and I can take this which is the buzzer module snap it together and then I can take this  Which oh here it is. Here it is the power module snap that on the side  Plug it into a battery. Ah, hold on. Oh, no  Oh, no game over  No, okay, i've recovered see that's how easy it is to recover when you totally mess up and then  Hey, what do you know, I just built built an alarm out of components just snapping them together the way that they snap together  Basically, you know prevents you from connecting it wrong because they're magnets they're polarized magnets  So it doesn't allow you to to snap it together  Incorrectly, and I mean that's just one of the kits that you find  In the manual is just filled with tons of these kits and honestly, this is the perfect time for something like little bits  It's obviously the holiday season  Perfect holiday gift. You can actually fit this whole box into a stocking a large stocking but it would fit  A little bits has something for everyone during the holidays  Whether you're a musician programmer gadget geek or just you know an enthusiast of this kind of thing  They have a holiday gift guide on their site so you can find a great gift  Now for the tinkerer the deluxe kit includes 18 modules that snap together with billions of circuits  There's no wiring no soldering required  That would be more advanced stuff. This is like the beginning stages building you up to that  So that you understand signal flow and what these components do what could take days to make without little bits now takes  Seconds and it's just a great learning tool for this kind of thing  I remember when I was a kid, you know  They had the uh the sets that you could get at radio shack the big boards and you can play around with them  This is like, you know kind of another another stage of that just building components and it makes it easy because of the magnets  on board and uh, it's just it's a you know, just an easy way to build really cool stuff.

Transcript:  Let's see here so  Is there anything that you guys are particularly charged up about uh talking about like google plus?  Do we want to do we want to go down the google plus rabbit hole right now? What do you think? Yeah, let's do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's do it. All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm curious to see where this heads. I personally I love google plus use it all the time before we start

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is mike in the studio? Is he listening right now? I need to know before

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Before we start you are in your underground bunker, so I think you'd be all right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's true mike can't reach you also it's his birthday today  So he's probably in a particularly good mood and I don't think he's here anymore. I think he's actually celebrating his birthday

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which is what he should be doing really. So I okay so I can say whatever I want with mike. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's not here. You can you can talk about it. It's cool. Okay, you'll never hear any of this. No, no totally

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not recorded in any way zone  Zone

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's just us girls, let's do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gina mike's off happy having 450 000 people wishing a happy birthday on google plus

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No big deal. No big deal. No big deal. So let's see here. So what are we talking about?  Chris massena who is the former developer advocate and ux designer for google plus?  Took to medium  And uh kind of came out swinging against his old project. He wrote about how google plus has  Uh messed up i'll say although he didn't use those words he used  Uh, you know words that I can't say uh and dropped the ball. He complains about how david  David bespris who's google's head of social media has pretty much said nothing publicly about his vision for google plus  Since he took his role a few months back  Chris also points out that ios updates to the google plus app have literally trickled over the past year while competing services have  Iterated quickly and shown that they're much more and you know in his mind much more dedicated to the platform  Uh chris also argues that not one social network like facebook should have such a demanding lead in the space and a company like google  Is one of the very few that has the resources to successfully take it on yet. That doesn't seem to be happening  so um  You know, he's basically he's asking why google plus exists for google the company isn't going to use it as universal repository  Uh for our identities within google citing that google took a conventional approach rather than a forward-looking approach to its challenging  Uh in the social network space, so that's kind of where this  All starts did you guys get a chance to to read chris's?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh post on medium figure to hear what my colleagues think. Yeah. Yeah. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do we think starting there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So i'm always a little  I don't know. I'm always surprised  When an engineer anyone really kind of publicly calls out  Uh a former employee or or a former team that they used to work with like that always makes me  Stop in question  I did it once with lifehacker. I regretted it later  Because it's one of those things was like, you know, you could talk to people internally, but you know, look  It's funny chris wrote this because he had tweeted he had kind of snarked about how google plus had this bug  Which actually didn't turn out that it was not a bug at all. It was a chrome extension that he had installed that was buggy  Um, so I feel like this was him just explaining, you know  Why he was kind of kind of a jerk on twitter about it even when he you know when it wasn't true  I I thought I think that it's totally reasonable to question what's going on with google plus because google isn't telling us  What's going on with google plus? So I think it makes sense to question it. Um, but I found chris's  Like reasons why he thinks it's not going anywhere kind of vague and not really well backed up and and so I thought  Mike elgin not to jump to the next  But mike responded point by point, you know, we all know that mike is you know  Has a huge followership on google plus has been a very passionate ardent user of google plus from the very beginning  Um, I I actually found  Mike's response to be a little more religious, uh than I mean, he's just super zealous about it  And I get it. He's had a really good experience in google plus. Um, so i'm kind of somewhere in between the two  I've just read you rosenblatt's jena  Oh, I I didn't let's see. It's here. It's here

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because uh chris linked to ed I put it up right before the show  And it's interesting because what it really goes into is the idea that what google plus could perhaps should have been was not  facebook light but was  Google me and was the opportunity for a personal  data  um  marketplace, uh a data data repository data storage. I'm not exactly sure what so it's interesting to think what google plus could have been  And and and then and I have to ask well, so I think I see two things going on one is that is that chris is seeing  google plus  No matter what they say kind of orphaned in terms of what developments happening and what's going on?  um  But on the other hand, it's not too late to make google plus into something and I and I my last point on this one  Before we go move danny is that I um, uh  I put up a post last week on on on the germans. Don't worry  We won't do light and short's for this week  But the discussion on google plus beat the discussion anywhere else. I still find that the case I still find better discussion there  And and I don't want google plus to die, which is what I feared that chris was kind of warning

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it just it seems like everybody is wants to talk about how much google plus has failed  But these are all folks who don't use it and like google plus did nail  I mean there's a couple of really good points parts of google plus and if you if you interact on it  It's a great I mean what you know, we have a community for all about android. It's fantastic. We run our polls there now. It's fantastic  Um, I I just I find it really it feels like everyone's kind of like oh gotcha  Google put something out there and it failed they did it again  They failed with buzz and they failed with wave and now they're failing with google plus and it's it's just it's a weird  It's a weird thing especially since if you look at google plus holistically, which is as a platform and not a social network news feed  It's it's wildly successful and I use it every single day. I use google plus photos. I use hangouts  Um, I you know, like I sign into my google plus profile. It's comments on youtube  It's comments in the play store like it's it's it's tremendous thing and I actually think google me has gotten built  It hasn't wasn't called that  uh, but it's google now right and like it's you know, it's google continues to  google  Accomplished something huge with google plus which is they put all their products under one privacy one terms of service and one privacy policy  And gave themselves permission and it gave you the opportunity to opt out of giving them permission to to for all their products to talk  To one another and let one another know about what what your data is where and so google really is a repository of your  Personal data and and I so I feel like all those things kind of came to fruition  But there's this I don't know. I feel like there's still this like weird raging debate about this social  This social network aspect of google plus which I think is just like a small part of it you do to chris  Well, you know, I just  I I don't interact on google plus a whole lot just because I don't know why I don't know it just it's I I reach for twitter  um more quickly

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um right right this moment. There are some city just in this discussion. There are google city experts  Put up a picture of them watching twig live. So let's give them a shout out. Where do they put it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's uh on twitter on twitter. It's mateo. Mateo. Donny. He's a he's a repeat guest on all about android. So there he is  Hey, how's it going? Mateo? Yeah  The links in the links in the doc, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's below. Yeah, I I just I like twitter because it's low. It's low effort, right? Like i'm just lazy  It's easier for me to tweet to tweet things and to put one time like entering high troll  It's high troll. That is true. It is high troll for sure  Hey, hey, mateo  Hey

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, yeah, well  So I love google plus use it all the time  I would say more than anything it gets used for the stuff I do here at twit and because you know  Part of what chris is saying here is that google plus has ended up being less of an identity thing and more of an interest  Service and he's saying, you know, is that enough? It could have been so much more and now it's basically, you know glorified  Forums of some sort or whatever but but it's true the conversation you get on google plus is unlike conversation that I get anywhere else  Maybe maybe you could liken it to something as active as reddit perhaps you you post a reddit post  You put it up there and you know, it happens to be in this particular bucket  You know the android subreddit or the apple or whatever it happens to be  So you're surrounded by all these other people that feel just the same way that you do because they're following it  And then they all pile in and and you know create this great conversation around this particular thought and google plus definitely  Feels like that and I don't know but could it have been more did did they mess up the opportunity?  I guess there's still time there's still hope that google could do something more with it  But anytime they try and do something more with it tie your your social identity or your online google identity to google plus people  Uh backlash because they say don't force me to use google plus don't force me into your social plan  Because that's not why I use your stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah  Yeah, I mean I  That's sort of where to begin on it  Um, you know, I think that google plus is a failure in the sense of  From my perspective is it top of mind for a lot of digital social marketers?  And no it is not and it is not after what are we three years into it?  when um, uh Dave besperous had had that long interview, um, I posted it and I said  Here's someone like chris mesina and other people like here's a long interview that basically tells us nothing  And in fact not only tells us nothing about what's going on  But doesn't even give us figures on their user growth  Which is the first time they've done that for as long as I can imagine which was not a positive thing  Because you know, I mean you can argue about all the user numbers all you want but when you don't even give them out anymore  That's just not a positive thing  and  Because if you post something about google plus on google plus and it is even remotely negative about google plus  Everyone comes out of the woodworks and just starts yelling  Interestingly, by the way, and that's part of the difference  You know one of the things that google plus is very successful for and I think counts as a big win as I've written before  Is it is a great place for the fan people?  Okay, and it is a great place for the android fanatics and it is anything they have to do with google  That is a home for those people, you know that google has not had before it is the apple store of google, right?  So, you know kudos to them they've done that but I'm  Quite often can share things across all three major social networks to me twitter facebook and google  And it is only on google plus where the google plus stuff have to come into this big discussion about  Is google plus great and it was google plus being attacked or is this a you know, whatever  People on facebook don't have those kinds of debates because people on facebook are not trying to figure out whether or not facebook should exist  Or not it does exist they see the value and they've moved on from that sort of thing  so  To come back when I you know  I did this post after three years and I was saying look  It was fine in year one to say that when I would encounter different social marketers or whatever that they'd be like  Well, I don't know if I should be doing this or whatever and you'd be like  Yeah  You really should be doing it if only because you had a search optimization benefit that came with it  You get into like year two and they're still not sort of doing it, but they are doing things like pinterest, right?  People won't even question that they should be doing pinterest, but they can't even take the time still major brands to  Take five minutes and make their page or to simply share the same thing  They put on facebook on google plus it is not that hard to do and they don't even see the value in doing that  So when you get into year three and google has taken away some of the value of google plus in the form of say authorship or whatever  And we're still having this discussion about well people don't get it  They're these people don't use google plus. It's like, you know what?  We're at the tipping point. It is not a question of well, they don't use google plus and they don't get it  It is a question of why after three years do so many people clearly not feel compelled that they need to use google plus  And so that's where I would say it's been a failure in terms of it being a standalone social network  If the goal was to have it come up and be google's facebook, which they never said was their plan  But obviously was their plan and their hope and their dream  Here's a question for all three of you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, what are the odds?  Give me a timetable. Let's say within two years is google plus still alive

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, google plus the social network

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, it's still there. Yeah, I would take that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I actually really danny you made a really good point was that they made a social network for super users  And maybe it's just that I mean, you know, and that's and that's a success. I mean that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's what I mean  It's like it you can you can say it's a failure on one hand and you can say it's a great thing and other things  There is a photo community that is there and in fact  There's perhaps an argument that google plus has become the new flicker in some ways for a certain group of people  So they have they have different audiences  And and maybe there are things that they can do with that and it's been interesting to also watch them do stuff like  You know google photos  What I think to your question jeff is what happens google plus the social network is still there  But parts of it start getting broken out and become more substantial and google photos is a good example of that google photos is an awesome  Awesome product that it is where if it were released from people still feeling like it's tied to google plus  As they're doing I think even more people would do it  Why you wouldn't be using google auto backup for all your devices because not everybody has a iphone  Yet you can use it on everything while you can't use it on windows phone but  Interesting windows interesting windows phone backup you can use or one drive you can use on all three of the smartphones  So but you know microsoft still has some challenges there, but the google photo option is wonderful  And I think they were smart when they brought it out as a photo app  And I think as they get people using that even if there's not the social aspect necessarily  There's an opportunity for them to maybe do more with google photos  Maybe google photos can be there kind of an instagram type of a thing  And and and there's this whole argument that are we going into this era of social networks that are no longer the all-in-ones?  Like facebook and the real future is as facebook seemed to think we just keep building all these little specialty types of things  so  you know  Anyway, i'm sure it'll be there. I just I think you're not going to see  A lot of further development into that particular platform  If you do see new social efforts, they will probably be more standalone social efforts  They may tie into google plus in some ways in other parts of google  But I don't think you're going to see them as as big things within google plus itself

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean it does feel like all of the all the features in the social app like you know  Plus ones and comments and I mean those are those are things an authorship  Well authorship got taken away, but those are things that you see elsewhere on the web  You know what I mean?  It feels like like google's building these features out and yes, they're all apart social network  But it doesn't feel like that's code. That's you know  Specific, you know chris massena did say like google google only invests in the projects that are that are doing really well  And hey, they killed wave because they had less than a million users, right?  But in so many ways wave lived on in google docs  Uh, we see so many of the features and now google plus with polls  Uh, so I don't know. I I think I do think it's going to be around in some form but  I hope it'll be broken out into a separate app and maybe not as central  I think that they launched it with the idea that this is going to be the central hub  And it didn't it didn't you know didn't get the reaction to get the users that they thought it would and so now they're breaking it out

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and they certainly they certainly had the ambition in the beginning whether whether they say they did or they didn't now  They had the ambition for this to be a big all-encompassing social network and now over the last three years  It's kind of settled into the comfortable, you know comfortable niche, you know tailored to niche zone that it is right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And well, but there's another bad thing. It's just different. No, you're right. You're right. I think danis point is great  But there's another analysis. The other analysis is that google needed more social signals  Facebook had the monopoly on the social signals  Uh google has social, you know has has contextual signals out of android  For a lot of users, but it didn't have social signals and connections and social graph and all that  To make for a better google as a service and a better google as an advertising company  Absolutely, daddy. I think a say is that if that ambition was there that's dead you're saying well, no, and I I think I think that's a real

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Problem that they have too if you if you go back before we got google plus they'd rolled out google plus one  And they said google plus one was going to be really important for them to have new signal to use in search  Then we got google plus, you know  That putting all this together, but then the plus ones were dropped out of search and google plus and your connections on google plus  Still can trump every other factor on on search, right?  If you are logged into google and you are connected with a brand or person and you do a google search  All that stuff about you got to get links or you got to have h1 tags  You got to have the multiple words all that gets tossed out the windows. I just did a search for um  Mike, you know elgin, right?  I just searched for his name the second thing that came up after his name on google plus was his response to chris messina  Which is ranking high because i'm connected to him and so it's figuring out i want to do this  But I do think they have this issue  They wanted those social signals and they couldn't get them from twitter because their deal was falling through and they didn't want to get them  From facebook because they just didn't want to agree to facebook's terms and that all never, you know happened  But it may be that yes, they still have enough of the signals that are coming in to give them some reassurance  But they still may need to do more  But they they are kind of stalled because I still tend to feel like they need something other than than the link reliance that they they  Still have really depend on yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Gina you were gonna say something but google has gmail. I mean they have our email which I so when you say social signals  I mean they have your contact list in gmail and you know, they have your your messages of the people that you sent  I mean think I feel like that's even those are stronger signals than anything that you post publicly  um, but I mean of course you don't have things like link shared or you know thumbs up or plus ones or comments on on links but  But I don't know it seems like

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They can get some of that and like we can share links of it  But if you think of it in terms of a ranking signal, you know  google's  Dominant you know, right their predominant measure is we analyze links across the web and try to figure out those that have have the  best and most reputable links in context, right?  So that's why when you you you know amazon has a lot of links  But when you search for cars, they don't come up because no one links to them with the word cars, right?  But people do link to amazon and say books a lot and they're reputable sites  And you can do that sort of thing with social where you could say well, you know  This brand has a lot of followers on twitter or a lot of followers on facebook a lot of followers on google  Therefore we think it is a very good authority  And so you could then apply and if you can see the linkage between the brand social accounts and their own website  Then you could apply some of that authority to the website and give them a boost that way  You can also then do the leveraging of well, we've seen a lot of shares to put this particular article  Wow, everybody's into kim kardassian's photos. So  You know, we're gonna we're gonna give that some extra credit or whatever  And and that kind of goes into it as well. It is true that  You have an issue that not everything gets like that we like but that's even more an issue when it comes to links  Think of all the things that you like in your life  um  That you you know all the businesses that you are really pleased about that you have good experiences with or whatever and how often do you?  Actually go back and then write a blog post about them  Make sure to link to them make sure that the link hadn't have a no follow that got put on to it or all these  Other things that go on there  In contrast, I think arguably many more people who like things are actually using social to give those signals  It's so I did that  It was like two years ago and I talked about this thing like socialize when everybody gets to vote and what I was saying was  When you use links as a method of trying to figure out who should get votes for search rankings  It is like you were saying democracy in the united states when it started was  Everybody gets to vote as long as they're 35 years old and older own land and are white  You know  Most people are kind of disenfranchised if your idea on how you count votes comes down to links  So I think social is really important for them  But you know, it's still kind of early days on how they're figuring all that out and and google plus if that was going to be  The solution has gotten them a bit closer to it, but it still has a ways to go

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, diff definitely didn't succeed in that way. Yeah, but I see your point that that's what those are the social signals  They were looking for yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google plus is one more reason for someone to log into their browser the minute they turn on their computer  As well, so all that all that extra information that it gets by just you being logged into your you know  A google account on your browser started on logging in fella

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the google change log

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gina trapani with this week's google change log

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thank you. Thank you. Jason and brian. So look I gotta warn you. It's the week after thanksgiving. There's not a lot here  But we have a couple of things  Uh, just today google released a new android app called device assist. It offers live tech support troubleshooting tips and more  The catch is it's only for nexus google play edition and android one devices

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I haven't I haven't installed I can show it while you talk about that would be that yeah, that would be great

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That'd be great. So in it in addition to  Offering quick access to google support the app detects issues the device is set up make suggestions on things like gps  Connectivity and batterings battery settings to improve overall  Performance, um, it gives you kind of it's like proactive troubleshooting to help you sort of get the most out of your device  How's it look to you? This is kind of how's it looking to you? Jason?  Do you get like a live googler on the line? Is it like is it like actually the amazon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, so looking for help send device information to google for improved technical support see google's. Okay. Sure  Okay, I don't know what i'm about to do here. Are you about to like launch a help?  Okay, so you can request a call back you can request a call back  Provide a backup number if you can phone issues will be easier to solve if we can call you on a different phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I should wait. Wait, is it illegal to like call them right now and see what they do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, of course it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're telling me to do it then yeah, see they call you back see how long it takes. Oh, that's it. Yeah. Oh  Really I have that for me  Google don't you know this about me already?  It's an app on your phone, but it didn't ask for access to your number cover it cover it that's that's really that's really weird

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now I feel like we're putting you on the spot here jace describe your issue

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's only optional so I don't have to actually describe my issue

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I won't i'm live on a google related podcast and i'd like you to comment on device assist

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was just my issue right now. Someone's calling someone at google saying get it ready here comes jason  Yes, exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

It's now in docs  And google slides on the web got a minor update. You can show slide numbers on a throughout your show  So you can go to the insert menu and include slide numbers  and finally  in the changelog, um made with code.com is a  A project that google launched I think a few months back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This isn't a web app there isn't a web app that's why you can't use it on the on the Chromebook  That's mobile. I was just wondering browser coming soon

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Womp womp

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So now it's it's facing the challenge of getting critical mass that everybody's using it  Man, there's so many of these messaging apps out there  Back of mine  Nexus 6 are losing us

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So let's see here. Let's let's hit on a few of these here real quick  Since i'm realizing we're we're nearing the end anyways of the show  So how about this google is redoing the captcha? Did you guys see this they announced a new approach to captures?  Captures are normally hated by humans by the way  They call the new system no capture. It's built on a new api  Essentially the system pre screens users and identifies humans in advance of the capture  So ultimately the user will see a checkbox and nothing more if they're identified as human by the time they get there  A more advanced test can be run if the system can't tell for sure and that's something like text recognition image recognition  That type of stuff  Cool because I hate captures. I know i'm not alone  Yeah, you know recaptures always captures in general always felt like this

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Weird old-fashioned thing, you know, like like, you know programmers just sort of foisted it upon users like hey  This is too hard for us to figure out  So now you have to swint at some blurry image and type this thing in right?  I think the thing the thing about no capture. I kind of want to know how it works  But it's got that problem right the seo problem where like if they tell you the algorithm and the bots will be able to beat it  So now it's just sort of this black box  I guess i'm not sure how it works  But I guess you just embed some code and google calls back to google and google figures out based on your ip address  And how you behave on the page whether or not you're a bot. I sort of it's the true terrain test  Yeah  Yeah, are you human?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, all right. You're right. I'm not a robot. That's the checkbox if it can figure out

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If it if it decides that you are not a bot it'll just show a text to you  Figure out  Uh if it if it decides that you are not a bot it'll just show a tech checkbox where that you can check it  If it can't decide though, it will show it will default it'll it'll or like not default but fall back on  A capture where it'll show you the image and you have to whatever right pick the kitten or whatever it is  um, so I think it's a good thing for users, but  It also makes me a little bit worried like what if my ip address gets marked as a bot, you know  And I are there going to be forms that I can't submit  You know, I always get a little bit worried about these black box things where when I you know, and I don't know how it works

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you're stuck in in capture purgatory because no one wants to be stuck in capture purgatory  Yeah, maybe maybe some people in the chat room. I saw that that were proclaiming their love for captures

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't believe them. I always love the story though about how it was at louis van on who who  Did the captures where it was taking text from?  It was taking text from scanned books that they couldn't quite recognize it was a great story  It was like five years ago, but they would take the text books that couldn't get recognized  And it turned out the biggest use of capture was on porn sites  So he was causing all these people who wanted to get online porn to first help  Digitize all these classic works of literature  By filling out capture forms and then the capture form would help them like, okay, that's what that word is. So  It's so clever

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's really good might as well put the frustration to use  So and also so how about this  You finally thought the gangnam style was a thing of the past you were wrong youtube  Says that the video has been seen upwards of 2.15 billion times  So many in fact that it grew beyond its 32-bit integer of 2 billion 147 million 48  483 thousand six hundred forty seven as a result is throwing off the view count  So youtube took to google plus to announce that they are now forced to upgrade the system to account for videos  As popular as gangnam style, which how did we get here? How did we let this happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's like the y2k bug all over. Yes the the gangnam bug  the gangnam bug

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's really unfortunate. It's unfortunate. Um, yeah, there's not a whole lot to say about that to be honest  Uh  What am I missing here? What what things I know? Uh,  Jeff, I believe it was you put in this, uh material redesign of the google search page

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's it? What's it all about material design and redesign google to it  For those of you listening, it looks very flat and blue

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It looks kind of like what you would expect a google search page. That's been material redesign. Take a look. See what you guys think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's see here  My first reaction was  No, don't change my google  So that's old. I'm not sure that's normal comforting google. We all know and love right? Oh, yes, very familiar very stark

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  um, okay  A lot of shocking isn't it? Yeah a lot of  It is a lot of space. That's not real, right? No, no, no, it's just it was a

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's not do that proof of concept

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Danny's thinking he missed a scoop. No, don't worry, dami. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, does it hurt your brain a little bit? Yeah  Yeah, yeah a little too much kind of like white space spacing between

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't get nearly but here's the question is google due for a redesign. It's a good question. It is a good question

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a good question

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google has had a redesign a good constant redesign  If you want to see what google looks like you don't look at it on the desktop you look at on your ipad  True true and and in fact i've it's on my calendar. I never get to it, but I wanted to spend a week of dealing with  Google just on the ipad or just on mobile because it is a radically different experience both from the results that you're getting  To the presentation, but if you look on your thing, you'll see it's it's not material design so much as it is  Almost card-based design but that all flows in through  And you know you you see it first on mobile and then you see it come into the desktop. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it looks like a lot of ways to space although I really I really appreciate and like  Material design on my device, but I don't know if it necessarily  The browser version needs to be updated  It's just kind of a little too pretty too too pretty for google on the web when google for years and years and years has been  has kind of  symbolized  simplicity, you know just kind of getting right to the information that you're there to look for and that just  Feels pretty for for no real good reason. I guess

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's the craigslist thing right? Yes, exactly craigslist got redesigned. It would feel inauthentic. I'd be like oh bing  I must have gone to bing right like it's a little too too good looking  It doesn't feel like authentic google. I feel like google's search results on the desktop  Just get this weird pass around design like they're just like we're gonna keep doing the blue links  Because this is what it is I feel like it's just so it's just it's the brand

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And people don't feel necessarily like it has to change because it's worked so well up until now  I guess it would be changed for the sake of changing it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, and there's years and years and years of data collection and ab testing that that that you know  Went into every single pixel of the way it looks. I mean, I guess you could say that across every device, but I don't know  um, it's it's it's interesting, um, my my co-founder uses  anneal dash he uses the  Gmail for in the ipad view like everywhere, you know on his desktop everywhere  He just he just likes the way gmail works in the ipad view. So that's interesting. Danny  I think that would be kind of a a fun a fun piece

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's funny like gmail  You know my morning starts off dealing with my gmail on the ipad and it's so much more efficient than dealing with it on desktop  when i'm trying to get through all my stuff and it's all my tabs or whatever and  Yeah  What about inbox have you used inbox?  I don't know. In fact, I was just thinking today is inbox going to turn into being the google wave of gmail, but  That could just be me  I just it was so weird when I went to it first place and then also because I can't use it on a regular google  Like you can't of course you can't use it on google apps accounts  So I like i've been sending all my mail to a google account  but then I don't check that that often so it's hard to use on a regular basis and  It was just weird and I didn't know that weird was better  I actually kind of think the gmail app is a pretty good app, you know, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, you know what? The other thing is the the offline gmail app, which I of course use on on my chromebook  Is really good and by the way, it very easily and smoothly goes back and forth between the two accounts with no hiccups  No headaches, no problems whatsoever  The only problem is it's missing a little bit of functionality that your regular gmail app has  Otherwise I would switch to the offline app. It's pretty darn good and it's pretty

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know what? I I mean i'm on the mac and I I really loved airmail because it interacts with gmail really well  It doesn't have the tabs which I miss a little bit but  And i've gotten used to those tabs, but I I wish google would just make us apps  desktop  But you know, I found airmail and that takes care of me for my day-to-day stuff and but I have

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The inbox all right, what's that does it do the priority inbox? All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I haven't tried to use it  My you know on a typical day my inbox all in the day with only about 10 or 12 items in it  So i'm not I hate you. Yeah, I know  A few months ago I had  I hate you and it's every day. I hate you  And in fact, I was tweeting pictures of like if you're at inbox zero in the gmail app you get a little little sun  I go on and I like was seeing that every day and it made me feel so good and I tweeted out people like going  What what what is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A little sunshine it tells you go out and enjoy the day you're done like it's a great it's awesome messaging  You're done go out and enjoy the day and it's like yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If I were going to do an in an email app  I would probably have an email app that at the end of every week  Or two weeks would literally take whatever's here in your inbox and just throw it into an archive folder  And because you're never going to get back to that stuff  But you sit there like almost a slave to it like well, I know i'm going to get to do whatever  I would just throw it all away because you know  I did this talk once on my my things on the email engine like anything that's really important  That that you don't get to it's going to come back to you so leaving in your inbox doesn't help you in any way  You know, so just you archive all this stuff and all the weight is lifted off your shoulders  And you just focus on the other things and then I don't know there's other things like it  But yeah, sorry, so I don't need priority inbox so much

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Man that sounds like a beautiful place  Yeah, it sounds like a beautiful place to have a inbox zero  As much as I try as often as I try I can never get there and even if I get there, you know  Gina you're you're saying just get outside enjoy your day. That's what the sun signifies  That's only for like the next two minutes  And then suddenly it starts piling up again. It comes back

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It does and then you hate the first person who messes it up. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The emails just keep falling in it's just tetris. That's how I think about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I I think it was sisyphus in reverse the mountain keeps falling on you  You

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly, I actually like like  Inbox but I agree it needs to be on on my app's account for me to use it here at work where it's desperately needed  on my personal account it's neat and i've you know, i've  Removed my uh, when when I open my chrome browser, it automatically opens inbox instead of gmail  So that's nice. It forces me to kind of use it in mobile and on my phone and everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But i'm still not entirely 100 sold I never get why we have to be such a second-class citizen when we have apps accounts  I just don't get it  I I like I want to throttle somebody over google and the only reason I have a google apps account  Is because I want my domain name  I want my own email in my own domain name and back at the day  That was the only way you could do it so that when you would email people you didn't get back  Um, you know, it used to be that if you sent it out you could send it out from an email address  But if it wasn't actually through google apps then you get this little warning like this person is pretending to be something or whatever  Right, and I think they fixed that but there's this like middle ground  I feel like where they could take regular gmail accounts and let you use your own domain name and have a few more  Advantages where I could have the things I want without having to be this apps administrative person and all these oh  Oh, it just makes you want to cry. Here's my guess. Here's my guess

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've they've fixed it for two years  They're dog fooding it long since all through google and they keep it from us just so they can watch the show and laugh at us every week  And occasionally tweet pictures of it, but come on come on in the secret evil building on campus

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is just dedicated to you jeff  The jarvis room

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Um, I have one one quick story. I want to do real quick. Oh, yeah. Yeah, if you don't mind me interrupting  Just because we we talked about uh on this on a on an earlier episode  We've done a couple episodes talking about online harassment specifically on twitter and one of the points that jeff always made  Which I thought was such a good one was that on twitter to report harassment  You you could only only the person being harassed could make the report  Not people who are observing it which doesn't make any sense because you know in the real world if you're at the playground and you see  Someone bullying someone else you can step in and help out and twitter made a bunch of changes to their abuse reporting  This week or they announced them and I believe that they're rolling out now  Uh, but one of the changes that they made is that if you observe someone harassing someone else you can report that tweet as a  As a bystander as an observer, so I was I I'm slightly optimistic feeling slightly optimistic about that  But my conclusion is clearly twitter is watching this week in google. So hi twitter. Uh, good job and keep working on it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I talked to cbc about this today and quoted you quoted you often  Uh try to talk about you know, the difficulties that they have but yeah the the the it's almost as if I don't want to  Do a conspiracy theory twitter made it incredibly easy to report spam  One click boom done and I do it all the time because it helps me and it helps them  But incredibly difficult to report harassment imposters  Trolls and other things you had to go through so much effort. You just didn't bother  It's like they didn't want to know and then it got to the point and I think that the thing that you've emphasized so much  on the show  Um is that it's it's you're right. It's it's also about us all helping each other  by being able to report these people and being able to get somewhere with that and um  Yeah, I hope that they were listening to you  And and they should get smarter about this and and I think after the beheading videos and the naked celebrity photos  Twitter is no longer a 100 open network now. It's got to decide where the line is  But it's got to decide that with our help and they were not getting our help before they were not being helpful before it was  Far too difficult. There was one horrible. I'm gonna get my trouble right now with this one horrible  quit  Uh of troll who just keeps on resurfacing resurfacing and I try to do the all of twitter the favor of  Reporting them  Oh  Oh, we just lost jeff  Oh no

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That favor the favor that blaked out the video. What a what unfortunate timing for the video to go away  um  Maybe when we get him back he can finish that thought but just to kind of give you a sense of the rest of the stuff  That twitter's doing here fewer steps to report abuse  So they're kind of making it easier with fewer steps. Like you said letting bystanders flag posts they see as abuse  Um a blocked user's page and blocking users from viewing a person's profile when they've been blocked by that user  So I say I don't want that person to look at my profile anymore on my tweets  You can do that and uh, you know, it's not just a matter of me not seeing them anymore  Uh, they can't see my stuff  so powerful controls  Better. Yeah. Yeah getting better for sure. Definitely better and that's going to be available over the course of the next few weeks  And I really want to hear what what jeff had to say. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it was the troll who shall not be named. I've maybe got cut off. I mean the timing was just impeccable  That was amazing. I was like wow, no good deed

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'll see what happens there  All right  So let's uh, but thank you for for bringing that up because I did want to definitely mention that and I skimmed over it  So yeah, apologies for letting me interrupt. Okay, no problem. Carry on. Okay, so uh, jeena  We might as well start off with you. What uh, what's your tip?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So tip this week come from life hacker pretty good site there  So you could you could search for your email receipts right from google  This can help you out with expense reports or holiday shopping  You go to the google search box and you just type in my purchases. Uh, you will see  receipts, uh in your results from your gmail  Um, it's pretty it's pretty good and you can also like you you can um narrow the results  If you're like, hey just show me all my itunes purchases do my purchases itunes or amazon for example, and it'll only show you  uh  Receipts from from that and now of course you can you can search for receipts inside gmail as usual but pretty neat to see  Uh, I think it's pretty neat. I don't know. Some people might think this is creepy  But I think I think we're all sort of getting used to the idea now that that google has our gmail and it shows us  Some content from our gmail in our regular search results. Um, I think this is kind of neat kind of kind of helpful helpful  So it's my purchases when you're signed into google and you'll see your receipts  Uh in the search results

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Excellent and right about this time of year. That's super handy. Yeah, I feel like my inbox is  Overcome by receipts and uh and purchases and everything right now  Another good apple on those lines is slice actually which i'm reviewing this week for uh android app arena  Um actually later on today 4 30 pm pacific. Um, but uh, yeah, it's really good  Anything that you can do to kind of manage this influx of receipts particularly this time of year is super helpful  Um danny i'm trying to remember if I even gave you the heads up on a tip and if I didn't I completely apologize  Is there anything you want to kind of talk about or a tool or tip or anything along those lines?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sure, I can give some excellent. It's the uh, I got my little android snowman here

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ah nice, isn't it cute?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's not a tip but that's the introduction because um, it is that time of year again  We have the santa tracker out from google that went live two days ago where you can go over and  Basically, just wait until christmas eve and then you'll actually be able to go online and track for for santa using google's tool  And of course we have the traditional and the long-standing norad track santa site that has also gone up and that went up yesterday  In partnership with microsoft  So, you know for those of you that are just waiting to count down the days until the jolly old st nick comes  Uh, you can check out both of those sites  They both have uh games that you can play and things you can do with the kids apparently google's even got a little javascript  Course that uh kids can can play with as well  And that that's sort of it for the moment

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Excellent. Yep santa tracker is great. Um  And apparently, uh santa has his location sharing turned to on because we can follow his every move. So oh, yeah  Yeah, uh good on santa. Thank you for sharing santa

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We don't have jeff yet  We'll see if we can get him back for his number of the week  But I can uh, I can give you a cool tool  So, I don't know if you knew this but with lollipop one of the features that uh, you know  Not a lot of people heard about and maybe it has limited use case  But I think it's pretty neat is that lollipop enables you to record your video from your device  Natively without root before lollipop you had to do this with root access on your device  And it was kind of a you know roundabout sort of thing either that or you know use terminal and go to adb into a command  And you know real geeky stuff now. It's accessible to anybody. There's an app  There's a number of apps that are doing this. Uh, koj has his mirror app that that does this  There's also one that I was playing around with earlier called az screen recorder. No root  And you can you just install it. It's a free app. It has kind of overlay controls to allow you to  Record your screen and it also picks up audio from your  From your onboard microphone  so it's not recording the audio from internally inside your device because I think maybe that's  a way to kind of get around the the the fact that people you know could record video and audio from a movie or whatever and  And uh, you know rent it and do that. So maybe it's a copyright protection in that regard  But it does record audio from your mic  Which could be actually pretty handy if you're doing some sort of demo or whatever a walkthrough on an app that you've created if you're  a developer of an app  And you want to do a walkthrough and go step by step through your app. This is one easy way to do it  It was super super easy. There's actually a video link and brian. I know you're you're hard at work  Um, but before but below this the this link in the doc  There's a link to a video that I recorded of me playing of the new what is it? It's run  Run sack boy run for the playstation character and recorded this just in the device for  For about a minute you can activate it to show the touch controls so that it overlays on the top and uh,  Yeah, just a neat feature that you didn't have access to before lollipop. So at least not without root  So cool. Yeah, it's pretty awesome  Uh this app that recorded this is called az screen recorder though. There are a ton  Of apps that do this sort of thing. Uh, that's mobile twitcher coming  There we go. What's that mobile twitch? I suppose so although this is this is less live streaming and more  Uh recording and then posting later  Uh, who knows maybe that'll happen eventually. Um, I just made somebody a fortune. It's a big business

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, exactly. I never understand it, but it's a big business. Yeah. No, I believe me. I hear you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, it's good to have you back sir. Sorry that uh, the video dropped at exactly the wrong time  We that's okay. No other video was smarter to shut me up

Transcript:  Uh the timing though, fam  Uh, okay. Well you are welcome to finish the story or you can do your number. It's up to you. Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll do a number. Um, so uh, one of the big things in the advertising world right now is what's called viewability  That is to say was your ad actually seen the thing you paid for?  And and google put out a spreadsheet that's on the rundown but the shocking stat in it, which is you know  Full disclosure is that 56 percent of ads served by google by double click are not seen  And so that's that's a huge issue in the media world now because it's it's an instant deflator  To all the money they used to make and the truth is the advertisers before kind of discounted  On that basis same way with they do with print where not everybody sees every ad  Yeah, we know you tell us they do either they don't  But but now of course you can count and you can you know places like chartbeat can tell you what's seen in analytics  Can tell you what's seen and 56  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This google's shutting him down again. This just never happens with jeff's video  Of course. Well 56 something smart i'm assuming is what he was going to continue with because jeff is a smart guy  uh  Okay, and brian's working overtime right now uh scrambling
