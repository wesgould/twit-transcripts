Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thanks for having me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think this is your first time on Twig, is it not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I believe it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Welcome. Good to have you.  And I see that he has brought his boxing gloves.  So watch out, everybody.  Also joining us, Gina Tripani from SmarterWear.org and former founder of Lifehacker.  She's, of course, the creator of ThinkUp app.  And I forgot to ask you last week, did you meet the pres when you were at the White House?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't. I didn't meet the president, but I met CTO United States and I met the first lady's chief of staff.  No bow sightings either.  I didn't see the dog.  But I did get to step into the West Wing momentarily, which was exciting.  Yeah, you don't normally get to go there.  Yeah, no, you don't.  The president was definitely hard at work because the Secret Service guy looked like he was about to tackle me.  You don't look right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Whoever you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because I look really intimidating.  Yes.  He looked very intimidating, though, so I stepped carefully.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tread softly.  Yes.  To my right, Mr.  Jeff Jarvis, who is calling from Switzerland, from Davos, where he is hanging with the big Mucky Mucks at the World Economic Forum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's cold here. I got to have a hat on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a good hat. Is that the hat that has the built-in earpiece earmuffs?  Yeah.  Isn't that cool?  I'm getting those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When I was with Matthew Ingram in Victoria, BC.  Wow.  Small world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It wasn't that cold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but I'm sure it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What you said, six feet of snow in the last two weeks.  Yeah.  And by the way, Gina, I was invited to a meeting with the CTO today in Washington and I was already committed to come here and it about killed me.  I came here and stood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, is it an election year or something?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All these bloggers are at the White House.  Every four years, bloggers get to go to the White House.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think after SOPA, we'll get to go a lot more often.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe.  Yeah.  The power of the blog.  Also here, and it looks like he's at Macworld Expo because I see the jukebox Marriott behind him.  Mr. Kevin Marks of Salesforce.com and Tellmul Vision TV.  Hello, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hi there.  I'm on top of the center.  I'm in the Yerba Buena Gardens, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And are you there for Macworld or something else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, I just picked this place as a nice place to sit and chat because I couldn't I found that all the offices were booked.  Perfect.  All the meeting rooms are booked in Salesforce.  Perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's next to the Metreon.  It is.  You'll see an IMAX film.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So there's also this sort of really weird view down here of like doesn't look like San Francisco.  It's full of churches and things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you're in the Yerba Buena Center, which was really quite a great redevelopment project.  And they put the Moscone Center underneath this garden on top.  And it's nice.  It's pretty.  The Museum of Modern Art is over there.  And of course, as you can see, the reason why they call it the jukebox Marriott, it looks like a jukebox.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Anyway, welcome all.  The big story, I don't think there's any question about it this week.  And it's all started with the Washington Post a couple of days ago.  Washington Post published an article I thought was a little sensationalistic.  I'd love to get your take on it saying, oh, my God, Google is going to update their privacy policies.  And somehow they left the conclusion that because of this, the changes were going to make that all of a sudden they were going to aggregate everything they know about you and you couldn't opt out of it.  Now, I just scan them because they just they have published them now on the official Google blog.  And I just scanned them.  And it doesn't seem like that Washington Post article was justified.  Anybody dissent disagree?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cashmere Hill did a very good story on that, just saying that they didn't really change their policy.  They changed some execution of it, but they've always said that they were going to combine stuff.  And it only makes sense that they would.  That's the point of Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What are you going to do? Build a firewall between your stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is this is the insanity of the privacy insanity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it makes sense. In fact, I think it's an improvement to have a unified privacy policy.  That's what's unified now. Right.  We have one privacy policy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right across all the products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's they inherited some from the companies they bought that were different.  I think YouTube had a different one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ah, it's right.  Right. Some each product, some of the products had different ones.  You know, I fell into the headline trap about this yesterday where I was like, this is terrible.  Google's being aggressive and making this horrible change that you can't opt out of.  And this is totally against their entire ethos about user control and openness.  And, you know, this is terrible.  It's so Facebook like.  And then I actually read about it.  I think Peter Kafka did a good piece where it was like, you know,  Google maintains an archive of all their privacy policies over time.  And they've always said that they may, you know, use data from other services,  usage, behavioral data from other services that they mean, we obviously know they can.  It's all one company. And now they're saying they may.  And this consolidation just makes that very clear. Right.  So that may not have been laid out very clearly in separate in different product privacy policies.  But now there's one privacy policy and it makes it really clear.  So nothing has really changed.  I mean, I was thinking, you know, a few days ago before the story broke,  if someone had asked me, does Google take the things you do on YouTube  and use it to inform the ads it shows you in Google search?  I would have said, well, of course, certainly they can.  And I don't see why they wouldn't. It's all one company.  I mean, you know, it's all one company's product.  So, you know, what's the big deal?  But then they announced this change, which is them being upfront and saying,  hey, this change is going to happen in a month or two.  You know, it's going to be the same for everywhere.  And we're just being really clear and consolidating 60 documents.  They're being transparent, right?  They're being transparent.  You know, you can you can just close your account if you don't like it,  which, you know, they didn't quite say that.  But that was what the non opt out piece of that sensationalist headline came from.  In the end, I was like, this isn't this is really isn't that big a deal.  Just the timing was bad after Search Plus Your World.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, that's what I think.  I think what's interesting is how people's perceptions have changed.  And I think it's partly because of Google Search Plus Your World.  I think some people, at least, are a lot more sensitive about  is Google doing this stuff for me or is it doing it for its own purposes?  So before they might have thought, oh, Google just shows me the results  that are really relevant to me, except now they're thinking, oh, no,  Google's showing me Google Plus results because that's what they want.  So now they're they're distorting things in a way to their own benefit.  So whereas before, someone, you know, someone might have said, oh,  I think Google, you know, is pretty fair with my privacy.  I think now they're a little bit more suspicious  if they're going to share all that information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry, go ahead.  I visited the Munich offices of Google this week, and those are the guys.  It's almost all privacy because they're on the front line of privacy in Germany.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In Blermony, yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And interestingly, you know, as I was talking to him in part about the need  to not just talk about transparency and talk about benefits,  but also to create more products that have benefits.  And they said, interestingly, after all the furor over the fair pixel  owns wrecked of Street View and and and wave and all that  Google priority inbox, Germans love it.  Nary a complaint.  And, you know, and they're Google's reading your email.  Know what they're doing.  But the value is so high, nobody pitches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I've talked to some Germans, including Chris Marquardt,  who's a regular contributor here, lives in Tubingen.  He said, you know, I don't think the German public share this fear  that the German government has.  The German public loves Google and loves to use it.  Now, let me let me this is the article that raised people's ire,  including yours, Gina, on The Washington Post yesterday.  Google announces privacy changes across products.  Users can't opt out. That's the headline.  Cecilia Kang writing, she says, the Web giant announced Tuesday  it plans to follow the activities of users across nearly all of its ubiquitous sites,  including YouTube, Gmail and its leading search engine.  Google has already been collecting some of this information,  but for the first time is combining data across its websites  to stitch together a fuller portrait of users.  It says consumers who are logged into Google services  won't be able to opt out of the changes which take a first effect.  March 1st is any of that wrong?  That's not factually in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think it's the first time they've shared information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and I, you know, we've look, I don't want to be an apologist for Google  by any means, but we've shared this Google dashboard many times,  google.com slash dashboard.  When you log into your account, Google has been more transparent than almost.  Look, this is my general response to people when they come to me.  In fact, somebody, a friend of my doctor said today, he said, what should I do?  And I said, you know, who knows more about you than Google?  Oh, your Internet service provider. What's their privacy policy? Right.  Do they have one? They know more than what you do.  This is only stuff you visit on Google.  And Google is very, I think, upfront about exposing what they know in this dashboard.  Is there any contention that this dashboard is not full, complete and accurate?  I think I think that's what I've heard. Right.  Kevin, what's your thought on it?  You actually worked for the evil. I mean, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I think that they've historically they bought the proteins with fairly  independent and there was there wasn't as much coordination as they could have  been. And one of the things that changes Larry Fashtag is that they are trying to  focus this stuff more.  And, you know, the way the black bar stuff, the logins and the Google plus  everywhere is part of that.  And I think the price price policy is another aspect of that.  If they're going to start actually coupling all the products together much more  consistently, then converging that makes sense, too.  And I think, you know, historically, there were a bunch of different product teams  that come from acquisitions and things and had some variations in privacy policy  and in profiles as well.  Google has still has several different profiles.  There's profiles on blogger, profiles on YouTube and the sort of core profiles that  are on the other services. And they're trying to converge those as well.  So I suspect this is this is sort of reflecting that general management effort  to make Google more coherent and more one Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're exactly right, Matthew. I mean, I mean, Kevin, you know, when I went out for  book talk at Google HQ, they were in the middle of privacy week and they have these  principles of privacy. When I went to the Munich headquarters, they're up on the walls.  They're really working very hard.  And, you know, we can we can criticize Google for other things.  But I think compared to Facebook, compared to Twitter, compared to your ISP, Google's  been doing better work. But it's just this this reflexive Google hatred that takes  over the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's. I mean, I think it is the perception.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry. Go ahead, Matthew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think the perception is changing and I think things like Google Search plus your  world are doing that.  I think people are questioning.  So they're they're losing a little bit of trust, maybe that Google is doing this for  their benefit or being as open and transparent as possible.  I think that's a real problem for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is, Matthew. But but then again, you know, Facebook is using everything you tell  them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Facebook doesn't have to say, oh, we're going to combine information from your  profile and your fan page.  Of course, they are.  But Google is always different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. People always assume Google was better, you know, more objective, more in it  for you. Right.  Kind of for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they are in it. That's the point, Matthew.  They are in it for us. Why are they doing this stuff?  Not just for advertising, but they're going to focus and give us a better service.  And again, I'm sound like a fan boy, even though I am one.  But they're going to use this information to give us more relevant results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, OK, M.G.  Siegler said an interesting thing.  He said and this is relevant to the conversation we had last week, which was about  search plus your world.  And we talked a lot about last week on Twitter and on this show in negative terms.  He said, look, it's Google's a private enterprise.  They have the right to do what they can to maximize profits.  My only issue and I think this is I would agree with him is it makes the search  results less good. And we showed that when you search for Mark Zuckerberg instead of  some sites that might legitimately tell you about Mark Zuckerberg, what you get is  Mark Zuckerberg's Google Plus account where he has never posted anything.  So clearly that's not as good a search result in.  And Google's doing that in order to promote their own product.  So they're they're trading promotion for quality.  And that's what M.G. said. And I agree with him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, there was a sense of betrayal there for.  Yeah, but it's the right to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's their right to do it.  I think that they're to be commended for being clear about what they're collecting  and give you a privacy policy.  What's unfortunate is there isn't any really credible competition for Google,  certainly no competition that's not doing the same thing.  Bing's doing the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think if you look at I don't want to get too much into the Google search plus  your world again, but if you look at what they've said, what they've said about why  or how they don't favor Google Plus, some of that is if not outright lying, then  clearly just, you know, twisting the truth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We should have had you here last week, Matthew, because we had Matt cuts on.  Now, he admittedly this is in his division and he wasn't speaking for Google in this  case. But he did make the argument, which I found somewhat credible.  We don't want to base social results on something we can't control.  And we learned that from Twitter, our experience with Twitter, we can't control  that data. We can't control the Facebook data.  So we have to use our own social graph.  At least we control that. Is that not a you believe that's disingenuous?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's I think that's disingenuous.  No, they can't they can't control the Web and they base their index on the web.  So that's yes, there's noise there.  Right. Ridiculous.  The focus on the user thing, the thing that Facebook and Twitter and Codes put up  to point this out is really interesting.  I don't know if you've played with that.  Because what they what they did, you can read the JavaScript.  What they do is they do the Google Plus your world search and then they if you  click their bookmark, they go into a plain Google search from the API and they  replace the Google Plus results with things that rank higher for that person  that come from social networking sites and the results get better.  If it fixes the Zuckerberg problem, it fixes a bunch of these other things.  It stops pointing to Google Plus, affirmatively.  Now, that is making it clear that Google's got the thumb on the scales for Google  Plus, but we knew that.  And I think Matt was being a bit disingenuous about that.  But the other half of this is that Twitter and Facebook do make it hard to call them  now. Yes.  They if you actually try and pull Facebook down with with curl, it says this is your  browser is not supported.  You know, they explicitly send you a not supported page unless you lie about what  browser you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You could cut the audio on this, John.  I'm just showing the video from this is the focus on the user dot org if you want to  know more. And they give an example, as you were saying, and you could do your own  searches of if you search for Hugh Jackman on Google Plus versus Hugh Jackman, which  is in an actual search result, the results are somewhat different.  Go ahead. I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to interrupt you.  San Francisco Fire Department of the United May indeed choose to interrupt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And so the thing is that Twitter puts no follow on all outbound links and it also  roots them all through T.C.O.  Now. So that's basically saying to Google's indexer, do not follow this link.  You're saying you're saying Twitter, not Google.  Twitter, Twitter puts no follow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twitter does no follow and does and uses their own shortening and cut off the fire

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  hose. All three.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. So the fire hose is a he said she said thing about that.  But it's negotiation.  Yeah.  Yeah. Basically, Twitter jacked up the price and Google bought the price.  But who knows what was doing, you know, sort of who was deciding what there.  But it is a massive shame.  Losing that real time search is a big hole in Google's results.  And that's right about that.  That was a beautiful feature that they had to take away because Twitter pulled the plug  on the contract or Google refused to pay it or whichever way around it is.  But they were able to crawl.  They are able to crawl Twitter.  The Twitter guy said you've crawled one hundred and fifty million pages of Twitter last week.  What are you complaining about?  Right.  The answer is they're complaining that they cannot get links out from Twitter because  Twitter is no following them all, which is I had a bit of a back and forth with Sam  Polaroid Twitter on this because the no follow thing was originally designed for third party  content.  So the idea of if you've got a blog post that has comments on it, the no follow was designed  to go on links that are in your comments that weren't posted by you, but not on links.  So you don't get a page rank.  So that you're not accidentally getting page rank to spammers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this was an extension that Google created and promoted.  Yes.  In a way to keep people from artificially boosting Google juice by posting on other  people's blogs.  And now Twitter is using this in a way that wasn't intended.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Twitter is doing it because Google wants them to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Twitter is awkward because it doesn't have that second party, third party distinction  because there isn't a distinction between a comment and a post.  So a tweet from me is from me, but a response from you to it is still a tweet from you.  And there's two things going on here.  One is that Google assigns page rank for the whole domain and they can't distinguish  between Twitter.com slash Kevin Marks, Twitter.com slash Jeff Jarvis easily.  That's what they say. That's what Max says about this.  But here's the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's say Twitter reversed their policy and Facebook reversed their policy.  Would Google really even want this?  Isn't that it?  They say they do.  Yes.  Don't they really prefer it?  Because it's more stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but don't they really prefer it?  No, because they're the search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Go ahead, Ben.  We've been to Google, right?  I mean, these engineers fix these search results with one

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  like JavaScript file.  This focus on the user weekend project is a bookmark list.  It's so funny.  Yeah.  And they have a lot.  I mean, right.  I mean, it really was a very, very good.  It was a really, really good project that made a really good point, which was like,  if a bookmark can figure out that this famous chef updates his Twitter profile a lot more  than he does his Google Plus profile.  And that if you search for him, his Twitter profile should show up first.  Then Google certainly can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's say it's even better than that.  They're actually using Google's signals to do that.  They're using Google's raw search ranking to decide which one to replace it with.  So I'll give you an example here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is this is a search, John, if you pull up my page on music as as revealed by search  plus your world, you see on the right people and pages on Google Plus, Britney Spears.  I don't even know who David Guetta is and Lil Wayne.  Lady Gaga noticed she wasn't on this list, so she suddenly joined Google Plus.  Now I click the Don't Be Evil link and these are massaged by focus on the user.  And and now we actually get something completely different.  We get some songs.  I'm not sure how this is improved.  This is my space.  How is Britney Britney's my space and David Guetta.  So what they did is they replaced Google Plus with my space.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, for music, but not for because according to what are first, you know, right.  Because it shows us what has the most page rank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, let me look at let me look up Obama.  That would be presumably not going to give me my space, right?  I don't get any Google Plus results here.  So maybe they maybe they aren't evil when you search on the president.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, if you search for cooking cooking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, let's try that cooking.  And now I'm getting Jamie Oliver, Alton Brown and Leal.  Oh, by the way, I'm getting ads.  OK, Lee Allison from Google Plus.  Let's let's de-evilize it.  I love that bookmark.  And now we're getting Facebook, Twitter, plus my space.  We're getting Twitter tweets.  Yeah, LinkedIn, much better.  And that's funny because Google has that information.  That's the point. Right.  Yeah. So so that just answered the question.  If Google had the information, would they want to use it?  No. They want to promote Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that was the argument Matt made was that if they can't reliably have it,  I'm not justifying it.  But he was saying that they're not going to include it as a feature  unless they know that that feature is secure.  I'm not I'm not judging because I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  One of the other things they did last week was deprecate the social graph API.  That was sort of buried in their list of things they were getting rid of.  And that really worries me because the social graph API  was the thing that Brad Fitzpatrick wrote that crawls  the realm, me and Ralph Friend links on the web to construct  a social graph from the public web.  It's kind of useful. You put your URL in that and it tells you what other  URLs are yours that are connected by real me links.  And you can see who you've linked to my friend links.  But what happened and that was that was what was used for the previous social  search. If you actually go back, go to the old S2 social search thing,  it will still show you that graph.  But they basically said we're taking this API away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know, because I because I added all those links.  Yes, all the real me links to my sites some time ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that's that's the point. This is how you do distributed social.  That was the point of that spec from that's a 2003 spec.  So why did they deprecated? Did they say?  Usage now part of the reason they deprecated is that when Twitter went to new,  new Twitter, all the real all the real me sorry, not all the real me,  but the real me links is still there.  But the real friend links all went away and Twitter's connection graph  is no longer crawlable. If you actually look at the robots.txt,  the the following pages are behind a login  and they don't want you crawling that.  So basically, you cannot crawl the link graph of Twitter anymore,  which means that this is not no longer driving link graphs from Twitter.  And I think possibly having problems with Facebook as well.  Facebook does show that, but they never showed Facebook never showed you  all the friends. They would only show you like five of them on the page  that was probable. And so it has to statistically accumulate them over time  or something. So the link graphs of now are no longer part  of the public web from either of those companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Their excuse is the API is an experiencing the kind of adoption we'd like,  which is true. I doubt very many people did what I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's still cost them making me keep it running. You know, that's the thing.  It is. The thing is, it's a very useful.  I wrote those some apps there, so I'm probably biased here.  But it is useful because it's actually quite hard and expensive to crawl the web.  And so to follow all those links with your own crawler to say, OK,  I've got Leo Laporte's page, whatever is the rest of his pages,  that would involve me visiting all those web pages and following all the me links  and deriving it. Google already does that.  They crawl the entire web all the time.  So caching that for other people is a really useful service.  It's basically taking Google's crawl and giving something back.  So dropping that, I think is a shame.  I can sort of see why, because the other companies haven't necessarily kept this up.  But it's still a step away from the open web.  The other the other link thing, the no follow piece is  Twitter is not passing through page rank to anything that's posted on Twitter.  When they when Google had the had the firehose, they were using those links,  but they're now strictly obeying the no follows that Twitter puts on,  which means there's no page rank flowing from Twitter to Foursware or Instagram,  or anything like that.  And I had this conversation with Dennis Crowley of Foursware yesterday,  but they they get a lot of traction from links being posted on Twitter,  but they're not getting they're not showing up on the search because of it,  because those links that link is not counted by Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Kevin, doesn't I mean, wasn't the no follow,  isn't that something that Google requires so that you don't flow page rank to things?  Doesn't it penalize you if you flow page rank to things that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  there's a mess there and it you know, it needs updating.  It will be good to get, you know, Matt Cutts in a room with  the people at Twitter who were responding in that sense.  But yeah, the issue is that  what you know, what Google really needs to make sense of Twitter in its terms  is to understand the links between the different Twitter profiles  and the links that are tweets and retweets so that it can build a trust,  you know, a page rank trust for the for the Twitter set of pages.  And without those follow links, it cannot get the  who's more interesting because they got more followers type information out of it.  And they and they because they're not allowed to flow page rank  from the tweets to the links in the tweets, they can't use the sort of trending links  there as a signal anymore, which means that posting a link on Twitter is not helping  people find it on Google. And that's a problem.  And I think that I wrote something recently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think both Google and Twitter and all their users are the ones who suffer.  I mean, you know, I wrote a whole blog post about the relationship between these two  companies feeling like a couple that has broken up or, you know, a couple that's  divorcing. You've got Google saying it's your fault and Twitter saying, no, no, it's  your fault. And Google's saying, well, you left first and Twitter's like, well, you  didn't, you know, you were seeing other social networks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you know, I don't think we're being tough enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But to me, the bad part is users are the ones who  users are the ones who suffer.  Twitter has virtually no useful search.  Let's face it, their search doesn't show up things that only last for like five days, I  think. Now, it's basically useless.  So then you have to go to Topsy, which is OK, but it's not great.  If Google had that firehose, it would be fantastic.  It would be great for Google users.  It would be great for Twitter users.  But I think we know here we are watching mom and dad fight over the kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go ahead, Jeff. We've got to ask a question about about Twitter here.  And I'm not trying to attack Twitter.  I'm just saying Google always gets under the the laser light and then Facebook gets  under the laser light. Twitter generally doesn't.  And I still go back and Gina, you've defended Twitter, but I still think that Twitter  behavior toward its developers is pretty schmucky.  Yes. And the Twitter doing things like being passive aggressive and assisting its own  clients to not do retweet the way the whole world wants retweet done and stuff.  And then, you know, yeah, there's back and forth between mom and dad.  You're right, Matthew, in terms of the firehose.  But Twitter should want to say you should be able to find tweets, our tweets.  They're our tweets anywhere.  They're not Twitter's tweets. Damn it.  And so I just think we need to put a little a little more attention on Twitter and ask  whether they're being good or evil.  And I'm not answering the question, but I want to ask it more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If we pose this question two or three years ago, remember Bear Hug Camp with Steve  Gilmore? We went there. We covered it live.  I've been saying this all along that we could we should do another bear hug camp.  I mean, at that time, Steve was upset about the loss of track.  But really, the issue is that Twitter guard is silos.  This information. Yeah.  A very interesting article on TechCrunch from Devin Coldway, who says that Google  going evil has become the Godwin's law of tech commentary.  I love that. He says that basically what's happened is there's bias.  People want so badly for Google to do something truly evil,  that they're they're actually expecting it.  And so that's why you get things like, oh, my God, they did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's really bad in Europe.  But you're right. The Washington Post has did it this week.  Yeah, I love that. Godwin's law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Godwin's law. It's so true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was saying on Twitter yesterday that like at Google's values, like I prefer  this is a very general statement, but I prefer Google's values  over their products and Apple's products over their values.  So whenever I feel like Google's values are compromised, I freak out  because because I feel like, you know, Google is sort of the conscience  of the industry, whereas Apple is kind of the forefront of design.  So, you know, I would be just as quick to point out if Apple made a crappy product.  I'm still waiting for that to happen.  Well, I mean, that's a good point.  That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We expect Apple to be evil, right?  We expect Apple to do things that are only in its interests.  But we always expect that Google we've sort of held it to a higher standard.  And so when it gets below that, I think people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm going to see Schmidt and company here at Davos on Friday.  Is there any question that you want to deputize me to ask?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, this is a good one to start with.  This is Sarah Lacey writing in the new Pando Daily, which has issues,  which we'll talk about at some point.  But she does point out.  She does. I mean, I guess what you should say is consider the source.  But she does point out that Chris Saka, who's probably an investor in Pando Daily,  daily has says that three Googlers is everybody an investor.  Everybody is. If you're on if you're on page.  What is it? Page Mill Road?  You're you're an investor.  She apparently Larry Page to Googlers is the headline.  If you don't get search plus your world work somewhere else.  Apparently, at a Friday staff event after the launch, he said,  and this is a quote, but again, kind of unsourced.  This is the path we're heading down, a single, unified,  beautiful product across everything.  If you don't get that, you should probably work somewhere else.  Well, this is Apple's value seeping into Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Like this is this is how I read that.  I that that worried me.  I was like, oh, these are these are Apple's values, keeping on to Google.  And that's something that I've actually I think Google has a lot to learn from Apple,  as I think Apple has a lot to learn from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But aren't they saying this to not just their employees, but users as well?  And this is the thing that bugs me a little bit.  Hey, you can opt out. Stop using Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now we see Leo, you're you're you're you're you're hit the wall there.  You're going you're a little bit far.  What they're saying to employees is that we've been saying  that Google doesn't have a strong enough strategy that was all over the map.  So now they're on the map and you're saying, oh, well, we don't like this map.  It's it's it's their map.  Nikesha was at the DLD Conference in Munich  a couple of days ago and I heard him talk.  And obviously he's given the company in line.  The company line is that we're moving as a whole here, not just Google,  but as a whole from the information age back to people.  And and that's where Google is and that's where the strategic view is.  And we like or dislike it.  But it's a corporate strategy that they're saying, you know, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is a good and that is a good goal.  I mean, what he's describing search plus your world is actually a great idea, I think.  Having social search results in your in your search results,  but they're not doing what they claim to be doing.  So they're not right.  They're not executing well, broad enough search and they're not ranking it  the way they do other things.  And that's what I agree that shows you.  I agree.  You do what they're saying they're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you can't you can't reduce the number of choices, right?  Like you can't offer something like if you were selling a product,  you can't offer a product for free and then make it cost money.  Like the psychological impact of that is people people get upset.  You know, Google's, you know, has always been about choice and control and openness.  And I think that, you know, the no opt out part of the privacy policy headline,  the sensationalist headline is the thing that got me because I thought, hey,  you know, Google is all about choice and control.  And now they're not right.  Apple's never about choice and control.  Apple starts out with CRM and then they remove it.  How you don't have it the other way.  You know, you know, lots of choices and now they're reducing choices.  So so the feeling I agree that it's the right path,  but it's why people are freaking out because you can't you know,  you don't want to raise prices.  So it's just a different it's a.  They are going to suffer through these kinds of PR problems  regularly if it keeps going this way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This reduction and saying you can stop using all Google's products, that's great.  So I can't use any Google service if I don't want to have my information shared.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, can you opt out?  Can I if I log out, do I not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can log out, right? You log out, right?  You know, none of this kicks in.  And also something important to note,  double click cookie tracking and Google Analytics tracking  is not covered underneath this new privacy policy change.  Like that's totally separate things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it doesn't sound too truthfully, what really happened here  is that Google kind of made some technical changes that this is  completely separate from search plus your world.  I realize we've got two conversations going on here,  but it made some technical changes that allowed them to unify all this data.  And as a result, they've given us a unified privacy policy.  And under normal circumstances, people would say that's great.  Now we want a simple, normal.  This is what you ask of Facebook, isn't it?  Give us a policy that's universal and clear.  So we understand it.  Google's policy isn't changing, by the way.  Somebody I've lost the article now, but somebody did a search back to 2005.  It's been doing the same basic policy all along.  It's just now. Yeah, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But so I think it shows that shows the response, I think shows  that Google has lost some trust.  What's the matter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, no, I think you're right and wrong in terms of the recent  search plus stuff in our circles.  I don't think that's really in the world yet in our circles.  Yeah, we're kind of a little suspicious.  But in general, there's just this general Godwin's law when it comes to Google  that they're big and big is bad.  And almost anti-capitalist at some point over here in Europe.  And I see it all the time.  And I don't think that's because of anything they've done.  I think that's just because they're big and successful.  And it was Microsoft before him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although, you know, I have to say, my daughter, my 18 year old daughter  said to me, what's going on with Google?  Why are they pulling all my information and not letting me opt out?  You know, still, but that's my doctor saying it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's like my doctor saying he's not a techie.  But he says, I'm a doctor.  I don't want I have to be very careful about what's online with me.  Now, should I worry?  Should I stop using Google?  This is the universal response to this.  But you're right, it's the press.  It's Washington Post specifically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's government, too.  That's again, I'm seeing that Europe will get to it in a few minutes.  But over here in Europe, it's there's just awful sopa squared stuff happening with this.  And it's going to affect not just Google, but every the whole entire internet  is getting foodies. And it will be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It will be interesting to see how Google's new pool, all your information  and do whatever we want with it is going to fly with European regulators.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And let's be honest, as you point out, Matthew, in your article on GigaOM.  This Don't Be Evil plugin was written by one of the developers, works for Facebook.  So it's not it's also Facebook, right?  It's also company editors, it's Twitter and Facebook saying Google's being evil.  And I think that's really that's really what we're seeing, by the way.  I mean, let's let's really be honest is intense competition among Facebook,  Google, Twitter.  You can include some other companies in on that.  And and in Microsoft and as the competition ramps up,  companies start acting more in their own interest.  They're fighting it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's what it's been across against cable industry and telephone industry.  It's going to get stronger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, of course. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And let's face it, that's why Google added.  That's why Google Plus was created in the first place. Right.  It's not because Google suddenly felt that it had to let you share photos  of your cat with everyone.  It was because they wanted to get those social signals that they could use  to improve search, improve targeting and so on.  And that's the holy grail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is something that happened.  And I don't know what happened, but something happened  maybe because the stakes are so high all of a sudden.  But a couple of years ago, we all observed this.  There was suddenly this kind of animosity.  Apple hates Google.  I mean, really hates Google.  Facebook really hates Twitter.  I mean, there was this battle all of a sudden among these companies  where in the past, there might have been some sort of sense of kind of  we're all in it together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, is there any hope that SOPA brings us back together for a group hug?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I just want to say one thing.  Isn't that what we all say we want?  We want competition.  Isn't competitive.  Isn't that what we're all talking?  And we don't want monopoly.  We want competition.  So a stronger Google and a stronger Facebook is good for the users, isn't it?  Good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's why Google putting its thumb on the scale is so important.  But Facebook is the balance.  Facebook puts its thumb on the scale.  And they're using their search market position to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, but Facebook puts its whole fist on the scale.  But Twitter puts its whole fist on the scale.  Admittedly, it doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They don't control 60% of the search market.  Kevin, Marks, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So yes, Jeff, they do.  But Google doing it too doesn't make it better.  It makes it worse.  Maybe Google is somewhat poking at Facebook, Twitter, saying,  make yourself more crawlable, please, so that we can crawl you better.  That's clearly part of what Matt was saying last week.  That they don't have specialized access.  They have to have to crawl them.  But they're calling them in the constraints of what they publish.  So there is definitely that.  And as you said previously, Facebook has briefed against them and said,  Oh, look, Google is pulling your private Facebook data out  when it was actually the stuff that was public.  So there is that.  Yes, there's animosity there.  But the kind of competition you want is not sort of,  you know, attacking competition.  You want competition where they're competing to serve us better,  not where they compete to attack the right of the picture.  Exactly.  The difference is the difference between the old browser wars,  where it was use our browser because we've got these special features  the other guys don't have and the new browser wars,  which is use our browser because we're implementing the open standards  of the web better than the other guys and it's more responsive.  And we want to move to that kind of competition,  as opposed to the competition of we're doing this thing just to spite each other.  So there's a way of doing competing in a sort of positive  some way as opposed to a negative some way.  And that's that's the piece that's probably the thing that makes me  most sad about this is that we're losing  we're losing a lot of the open web of this stuff.  There is this competition for quality, really social insiders.  Yeah.  Now, we had we had this sort of very distributed  graph of information that was the blogosphere,  that was the equivalent of what we use Twitter for now.  And I was able to write a search engine at Technorati that could crawl that  because it was all in public and it was on multiple people's service.  And, you know, no one company controlled all of it.  There are a few companies that were fairly big that you had to deal with specially.  But we could do that now.  That stuff is not crawlable in the same way.  And the other thing is we had a convention for pinging to say something is new.  Something has changed. Come and crawl this now,  which meant that Technorati didn't have to pull the entire web.  We were told by by the blog software when something had changed.  That piece is is a big chunk of what Google got from the fire hose was  and a note, you know, notation that these things have changed now.  If they do it with standard crawl, they've got to basically keep hitting pages  and guessing when they've changed, that they don't get that feed of updates.  And we don't have well, we that's not quite true.  We do have a standard for how to do this with PubSubHubbub.  But that is designed for a distributed world, not for the centralized worlds  where you really do need a feed from one company to the other to make it useful.  And the other part of this is that Google Plus itself  doesn't have a good API for this or rather the Google Plus API  has a 5000 calls a day limit, which means you can't  get firehose access to Google Plus.  And it was responses, well, cool, it's like we crawl the web.  It's like, well, yeah, but we don't actually have the infrastructure to do that.  It would be nice if you set an example by making your API available, too.  That's a great point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me OK, let me wrap up this conversation by asking each of you.  Has Google changed?  What has changed?  Is this a different is this a suddenly evil Google, Kevin Marks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think it's a suddenly evil Google.  I think it's it's a it's a suddenly more insular Google  or more obviously insular Google.  They're starting to say, oh, right, we'll do this ourselves  because you won't cooperate with us.  And I get you know, I sense that frustration.  I was I was there when we were having versions of these battles with Facebook,  where Facebook would say, no, you can't call rape.  I stop it.  And so, you know, eventually.  And then it was like, OK, you say we violate in terms of service.  What could we change to not violate them?  We're not telling you.  So those those kinds of sort of bad blood conversations have happened.  And the the way the way forward for me is  to make this part of the open web, to make this stuff out there in public  that people can make sense of.  And that's the bit that's that's being that's being lost in these battles.  People are sort of cutting off access to each other's stuff.  And that's that's the piece that  Google is being more aggressive in those terms.  And that's the piece that this  work for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Has has Google changed, Jeff Jarvis?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think Google has not learned grace.  I think the problem is that's nerds are not graceful, let's face it.  No. And and and and they're creating a new feature,  which I think we would intellectually agree is the right direction for them  and the right direction for the Internet is headed.  And we've been saying this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We've been saying this all year that they have to have social. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they're doing two things wrong when they're doing it clumsily.  And I think that, you know, again, I'll defend the beta view.  I can defend that part.  But what I think they've got to learn is and I and I and I and I'm  too much, but they've got to learn how to be more graceful  in terms of how they speak with the public.  And and and they haven't learned that.  Now, part of that, the bad part of that is they become pure PR speak.  I don't want them to become fake about it, but I want them to be more human  and realize Nikesh Arora was at DLD and he was very, very good.  But he came up with a line.  I thought, oh, there's an Eric line where he said, well,  you're not going to have a good experience on the Web if you're anonymous.  He said it worse. He said, you can't be you're going to have to  be anonymous of the Web won't work.  I thought, oh, boy, where does it go?  But I knew what he was saying.  He was saying, you're not going to have a less good experience.  But they've got to think this through first and realize how they're seen  and become graceful out of that.  And they're not. So I think that the changes they're making are not evil.  They're clumsy, but clumsy and potentially a very damaging way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gina. Google has changed.  It has not become more evil.  It has become more focused.  The problem is it has to work twice as hard to prove that focus does not equal evil.  And like Jeff just said, the clumsiness is an issue.  So they need to take things like focus on the user and iterate based on them.  They need to be open about that kind of feedback and show they need to respond  to things like the NIMMORES more quickly, which they did finally respond to that.  Pseudonyms are allowed and we'll talk about that in a bit.  But they need to be more responsive and more additive more quickly.  And they need to be more elegant and better about communicating,  just like what Jeff said, less clumsy.  So they're more focused, but they need to work harder  to communicate that that doesn't mean necessarily more evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is there someone at Google besides Matt Cutts?  Should Larry this be Larry? Who should do this?  Who's capable of doing that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who's the Larry better learn Larry better friggin learn?  Larry, I think it's got to be Larry.  His vision has to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree. And this focus is his obsession.  I mean, this is, you know, you know, some people might say this is about him,  you know, his meeting with jobs, right?  And this is what Steve Jobs advised him was to become more focused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the problem is that Steve Jobs never talked to the public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, he wasn't very good at that.  Although, well, he did those emails.  And in some ways, those emails were a very clever PR strategy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He was never great. God knows he was not graceful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No. Well, he was but he was straightforward and honest.  And I think he understood better than anyone  the value of of good public relations.  It didn't seem that way. I know sometimes, but I think he actually knew.  He was pretty clever about me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He cared more about public relations, about media relations.  That's one way of putting it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I disagree, because he knew who to suck up to in the media, too.  Let me tell you, he knew very well who was powerful.  And when Walt Bosberg, you know, comes to his house and spends three hours with him,  that's not because he likes Walt so very, very much.  By the way, Larry, Larry doesn't have that Larry's missing that.  And, you know, but it shows you don't have to be a nice, wonderful, friendly, charismatic.  Well, I guess he was charismatic, but you don't have to be a lovable person to do that.  But you have to have some focus and vision.  And unfortunately, I'm just pulling up this story on Fox News.  This just crossed the wire.  Be afraid. Google spying on you.  New policy rolls out March 1st.  Oh, God.  Effy News Corp.  And guess where it comes from?  The Wall Street Journal Journal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, don't get me start.  Well, you will get me started momentarily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Can we can we compare the Wall Street Journal's privacy policy?  Because they insist you log in and track you with cookies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And not only that, they know your P.I.I.  They know your name and address and credit card number.  They do not allow you to opt out.  They require you to be cookie.  They they sell your data to third parties.  They finally had to admit all that stuff after doing their what?  What do they know? Spooky, spooky series.  Don't get me started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The way it's Julia Angwin again.  Although I got to say the Wall Street Journal headline,  as opposed to the Fox News headline, is much less sensational.  It's merely Google widens its tracks.  Privacy changes to combine data on users, making anonymity harder to keep.  Much more judicious and inaccurate than the Fox News article,  which links right back to the Wall Street Journal article.  Be afraid.  So this is so I agree with you, Gina.  This is a communications issue.  Very much so.  Matthew, we lost you for a little bit.  I don't know if you heard how much of this conversation you heard.  But the question is, has Google changed?  Is this a different Google and what what do they need to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it has changed.  I don't you know, I'm not going to say they've become evil and so on.  I think I'm sure they wish that phrase had never entered the lexicon.  But so whether they've they've gotten evil or not, I don't want to say.  But I do think if you look at what Google promised when it went public,  it was going to provide objective results.  It was not going to influence those results based on who paid money or whatever.  But now it sure looks like Google is influencing those results  based on what it wants to do, which is to promote its own network.  And I think that fundamentally changes  the the nature of what Google is is selling or pitching.  And so that's, you know, to me, that's that's a risk.  And I think as as Kevin was saying, the biggest risk is that it's just going  to change the sort of openness and and the the we came to rely on Google for that.  So now if it's if it's just going to do what everybody else does  and sort of pimp its own stuff, that's going to change things fundamentally.  That's and that's a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although you got to feel for Google a little bit, because that is a subtle.  And I think you're exactly right.  Distinction between the old and the new.  But Fox is not going to make that distinction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google did not handle it well.  And Google has to consider real people, not us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They have to consider, you know, we can understand the nuance.  We can say, oh, yeah, they're hurting their search results.  That's not what the guy on the street is thinking about.  They're thinking about is Google following me everywhere I go?  And what are they doing with what they know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, especially given the stuff that's going on with the FTC.  And again, I keep on presaging this.  But but here in Europe, they've got to be hypersensitive.  And this was not hypersensitive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm tempted just to say, hey, Google, I'll do it for you.  Give me you know, I'll take a month leave.  Let me just go. I can explain it to people.  Really, it's yes. Yeah, because it's just they don't they are not communicating.  I think well at all.  Let's take the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This really should have been they clarified their language.  Yes. Made a change.  This is about a change and more about clarifying their language.  It's a good news. A unified privacy policy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is good. This is clarity.  This is what we always want Facebook to do.  This is not, oh, we're trying to hide something or, oh, we're not going to let you opt out anymore.  There isn't a change in the way they deal with your data.  Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're just letting you know now, clearly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there could be a change. We don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, we well, I'm looking at it.  We kind of know because they've now published it.  So, I mean, it doesn't look like it's a change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But how are they going to share it? Are they going to share more?  They're going to share more between.  No, it's exactly the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, same. They're just unifying it.  They're doing exactly what they said they've done.  They haven't changed anything.  Let's go to a break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And but that's the problem is that that that does not generate page views to say that.  What generates page views is be afraid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm going to make you afraid in a minute.  We come back from break. I want to make you very, very afraid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Film at 11.  Are people rampaging in the streets about to kill you?  Film at 11. Stay tuned.  But first, by the way, the answer, no.  But first, a word from Ford.  You know, that's what I love about engineers.  I said, what I love about doing a technology network and it is so different from mainstream media  is we assume the intelligence of our audience and like engineers, things are tend to be black and white.  There's there's we're so we're looking for truth.  And maybe things are nuanced in all sorts of interesting ways.  But ultimately, I think engineers always say, well, it works or it doesn't work.  It is or it isn't.  And that's why I love working in this field, because it isn't so it's not like nailing jello to a tree.  Despite what they say, we're going to talk a little bit about Ford right now.  And I have to say, I love talking about Ford because this is an example of a company that I love.  When we went to Detroit last was it last year or two years ago?  And we went it was the last year we went out on the assembly line of their of their original plant,  the one that Henry Ford built in the 20s because he knew there was Henry Ford's goal was at the time  when he started Ford, only very rich people could drive.  And his goal was to make a car that everyone in the United he said, I want to put everyone in the United States on the road.  I want to make a car anyone can drive. I want to make it accessible to all.  And to that end, he built this plant that took box cars of lumber and iron ore and coke and in one end and cars came out the other end.  It's amazing, massive plant. And it's still there. It's still operating. It's green now.  They've got greenery on the roof that captures CO2 and generates oxygen.  They've got light everywhere. You know, I went down on the actually rode the assembly line, which is a treat.  It's not quite going to the West Wing, but it was close.  And to talk to the workers and their experience has changed so much.  This is a modern company.  And I just love how they've gone into the 21st century with that vision, though, of of of you know, this is this is the original technology of  industrial era technology, turning it into information era technology.  And by and to do that, of course, they're wiring the cabin.  Now they have a challenge, which is distracted driving.  They don't. And I think a lot of car companies are not paying much attention.  I won't say the name. Big Luxury Car Company on the show floor showed how you could update your status on Facebook in their car as you're driving by looking down at the screen, turning a knob to the right status and pressing go.  And it's like, no, don't please don't do no.  I don't want to be dodging Mercedes in the street coming in the next few years.  Ford's idea is, look, we understand consumers want technology in their car.  How do we incorporate it? How do we solve this problem?  And after a lot of research, they said, and Alan Mulally told me this is if you keep your hands on the wheel and the eyes on the road, if you're focused on what you're doing and you're not like looking down and you're not twiddling knobs, you have enough humans have enough cognitive  free space to also make it have a phone conversation or to listen to stuff or to interact with the car using voice.  So that's where they focused on this voice technologies.  And that's where sync comes from.  And now sync and my Ford Touch.  And he told me this last year, their cars iterate, they've got the car iteration down about three years, which is amazing from the conception to shipping.  But it's still, of course, much slower than your Android phone, which seems to update every three weeks.  So what they've decided to do is they created an API for sync that allows app developers to interface with the car.  So now you can talk to your smartphone and into the apps on the smartphone.  So the iteration happens in the phone and you have that full access.  So they started with Pandora.  You can you can literally press a button on your steering wheel.  You're driving, you're paying attention to what you're doing.  And you say, play my classic rock station.  It plays. By the way, this has to terrify radio broadcast radio is just going.  They've got Stitcher now and Slacker, so you can actually listen to this show.  You don't even have to download it ahead of time.  Just say play, play Twig and it'll play.  You get thumbs up and thumbs down songs.  You can do all the things you could do with Pandora with your voice.  You can get horoscopes, maps, you can call people, you can play music.  You get you're connected, but you're not distracted.  And I think that's really the key to all of this.  You can find out more at Ford.com slash technology at CES.  That's five or six new apps that use AppLink API.  There's more, many more to come.  Ford.com slash technology.  And of course, try try it today.  You can try the app link is available in the 2012 Ford Fiesta,  which you can test drive at a Ford dealer near you.  It's actually going to be in all the cars, of course.  Ford.com slash technology or drive a Fiesta at a Ford dealer near you.  We thank them for their support.  I love to I love that story.  It's just it's just such an interesting thing to watch.  You know, you look at Kodak, which filed Chapter 11.  It's so hard to pivot and watch this industrial era company go into the 21st  century and watch and we know what it is.  It's it's intelligent people.  It's you know, Alan's an engineer from Lockheed or not like Boeing.  He would he says I was involved in every Boeing cockpit for less 20 years.  He knows all about this and he's a brilliant engineer and he engineered the future.  Very smart.  Let's see.  Well, let's talk about. Yes, go ahead.  Are you losing your battery?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can hijack the shows before my battery goes out.  Yes. And do and do the European so I think it will be boring.  But but I think it's important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, no. It's a huge topic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Acta. Here's the deal.  Oh, no, not active this time.  This is today.  Vivian Redding, who's the vice president of the European Commission,  came out with a whole new list of privacy regulations and laws  that she plans to implement, and she has four pillars.  I'm going to go through this real quickly.  But here's there's a lot of dangers.  One pillar I agree with is transparency and portability of data.  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  Two is privacy by default.  Well, if you make privacy the default by law of services,  we'd never have a flicker.  Three is that your data must be held by European standards, the world around.  Or else the EU can find a service up to two percent of their worldwide  global take home.  And so what that means is the Europe just is trying to take over  the friggin Internet.  And it also means we end up with a high watermark of regulation  and a low watermark of freedom.  And if we grant that power to the EU, we'll grant it to China.  Fourth pillar is the right to be forgotten, which again sounds cool.  But it says that you have the you would have the right to demand that any  any personal information about you would be deleted.  And she has to carve out history and carve out journalism,  which acknowledges the impact on freedom of speech.  But she's defined personal information as anything about you,  including your private, public and business and public life,  including an IP address.  So so that means that people can go back and years later come to you, Leo,  if you cookie and demand that that you have to get rid of their IP address,  not even knowing who that person is and photos and posts about you in the public.  This is extremely dangerous.  It is a huge grab to regulate the Internet,  the whole Internet from Europe across 27 countries.  It is truly dangerous if we got our dander up and we got our action together  about SOPA. This is as Henry Blodgett said to me tonight in the snow of Davos.  This is SOPA squared. This is a big deal.  And we've got to get mad about this.  We've got to get scared about this because it doesn't just affect Europe.  Europe will affect all of us.  That's the end of my spiel here.  But I'm telling you, folks, watch out for this news.  It's dangerous stuff and it's going to affect media to us and media  because it's going to demand that you have to give the right to opt in,  even to cookie.  Which means you wouldn't be able to use the New York Times or Leo,  one of your people comes to your site from Europe.  You're going to have to say, I'm just going to block my cookie. You write.  And what's sorry, you know, most companies are going to do that.  And so that's where we end up. It's extremely dangerous.  It's a move of a government trying to regulate the Internet.  It's just as dangerous of Sarkozy does it.  Or if the American Congress does it with SOPA or if China does it.  And we, the Internet have to fight to keep our tool of publicness free.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a proposal for directive 9546, which does this have to be,  how does this get approved? Is this approved by the European Commission?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, obviously it'll get, yeah, it goes to the European Commission.  Does it go to all 27 countries?  It goes in some measure.  Some parts of it have to be passed by the 27 countries.  They'll have two years. Once it's passed by the EU,  then the EU dictates the 27 countries must do this.  They'll have two years to implement it.  And we're going through this right now with cookie directives as we stand today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the question, and rightly so in the chat is,  well, but this protects me as an individual.  How does this hurt me as an individual? Doesn't this protect me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, but protect from what?  That's the first question of what's the real harm here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll give you an example. So you watch Twitter.  I'm not interested in any personal information about you,  but as with all web servers, we have a log and the log has who watched when.  And we actually do use that to count how many viewers so we can charge our  advertisers. That would that log now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you did it. So the same thing,  the same argument would be that American Express should delete all of your  financial records after six months because it says what you did.  The library should delete all the records of after a certain time that you  should be able to erase yourself from the whole net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this applies to anybody, including us, processing data of any EU citizen.  Exactly. So you ask anywhere you're responsible for doing this.  And what are the penalties? Let's say Twitch says, yeah, go ahead.  European Union.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What all these go up to 2% of your entire, not just come and get me.  How are they going to get that? Well, because if you, well, you perhaps not,  but, but obviously there's a lot of international companies. Right.  And so Google for instance would be vulnerable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you bet.  Google's all as its money's in Ireland. Right. Right. Yeah.  So mandatory data protection officer. Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you have 250 employees, you have to,  you have to add a full time staff for data protection.  Now, you know,  the advantage she argues is there are now 27 different regulations in 27 countries  in Europe. And so this puts it together, but this is also, you know,  it's kind of the one world government or the internet comes along.  So who does that? Is it the U S is it China? Is it Sarkozy? Is it Redding?  Is it Germany? This is what's happening. My friends is that,  and I see this in Davos right now. Davos is scared shitless.  The institutions that are here of us who through SOPRA through Occupy Davos and  Occupy Wall Street and the Arab Spring and the Indodados of Spain,  these are all movements that scare them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you're really, this is a meeting of the 1%. Is that what the WEF is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, the point, the point one. Yeah. It's the, it's the,  it's the people who are in charge of the 1%. Oh, wow. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they are threatened by all of this. Very threatened, very threatened,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and full of denial. And this is about a fight about disruption of institutions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And what, so are the, how, actually I'm very curious.  How aware are they of what's going on and how, how real is, I mean, I,  clearly Rupert Murdoch's grasp of what's going on is hazy at best.  These guys at WEF, these guys you're hanging with in Davos, do they get it?  Do they know what's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, what they got was that SOPA was,  the reaction to SOPA was scary that it was people rising up.  What they get is that Occupy Wall Street is weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you're in the 1%, you don't want to hear from the 99.  Just do your job and stay cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Vivian Redding said, well, we'll never have a blocking bill out of Europe.  Yeah, not now. You're not going to. So they're aware of that.  I was at a time debate on the future of capitalism.  It's kind of absurd topics this morning.  And there was a corporation and an equity firm and labor unions and bankers and  universities. And I just got fed up at one point.  And I said, none of you is accepting responsibility for the mess we're in.  You are the disrupted. I want to hear from the disruptors. And they're there,  they're here too. Some of them, but not many. This is the disrupted.  And what I'm trying to say is that what we're really seeing at a high level is  that the internet threatens institutions.  And so the institutions are now fighting back to use the power they have to  regulate the internet. And we've got to keep fighting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kevin Marks, you have a funny accent.  These are your people. Actually,  Britain is kind of only a reluctant participant in the EU.  The chat room is saying that Jeff is biased against Europeans and doesn't  understand how it works.  Jeff's muted.  Yeah, read them and I'll put a link in the show notes, but Jeff's muted.  I mean, Kevin, Kevin, you're muted.  We can't hear a word you're saying. Maybe it's that funny accent. There it is.  There we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There we go. Sorry, another fire engine went past.  So I can't do that. We can do that here too.  Okay. So what about, I think Jeff is overstating this to some extent.  Some of the European data protection stuff is useful.  The stuff that they have in the UK says that you can demand information from a  company that they're holding on you. And they have to send it to you.  That's a useful right.  And I'm for that transparency, for it.  Right. There are chunks of this that make sense.  There are also ways when they're trying to extend these that don't make sense.  And I think this is the first pass at this.  And yes, we need to engage with it and make sure that it starts making sense.  I think that's very true.  And the similarity with SOPA is that these proposals tend to get written by one  side of the argument, as you say, by these sort of professional privacy lobbyists.  And then we need to look at them and say, well, do you understand the implications  of what you're saying and fix them?  And with SOPA stuff, there wasn't much to actually fix there.  I think with these, there probably is some useful stuff there.  And I'm fairly sure that my colleagues at the Open Rights Group and the others who  are involved in the policy stuff in Europe will be paying close attention to these  and saying, this piece is good, these bits are bad.  There was a great article in Computer World by Alex Muffet, which I've got a  link to somewhere, talking about that.  I think that you'll like Jeff talking about the problems of trying to regulate  this stuff. It was talking about.  That debate is like, it's you need to be careful not to tell people how to do  things, but you need to give them frameworks to say what you want to achieve.  And that's that's the difference with right.  We've got to have you right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Regulate the behavior, not the technology.  What's happening here is that whether there's child porn or whatever, this stuff,  we see the government trying to regulate the technology because the technology  befuddles and frightens them.  Well, what you already have the laws to regulate the legal behavior.  Witness the taking down of Mega Upload.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They didn't. Well, but Mega Upload, you know, this is interesting story because  Mega Upload servers were in the US, so they could take them down and everything  about SOPA. But they were for international service.  Yeah, but they were able to arrest the guys.  But if the servers had been in China, they wouldn't have been able to do anything.  So, I mean, I'm not believe me, I'm not an apologist, but I but I have to you  have to I don't think this is a relevant Mega Upload is not a relevant issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What Vivian Redding said was nothing new when she spoke at DLD this week, but I  was with executives of a certain very large technology company and a certain part  of the advertising industry who were scared to death.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it is it is it scares me.  I don't know if I should be scared.  It's you know, I know in England anyway, Kevin, there's been a very active and  effective, as you said, the open rights movement,  political action against this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that was I mean, that was founded like seven years ago to try and  provide a voice for this.  Well, one of the things that worried me about the sort of post-SOPA thing was the  entertainment industry should sit down with the technology industry.  It's like, no, that doesn't necessarily give you the right answer.  You also need these.  You need some of these people who are representing the broader public interest  as well, like the EFF and the Open Rights Group, who are there saying, well,  can we look at both sides of this?  And yet there is a danger that you also get people who are, you know, axe grinders  who were there with a particular agenda.  But there are there are organizations who actually are focused on thinking this  stuff through carefully from from the technology angle and from the policy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  there. There are a lot of people, activists, in fact, who believe in privacy,  Jeff, and who say, well, we need strong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do, too. I believe in privacy.  I'm not against privacy.  That's I mean, you read the book.  I'm not against privacy at all.  I think I'm for privacy, but I'm for protecting the tools of public  business and I'm against regulation of the Internet.  And it's been around for decades.  Why is it suddenly getting regulated?  Why is everybody suddenly seeing danger, danger in the Internet?  Because the Internet's coming together, it's becoming more powerful.  It's becoming economic and also political.  It's becoming a force for political change.  Internet hasn't changed, folks.  The circumstances around it in society of change is having an impact.  And that's why they're reacting.  And if we reacted to SOPA, I'm all in favor of privacy.  I have a private life.  Privacy needs protection.  I'm in favor of privacy regulations.  Make that clear.  But I'm also saying here that the Internet means to remain free.  And the Internet is the tool of disruption.  And that's why it's threatened.  It's freedom is threatened.  I'm about out of battery juice.  So you'll be lucky to know that I'm not drunk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're almost out of time. Jeff's out of juice.  But I do want to before we wrap, go ahead, Matthew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was just going to say that I think one of the things, Jeff,  one of the points he raises, a good one, that even if you accept that the goals  of, say, the right to be forgotten are good ones, the duty that that would impose  on companies and the expense and the time and the effort required to do that  might be punitive, it just might not be even be possible.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's exactly what he's saying.  And that's that's this issue with SOPA, too, is that maybe the maybe the goal  is appropriate, but you've got to be careful about how you achieve these goals  without doing things that you know.  And I think you're right, Jeff, that the scapegoat is often technology  because it's scary whether it's political, economic or just we're Luddites.  It's scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I didn't mean to hijack so much.  I apologize.  No, that's good.  I got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's scary because people are using it.  Right.  That's a good thing.  And that's what we want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Yes.  Pseudonyms.  Google has Google Plus says, yeah, you can use a NIM.  Good article Monday from you, Kevin Marks.  Google admits they want they'll they want fake names, but you have to  do you have to be famous.  What is the deal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's kind of the same thing they've been saying all along,  but they've been direct about it.  Bradley wrote a sort of PR thing.  Oh, we've done this stuff.  And then you're not saying Zungren in the comments said what was actually  going on, which is they have decided that people don't like the look of  handles and so they have an algorithm that tries to decide if your name looks  real or not and they don't care if it is real or not.  They just want them to look like names.  So it's this is this.  The thing it reminds me of is broken.  People working in call centers.  So Google and they're American.  And it's like it's like a passing thing.  It's like you have to look normal because you're scared.  You're scared.  You scared the so mainstream Americans or whatever.  And so what they've explicitly said is your name has to has to be look name  like enough to our algorithm.  Now, their algorithm lets through a whole bunch of crap.  You know, I checked 30 of mine and I got let me let me look up again.  I got the Phoenix Rising panel heater to lay made the most and that one called  Mayor Decent, which is actually obviously a fake account using a Pakistani actress's  photo. And that was out of the 30 people, the last 30 people who followed me at that  point. So their algorithm is failing in its goal of creating things that look like real  names. And they are attacking people who use names that they want to use.  Now, they've said, oh, if you can show us you've been using this name on the  Internet for a while, you can go through the appeals process.  Well, clear Hamlin went through the appeals process and it is ridiculous and it  clearly is designed to mess you around and make you back off.  So it's it's really annoying.  They still have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ozzie's annoyed to my dog's annoyed to Gina.  What are your thoughts? Were you cheered by this change or does it seem like it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  meaningless? I was cheered that there was a change still kind of annoying.  I mean, I sort of agree with Google that they want that a community of real names  has a different vibe to it than a community of handles that can be anything.  But I'm not convinced they're quite handling this right yet.  I'm still also really suspicious that most of my people who have put me in their  circles on Google Plus are spammers.  So so there's also that.  I mean, my phone numbers are insane and it just seems and I just get a lot of them.  So, yeah, I'm not sure how I feel about this yet, although I do have friends who  have handles who use them on Twitter and other social networks and have had them  for years who are now finally getting their Google profiles restored.  And that makes me happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It does seem like there's an awful lot of spam on Google, but more than there is on  Facebook. So clearly this didn't whatever they did didn't quite work.  It's a help. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I think in a way we've got the worst of both worlds.  We've got Google pretending that they're having real names, right.  But they're not because it's as long as it's what I call the real looking names  policy. Well, what purpose does that serve?  Why not let people use whatever name they want?  And the thing that I like about Twitter is that you can use whatever handle you  want. And most people attach their real name to it.  Some people don't. But then it's about the quality of the content.  And then you can start forming your community around that instead of what  someone's name is.  But Twitter, there's your handle and then there's your full name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, you kind of have you have both really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think Google is trying to do that.  So they're saying there's this other field and you can have your handle in there.  And but we still need your real name or your real looking name, which, you know,  it just it feels like the worst of both worlds instead of the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let us get to our tool tip and number of the week before Jeff's battery dies.  Why don't you do the number first as the air escapes from Jeff's balloon head?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why? I will. I will confess that I cheated and teacher gave me a number.  I gave you. But it's a good number.  It's a good number. Nine point six, eight million.  That's how much Google's spending on lobbying, which I would just say simply is  still a lot enough. Not even close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, although members of Congress are cheaper than they used to be.  A few thousand gets you a vote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it but if Google saw it's if Google I think this is where the discussion early  on the show was was right. If Google truly were aligned with our interests,  if it truly were, were able to do that and did that well,  then they wouldn't need a lobbyist because we proved with SOPA that we are the lobby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Let us be the lobby, Google.  By the way, that number is twice what they spent last year.  Twenty ten. That's the twenty eleven number.  So they is going up.  Going up. Yeah.  Half of it is that will continue to go up by the half of its car fare for Eric Schmidt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I'm going to apologize rather than just fade away.  I'm going to say hello to the one point one, the point one percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bono's not there this year. Mick Jagger might be.  We're not sure. I'll try to dance with a fine Mick.  See you, Jeff. Thank you, Jeff Jarvis.  Buzz Machine, the new book Public Parts, available at better bookstores everywhere.  He'll be back next week. I'm sure. Enjoy Davos.  Enjoy the six feet of snow.  Gina, you have a tip for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, I do.  I like this.  Google Maps now highlights an area.  So if you search for Petaluma or if you search for a zip code, if you search for a county,  the Google Maps, if you're in not in satellite view, but in just regular map view,  it'll highlight the area in pink.  You can actually see the boundaries of a zip code or a city.  So if you search for Brooklyn, New York, you can see how big my my my hometown really is  or my home borough really is.  It's just a neat feature if you kind of want to get a sense of different areas  and neighborhoods, it might even work for just neighborhoods as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's cool.  And they've added a bunch more 3D renderings as well.  Like they said, 42 plus more locations.  Let me just see Brooklyn, New York, New York.  Let's zoom in on that here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you have you have to be in map mode.  You're in satellite mode right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, let's go to map mode.  I don't even know how to do it.  Wait a minute. What happened there?  Click that. There we go.  Oh, yeah, look, they're pink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. So you can kind of see the Brooklyn.  The highlighted area.  That's where it is.  I always wondered.  It works really well for zip codes as well.  If you want to get a sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's cool. Let's see.  Let's look at our zip code.  Oh, now that's what we should do.  Let's see the 11th Congressional District.  That's what we need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
