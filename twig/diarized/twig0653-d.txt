Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, it's Stacey Higginbotham.  She's back.  Stacey on IOT.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm so glad to be back.  We miss you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We are happy to have you.  Yay.  Everybody's, it's the everybody in the house.  In fact, literally in the house sitting next to me.  In the house.  Yeah, hi Ant.  I haven't said hi yet.  Maven, Ant Pruitt looking sharp.  I try.  Yep.  And doing a great job with the club.  We'll talk a little bit about some of the  club twit specials you put together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep.  It's been fun so far.  Yep.  And I'm still enjoying the Stacey Higginbotham book club.  And I'm about halfway through this month's book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cory's book.  Cory's gonna be on Twitter on Sunday.  I'll have to tell him that you're doing the book club.  Tell him we're doing a book club with unauthorized bread.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I bought the Kindle version and I struggled with it  as usual so I ended up buying the audio versions.  And I bought the audio version.  The audio version is awesome.  Audio books are great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's great.  They are great.  They're great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm gonna start picking audio books just for you.  No, don't do that.  Because I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because I'm still trying.  Pretty much everything's on audio now.  Which is nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm still trying but I think that's when I actually have  ADD is when I try to read books that aren't like  instructional books.  Yeah.  You know something about reading for leisure  just doesn't do it for me.  I was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Shall we note at this moment that the man who popularized  audio books Duval Hecht has died at the age of 91.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is by the way Jeff Jarvis.  Everyone knows him.  Oh hi.  Everyone knows him as the Leonard Tao professor  for journalistic innovation at the.  Great great great new model.  Comes with his own choral group.  Graduate school of journalism at the City University  of New York.  Who invented audio books?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I never heard this guy's name.  Well he didn't invent them to be popularized  because he was the founder of Books on Tape.  Books on tape.  I used to be on the board of reading for the blind.  Yeah.  And dyslexic which changed its name to Learning Ally.  But it was started after World War I because of mustard gas  and other things that made.  Yikes.  Veterans blind and so volunteers came together  to read books for them.  And that was the form but Duval Hecht started Books on Tape  as a company and I'm trying to see the year here.  1975 so much much much later.  But really led to the popularization of them.  Until of course one company took them all over  as happens to everything good.  And now it's all audible but I like audible.  Audible's okay so far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Audible.  So I was a Books on Tape user.  I had a long commute two hours sometimes each way  to Tech TV starting in 98.  And I would get a box would come in the mail  with 38 audio cassettes in it.  Remember that?  Yeah.  And you'd put them in your cassette player.  And if.  What's a cassette?  And if one of them got damaged you were stuck at that point.  You'd tell them and they would send you a new cassette.  And then but you only had a month to get through the book  because you had to send it back.  It's like library.  And when audible came around,  I subscribed in 2000, 22 years ago.  That was a lifesaver because you didn't have  to send them back.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You didn't have broken cassettes.  You didn't have to worry about file corruption.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well maybe if you could download it again.  You know LibriVox?  Yeah.  Which is the open podcasting.  It's the volunteer version.  There was a book I needed to read and I didn't have time.  And so I went on LibriVox and found it.  It was William Dean Howells book from the Gilded Age.  And the narrator was great.  He was phenomenal.  Which is cool because these are volunteers.  So you know.  They're all public to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's gonna be.  Probably when I retire that's what I'll do  is I'll read for these guys.  That would be kind of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I could do that for free  and fulfill my like audio narrator dreams.  You have such a good voice Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would get.  You know what you should do Stacey  you should do Edith Wharton novels.  Accents.  No Edith Wharton novels would be.  Yeah you could do the accents.  That would be so great if you know  you did Age of Innocence and House of Mirth.  You would be perfect for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do love a good Edith Wharton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know they're great.  I have an audio audible version of House of Mirth  I've been listening to.  Fantastic.  But I could hear you reading those.  That'd be wonderful.  Anyway.  Yeah.  Anyway.  I'm glad you mentioned it because he was a pioneer  and Books on Tape was for many of us  kind of the entry gateway drug Duval Hecht.  War and Peace ran 45 tapes.  I remember.  I was listening to the Aubrey Matron series  and I'd get these big boxes of tapes  and you'd kind of have to hustle  because you only had a month to listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My grandmother she used to run a flower shop  in Greenville, South Carolina  and our commute was from Clemson to Greenville  so it was a little long for her  and we would get in the car with her in the summers  to go work at the flower shop  and she would always pop these tapes in  and like oh man why are you listening to this stuff?  We wanted to hear music  and she was always playing these books on tape  and I'm like oh grandma give us some music please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hecht was working as a broker in Los Angeles in late 60s.  He had as everybody does in LA a long awful commute.  He told the LA Times he became frantic  to escape his daily misery on the road.  Radio he said offered little more than bad music  and worse news.  He found a degree of solace  and recorded books for the blind  which he played on a reel to reel machine  that rode along like a passenger in his Porsche.  But in 1975 with his seed money from the sale of his Porsche  he started books on tape  and really books on tape was a life saver for me.  I love it.  Well all right you know what I'm glad you brought that up.  We're big fans of audio books here.  Audible has really kind of democratized it  and simplified it.  And by the way they have a lot of books  on tapes recordings on Audible.  I guess they licensed them over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I'm reading the Washington Post a bit.  Quote, listening is just returning literature  to its original form before Gutenberg got into the act.  He once told the journal  referring to the 15th century craftsman  regarded as a father of Martin Printen.  Do they really think people don't know who Gutenberg is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well not if they listen to this show.  They are experts on Gutenberg on this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let us note that last week you were whining  and moaning and mewling about how we had no news  and good Lord the fates answered you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah well war is bad for humans and other living things  but it happens to be good for news, the news business.  I remember working in TV news  and it's kind of embarrassing and sad  but you know day in day out it's really boring.  Man bites dog but when something,  when there's a big story you kind of jump into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go find the closest Ukrainian citizen  and ask them what they think.  Who has suppliers from Ukraine?  So as a result, and the other thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that's different in this war is how technology  has influenced it, changed it,  become a part of the battleground is really,  even from Afghanistan and Iraq and other recent wars,  it's changed dramatically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No one has mentioned anything about oil  or anything like that, it's all cyber stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, so from a technology perspective,  there is both helium and neon,  are supplies that actually are used  in the semiconductor manufacturing process.  So I've seen a couple of really fun articles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is Russia the primary source?  They're out of Ukraine.  Ukraine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  65% of our supplies of ultra pure neon  used in etching for chip manufacture comes from a town.  Oh, that's interesting.  Well, a plant in Odessa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a chemical plant though, so presumably you could,  it's not like they're mining the neon.  They're not taking it out of the ground.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have to make it, no, or filtering it out of the air.  You do actually have, it's a clean room facility process.  So you have to have, I can't remember.  It's a complicated process.  You don't just like pop these up overnight,  but yes, you don't, I don't think they mine it there.  They just purify it there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so, but you could have a neon factory  built elsewhere in time.  It just might be one more of those shortages  we've been suffering.  Yeah.  Wow, I didn't see it.  That's the point.  This is why we miss Stacey when she's not here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ta-da!  Weird news about semiconductors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are actually, I put some semiconductor news in here  just for you, Stacey, you'll be glad to know.  But let's start with Ukraine.  And how tech is responding to it.  And there's so many stories.  Of course, the most interesting person in all of this  is the vice prime minister of Ukraine,  who has taken it upon himself, or maybe it's his portfolio,  to tweet to all the tech companies.  Oh yeah.  Mikhail Fedorov, Washington Post, just had a profile.  He's on him.  He's the nation's youngest cabinet minister.  And he has taken to Twitter to shame Silicon Valley.  Six months ago, he made a pilgrimage to Silicon Valley  to discuss Ukraine's digital transformation.  He posted a photo of himself arm in arm with Tim Cook,  praising him as the most efficient manager in the world.  He called on Tim Cook last week  to shut down the app store in Russia.  And on Tuesday, yesterday, Apple responded and did so.  Cut off all sales, paused all product sales,  shut down the app store, and shut down,  and this is partly due to the bank shutdowns in Russia,  the ability to use Apple Pay.  Google did the same with Google Pay in Russia.  And I've seen pictures of people queuing,  mass crowds queuing at the subway stations  because they couldn't get in  with their touch to pay devices anymore.  You needed cash, and you can't get cash either.  Yeah, yeah, because the ATMs, there's a run.  So he's 31 years old, and he's,  it's been really interesting.  I shouldn't really even laugh at this,  but his Twitter account has become the place  where your crane comes to Silicon Valley  and says, please help us.  Let's see what the latests are.  Starlink, many thanks to Elon Musk.  Starlink keeps our cities connected  and emergency services saving lives.  And now we need generators.  I think he's just doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As a thank you.  To pander to Elon Musk and his ego part.  I'm like, Elon was like, I will send Starlink things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm like, do they not have satellite communications?  I was trying to find a tweet from Brianna Wu.  She's been kind of the counter.  Yeah, the counter to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Some have pointed out that Russian military  is very good at using satellite links as targets  so that the terminals for Starlink might not be the most,  you gotta keep moving.  In fact, Alex Lindsay confirmed that yesterday  on MacBreak Weekly because apparently  he had been doing a stream in Turkey and using Starlink.  And they did in fact have to move regularly  to avoid being shut down.  Letters here.  Speaking of satellites.  Congratulations SAP and Oracle for their support.  Again, this is Fedorov earlier thanking them  for the blockade.  This is really an interesting way to,  I mean, I can't remember this ever happening before.  You had to put pressure on big business.  Use Twitter for it.  They're also crypto.  It's been a big thing for crypto, both on both sides.  Some crypto exchanges have refused to shut down in Russia.  That seems to be maybe one of the only ways  you can move money in Russia these days.  But others have sent, there's been I think 30 million  in cryptocurrency sent to Ukraine.  So that's an interesting,  I kind of understand how if you're a crypto exchange,  the whole reason you do crypto  is so that there's no central politics involved.  But this puts you in an interesting position.  The world is turning against Russia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm really curious to hear what you all think about  whether or not YouTube should take down RT  as one example of discussion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think you should, I mean, yes,  RT is government propaganda,  but it's also a huge source of news for people.  I don't think you should take down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They've demonetized them.  Google has blocked RT and other Russian channels  from earning ad money, which seems at least,  the least you could do.  But yeah, they've been getting,  YouTube's been getting some criticism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they're taking it down,  they've taken it down in Europe.  They took down RT and Sputnik in Europe,  but it's still in the US.  And if you go to RT, which I do a couple times a day  to see what insanity they're spreading,  it's a YouTube player at RT.  Now RT could surely have a Russian-made player of some sort,  but it's on YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's on YouTube service.  That's interesting, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What does RT say?  I mean, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, so they had a couple things.  They had a, they were playing a lot of documentaries,  air quotes, about Ukrainian neutrocities  and the Donbass that motivated them to come in.  Oh, please.  They go on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pure Putin propaganda.  Oh, it's pure Putin propaganda.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The big thing is this, the big thing,  I just heard the argument before I came on the show,  that they make, which is that evil America,  it's all evil America,  evil America manipulated Ukraine into this position  so that we could then fight with Russia.  Oh, boy.  A proxy war.  Proxy fight, yeah.  As we had in Syria.  And how evil and awful this is, it's our fault.  We did this.  It's an American war, even though we didn't record it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is from The Hill.  Russia says, Metta and Google should be held responsible  for inciting the war.  Oh yeah, it's their fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So everybody accuses them of doing everything  on every side of every fight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Russia State Communications also demanded tech companies  stop discriminating against Russian media in Europe.  That's YouTube, of course.  You know, the other thing I found interesting,  and I was very concerned, we talked about this last week,  I've talked about it on some of the other shows,  that there would be a cyber war at the same time,  and that may still materialize, but.  So far not.  Surprisingly.  So much.  Not so much.  Right when the invasion started,  you may remember briefly Russia or somebody took down  DDoS'd the Ukraine banks.  Russia has in the past attacked Ukraine,  their power grid back in 2014.  In fact, according to this article in the Washington Post,  Joseph Men and Craig Timberg,  partly that's because of Russia's previous attacks  in 2015 and 2016, Ukraine focused on hardening  their systems, and so we're less vulnerable  than even we are here in the United States.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The thing is though, sir, we may not hear any news  about this until next week or week after,  because isn't it pretty standard  that we don't know about the intrusion  until well beyond after the fact?  You know, it's not like an alert happens  as soon as they get in the door, especially.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it depends what they do.  I mean, when they DDoS'd the banks, everybody,  because the banks are immediately down.  Yeah, they may be wandering around in the networks.  In fact, there's some evidence they're wandering around  in our grid as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the thought process is you don't do a cyber attack,  it's kind of like, not nuclear war,  but it is like, if you spend all the time and effort  to get there, you don't deploy that lightly  because you have one chance to use that to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, as soon as you initiate the attack,  defensive steps are initiated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Also, I will say CISA, which cyber, hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, this is the US.  The US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency,  they have a program called Shields Up,  from the beginning of the tensions,  they have been updating that page.  And the advice on there is excellent.  It's very even-handed and it's also really focuses  on monitor, look, know what's happening  in your system starting yesterday, but now is fine too.  I like it because it's not panic-bondering.  They're very clear to say that they have not seen attacks  against the US and US companies here,  but they're giving concrete advice on what to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Richard Clark says, we still believe retaliation,  including cyber attacks, is coming.  So as with everything in this war,  it's premature to say, oh, nothing happened,  but so far, nothing has happened.  And as you pointed out, Ant,  you don't wanna trigger the bomb  until you're ready, the time is right,  you might get more valuable information  just by secretly wandering right inside the network.  So Jake Williams, former NSA hacker,  now on the Information Security Research Group at IONS,  this is a quote from the Washington Post,  if I wipe a bunch of their computers today,  I can't do that tomorrow.  A big question is, when do you pull the trigger?  So you're exactly right.  For all we know, they're in there,  and we just don't know.  Here's the Starlink dishes being delivered to,  I guess, Ukraine, this is again from Fedorov,  and his tweets, thanks Elon Musk.  You're right, it may just be kissing up to Elon.  Probably a wise thing to do.  Buy a few stingers while you're out, Elon.  Ant's got a very thin skin.  Yeah, be nice to Elon.  Yes, he's very sensitive.  Small what, go ahead.  No.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wasn't actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  No, it's okay.  No judgment, no judgment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was gonna say a small sense of self.  Yes, that's it, of course.  That's what you were gonna say.  It actually was, okay.  No, I know, I'm just teasing you.  I'm just teasing you.  I'm not a guy.  I don't think that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is why you have to build rockets in a certain shape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's for aerodynamics.  Google has kind of modified Google Maps early on.  We talked about the professor,  who with his students predicted the invasion  like 12 or 13 hours earlier,  because Google Maps showed traffic blockages  and road closures, and it was pretty clear  that that was because of the invasion.  Google is now blocking edits that it claims  may have been used to coordinate Russian airstrikes.  So it goes both ways, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's also amazing that Russia counts on Google Maps  for an attack.  Jeez.  It's a free resource.  Why not?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They, we all, yeah.  I mean, think about it.  You can just send out your soldiers with their smartphones  and it's already loaded.  You're like, boom.  Everybody log into this link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  According to some, Russia's military  is adding specific pins to Google Maps  to keep track of where they're going to attack with missiles,  where the trucks are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like we're planning a vacation.  They're planning an invasion.  I mean, it's literally the same process  that you use with your buds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google says, some of these edits go back a while.  So we can't say all of them are due to the Russian military,  but out of an abundance of caution,  we are removing user contributions like photos, videos,  reviews, and business information,  and all users submitted places from Google Maps  in Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus since the invasion began  and are temporarily blocking new edits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So basically just presenting the facts  of this is the map.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're not going to let end users modify these maps  for any reason.  Good.  Wikipedia has also been a battleground.  Big article.  It's nice to see an article about Wikipedia  every once in a while.  Forget how important Wikipedia.  Make your donations, folks.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And of course, Wikipedia in Ukraine and Russia,  as well as in the US, has been struggling  with how to cover the invasion.  They want to, of course.  One of the things Wikipedia does very well  is cover current news events.  I don't know if people know that.  It's a really good news source.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, man, they know when someone famous has died  before the internet happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This article from Slate,  how the Russian invasion of Ukraine is playing out  on English, Ukrainian, and Russian Wikipedia,  talks about big editorial battles.  It started years ago when the decision to use the word Kiev  instead of Kiev was hotly debated.  Back starting in 2003, Kiev is the Russian pronunciation  of the capital of Ukraine.  It's actually Kiev.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kiev, it's still two syllables.  There's a pronouncer I put in the rundown there.  Kiev.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, thank you.  Kiev.  And then Kiev is the Ukrainian language version of it.  And so a nationalist, Ukrainian nationalist,  say, no, don't call us Kiev.  That's what the Ruskies call us.  There's, for nearly two decades, Wikipedia editors debated  the changing of the spelling with 50,000 words  on arguments and discussions about the issue.  But it was in 2014 after the Russian invasion of Crimea,  Kiev, Kiev, Kiev?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kiev, Kiev.  Leo, seriously, the audience will find this interesting,  I think, go to line 49.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because Anderson Cooper say Kiev.  They're all saying Kiev.  And then he said Kiev the next day.  Right.  And here's how you say it according to Mila Alien  on TikTok, I presume she's Ukrainian, yeah?  How to say it, ladies and gentlemen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How to spell Ukrainian's capital?  Well, this is how you spell it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kuyiv.  And it's not Kiev.  Kiev is Russian spelling and pronunciation.  Kuyiv.  That's how you say it in Ukrainian.  Kuyiv.  Kuyiv.  Kuyiv.  Kuyiv.  Kuyiv.  Kuyiv.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not Kiev at all, is it?  No, not at all.  Not at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can see how you get there to an American here.  Kuyiv.  It was reduced to one syllable, so Kiv.  No, Kiv.  Of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But wouldn't it be Kuyiv?  Kuyiv.  Kuyiv.  No wonder people say Kuyiv.  Kuyiv.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow, yeah.  I need a lot of practice on that.  Yeah, it's not easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And if you say that, people go,  what are you talking about?  So you gotta choose one or the other, Kuyiv or Kuyiv.  No, no, Kuyiv.  Kuyiv.  Kuyiv.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you just, you get to,  we're in a position to educate people.  Kuyiv.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got it on your lips.  Okay, we should be the people who say it right.  Kuyiv.  Yeah, that should be our goal.  Say it again.  Kuyiv.  Kuyiv.  Kuyiv.  Kuyiv.  Kuyiv.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kuyiv.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Kuyiv.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, I found our supercut for the episode.  Yeah.  There it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Instagram has responded,  Meta's responded in many different ways,  but Meta's rolling out encrypted DMs in Russia and Ukraine,  and they're demoting Russian state media  worldwide on Facebook.  So Nick Clegg announced the new features yesterday,  saying Instagram will be giving users notices  when they can switch to encrypted chats.  Of course, WhatsApp has already been encrypted  as its Facebook messenger,  but now it's available also on Instagram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For both Ukraine and Russia?  Because the, good, the dissidents there need it.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, honestly, more and more I'm feeling like  the only real way out of this is for Russians  to rise up against Putin and depose him.  Yeah, that seems like a great strategy for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, what else?  Just like, it's like saying,  hey, you gotta get rid of Stalin,  and you're like, yeah, thanks, that'll help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know, but, well, I mean, otherwise, if he's untouchable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the best commentator by far, in my view,  is Julia Ioffe, who I think is just, has a stunning mind.  Are you glad you subscribed to Puck now?  I did, I did.  I was about to say, it's on Puck.  Yeah.  It's on Puck.  She said Moscow is the grand exception.  In Moscow, Putin is surrounded by his,  the people can't stand him, but you go outside,  you go into the heartland of Russia.  They love him.  They're watching TV.  They're watching RT, you know, the homegrown equivalents,  and it's different.  So Moscow and St. Petersburg,  yeah, you could see protests against Putin.  You could see some angry oligarchs  who were losing their yachts.  One just got taken by Germany, a big one,  but they know where their bread is buttered,  so they're not gonna fight that much.  I agree, Leo, I'd like to see that, but Stacey's right too.  That's us wishing somebody to put themselves  in danger.  Mothers and their children were jailed  for holding signs that just said no war.  Children.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They let the children out, I believe.  Because, you know, you don't wanna be,  you don't wanna be like putting children in cages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh no, that's so bad.  That's right, yeah, nobody would do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's just terrible.  Even Putin wouldn't do that.  Let's see, what other stories here?  I wonder, now I might save this story about Birdwatch  for later, because it's more than just about Ukraine,  but it's interesting.  This was about a year ago, Twitter announced this  fact checking done by users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just got a Birdwatch related to Ukraine.  Did you?  Supposedly they were not doing it,  and I think they're figuring out I just got one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Part of the problem with Birdwatch is there aren't  a whole lot of volunteers, only a few hundred.  Yeah, I'm one, but.  Washington Post analysis of data that Twitter publishes  on Birdwatch said that contributors were flagging  about 43 tweets a day in 2022 before  the invasion of Ukraine.  That's nothing.  Although the number went up to 156 last week.  But still, that's nothing.  Still a low number.  Total flow.  Yeah.  359 contributors, that's all.  Birdwatch may be not the success Twitter was hoping  it would be, but it's just one of a lot of things  Twitter's trying out.  EA is eliminating Russian soccer teams from FIFA.  It's a soccer title.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And a verse to Russia, you are dead to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah, so the tech community's responding in that way,  which is really interesting.  Reddit has shut down or quarantined the Russia subreddit  slash r Russia due to misinformation.  DuckDuckGo, which used Yandex for some of its  non-news searches.  Well, that's right.  Has paused its relationship with Yandex.  Yeah, oops.  Yandex is the Russian Google, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, there was a story, I got into a Twitter tussle  about it, but it was the New York Times,  the Washington Post has a story, I don't think we did  last week, where the quality of search results on a certain  number of test things, I think it was the New York Times  did it, was far, far, far better on Google  than both DuckDuckGo and Bing.  Interesting.  They had a lot of disinformation sites in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Google leaps into action, don't they,  when something like this happens, and they have the staff  to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They also talk about it, I remember after 2016,  they called a bunch of people, me included,  with their search quality people just saying,  what do we do, what do you think we ought to do here?  Not that they were gonna listen necessarily,  but they wanted to gain opinions from elsewhere,  and they're smart, and they think it through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But isn't that more of a resource advantage?  You look at what Google has from all of its staff  that they can pull in and can pay fairly well,  versus something like this Yandex or DuckDuckGo  that's usually just a bit of community volunteers,  it's doing that amongst other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's interesting to me that Yandex being Russian,  if DuckDuckGo was using a Russian source, that's an issue.  Sourcing, yes, you're right, it's how much do you write  things to try to get rid of bad stuff.  That's very intensive in resource.  But whom you choose to use as sources,  I'm about to fund, full disclosure, money from Facebook,  but none of it comes to me, but it comes to school,  a project with Wikipedia, we haven't talked about it yet,  but Wikipedia has tremendous discussion and thus data  on the credibility of sourcing.  So sourcing alone, I think, doesn't require the kind of  write the UI to get rid of the bad stuff,  but it does say, whom should we trust to serve to our users?  That doesn't require-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not just a question of trust.  I mean, these are financial relationships.  So DuckDuckGo can contract with certain other companies  to bring in search results.  And Yandex may be great at a large number of searches  and we don't necessarily know how they use it.  I mean, it's theoretically possible that you could say  any search involving math or physics,  open it up to the following options,  or you could shut that down in case of,  I'm just theorizing here, but the point is,  not all of your sources are gonna be golden.  Even as a reporter, I talk to people and I'm like,  after I talk to them, I'm like, you know what?  I don't think you're actually that smart about this topic.  This doesn't jive with anything else.  So I'm gonna pull you out of this story.  And I don't think it's crazy to think that  they'll have these relationships  and have to evaluate them when suddenly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yandex was seen as an alternative source,  you know, 20, 15 years ago.  But now I just searched for Ukraine on Yandex.  Third site is RT.  Looks like about the sixth site is TAS.  What do you expect from a Russian company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why they pulled that.  Yeah, that's why they pulled their search results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But what was being served up over the last,  you know, since 2014 and the invasion of Crimea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you're saying it's non, they used it for non-news.  So they were aware of this, obviously.  This potential.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me look up the geography of Eastern Europe.  You know, a lot of these are news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they may not just use Yandex.  They may consolidate those results with Bing.  And other search engines I can't think of.  Well, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A lot of tech companies, as we've mentioned before,  in Ukraine, it was a big tech area.  A lot of companies hired tech staff in Ukraine.  And there are, of course, Ukrainian companies.  One of our sponsors, Gramerly, is a Ukrainian company.  Yeah, I didn't know that.  They have headquarters in the US,  but it was founded by two Ukrainians  and still has a lot of technical staff there.  I love Luminar.  We talked about this.  How's that say, Skylum?  Skylum is a Ukrainian company.  In fact, if you go to Skylum.com,  you'll see a big banner at the top in support of Ukraine.  Wix, I didn't know this.  Wix, which is an Israeli company,  is, of course, the website building company,  had 1,000 Ukrainian employees.  They mobilized.  800 of them were sales staff

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  because you saw Wix ads everywhere.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, actually, mostly developers.  They were able to get about half of them out.  But, of course, as you know, Ukraine has said  no one military age, which goes all the way up to 60.  A male.  60-something, right?  Could leave the country.  But they were able to get about 500 of their employees  and their families out.  Wix had about 30 of its Lithuanian employees  volunteer to drive 600 miles to the border of Poland  to collect people.  They picked up workers, set them up for the night to rest  before the trip to Krakow,  provided them with food and blankets and stuff.  Of the 500 employees who remain in Ukraine,  195 are in areas considered to be dangerous,  according to Wix.  So they're still trying to get people out.  Microsoft has a big tech team in Ukraine.  The video doorbell company Ring  has a bunch of developers in Ukraine.  Ubisoft, Snap, all doing what they can  to protect workers in Ukraine.  Tampa-based software outsourcing company JetBridge  said it has been struggling with the logistics  of getting its 24 developers out of Kyiv.  Kyiv.  Kyiv.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kyiv.  Kyiv.  Kyiv.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You gotta put the U in there.  It has also, this is interesting,  started paying employees in Belarus in Bitcoin.  So this is Ukraine's birthplace.  That's not gonna go well.  I know.  You remember, what was it, FaceReplace?  That FaceReplace software, FaceRedo?  Anyway, that was in Ukraine.  Luxury, which is a company Snap bought  to help with the augmented reality stuff.  300 team members in Ukraine.  Snap would not say how many are still there.  Exciting safety concerns.  They halted ads running in Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine  and stopped sales to all Russian entities.  Ubisoft has provided Ukrainian team members  additional funds to help cover the costs of travel  and relocations.  for a US tech company or a Western tech company in Ukraine.  Microsoft, which has employees in Ukraine,  and Russia says it's monitoring the situation  and focused on supporting its workers in the region.  That's the other thing that's different,  is how global society is these days.  And so, this has really felt everywhere.  It's just a really interesting story.  I'm gonna move on, unless there's any other,  I mean, I have many, many, many more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can I just mention one thing?  Sure.  I'd like to put in a plug for the Kiev independent.com.  So, there was a site called Kiev Post  where it was bought by an oligarch of sorts,  a small, a mini oligarch, and he shut it down,  and the entire staff left and started Kiev independent.  And it is phenomenal, phenomenal brave journalism,  including an alum from my school, Igor Kosov,  class of 2009, is reporting there bravely.  I go in every morning now, and just that newsfeed on the left  is an unbelievable collection of the journalism  that they've done and curated as well.  They're brave, they're in the midst of this,  they're reporting from around the country.  You can donate to them, I have, through Patreon  or whatever's the other one they have, GoFundMe,  and they're doing phenomenal work.  And so, if you wanna know what's going on in Kiev  and in Ukraine, I recommend them highly.  There's other things too, there's Euromaidan Press.  And by the way, the other thing  that I wanna mention real quickly  is the wonder of Google Translate.  So the day of the invasion, I went to Helsinki Sodomat,  the major newspaper in Finland,  which thank, bless them, is open, we're not paywalled,  and phenomenal coverage, just like they went  to four historians to get perspective,  something we don't do in American journalism.  And Google Translate is amazing  with one of the most complicated languages on Earth,  and it really gives you another perspective  of what's happening to go around from Estonia  to Finland to Hungary, well, Hungary, not so good,  but elsewhere, so changing your news diet  around the whole of the web at a time like this,  but getting from the source, I think, is so important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just fascinating how technology changes all of this  so dramatically, in a way,  I don't feel like we've seen this before.  It's just, and it's also a little disconcerting  because you go to a place like the Kyiv Independent,  and they have fun things to do this weekend.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They kind of didn't get rid of that part of the page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but I think that's what's so weird about it,  and what's so kind of disorienting about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Only a week ago, that's what they cared about.  Only a week ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, let's take a little break.  We have lots more to talk about.  It's great to have Stacey back, and Pruitt's in the studio.  We actually tried to get people to come back to work.  The mask mandates are over in our area,  and we had a pizza party, and no one showed up.  Thanks for the pizza, Miss Lisa.  There was like, you know, it was like,  there's all these pizzas in the other room,  because no one.  No, there's not.  Oh, they're gone?  Oh, that was before Ant got here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ant's like, stay home, I've got pizza for dinner tonight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are no pizzas here.  I'm just kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, good to know.  Is the coffee machine there still at?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No comment on the coffee either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ant, to his credit, is one of the guys  who's continually kind of come in.  You do floss every Wednesday morning,  and you've been a presence around here, which is nice.  I always like seeing your face.  Likewise.  And knowing that life goes on a little bit.  But in two weeks, this will be the second anniversary  of when we shut the whole place down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was a little weird, though,  because I came in today and didn't realize,  oh, I'm gonna be on Twig in studio.  Oh crap, I forgot my laptop, so I have to go back home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can always borrow one of mine.  Oh, I thought you'd forgotten your T-shirt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or your pants.  Normally you're not quite so dressed up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I brought my shirt.  I remember to bring the shirt.  You look great.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff and I are both wearing black sweatshirts.  Best way to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hope I'm not telling anything out of school,  but yesterday before Mac Break Weekly,  the camera, Andy's camera was on, and he got up,  and I think he was, I don't know,  unless he's taken up golf lately,  I think he's wearing jammies.  He was wearing a normal shirt,  but the very bright big plaid, I don't know.  Maybe that's what he wears.  That's how he rolls.  That's his style. That's how he rolls.  Maybe it is, yeah.  Life has changed, it's changing so fast.  It's very interesting.  In a way, that's kind of what we cover,  and so this is our beat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want video chat room.  I want video with him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's somewhere.  He probably is on the Twit Plus feed in our Google.  Yeah, just smile.  That's definitely a premium.

And we thank CDW and HPE GreenLake  for supporting this week in Google This Week.  I don't know if it's a big story or not,  Epic Games just acquired Bandcamp.  Ooh.  It's a music, I know a lot of people use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like the home of all of the hotness.  Indian music, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  So, and Epic of course is a gaming company,  so it's kind of unclear.  Epic says they want to build a creator marketplace  ecosystem based on fair and open platforms.  Bandcamp will still run at standalone store and community.  The co-founder, Ethan Diamond,  will continue to lead the operations.  We don't know how much money it changed hands,  nor when the merger or acquisition will happen  or be finalized.  It's very interesting.  Epic has been kind of buying up some interesting stuff.  Epic is of course the home of Fortnite.  They made a lot of money on Fortnite.  Tim Sweeney, their founder, I think,  made $7 billion in 2020 on Fortnite alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does this make sense for them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, clearly they're trying to do something new.  I think one of the things they learned with Fortnite  is there's a brisk economy.  Has nothing to do with buying the game.  The game was free.  Oh, all of the extra stuff.  In the creative stuff.  Now I get it.  So they have bought ArtStation, they bought Cubic Motion,  they bought SketchFab.  So they're buying these kind of tools for creators.  Epic does-  It's interesting, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's a smart idea  because I think a lot of the web has been,  we see this kind of, I don't even know if it's a seesaw.  Huge amounts of money are made on consumption.  So we start with consumption models,  we start consuming things,  and then people get comfortable with that  and start building things and creating things  around whatever they have been consuming.  Think about it just like fanfic, right?  This is the equivalent for other types of fanfic.  So creating little videos and TikToks  or songs for your, around your favorite world or characters.  I think it's really smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're not worried about EFPs,  they go on another route.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and historically when companies,  when the railroads thought they were  in the railroad business, they had trouble.  They didn't understand they were in the transportation.  Transpo.  That's the old story.  So I think it's sensible for a tech company,  in this case a gaming company,  to say, well, what really is our business?  Is it making games or is it providing  a marketplace for creators?  And there are a lot of people who say,  oh, that's it, I'm out of here.  I'm a Bandcamp user,  but I notice in the comments on this story,  somebody pointing out in the past  when Epic has purchased other companies,  they've usually cut the commission in half or more.  Oh boy.  Epic, remember, is the company that sued Apple over there.  30% take in the app store.  So they have to walk the walk as well as talking the talk.  So it could be very good for Bandcamp,  or at least creators on Bandcamp.  It could be, Bandcamp says they've paid a billion,  more than a billion dollars to artists so far.  That's very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's also kind of a Gen Z strategy.  I don't know if it's because they're young  or because they've grown up digitally  or they don't have real jobs.  But I mean, my daughter and her friends,  they are way more creative or more interested  in creating things and sharing them digitally  in ways that, again, they're young,  so maybe it hasn't been beaten out of them yet,  but I do think it's a very interesting Gen Z play,  as it were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I see the same thing with the kids in my home.  They're all about wanting to create this or that.  The boy bought a dad gum sewing machine.  Really?  Yeah, I mean.  That's awesome.  What's he doing with it?  Right, he sews stuff and makes his own little design  and then, a little weirdo, my little niece,  that's what I call her,  she's been getting into graphic design  and making just little digital art and stuff.  So it's clearly the generational thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kids, I mean, humans are normally naturally creative,  but I think if you don't beat it out of them  at an early age, you're at a risk  that they're gonna be artists their whole life,  which is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He talks about watching videos of some of his friends  back in Carolina, and even though they're just out  with this iPhone, smartphone, or whatever,  and just making videos of random stuff  and turning it into stories just because they can.  That's so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's how Anna Delvey started.  She was cutting out stuff out of Vogue magazine.  Actually, maybe that's not the best example.  I couldn't resist.  Hey, it can go a lot of different ways.  A lot of different ways.  There's a lot of creativity in being a con artist.  It's not easy.  Can't stop watching that show.  I'm down to the last episode.  I've been hearing good stuff on it.  It's fun, you know, it's just fun.  I don't have much to say about it except it's fun.  Stacey actually wrote an interesting piece, I thought.  This is kind of along the same lines  of rethinking what it is your business is  and how you make money.  Traditionally, in hardware businesses, they think,  well, we sell you the hardware, and that's how we make money.  We mark it up and we make money that way.  Apple's kind of pointed the way to, you know,  they've practically saturated the market for iPhones,  and so they decided to stop counting  how many iPhones they sell and still count  how much revenue they make per customer.  Services.  Yeah, with services.  R2.  And so, same thing for Microsoft.  You know, Microsoft decided they didn't want to sell Windows  in the office anymore.  They want to, you know, sell you a subscription.  So Stacey, I thought this was very interesting, said,  you know, the same thing may happen with hardware.  Subscription.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is happening with hardware.  And what's happening is they're maturing their model  from being like, you will pay a huge upfront price  for the device, for a smart device,  and then an ongoing subscription.  And they're actually just starting to think about  wrapping everything into a subscription.  Probably the most sophisticated of this  would be something like the Whoop Band,  which is, you can't buy the band individually.  You just pay 30 bucks a month for coaching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You get the band, but you have to pay for the service  and all the metrics and stuff.  Did you like Whoop?  I think I did.  Did you?  Yeah.  I did.  I lost my battery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why didn't you like it?  Not because, okay, my Whoop edit still stands,  or review still stands.  I'm just not hardcore enough for Whoop.  I know.  I wonder if he's pretty hardcore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It gave me everything I needed to know.  What is it?  Is it an exercise band?  You know, it basically just tracks your activity in the day.  And I think they measured as a strain.  And what I found was the more that I did just,  even if it was just moving gear around in the studio  or whatever, that was part of the activity,  not just walking, not just going to the gym.  They took into effect a little bit of everything.  And the more that I stayed on top of it,  I slept better and felt better.  And when I noticed that little bar was down  in the yellow or red.  30 bucks is a lot, though.  It was an expense of service.  For a month.  It was an expense of service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't measure steps,  because steps are not hardcore.  Right.  It measures heart rate.  Everybody's steps.  It measures heart rate variability.  And the thesis is, so they measure it,  they take what Ant was talking about with strain,  and they combine that with recovery.  And the idea is they do, depending on how well you sleep,  you will get something saying,  hey, you should go to this level of strain today.  Yes.  Because you've led.  So it's those two forces counterbalancing,  and it's all based on your heart rate variability.  Which is a research back biometric,  or bio indicator, rather.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everybody does that now, though.  My Aura Ring does that.  Right.  My Apple Watch does that.  My Samsung Watch.  Everybody does that.  My Fitbit'll do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  But that Whoop was one of the first companies that did it.  And they actually, they really do.  I will say when I tracked my stuff using Whoop,  it did really match with what I felt in my body.  Exactly.  In a way that others do not.  Yeah, that's, for instance, the Aura Ring

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  is, I think, not accurate.  I stopped wearing it because it didn't match my experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If I woke up feeling a little bit groggy,  and I could check the Whoop analytics,  it would basically tell you,  yeah, you're gonna feel like crap today.  And it was right.  Yeah.  I loved it.  And again, I like how it just sort of gave me tips to say,  hey, you need to step up your strain a little bit more  by 20% today, and you should feel better with the next day  and get better sleep tonight and so forth.  And it was spot on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You speak in the past tense here, Ant.  So you literally, you lost your battery,  and then you had to cancel it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I lost the battery, and I quit paying for the service.  Because it's expensive, and I got a lot of other bills.  So.  Yeah, 30 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  30, I mean, it looks like if you're an athlete,  or you wanna, if you really have a lot of spare income,  and you really wanna maximize your productivity  in terms of working out, this is a really good thing to have.  But that doesn't describe a lot of people.  No, it's not for most.  And I think I said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think I said it, it's not necessarily  for the weekend warrior.  This is for the Wintudows of all about Android  that's out there just crushing it  with high intensity workouts on a regular basis.  And she's wanting to know, all right,  what do I need to do to keep this level of fitness?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Probably no good for a man over 60.  Actually, it would be really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe not this man over 60.  Good excuse, good excuse.  Maybe not this man over 60.  No, I mean, I really,  because they had a thing called strain coach,  which I thought was really helpful,  because I work out, when I work out,  I used to just go super hard, like a crazy person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you don't know, you need the strain coach to tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly, because then I'd get sick.  I'd be like, the next day I'd be like, totally wiped.  And I was like, clearly I suck at figuring out  how to work out.  And it was very good for being like,  calm the heck down, Stacey.  And I'd be like, oh, thank you.  That's helpful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have no idea how I feel or what I should do or anything.  So it would be nice if somebody told me,  you should not do anything today or you should do a lot.  So it's expensive.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you get the first month free.  So they'll send you a thing and you can try it out  and see if you like it.  I mean, it might be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does it ever tell you like,  this would be a good time to take a nap?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It does actually.  Does it?  Well, it doesn't say it's a good time.  It would tell you like, when you're in the red,  it's like, hey, today you chill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's what I was saying, the whole color coding thing  with the red and yellow is usually bad times to,  a bad sign that you need to slow down  just a little bit and recuperate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One thing I should point out that like whoop,  all of these things, you still pay for the hardware, right?  It's not like they send you, they don't send you  the whoop band.  So really it's double dipping.  There's charging for the heart, like the aura ring.  Same thing, it used to be just by the ring.  Now you gotta buy the $5 a month subscription  to get the most value out of it.  And I see that more and more.  We got those eight bed cover that  changes temperature and keeps you cool and then warm.  And you can just buy it, it's expensive,  or you can get for an additional monthly fee,  the super duper coach.  My Peloton bike doesn't even work without a subscription.  Does it help you put it on the right way, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you heard that story.  Does it help you put it on the right way?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's on the right way now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I think the point, the transition that's gonna happen  is and what whoop is good at,  because they actually tell you, look, it's 30 bucks a month.  You have to sign it for six months.  Hold on, you don't buy the band at front.  So it's 30 bucks a month for however long you have it,  as long as you have it for six months.  Peloton CEO talked to the New York Times  and he was saying that maybe we do like a cheaper  upfront price and a slightly higher monthly price.  So instead of spending $2,000 on the bike  and then $39 a month for the subscription,  you might be buy the bike for $500,  which puts it in line with like.  Sounds just like a phone deal.  It is a lot like your phone,  but the idea is you're getting continual value  on a long enough basis because it's smart.  And I think this is good because like,  this is an evolution of connected products.  And if you build a connected product,  it needs to have value to the user every day, right?  So enough that they would be willing to pay for it.  And I think if you don't charge them the full upfront price  and it's more comparable with normal dumb products,  then I think people won't feel as ripped off  when they try to evaluate these deals.  Can I ask you a question, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So we saw with the remarkable, right?  That they said, oh, this is included.  And then suddenly later they add a subscription.  How much are you seeing that where when you buy it,  you don't know what the deal is and the deal changes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's pretty common because the company,  I think it will become less common going forward  because companies now are more sophisticated about saying,  oh crap, I've got to keep a cloud connection.  Or the other thing is, oh crap,  I can't sell enough of these.  And basically this hardware Ponzi scheme  where there's enough new users in that you can pay the funds  to keep the other ones operational.  So we're going to keep seeing that.  The other thing that's influencing this is no matter  how good you get about predicting  and building in your cloud costs,  VCs are not funding companies  if they don't have recurring revenue.  They look at this and they're like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that's where the money comes from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, let's take this SaaS model to hardware.  We love this stuff.  It's money and margin.  So that's the two trends driving it.  One, it used to be required  and people weren't sophisticated enough  to price it in early on.  And now it's VCs are like,  don't you leave that money on the table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think of my owl car camera, right?  Where they didn't charge a monthly fee.  They had LTE built in and all this stuff.  And they went out of business because-  Yeah, that was dumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They had their cloud costs were high because they had video.  They had LTE costs.  What were they thinking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They didn't obviously do a business plan  because I mean, it was expensive upfront,  but they had nowhere near covered.  I've obviously nowhere near covered their costs.  They ended up getting sold in the new companies back  but they're charging a monthly fee as they should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was thinking this would be something applicable  to like the studio life of things,  far as like cameras and the-  Should we just charge a monthly fee for-  For things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's I guess what Club Twitter is in a way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But at the same time,  maybe studios are starting to go away  because people are doing more things mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you don't really need it anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they're talking about doing office subscription.  So this is a really interesting thing where Leo,  let's say you sign up 10 virtual people to be hosts, right?  And you, instead of sending us gear  that you all picked out and mailed to us,  instead you pay some company $10 a month  to keep us updated with the latest ring lights  and microphones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's a good idea.  Think I know.  Is it?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, think about it.  I have no head for this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm just terrible at this stuff.  I'm the-  You just want to do the content.  Yeah, I'm the guy who sold the owl camera for 3.99.  He said, it'll work.  You'll figure it out.  I don't know.  Come on man.  Something on the back of an envelope.  It looked right.  Yeah.  It would be more than 10 bucks a month  to keep you in ring lights.  I can tell you that right now.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, anyway.  Am I like this evil ring light destroyer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I'm just saying, you know, 10 bucks a month,  that's not gonna buy anything.  No, that does cost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, the point is,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  well, okay.  Yeah, I did not plan out a solid studio ad-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where's your business plan?  I don't think 50 is enough.  Look at my lighting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you think I know about ring lights?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So get the whoop.  Don't get the Fitbit Ionic.  They're all being recalled.  Oh no.  For causing burn injuries.  Apparently the battery gets really hot.  I thought you were supposed to do the burn.  Do the burn, feel the burn.  Feel the burn.  They said feel the burn.  They didn't mean on your wrist.  Oh no, I'm feeling the burn.  But you know, good on Google.  Because they're recalling 1.7 million watches,  giving every owner a full refund  and 40% off another Fitbit.  So-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kevin and I were looking for old Fitbit Ionics  still on Amazon for some recall arbitrage.  Good deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good, a good deal.  Pirates.  Did anybody, any of you own the Iconic?  It was a nice looking watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did not like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  I never got into the Fitbit life.  Or ecosystem, I should say.  Well if you have one-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Having the Fitbit ecosystem.  Oh, my Fitbit's going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fitbit received 174 reports  of the battery overheating worldwide.  78 reports of burn injuries in the US alone.  Two reports of third degree burns.  Four reports of second degree burns.  That's serious.  That's hot.  Good grief.  That's a burn, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you think you would have taken it off before that.  You're not a frog in boiling water.  I think they must have been sleeping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe that's-  That's the only thing I can think of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe and they woke up suddenly it's hot here.  Geez.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That would suck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good grief.  Did just anybody sign up for Truth Social?  Was anybody able to get in?  It's not-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Asked me if I tried.  It's not on the web, it's not a web service.  It's just through an app, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's an app, it's an iOS app.  So it's still a no for me.  It was the number one app on Apple briefly.  It's now fallen to number 57 on the app store  just behind Tinder and Planet Fitness Workouts.  I don't know if that means anything.  That's still pretty impressive.  It's 57, still pretty good.  The problem is that nobody's been able to get in.  Apparently not even the president, the former president,  Trump has not yet posted on Truth Social.  He doesn't know how to use it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He hasn't been co-edished.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And in fact, this would be an opportune moment for him  to get on there during the Ukraine thing instead.  That's his buddy Putin.  Yeah, instead he's going to radio and TV or CPAC.  And part of the problem is that  I think there must be a technical issue.  This is the other issue is they have a SPAC.  So they're raising a lot of money in this SPAC.  I can't remember the amount,  but it was a huge amount of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did the SPAC actually already go through?  Because there's a lot of skepticism right now about those.  So a lot of the planned ones  are probably not going to happen.  And this sounds pretty dicey to begin with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, yeah.  I mean, a lot of people signed up,  apparently still are in the waiting queue.  In fact, the queue hasn't moved in a week.  Oh, wow.  So I don't-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it's like people waiting for their helium routers.  I don't want to say it's a grift,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but the truth social SPAC is valued at $3.5 billion.  Which is just ridiculous.  Yeah.  Asinine.  Even if it were a massive success,  I don't think, I mean, Twitter can barely make a penny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the money doesn't go to the company,  it goes somewhere else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wonder where.  I wonder where.  Devin Nunes, right?  That's who's running it.  So-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was it $5 a month or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that apparently, somebody corrected me  and they went to Snopes.  Because we were saying, as we're many news outlets,  that's where I got it, that it was $5 a week.  A week.  But apparently it's not.  Okay.  since nobody is actually doing it.  The only good if.  Yeah.  So, but apparently it's free, at least right now it's free.  So just an update on that.  If anybody gets in, let us know.  I'd love to just find out more about it.  Ah, I put this in here for you, Stacey.  The first smart door lock to use Apple's home key,  the Acara Smart Door Lock A100 Zigbee.  Unfortunately-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We did talk about it on the show.  Not sold in the US.  It's not available in the US.  Why not?  Acara, they started, I think they're not a US based company.  It must be Turkish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That sounds like a Turkish name.  Oh, I don't-  It'll be sold-  I feel like they're Italian?  Oh, Italian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's sold in Asia first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Malaysia, Singapore, and then Russia,  and more of Southeast Asia in the coming months.  No mention of European or North American launches,  or if ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They do say it will be available worldwide.  They just don't say when.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Home key is really a cool idea, right?  Is it Bluetooth only?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no, it's NFC actually.  And they store the information on your wallet.  They store your house key information on your-  In your Apple Wallet.  Apple Wallet, thank you.  And so you can just open your door  when your phone's near it, which is nice.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think.  It requires a Zigbee 3.0 Acara Hub to function.  About $365 if you could buy it in the US, which you can't.  And there is some speculation in this article  on Apple Insider that it is really intended  for commercial installs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is this the stuff that hotels are using?  Because I thought it was all NFC based in hotels, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is based, yes, it is.  Well, because Bluetooth really isn't as secure as NFC.  And I don't know.  So Carkey uses NFC and UWB?  But the locks for HomeKit don't use UWB yet,  because we're not seeing those radios  in a lot of products yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is quite a lock they have on this door.  It is a hell of a lock.  Four dead bolts.  So this must be in use in Russia.  It's like a Manhattan apartment from the 60s.  Maybe that's it.  I'd love it if it unbolts those in sequence.  So it goes, chung, chung, chung, chung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I just wanted to update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Acara is based in Shenzhen and New York.  And New York.  They're Chinese.  Yeah, so they were created like in 2016.  And their name is Latin,  which is where I got the Italian from, sorry.  I was like, just don't ask where my brain is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So a lot of talk, and I'm sure you talk about this  with Kevin, about the deaths of the 3G networks  on February 22nd.  T-Mobile pulled theirs down Verizon at the end of the year.  It's affecting a lot of things.  Home security systems, a lot of them are 3G.  Is this affecting you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You need to update your...  You probably didn't pay attention  to the like 8 million emails from the company  who's providing your service.  That is all I...  I've talked to these companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We warned you over and over.  Updates your hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know that the companies that I was talking to,  they were sending out emails.  I mean, granted, there's probably some random stuff  out there that yes, just died.  And that's unfortunate.  But for most reputable companies,  especially on the alarm side,  they've been emailing people for like 18 months.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But who reads their email?  Not me.  Well, yeah, we know you don't.  I don't.  Get ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What about the app notifications?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, what about them?  You get those.  Oh, you get those?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you'll get those.  They've used app notifications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got one letter from 18T1 saying,  your phone's not gonna work in a couple of weeks.  So what do you want to do about it?  That's it, one letter.  Which phone? Interesting.  Well, it's a phone I haven't used in years.  I know that, I'm curious, which one?  Oh, I don't know.  I mean, they said that whatever,  the phone with the number ending in 9154  is not gonna work anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, did you still, wait, wait, wait,  were you still paying AT&T?  Why would they be?  Jeff is like, why are you giving me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  God.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got, okay.  Do you know how many phones this dude has?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How many, does he have 10 year old  flip phone service still paying for?  So what happens is I get rid of the phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and I have the SIM and I think,  well, someday I'll put this in another phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're still bad.  Oh no, oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's, you know, it's, but the problem is,  okay, I have Verizon.  It's only 20 bucks.  I have T-Mobile.  I have AT&T.  Fi.  And the problem in Google Fi  and MipMobile and Ting.  But the problem is,  there's a few more.  I don't, Sprint, I can't remember.  Anyway, the problem is there's different people  on all of them.  MCI, you're probably still paying MCI.  If you know me, I'm paying for your cell phone  is how it works.  So I have people all over on this AT&T plan  and I don't know who they are.  Oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You sent me the Samsung phone.  Oh hey, I forgot to ask.  Have you actually got it?  Did you get my phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is there a SIM card in here?  No, I took it out.  Yeah, I forgot to ask you.  Not only did that, I threw in a little bonus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, where did I put it?  I was like, I opened it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh boy, she's so happy that she got it.  Yeah, exactly.  She threw it to the side.  I sent her the Galaxy Flip 3  cause you was, and then I thought, you know,  I've got like 18 book readers.  Oh, the Kobo reader.  I just bought that.  Oh, the Kobo.  I just bought the Kobo  cause that one, you'll like that one,  works with a library card.  Nice.  So you can borrow books from the library.  Very cool, yes.  So that's why I thought, oh, I'll send this.  I didn't want to send a Kindle to you  cause I could have, but I thought, you know what?  I bet she'd like this Kobo.  That's cool.  Cause you can tie it to your library card account  and then borrow books, which is really cool.  Is that one of the Kobos where you can write stuff?  It is and it unfortunately is the one that came out  just before, I bought it like a week before  they announced this new feature.  But it's nice, it's big, right Stacey?  It's not a little one.  It is big.  Yeah, it's nice.  You haven't plugged it in obviously, but that's okay.  If you care to recharge it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, well, okay.  It came while I was out of town.  So I didn't actually get the package until Monday afternoon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not, believe me.  That was just sitting on a shelf somewhere.  I just thought, well, I got a box going out.  Let's throw some other crap in there.  You're lucky you didn't get some twit stickers  and a Leo bobble head.  I think you should have gotten some,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  what was the bread we were making with the machine?  Oh yeah, you could have gotten some roadies in there.  Roadies, yeah.  Whatever happened to that machine by the way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Still be used.  A former employee kept it, I believe.  Or do you have it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, was it Miss Megan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I think Colleen has it.  Did she ever bring it back, John?  No.  So she probably has a phone too.  So look at the eBooks you can get.  From the Rakuten Kobo, like this one from Ashley Zacharewski.  Let's get naughty.  No.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I pulled this side up and I'm like, oh crap, get this off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They do a lot of romances.  But if you look at the,  I don't know which one you've got even.  It's relatively recent.  I bought it last year.  Cause I thought I should check out this.  And I did sign up for library card and put books on it,  which is really cool.  So I thought you might enjoy it for that reason.  But honestly.  Is that from a Wattpad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wattpad?  Wattpad, W-A-T-T-P-A-D has 90 million users writing fan fiction.  Oh.  I looked up Wattpad and that cover actually looks familiar  from Wattpad.  It could be fan fiction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I wonder what he's looking at.  Cause he's, Santa's looking down at something.  This is a, this is an anthology.  It says, if you think it's too soon to get on  Santa's naughty list, think again.  Cancel your plans and spend this holiday season  with 26 romance authors who've teamed up to bring you  a delicious holiday treat.  This collection has it all, fake relationships,  second chances, enemies to lovers, friends to lovers,  workplace romance, age gap, CEOs, bikers,  and falling for the best friends brother.  And Rudolph the Red Nose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When I go to the ebook store,  I get highlighting the work of black authors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you much better.  And, and it's in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know what store you're in.  Oh, well this is, this is women's, this is woman's month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A celebration of women's stories, stories they tell.  I don't know.  I like ebook readers.  I read stuff on my Kindle.  Mostly technical books.  Cause I, you don't want an audio book that says  C plus plus equals four over seven  parenthesis open close.  So I, but, but for, for technical books,  the Kindle's a really good choice.  And this is, this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh look, they have the most popular recommendations  on book talk.  That's actually, I don't know why Amazon doesn't do that.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, so just consider it a little bonus for, for Stacey's  book club. Yes.  I forgot to ask you if you even got that.  Good. I'm glad it arrived.  It arrived intact.  Have you, have you put your SIM in the flip phone yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I just started updating things last night.  Cause again, didn't get to it.  I didn't get the mail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hope you like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I hope you like it.  I think I'm really excited about it.  It looks neat.  And my daughter is like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Best Buy it's, it's surprisingly,  the line is not disturbing.  It's surprisingly nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you know what?  It's not too heavy.  No floppy hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why I thought for you now put the case on the  Oh, look at that string.  The case is in the box.  So the case is on the box in there.  Cause I had to take it off to fit it in to the original  box.  I just heard a crash.  I hope that wasn't a bad thing.  Say yeah, this is Stacey.  Put the case on it too to give it,  I think it's a little better with a case on it.  Yeah. Give it some substance.  Yeah. Good. All right.  Apple has announced its event.  Yeah. Look at that.  It is kind of manly.  I'm sorry if it's too manly, but you do have black.  Oh no, no, no.  You're actually black fingernails, black turtleneck.  You're in blue hair and blue hair.  You're kind of dressed for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My current case is camouflage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a little, a little more feminine than that.  Okay. Okay.  It does look like a man's wallet though.  I did not see that coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I apologize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was the case that came on the phone and I'm not,  I don't care what case is on my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There you go.  That's why I sent you that one.  Yep.  Apple's event is Tuesday.  We will cover that live.  Interesting name.  Peak performance, which sounds like, you know,  that's yet another thing for you, Ant,  but it's P-E-E-K.  Like we're going to take a peak  and the invite was an AR portal that you go into.  So I think it's reasonable to think Apple might in fact,  at least give a peak at its rumored AR VR hardware  coming out later this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So at least let us look at it,  but not give us something that we can order.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do they do that?  Rarely.  I was like, I don't recall Apple ever showing off  a device before.  Well, they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they do with devices where they need developer support.  So the Mac Pro, the last Mac Pro,  they announced six months ahead of its release.  They did that with the previous Mac Pro as well.  The trash can, right?  Yeah.  I think this is, you know,  they've got to get developers writing stuff  for whatever this is.  So this'll be interesting.  I think, you know,  it's probably going to be more prosaic stuff, basically.  An iPad Air, a iPhone SE 5G.  Oh yeah.  We're hoping, crossing our fingers for a new Mac Mini.  And you know, actually in the Russian FCC database,  there were, I think, four new devices from Apple  a couple of weeks ago,  which usually happens right before an event.  And at least two of them were Macs.  So there may be a Mac Mini and a Mac laptop.  Anyway, something to watch.  We'll be covering it live next Tuesday, 10 a.m.  It'll be, I guess, Michael probably will do iOS today early  with Rosemary Orchard.  Join me at 10 a.m. for that.  And then right after Mac break weekly.  So it'll be an Apple Day on Tuesday.  A little program note.  Peak performance.  Let's take a little break.  Come back.  Still got to do a change log.  I know you all can't wait for that.  The highlight of the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Coming up in just a little bit.  The segment you just burned through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I look forward to it.  All week long I say, oh man, I'm just so excited.  So excited.  Our show today brought to you by Hover.  This is the place to go to get your domain names.  I think Hover is the easiest, fastest way  to get domain names.  And I can tell you, because it's so easy and fast,  I have hundreds, hundreds of domain names at hover.com.  Why would you want your own domain name?  Why wouldn't you want it?  Whether you're a blogger,  an artist creating a portfolio,  building an online store,  any business should absolutely own its own domain name.  It doesn't have to be for a website.  At least for email.  At least for email.  If you're a student starting out in the world,  get a domain name that links to your LinkedIn page  or your resume.  Hover has the best domain names and email addresses  just for you.  I am a big believer in owning your domain name for email  because then it doesn't matter who you use  as your email provider.  You can move around as you want,  but your address is kind of your permanent address  for the rest of your life.  Hover makes it very easy.  In fact, you can sign up for email from Hover.  It's very affordable.  So you get the domain and the email at the same time,  which is nice because when it's time to renew the domain name,  your email renews automatically.  Very easy to set up.  You can get as many mailboxes as you need.  The price is very, very affordable.  Their most popular mailbox is basically a no-brainer  for business owners.  And again, it's your business name,  which is I think so important.  Plus, it's real email.  You can access from anywhere.  You can use the email program you're already using.  They have a web interface as well.  That's fantastic.  And they have so many interesting and fun  and different names.  .ninja, .art.  My photography portfolio, I think there's .photo,  but I got .camera.  So I have leo.camera.  Don't you think that's good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because you had to be different, sir.  Yeah, leo.camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I am a camera.  And that points to my smug mug site, right?  So I could be leolaport.smugmug.com,  but leo.camera.  So I think it just represents you a little bit better.  If you're a professional,  you absolutely ought to have your own domain name.  Very easy.  Now I know, I like working with the DNS settings  and all of that.  And they have great, powerful, pro-level tools  that are very easy to use,  but give you all the capabilities you want.  But they also have,  if you don't want to be like an expert geek,  they have Hover Connect,  which is one button to connect your website,  whether it's Squarespace or WordPress or Wix,  right to your domain name.  Just a couple of clicks.  It could not be easier.  Of course, unlike other people,  Hover includes who is privacy with your domain purchase.  They know you want private information to remain private.  That reduces spam,  protects yourself from unwanted solicitations,  attempts to steal your domain, things like that.  That's built in.  Other companies will upsell you like crazy, not Hover.  It's fast, it's easy, and it's very affordable.  Domains are very, very affordable.  At Hover, you're a customer, not a source of data.  Take back control of your data  with a reliable tracker-free email.  Hover's trusted by hundreds of thousands of customers  who use their domain names  and email to turn their ideas into a reality.  It's all we use here at Twit.  I'm a big fan.  Whether you're a developer, photographer, or small business,  Hover has something for you to expand your projects  and get the visibility you want.  Think of a domain name.  What domain name would you like?  Just to match your interests, your passion.  It's kind of cool,  all the different names that are out there.  Go to hover.com slash Twit  to get 10% off your first purchase of any domain extension  for the entire first year.  That's a good deal.  10% off Hover, H-O-V-E-R.com slash Twit.  I actually use dot email for my email addresses,  but I have leo.fm, which is the shortest.  I can get an email there.  For my retirement podcast, Leo on the Line,  I have lottle.fun, L-O-T-L dot fun.  Get it?  Lottle fun.  Lottle fun.  So cool.  Anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, when my husband and I had our engagement party,  they asked me how many domains did he own?  And that was one of my questions.  I was like, I have no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you did like the newlywed game?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, cute.  How many domains does each person own?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What kind of newlywed game is this?  What was the answer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Andrew's like-  It's like 130 something.  Yeah, like he's a total, that's his business now.  He's a domainer.  He's a domainer.  That's his business.  How many do you own, Leo?  And he was then.  Did he?  Oh gosh, let me see.  I don't know, I should go to hover.  Let me log in.  I could tell you.  100 it seems like a reasonable amount.  Unbelievable.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's how many phone bills you have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I have to have a domain for every phone, right?  Well, for instance, when Michael wanted  to run a Minecraft server, I said, okay.  You know, it's 164.3.9.  I'm not going to tell people that.  So what domain, what do you want it to be?  He says, I want it to be, and he was like eight or something.  NitroMinecraft.com.  And so I registered and hover, right?  Got it, NitroMinecraft.  That's where our servers are.  And I made a big sign in his Minecraft.  It says NitroMinecraft.  So that's cute.  Isn't that cute?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that fun?  Yeah.  That's good parenting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, yeah, I don't know if he appreciates it, but anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uncle Andrew could give us a good domain advice.  Yeah.  Well, Andrew's like obscure stuff, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, he likes really weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just got a waffle with the tax taken out.  That's my delivery.  With the what's taken out, the tax?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tax.  Oh, they took a bite out of it?  Well, I always told my kids,  that's just to check if there's poison.  There you go.  So here's all my domains.  Let's see, I got abbylaport.com, henrylaport.com.  Got to get the kids' names, right?  Inside twit, this week in tech, leoville.net.  I got my ham license, W60WT.  Oh, dude.  I got .com.net.org.

I even have some stuff for like businesses  that we thought we were gonna do, fancypants.com,  things like that.  Let's see.  Oh, I got, this is a good one that I never use.  Leoist.  I feel like there's something I could do with that, Jeff.  I don't know what.  Something's gonna happen with it.  There is, I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like Kiv.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like your influencer name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  But you know, I look for short.  That's the Leoist.  There aren't that many folks I love that.  There's the Leo, the Leoer, and the Leoist.  There aren't that many short names in the world.  That's the problem, right?  I love antproit.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's your next one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There you go.  I got a lot of twit ones.  Twit fan, twit show, twit news, twit studio,  twit social, twit community.  We twit socials are messed up.  Yeah, twit social, yeah.  Twit communities are forums or discourse.  I don't know, I never used this one.  Twitish, T-W-I-T-I dot S-H.  And I also have Leoish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's from down from Leoist.  Leoish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, twitish and Leoish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You got shells for your domain names, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I got liplock.live when I thought  what I was gonna do a TikTok competitor.  Somebody said you should get your name backwards,  so I have etropaleo.com.  Oh, I do have laport.photo.  I didn't even know I had that.  Sometimes you can have too many domains.  So I got leo.camera and laport.photo.  But not when you have hover.  Not when you got hover.  So how do I count all these?  I don't know, there's a lot.  He goes to the terminal.  I need a terminal command.  Twit.sh.  Yeah.  That's a stretch.  I should be able to do something with twit.sh.  So Andrew, when you were getting married.  Twitch.  And you played I've Been Working on the Railroad  as your theme song,  Andrew had already hundreds of domain names.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He was already buying,  he's been in this business for like 22 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did he think it was gonna be really like money?  Like he was gonna.  No, he.  Sell, like sell him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's constantly, no, he's like one of those entrepreneurs.  He's constantly looking for things  that he can make a business out of.  So he has like two or three things going on at any time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this has just been the most constant one.  At that time, he was also selling baseball cards.  Oh really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's neat. Yep.  Retcon agrees with me. And selling,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  what does he say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh no, I'm just looking in the chat room,  retcon agrees with me that twit.sh  is a very powerful bash script.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I was gonna put it,  I pasted it into a spreadsheet to count them,  but it pasted the whole thing.  So I don't know.  It pasted the whole page.  I don't know.  What do you do for a living?  I don't know what I do.  Yeah.  It's a mess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe you can ask Hover to count it for you.  Would you just be like,  hey, you know what you should add?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a feature request.  Hover should have like a number next week.  Maybe they don't want you to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dude, you got thousands of them.  The count would say not enough.  Yeah. That's what they'll say.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, you got to do it.  Hover.com slash twit for 10% off.  Your first purchase for a whole year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You do not get an ad like that.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You might be grateful.  A lot of these are just like,  Laporte.coffee?  What do I need that for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For your coffee machine.  Probably back when you were going to have one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, for my coffee machine.  You're right.  Coffee machine.  Really?  Oh, brilliant. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Our house has a domain.  So we have a domain for every house that we move into.  You see?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What happens when you go to that domain though?  Does something show up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We do it just in case.  And then when we sell our house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sell, yeah.  Oh, for the selling.  Oh, for the selling.  You're brilliant.  For the selling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For the selling of the house.  123mainstreet.com.  Yes.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have my purple air sensor,  you know, the air quality measure thing,  have their own domain name.  So I can go right there and find out what the weather is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that Leo's cough, Leo's wheeze?  Yeah.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's do the Google change log.  Already.  Already.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh.  It's time for the Google change log.  Thanks to Raygun01,  AKA Jason Howell for putting this together.  Cause I never have anything to add to the change log.  The Pixel 6 cannot install Android 12 L  after the latest update.  What?  Now I'm mad.  I have a Pixel 6, I have a Pixel 6 Pro.  I presume they mean the Pro as well.  I've enrolled my device,  but apparently they don't want you.  So if you're enrolling a Pixel 6 or Pixel 6 Pro  that is on the latest February official build,  you cannot, will not receive an update to 12 L Beta 3,  but instead receive the next upcoming Beta build  released in March, as long as you keep device enrolled.  And this is otherwise you would have a conflict, I guess.  So anyway, I don't know if that's a change  or something you should know about it.  Did you know Google has something called  the Fast Emergency Dialer?  It's on your Pixel 6 lock screen.  Yeah, see if you've got it on yours.  It's slowly rolling it out.  It's a new Fast Emergency Dialer  designed to help users travel internationally.  This is what's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cause it's 9-11 isn't international, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know 9-11, but if you're in some other country,  it's not 9-11.  So Police Fire Medical Services,  the dialer was first seen last year  through the Pixel Emergency app,  but Google confirmed to Android Police  that it's gonna be rolling out to a wider release.  It's designed for international travel.  You can use it at any location.  It will show options relevant to your location.  So it knows where you are.  Quick access to call an emergency number with one action.  Use the slider.  There's automatic emergency numbers  that are tied to your location.  The phone does that automatically.  Plus you'll get numbers for your area  like Police Fire Medical Services  and use the slider for the one you need.  You may not have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know if mine's set up  cause it just says no information.  Yeah, I don't think you have it yet.  But it was pretty easy to just swipe up  and hit that one button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, on the phone's lock screen  there's an emergency call button,  but you'll have sliders for the numbers  when that kind of rolls out.  Also, if you hold the power menu,  it'll show up there as emergency calls do as well.  I think you just don't have that dialer thing yet.  I don't have my Pixel 6 with me.  Oh yeah, there's one.  Call 911 and it's just a slider.  But if I click on touch,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the emergency button, is it gonna actually call?  No, you can touch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, you can touch it  and then it takes you to the next screen to do the slider.  And then you can see if it's the slider.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sliders are smart because you're lying there,  you're bleeding, you're feeling terrible,  you broke your leg, you got a headache  and you don't want to dial 911.  Didn't have enough coffee.  Just slide, didn't have enough coffee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So in other words, when I die on the show,  as we have discussed.  Please dial my number.  The moment beforehand, I can try to use that.  So instead of you helping me,  you're gonna say, no Jeff, go to your phone,  swipe here.  Jeff, Jeff, oh shoot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff, don't use your fingerprints, Ken.  No, just hit the lock screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff, you and I are the same age.  I was just thinking this the other day,  I want to write a blog post.  It used to be when I'm ruminating,  before I go to fall asleep.  In your rocking chair.  In my rocking chair ruminating.  Used to be I'd think about pleasant thoughts,  girls, football, bourbon.  Almost exclusively now it's death.  Oh boy.  Do you find that Jeff?  Like you just.  Yes, yes.  I think it's with age.  You go, I'm thinking, I just was thinking,  I just lost two years, I don't have that many left  and I just gave away two years to COVID.  Like I'm not gonna have, I'm gonna have 20 years,  I got eight, my life expectancy is 18 years, 18.2 years.  I just gave away two of them for nothing.  Nothing to show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's not true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Some things happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A few things.  A few things.  Not all in the good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, life is not a constant party, we'd be exhausted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why the hell not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Some people want.  Oh, oh, crochet that in a pillow.  Life is not a constant party, says Stacy Higginbotham.  Party pooper.  All right, I got 600 hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you think that's gonna be?  600 hours in Valheim, about 400 hours  in Animal Crossing New Horizons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Valheim, you were on a tear with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I learned just so.  In your underwear.  I made a lot of sourdough.  Okay, you're right, it wasn't completely wasted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, you bought a thermomix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did.  Yeah, your thermomix, I knew you were gonna bring it up.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All is not lost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which you didn't gift.  So they recently did an MRI or an EEG of a dying person.  Did you see this?  Did not, because I don't think about that kind of stuff.  We're still in the change log.  This is just a detour, okay?  So this elderly epilepsy patient  who was in the middle of an EEG suddenly died.  Bursts of activity measured by the EEG  associated with memory recall, meditation, and dreaming.  The physicians monitoring,  and this is an article published in Frontiers  in Aging Neuroscience,  which is my personal favorite magazine.  They said this is in effect kind of matches  what you'd expect if your life  was flashing before your eyes.  They say this is rare because you can't plan this.  No healthy human's gonna go and have an EEG  while they're dying.  And in a sick patient,  you don't know whether they're gonna die or not.  So it was just kind of chance.  For roughly 30 seconds before and after  the man's heart stopped beating,  the scans showed increased activity  in parts of the brain associated with memory recall,  meditation, and dreaming.  High frequency gamma oscillations,  slower frequency theta, delta, alpha, and beta oscillations.  Scientists say they were particularly intrigued  by the presence of gamma waves,  which suggest the man's brain  may have been replaying memories from throughout his life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow, passive before your eyes.  So maybe that's peaceful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's the old wives' tale.  Is that what you'd see?  Yeah.  Yeah, a little review.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And only if we knew it was scored to the soundtrack for Up  and then we'd know exactly where we were going.  Oh man, that movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right before we die.  They make you cry, that movie.  Man.  They make you cry.  Stupid movie.  All right, so.  You cried too, didn't you?  Get back to the change.  You cried.  I think you did.  We all cried.  You cried.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stupid movie.  You can't not cry.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Speaking of dialers.  Change log.  Google phone is preparing material you inspired dialer  that looks like Android 12's lock screen.  Here's a gallery from nine to five Google.  Ooh.  Okay.  This is where we, this is how pathetic  it has become now with smartphones.  Change log.  Because well, there's just not much new.  There's not much you can do.  So now look, the picture, the color,  the background kind of matches your wallpaper.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  The color that I didn't want.  Yeah.  Because your OS is saying I have to lock it in  to this particular shade of orange.  Did I show you my wallpaper on the,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you would actually, I should lend you this phone.  Yeah.  Have to take the SIM out though.  That's the.  The new note.  I mean not note.  Ultra.  Note-ish.  Look at the back, what the backdrop does on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, live wallpaper.  Ooh.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't that cool?  Nose or back?  Yeah, here, where is it?  There it is.  I don't know, it's just a Samsung thing.  Yeah.  But I, you know, the screen on this,  look at the screen on that.  Give me an independent photographer's eye.  It's a good screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Samsung has always had beautiful displays.  Yeah, really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  120 hertz, very smooth.  Look how smooth that is.  Yeah.  Oh.  I'll have to say though, in my experience,  the fingerprint reader on that isn't,  is the same as the Pixel 6.  It doesn't work the same way.  It's optical, not infrared.  But.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, this is so smooth.  Yeah.  And isn't that screen beautiful?  Oh man.  Yeah.  Where's the camera?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hold on.  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  You know what?  I'm going to wipe that and you can borrow it if you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How's the white balance?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we will know after I snap a shot.  I can't find a damn camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you referring back to?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When Aunt critiqued the one picture I took  with the Pixel 6.  Look.  And said the white balance was off.  Is that what you're referring to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, because it was off.  Ooh, yeah.  This looks great.  Damn, I look good.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, sorry.  Oh, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now we know how Aunt judges a camera.  It now has a good selfie camera.  Oh man.  It has a wide angle too.  That is really nice.  YouTube's music artist pages now list songs and albums  from your library.  This is a feature I actually really liked in play music.  And it's now on YouTube music as well.  This is how pathetic this changelog is.  This is the most minor.  How about this?  Jason, it's not Jason Howard.  No, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's all there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jason, you're amazing.  We love you, Jason.  It's your changelog that sucks.  It's not your fault.  We can only do what Google does.  And as you know, Google's on vacation.  This is something that's been in Samsung phones forever.  It's a little slider that goes with the flashlight  so you can adjust the dimness.  Android 13 is going to add it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you.  Thank you, Samsung, for telling Google to do something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, that Samsung is not bad.  That Samsung is not bad.  Yeah, I like to play with this.  I like that.  That's 22 Ultra.  And that, plus a little more, is the Google changelog.  Changelog plus.  It's a little top heavy too.  Wait.  It's heavy.  Doesn't it feel, I think heavy though  makes it feel more valuable.  Sorry, did I miss anything?  That's what I said.  I said they feel it's premium when they're heavier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there's more in it.  No, no, stop it with the heavy phone.  Stop it, Miss Floppy Wrist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I gave you, once I got this,  that's why you got the flip phone.  It's because I got the new S22 Ultra.  I said, now who do I know has floppy wrists?  And it was me.  That's me, just flopping around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And if Stacey lifts her phone up,  she's just going to topple over and fall over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's a little wisp of a lass  and she can barely hold her phone up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't talk to my ear because.  I'm antithetical to who I am.  I'm going over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is really good news.  I'm going to ask Cory Doctor about this  because Cory has always been,  he's a science fiction author, very acclaimed.  You're doing his unconstitutional bread.  Unauthorized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Unauthorized bread.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Constant.  That's the sequel.  That's later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's his next book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's later.  His ancillary bread book in your book club.  And he is a pioneer in open sourcing his books,  Creative Commons, his books.  He gives them away.  He does the audio books with no DRM, things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The audio book, I bought it directly from him,  not through audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly, I think that's great.  And honestly, Jeff knows this.  You don't do right books to make money  because you get the gigs.  You write books to get the next book.  It establishes your credibility and things like that.  It's very few books make a lot of money for artists.  Well, Brandon Sanderson,  who's a very well-known sci-fi author.  In fact, he's the guy who finished Wheel of Time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was going to say he finished the Wheel of Time.  He did a good job.  He did a great job.  And he's done several great fantasy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's beloved.  So during COVID, he didn't want to waste those two years.  He wrote not one, not two, not three,  four secret novels.  Didn't tell anybody he was writing them.  He said, originally, it was a surprise for my wife.  They're in his existing Cosmere setting.  Decided instead of going to a publisher  and getting it in advance or selling them that way,  he went to Kickstarter.  In one day, $15 million.  $15 million.  Broke fundraising records on the platform.  Unbelievable.  It helps that he's a very well-known and beloved author.  That's all there is to the world.  But this really is a model for the future.  Do it yourself.  Do it yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A lot of artists have been saying that  on the music side of things,  in addition to people writing books.  Yep, yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't say anything yet because of the contract,  but I'm going to sell a book to an academic publisher.  So the terms, $1,000 advance.  And I think it's 10% of the net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the net is they only take half of the cover price.  The bookstore gets the other half.  And you get 10% of that.  10% of half, yeah.  10% is actually a decent royalty.  But you're not alone.  A lot of authors make more money  on the Amazon Associates fee  than they do on their royalties.  Actually, Sanderson did a Kickstarter in 2021,  funded a 10th anniversary leather-bound edition  of his book, The Way of Kings,  raised $6.8 million in that one.  Dang.  So.  Does he pocket this?  I didn't think individuals.  I guess so, yeah.  Yeah, minus.  Minus the expense of printing them.  Right.  But it just shows you,  67, oh, it's actually up to 17 million now.  Oh, it's going up fast.  Up to 17.  Even as we're looking at it.  67,000 backers.  It's only day two of the Kickstarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you get all four books for how much?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  $10 without a reward.  $40 to get e-books, quarterly e-books.  $60, you get audio books and e-books.  $160, you get a hardcover e-books and audio books.  So, yeah.  And $220, you get all three formats of all four books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like when Disney used to sell their,  for five bucks extra,  they would sell you the DVD, the Blu-ray,  and the digital version.  I bet they don't do that anymore.  Each book is about-  It was a golden era.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cause now they're like, what's the DVD?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Each book is 400 pages long.  So these aren't little short books.  You also get, so you get a swag box each month.  So he's putting a lot of effort into this.  Wow, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's really neat.  In other words, he's giving these backers value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I should get this for Kevin.  He's a huge Sander son.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I'm getting Kevin.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The other issue thing was that if he'd done this-  You could also send him that Kobo e-book reader.  If you want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That you just sort of put to the side.  I'm just saying.  Where's the phone?  Where's the phone?  There's the phone.  You should charge it someday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was just confusing.  I was like, what is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I should have written a note.  This is not a phone.  I didn't put a note in there.  I didn't put a return address.  No, the book lady.  It was just a box.  Just a-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I figured it out pretty quickly when I saw the phone,  but the reader was a surprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, just a little extra.  When I sent out a box,  you never know what you're going to get.  You might get a surprise in there.  Just saying.  Ford has announced that it's splitting its auto business  into gas vehicles and electric vehicles.  Who wants to be in the past?  Isn't that interesting?  Yeah, who's going to buy me?  Well, I mean, there'll still be a market for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everybody can't afford the EVs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, there'll be a market for gas vehicles, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like the people who want to work in print.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like working in print.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  50 is-  It's my artisanal Ford.  Yeah.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's so title.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Mach-E, which I have, has done pretty well for Ford.  Well enough that they're very bullish on that.  But I mean, honestly-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Didn't they do the Lightning pickup truck?  Isn't that Ford?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The F-150 is a huge business for Ford.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That thing's, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The electric is probably going to do very well.  The stock market went up 5% on News of the Re-Ork,  so clearly the market likes it.  They'll still be both under the Ford umbrella.  It's kind of like Alphabet,  but they're going to have two different divisions.  They plan to spend-  Separate dealers?  Oh, that's interesting.  Dealers have been the weak point in this EV thing.  There are quite a few EV owners  who get quarterly mailings from their dealers,  offering them oil changes, things like that.  Oh yeah.  Both Lisa and I have experienced issues  with all three of our electric vehicles  getting them repaired.  The dealers don't really,  I have a recall on my Ford  that's been going on since December that-  Do leases ever get fixed?  Yes, leases is fixed and working fine.  Yes. Perfect.  But it really took a lot of-  It was overhauled.  Yeah, it was, yeah.  And the dealer we bought it from  didn't know what to do with it.  They actually sent it to another dealer.  And that's kind of,  I think that's the weak link in the chain.  So maybe they should have a separate EV dealer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't want your car dealer to say,  well, I have to escalate you.  That's not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they did.  They had the right to Germany to get the part.  Because it turns out it's a BMW underneath that.  Are you, if you're a Spotify fan,  are you going to buy the car thing?  I'm not buying any Spotify now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually thought of-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  I'm not a fan anymore.  Not a fan.  This is like a, you know,  kind of a phone sized device  that's just for playing music from Spotify.  I mean, most people don't,  new cars don't need this.  It's for older cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay. Wait, wait though.  Wait.  Okay. Hold on.  But wait.  It would come in handy for 90 bucks.  My Tesla now integrates with Spotify,  but because you have to create a separate email address  to work with a car's account,  this helps get around.  So one, before my Tesla allowed for Spotify,  you know, kind of a-  You couldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You couldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So it would have been handy then,  and then it would still be handy just so,  it's like, man, every now and then, you know,  the token renews and then suddenly it gets signed out  and then we gotta go look up the special email  and the special password and-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This looks like a pretty nice little piece of kit too.  It's got a nice dial.  And it's a nice, yeah.  Yeah. It's got a good screen on it.  It looks pretty nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For the money, I-  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not that much.  And-  Help destroy podcasts when you buy it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, Jeff.  That world is so many shapes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Before the show, Jeff and I had a long conversation about,  I think, honestly, Spotify is trying to kind of  get rid of independent podcasting  and bring everything under its roots.  And you know, there are only,  there's four big, at this point, podcasting companies,  because Spotify bought Gimlet and Amazon bought Wondery.  So Spotify, it's Amazon, it's iHeart,  that does my radio show, so disclaimer, I work for them.  And Apple.  And honestly, I think that these companies are so big,  so dominant, and will eat up all the advertising,  that there won't be a lot for independent podcasters.  And that's my concern, is companies like mine  probably not exist in the years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So people join the frigging club.  Yeah.  You got Ant there.  That's why the club's there.  That's why the club's there.  You're gonna see hosts in their PJs.  Yes.  I'm telling you.  Yes, it's awesome.  Join the club.  That is the declaration of independence  from Spotify.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, that's one of the reasons we did it.  We knew that this was coming, you know, is that,  and you know, when I started Twitter,  I really wanted it to be just no ads and user-supported,  but the infrastructure didn't exist.  I don't think we've gotten the size we've gotten  without advertising support,  and I still think that's gonna be the case going forward,  so I worry.  I agree, I feel you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's lots of stories here.  Amazon just announced that they're closing  all their physical stores.  Yeah, isn't that interesting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're closing some of their bookstores.  Bookstores.  Whole Foods will stay open,  and their fashion stores that they're trying to launch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Whole Foods, but no, all their book,  and that elist all of the good stuff stores.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This doesn't include the Go stores, right?  The Grab and Go.  It doesn't include groceries, no.  No food.  No, it's not food.  But it is 68 stores, Amazon Books physical stores,  Amazon Four Star, and Amazon pop-up shops,  which sold a variety of electronics on their hot items.  That was kind of weird, right?  Instead of going to Amazon, you'd go to the pop-up shop,  and you could see the most popular items  and buy it directly.  I think these were all experiments anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but they did have them,  they have them in very nice shopping centers.  I mean, the higher end shopping centers  are where you find those,  so it's a little interesting for that space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although shopping centers  aren't doing all that well, are they?  Nope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, shopping centers like the open-air malls,  and those are doing actually pretty well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the big indoor ones that are.  Yeah, the old school ones.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they're all graveyards right now.  Yeah, that's sad, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That brings us to this comparison  of online versus physical store sales for Amazon.  Last year, the numbers for last year,  $17 billion in the physical stores,  $470 billion online.  Or overall total.  So you can see it's a small portion  of their overall revenue.  I think it was just an experimental thing  they were trying, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think pretty much.  And, you know.  It's easy for deliveries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, how many times I've bought one thing  in one of the Amazon bookstores.  I haven't even sold one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  Although I like going to our bookstore,  our local bookstore and browsing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, in the Amazon bookstore experience was terrible.  Their aisles were packed with people.  The aisles were small.  I've never been in one that wasn't crowded.  And then there's just crap everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've never seen them.  I've just seen a few mom and pop stores here in Santa Rosa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's some neat stuff like, you know,  if you like this, you'll like that.  The problem is you can't browse for books anymore.  All we have is Barnes and Noble,  which its new CEO has at least improved that,  but there's, you know, books that aren't there.  And there's nowhere else to browse.  And book reviews don't review books anymore.  They have to have thumbsuckers and hot takes.  And so I welcomed another place to browse  and discover books, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't have local bookstores?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Very few.  I'm out in the burbs.  I'm way out here where I don't read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we only have one in Petaluma.  Only one, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I live on an island  and I have one local to the island.  But then I have a couple local bookstores.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Every island should have a bookstore.  That seems like.  Well, yeah.  Table stakes, really.  Sanity check.  TikTok, I don't know if this is gonna work.  TikTok, which went from 30 seconds to three minutes,  not so long ago, is now gonna increase  the length of their videos to up to 10 minutes.  Would you sit and watch a 10 minute video on TikTok?  I wouldn't, but a lot of people will.  I mean, watch the three minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A lot of people will.  Really?  Yeah.  TikTok, hardcore people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thing is, you spend that much time on TikTok  just scrolling up.  Just scrolling up.  It's not the time.  It's just, I don't know if I wanna,  I honestly, if it goes on too long, even like a minute.  Yeah, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's you, though.  But do you not think the younger people  that find something that they like,  they watch the whole video anyway.  And if it's, if salt underscore Hank  decides to do a full one all the way through,  they'll probably watch his all the way through.  Not our generation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think even when they got longer.  But Hank's stick is efficiency.  Yeah, when they got longer,  he was reluctant to make his longer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah, well that's different for his stick.  Yeah, his stick.  But it's just saying someone that's,  you know, you have like these-  There's all kinds of stuff on TikTok, I agree.  Like a lot of the social justice people  that are all over TikTok,  they would probably get a huge boost out of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It'll be, I mean, it doesn't,  I mean, you don't have to watch all 10 minutes.  No, you don't.  Is it interesting?  It's kind of saying, well, you know,  maybe we should be more like YouTube.  Like YouTube.  Yeah, it's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's a shot across about YouTube, yeah.  Cause 10 minutes is about the max.  But things that don't go on for 10 hours  and puts it, it puts it in a feed.  Yeah.  Which I think is important.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you guys get an email from Facebook  telling you to join Protect or-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would if I had a Facebook account.  Don't have a Facebook account, sir.  Oh, there's that.  Yeah, no Facebook.  Wow. You're the only one, Jeff.  Jesus.  The old man.  The old man.  That is fascinating.  That is telling right there.  That's a news story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have, I actually have a site account  and we did get a notification, but it was, it was lame.  What was the notification?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is it?  What does it say?  It just said confirm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It just said confirm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is Protect?  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's two factor.  It's two factor.  Yeah, authenticate.  I was like, I didn't tell me to sign up.  It just wanted me to confirm  that I was protecting my account.  It did look like a phishing email though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It absolutely did.  And let me find the email if I can.  That's not helpful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's kind of, I was like, well, this feels dodgy.  But then we went to the page itself and looked  and it was fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it basically said you're a media per,  a lot of media people were getting,  you have a popular, maybe it's also a site.  You have a popular site and you could be attacked  by bad actors, ergo, we're going to require you to do Protect.  And if you don't buy it, here it is, here it is, found it.  Hi, Jeff.  I love how they know you.  My dear friend, Jeff.  Cause they know you.  Your account has the potential to reach a lot more people  than the average Facebook user.  Whoa, make me feel big.  Hackers are often motivated to attack accounts  that have a lot of followers, like me.  Run important pages, well, yes.  Or hold some community significance.  I'd like to think I do.  To help defend against these targeted attacks,  we require Facebook Protect for your account.  Turn on Facebook Protect by 17 March,  what do you think we are, European?  After that, you'll be locked out of your account  until you enable it.  All right, so my presumption was fishing.  Now, hold on.  The address seemed okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did they close that with a nicety?  You know, they were all warm and fuzzy to start,  then they went and said, require,  and you better do it now or else.  And then they say, well, have a nice day,  you such a nice user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it still makes me feel special.  There we go.  Cause it says, note,  Facebook Protect isn't available to everyone.  There we go, that's the sandwich.  We require stronger security for your account  because it has the potential to reach a large audience.  Thanks so much, the Facebook team.  So anyway, so I click on the thing,  turn on Facebook Protect.  All right, all right.  And all it does is take me through like,  this is what Facebook Protect is.  And then it says, you already have two factor identification,  so you're okay.  Well, shouldn't their database know that?  And not send this to me?  But it made me feel so important that I feel better now.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wonder, I think, you know,  I've heard that a lot of this would be happening  because of the war,  that everybody was a little bit concerned  about cyber warfare and a lot of companies were saying,  let's lock down a little more than usual, I would guess.  Anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can I put in one interesting story  that I found interesting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As long as it's not the Wheel of Fortune.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you watch that though?  Did you watch it?  We all watched it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I haven't seen the whole internet watched it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have six million views of, what is this?  Everybody knows what the puzzle is,  but two people go bankrupt and finally the guy solves it.  And what's the moral of this message?  Americans are ignorant.  You don't all speak the same language?  No, you are ignorant because you don't understand  what's going on here.  Merv Griffin designed this show  to incent the onscreen contestants not to solve the puzzle.  The more they spin, the more they can make.  Right.  And he designed it because it would make the people  at home feel smart because they're sitting going,  it's feather in your cap, it's feather in your cap.  And these doofuses who are playing on screen,  they know it's a feather in your cap.  Right.  Well, one of them didn't because he guessed G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're in Vegas.  Because she guessed wrong.  She said I'll solve.  And it was a feather in your map.  A feather in your map?  Yeah, that's why this is, so you didn't watch it.  I can tell you didn't watch it.  That's good to do.  This is special because she solved wrong twice.  But you're right, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She was a dean of students at some college.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe she never heard that phrase, a feather in your dap.  And she didn't know that's what it was, right?  But you're right, Neil.  I'm sorry, feather in your gap.  That's right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is first person effect.  There's lots of academic studies for this.  There's third person effect, which says,  well, you're all going to be corrupted  by disinformation and pornography.  Not me.  I'm somehow immune.  First person effect is I'm smarter than everybody else.  They're stupid.  The entirety of TV, game shows,  It's designed that way.  Were made for first person effect.  Except for Jeopardy.  To feel superior.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Except for Jeopardy.  Yeah.  Which makes you feel horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Jeopardy makes you feel really, really dumb.  Really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's great.  When you do well at Jeopardy, you're like heartache.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love that show,  but I hardly ever do well at it,  but I do enjoy watching it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And we'll wrap up on a sad note.  The, actually-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't have the story I was going to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, go ahead, please.  That was the sad note.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's quick, it's quick.  I found this interesting.  The Copyright Review Board refused to grant copyright  to art created by AI.  Right.  And they said that ownership by the machine  was not sufficient.  And that, where did it go here?  In their review.  That there's a presumed human touch to it.  Presumed.  That was founded for, quote,  that are founded in the creative powers of the,  and they put in brackets, human mind.  Which is to say the law didn't say human.  It didn't anticipate unhuman creation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they had, yeah, the copyright law  predates any of the AI stuff.  Well, 1710.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  It starts, right?  So, it's weird because this thing doesn't look like  it was a very good argument on its behalf.  Maybe it's just a test case,  that's why they were doing that.  But what it says,  because they also go to an 1880-something case  where somebody printed a photo  and they tried to argue that the photo  was not the creation of human being,  it was the creation of a machine.  Well, wasn't there a whole furrah about the photo

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that was taken by the monkey, the gorilla?  Yeah.  And who owned the copyright to that?  They cite that here.  But the monkey couldn't.  Photographer, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It has to be human.  I don't know, I found this really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's very human-centric.  I don't like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Let's power to the AI's.  It's humanist.  It's very Leo-ist.  Yeah.  Leo-ish.  Leo-ish.  Don't you mean Leo?  Yes.  I have Leo-ist as well.  But that's impossible.  Leo-ish.  I have L-E-O.  That's, well, Leo is Leo

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  as Kiv is to Kiev.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right.  Kiv.  So the problem with Leo is it's got an E with an accent to Q,  and so that always gets translated  into a weird Unicode string.  So you can't use it for a domain name.  It's not good.  I tried, but everybody laughs at me when I do.  Oh, look, it gets a nice picture, though.  What the hell?  That's what it goes to.  That's what it goes to.  I don't know why.  Maybe because IS is Iceland.  Is this a picture of Iceland?  That's very odd.  I didn't put that there.  Sure you didn't.  That is weird.  Oh, that's Leo-ish.  That's the problem.  I need to do Leo-ish.  See?  Anyway, I think I've told this story years ago.  Thank you for letting me do my little story.  I thought you never had a sad moment.  Well, do you agree, though,  that AI should probably not be able to be given copyright?  Well, I don't know.  I think they should be.  What's the entity and what's the purpose?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the thing about copyright is,  go ahead, go ahead, Stacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Then I'll go to the next one.  Well, I was gonna say, if I've got copyright,  then I can make money on it.  So if I'm a person who invents an AI  who can write something that's copyrightable  or produce something that's copyrightable.  Then the person should get the copyright.  Then I end up with the money and the copyright.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, here's the deal.  So copyright was created not to protect authors.  It was created by the publishers, the booksellers,  to create a tradable asset.  They couldn't own the asset and sell it  unless I own something as the author  and granted it to them.  And then Ant sells it to you, Leo, and that's the why.  So what's gonna happen here, I think, is Stacy's right.  I'm gonna go create an AI  that's gonna pump out tons of NFTs.  Yeah, that's exactly what's happening now.  And I want them all to be tradable assets.  That's exactly what's happening today.  That's what Netflix does already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.  It's basically an algorithm deciding what movies they create.  So, okay, yeah, I can see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a point.  That's interesting, Stacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Would you buy a cookbook  based on?  Yes.  Yeah, of any kind.  But maybe, think about this.  Based on 50 recipes found in the world's biggest email leaks.  Email leaks.  That would be no, sir.  Featuring WikiLeaks and Hillary Clinton,  as well as the Pizzagate scandal,  exchanges between staff  and the world's most influential companies  like Enron and Sony.  The leaked recipes cookbook showcases 50 recipes,  including the very best cookie  and a secret barbecue sauce, among others.  It's not just a cookbook.  It's an insight into office culture, politics,  corruption hacking, family, and friendship.  Oh, my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would 100% buy it.  It would be a great gift to give someone like me  who is a journalist who also likes to cook.  I would just say that's a fun gift, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's interesting.  Because it is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's cool to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Because it has the email,  the author made the recipes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was going to say, are these tested?  Yes.  That's important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, in fact, the images are hysterical.  Here's pecan and pumpkin bread  with a pocket computer associated with it.  This is 35 euros from JBE Books.  It's written by Demetria Gloss.  And some of these recipes have redacted.  Redacted?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love the pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You should redact celery in anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mums the wed.  I think these are, I mean,  because think about it.  Isn't that clever?  I have this instant flashback to all the recipes  I've shared with people via email.  Yeah.  So, or Slack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or Discord.  Thank you to cocky.org for discovering.  That one from Demetria Gloss and photographer,  Emily Bouts, the leaked recipe's cookbook.  Fascinating.  Fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thing of the week?  Or are we still?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  I just, we're gonna do a thing of the week.  I just want to mention in passing,  I had never heard this guy's name.  He was co-inventor of Ethernet,  passed away at the age of 71.  He was an intern at the Xerox PARC research lab in 1973.  One afternoon in the basement of the lab,  he noticed another researcher tinkering  with a long strand of cable.  The researcher, another new hire named Bob Metcalf,  who we do know, was exploring ways of sending information  to and from the lab's new computer, the Alto.  Mr. Metcalf was trying to send electrical pulses  down the cable.  He was struggling to make it work.  Mr. Boggs offered to help.  Over the next two years,  they designed the first version of Ethernet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Surprisingly, even though Bob Metcalf mentions Ethernet  every time you talk to him,  he has never mentioned this fellow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing, I never heard this guy's name.  Metcalf did say in an interview with the New York Times,  he was a perfect partner for me.  I was more of a concept artist.  He was a build the hardware in the back room engineer.  Everybody who has the idea needs somebody who can make it.  So Boggs was, I guess, Mr. Metcalf's Burke.  He was the guy who made it.  I was gonna say you were more like the Was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He was his Was.  He was his Was.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's, you know, we should mention it.  David Reeve's Boggs passed away at the age of 71 this week.  Also, Ham radio.  We're getting to that point where we pretty regularly

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  are paying tribute to people who created  the technologies we're using now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And more and more we're getting that time of life.  All right, let's take a little pause,  a little breath, a little breather.  I was gonna mention the new UCIE chiplet standard.  I was gonna mention the success of RISC-V.  All of these were stories to welcome Stacey back.  But, you know, just read her, you know,  Stacey on IOT Newsletter.  I'm sure she'll talk.  I had put a lot of chip stories in here  to celebrate your return.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did see that.  I was like, oh, I feel like I'm needed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is UCIE?  What is that?  I have no idea.  Okay.  Yeah.  That's a standard AMD Intel and ARM supported.  It's an interconnect.  Universal chiplet interconnect.  Oh, yeah, this is, okay, yeah.  It's an interconnect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is not something I know about.  Infrastructure.  This is because it was launched today.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  We'll be hearing about it tomorrow on Stacey on IOT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, let me know.  Let me read about it in today's news  that I was recording my show for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let us pause when we return the picks of the week,  the things of the week and that sort of thing.  Let's kick things off with Stacey Higginbotham  and her thing of the week, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This week's thing is actually an app  helping or because of a thing.  So Apple AirTags, we all know and love.  Or are worried about being stalked by.  And we've talked about how Apple released an app  for Android users.  But a German engineering school, no, a German university,  that's the word I'm looking for, has released,  I'm looking for it, an Android monitoring app.  I thought there was gonna be an ad for me to look this up.  Sorry, y'all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did it very fast.  It was a quick answer.  I was like, oh my God.  It's time to pull this up.  Apple released its own Android app, Tracker Detect,  which really isn't that good.  And it's an issue.  If you have an iPhone, the iPhone will say  there's an AirTag tracking you.  But if you don't have an iPhone, you're kinda in the dark.  So good.  What is this app called?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's already notified me like three times.  I can't find it.  Oh, that's so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  AC is in extremis.  Oh man, we need to make a GIF.  Oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Please.  Sorry, it's called Air Guard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's an AirTag protection app for Android.  Ooh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, and they built it and they're making it better.  It does seem to be a little bit more active.  Now, because it's on an Android phone, it doesn't go off.  It's gonna notify you much less often  because it doesn't have access  to the Bluetooth controls, I guess.  But you get a notification  and you're also part of a giant research project,  I should tell you.  When you download this app,  and like 125,000 people have downloaded it so far,  you become part of their research into this.  And they're very upfront.  You have to share all your location permissions  even while the app is not being used.  So you may get a little weirded out by that,  just so you know.  But it seems to be really good.  It's notified me.  My husband put an AirTag on me  for wandering around over the weekend.  It worked.  I also got a random one that I realized was my friend  that I was hanging out with.  So, yeah.  I don't know.  It seems to be pretty good.  And...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to ignore battery optimization.  That's a Samsung thing.  I'm just doing all this stuff right now.  No, I had to do it on my Pixel 2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you did?  Okay, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I had to, yeah.  I'm participating in the study.  I'm all set.  Okay.  And now it will tell me  if there are trackers in my neighborhood.  That's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so it shows me like,  here are all the AirTags that have been discovered  in my neighborhood or around me lately.  So it tracks all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's tracking right now.  Let's see, because there are quite a few AirTags  in this environs.  Let's see if it finds any.  No, it didn't.  Here, let me just put this AirTag right on top of it.  And...  Give it a minute.  This is a problem I had with the Apple device as well.  The Apple app for Android.  And maybe it's a limitation of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was gonna say, let it run for half an hour.  Okay.  Let's see if it'll find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  But it's not something you could walk into a room  and see AirTags in the room because it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's not what this is designed...  That's not what the original app is designed to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I understand.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, okay.  And what's nice, it does allow you to ignore some.  So if you have some of your own, you would wanna do it.  Okay.  Oh, I have to turn on BLE, which was not on.  You do?  That was not on.  So maybe that was part of the problem.  Let's do another manual scan  with Bluetooth low energy turned on.  Ant's doing it as well.  Did you find anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No?  No, show all devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is kind of the same problem I had with the Apple app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Again, check it in half an hour.  I'll leave it running in the bathroom.  Or an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because your gun, it'll pop up.  Mine didn't pop up with anything  even though there are AirTags hanging out with me,  you know, constantly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Apple's doing everything it can.  And to be fair, there are even better ways to do this,  like these little inexpensive GPS devices,  which are much more accurate.  The reason that AirTags are an issue  is because there's so many iPhones out there.  They're so ubiquitous.  That it really is a-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the same reason that Google,  like getting your name in Google search engine  is such a problem for people because everyone uses it.  Anyway, that was my thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Excellent.  Jeff, do you wanna,  I see you tweeted about Ukraine Radio.  You wanna, is that one of your things,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  or you just wanna talk about that?  No, I just tweeted it because I'm-  Tick tock, crinkle cake?  Tick tock, crinkle cake.  We could do that.  We could do tick tock.  Crinkle cake.  BBC just announced they're gonna start a short wave  in Ukraine and Russia, which I don't know.  How do you have a short wave radio?  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wonder if they're more common in other countries.  When I was a kid, that was the best thing to do.  In fact, I listen to Radio Moscow all the time.  I do too.  Yeah, I wonder how many people have short wave these days.  We became communists, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's right.  We were misinformation.  That's right.  No, I decided to do this week in crypto  because we have the Guardian test runs  an NFT vending machine.  I put it in my corner and nothing came out,  which is basically how that works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you don't get anything when you buy it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You get some kind of box or something  that's saying you're a schmuck.  You just want to know.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are only two products.  You can buy a color for $5.99  and a party pigeon for $420.69.  Har har.  Wow.  This is basically a scam, I would guess.  Although it's a fun scam.  It's smart because by having the party pigeon  $4 to $20 thing, the $5.99 for a color seems like a deal.  Oh yeah, and they go rack up on the $5.99.  It's like, oh wow, obviously you have to be an idiot  to buy the party pigeon.  Let's just buy the color.  It's only $6.  Rack it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  Then we also have elsewhere in Cool Land,  a social club, says the New York Times,  runs on crypto tokens and vibes.  Friends with benefits, get it,  is a VIP lounge for crypto's creative class.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it's just like the Anadelvy Foundation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was going to say, it's for con artists.  It's going to have great, great artists

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and we are going to have wonderful food everywhere.  Friends with benefits, a VIP lounge  for crypto's creative class.  Man, those are the people I want to hang out with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a Dow.  Of course.  Dow!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The chef is named Belly Man.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ah!

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  6,000 unique token holders.  Dang.  It raised $10 million from investment last year,  including who else but Andres and Horowitz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because they're the big pushers of all of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I have a theory here,  so I'm working on a proposal for something.  I wonder how different the internet would be  and our attitudes toward it would be  if it weren't run by bros.  VCs?  These guys?  Well, not too, but bros.  Yeah, bros.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Man, this club has really run down.  This is a dump.  Uh, okay, yeah.  I can't wait to hang out with these guys.  That looks so much fun.  Do they have a space heater in there somewhere?  What is that?  Yeah, there's a little space heater.  Uh, yeah, this is a quality place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they debate things like whether to spend $20,000  from the treasury to develop  a members-only subscription coffee service.  Sure, why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sink in your cup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And.  You're old, Andres, you're old.  Bob Dylan is getting in the NFT train.  Right?  This is yours?  Yeah, this is mine too, yep.  Did you post the wrong article?  Cause I only see stuff about the Ramones.  I see the room.  How did that happen?  You posted an article about why the Ramones  never had any hits, which is fascinating, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They should have some NFTs.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh hell, where was that?  Bob Dylan is getting into NFTs with Snow Crash.  Yes.  I could see how somebody like Dylan  could be talked into, you know,  maybe you can make some nice money.  If you have your own alcohol,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you probably have your own NFT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.  So, oh, there's going to be a Miles Davis NFT as well.  This is a Solana marketplace called Snow Crash.  Wow, what can I get?  A Bob Dylan NFT drop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I put it on 195, I found it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just doesn't really seem like a good use of my money.  Oh, Leo.  Can you do it?  I haven't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I have an update from you, hot from the Twitter  about your domain name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo is, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, about you actually, according to Mime Artist on Twitter,  you have 71 domains.  It said so at the top of the list that you were showing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Andrew wins.  Andrew wins.  It was at the very top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We should have done this in a dating game.  It would have been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was like, oh, I just checked Twitter,  so I feel like I should probably do that.  I guess so.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah, domain 71.  Yeah, it says it right there.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's in dark mode.  You think you'd be able to read it better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, there it is.  Well, that's not very many.  All right.  Golly, you think I'm important than that.  If Andrew's got 100, he had 100 when you got married.  He's probably got thousands now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, Stacy, did you do the over or the under  in your engagement party?  Did Andrew have more or less than you thought?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, way more.  I mean, who in 2002 would think you would have  that many domains?  I mean, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What other questions?  I'm really curious.  I have two now.  In this fun context.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What did they ask him about you?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I really don't remember.  Is there a video?  I just remembered the domains.  There's a video somewhere, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somebody made a video.  It was 2002.  Yeah, there's a video of it somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If it was recorded on a flip, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And your thing of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  First, I want to give a shout out to Maxon  because they're continuing to create some content  for video creators that are wanting to do  more visual effects.  And they have released their schedule for this year  for free online webinars for people to get into training  with stuff like Cinema 4D and Red Giant  just a lot of visual effects software  that you can use for your video.  Nice.  Best known for of course Cinema 4D.  Yep, yep, yep.  Something I still don't know yet  because it scares the crap out of me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, me too.  I look at it every time.  I go, okay.  And Red Shift is, I don't know what Red Shift is.  Red Giant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Red Giant?  They do a lot of particles and stuff.  A lot of plugins.  Cool.  But yeah, I wanted to give them a shout out  so I saw that in my inbox today.  And then next I want to shout out Miss Terry, Terry Porter.  I met Miss Terry this weekend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You were on a sailboat I saw.  I was on a sailboat.  I was very jealous.  And with my buddy Chris Michael I love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh man, it was so much fun.  I was invited by Flipboard and Mr. Jefferson Graham  who's been on the show before  just to come out and do a little photo shoot on the boat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, do we have any pictures from Aunt Pruitt?  I put some in my little Flipboard gallery

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  down next line.  But Miss Terry was this little old lady.  She was so funny and just had a good time.  And she knew about Twit  because she used to watch iOS today.  And she said she remembers watching Twit  when she first got her iPad and how she enjoyed Twit.  But I just wanted to give her a shout out.  She was just a nice lady and just fun to talk to.  And we didn't freeze out there in the water  like I thought we would.  I got home and my bed was spinning, but okay.  Oh, I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love how my bed rocks after you've been on a boat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My bed was spinning.  Wasn't rocking, spinning.  I was so sick.  But you weren't sick on the boat  just when you got home.  No, I wasn't sick on the boat.  And it's probably because I was driving a whole lot.  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.  So it was a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love this picture of you.  Did Chris Michael take this?  That was, yep, for Chris.  And it must be his Leica.  I love it that he let the dot be red  and everything else is monochrome.  I love that shot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love that shot.  That shot, I had the best dadgum time  and I remember sitting there just thinking,  this is a photo opportunity for me,  but here recently, I don't know if it's because of  the way COVID has made us think differently,  but I had to put my camera down and I just take it in  and just enjoying the moment.  But it was just one of the best times of my life.  That's fun.  It was a sailboat?  Yeah, on a sailboat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't that nice?  Oh, it was great.  Some years ago, before your time,  we bought an auction, a sail around the bay  on Humphrey Bogart's old sailboat.  What?  That somebody at the school auctioned off  a ride around the bay.  And we took the twit team, it was a long time ago,  but we took the twit team and went out on a sail.  It was really fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And getting out there at sunset,  and being able to watch the sunset on the bay there,  it's just beautiful.  And I put a couple of shots up on my site for prints  if people want to order them at perot.com slash prints.  But it was just a great experience.  Nice.  And then lastly, I want to say good luck  to the little weirdo and the hard head.  What's going on with the hard head?  This is her opening week for track season.  The niece.  Yep, my little niece.  She wanted to learn how to do hurdles,  so I taught her on that,  and she's doing really dang good.  I can't wait to see what she does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You make the camera distort every time she steps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's fun.  I've had a lot of fun working with her,  and the coaches have been working with her,  and I'm just really pumped up about it.  And the hard head, he's wanting to defend his title.  He pulled a hamstring last week,  but he may still be able to run this week.  We'll see, but this is my little niece.  You're better.  You can turn the audio.  Oh, yeah, I should,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because there's probably some screaming involved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Probably aunt screaming.  It was, it was some pearls of wisdom there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then he wanted to do a trailer for himself.  Oh, this is hysterical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I saw this.  This is good, aunt.  This is so much fun.  Oh, this is great.  What do you use for the effects?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me see, that was a mix of stuff in Resolve  as well as in Premiere.  I love that.  The boom, boom, boom.  I have no life, so I just sit around.  It's really great.  It's doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love every time she steps, it goes boom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's going to crush it though.  I'm looking forward.  That's nice.  Get that knee up, get it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you the coach?  I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, nice.  Get that knee leg up, get it right back down,  because you are running, you're not jumping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right.  That's words of wisdom from Coach Pruitt.  Yes, coach.  Yes.  So she's going to go over that hurdle.  Get it, get it, get it.  Oh, yeah, that's scary.  She did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She got it.  That's hard to do.  I'm pretty proud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can I get you, aunt, to do some sound things for me  when I'm doing my workout?  If you could just be like, get it, get it, get it, get it,  go, and I'll play it at the right moments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Get it, get it, get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got you.  Like when I'm doing my 2,000 meter row.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I can just be like.  Get it, get it, get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That'd be good in the whoop band.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'd pay for that.  That's not enough.  Keep pulling, keep pulling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There we go.  Exactly, because you get to that last 500,  you hit that 1,500 mark, and you're like,  oh my God, I'm dying, I'm dying.  Everything you've got.  But you got to do it appropriately,  you know, because you got 500,  but you know you've still got like  three and a half more minutes of rowing you got to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  These four kids, I'll tell you,  they love and hate our relationship.  I'll just say that,  because they want me to help them out.  Well, I could turn you off when I'm done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you're in my whoop band,  I could just move the whoop band.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll be like, and we're done here, Ant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis, thank you so much.  He blogs at BuzzMachine.com.  He's at Jeff Jarvis on the Twitter,  but most of all, he's the director of the Townite Center  for Entrepreneurial Journalism at the.  Newmark Graduate School of Journalism  at the City University of New York.  Jeff.  Thank you, boss.  Appreciate your contributions.  You and I, we're just going to sit in a rocking chair  and think about death.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I will definitely not be hanging out  with you on the front porch.  Good morning.  I only got a few years left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You got a bucket list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey Leo, do you have a bucket list?  I don't, but I was just thinking the other day  that if I had a bucket list,  I would do a Panama Canal crossing on that bucket list  because I've done the Suez Canal.  I think I'm going to do all the canals.  Maybe that'll be it.  Do it.  I forgot, I got to travel.  How about the Erie Canal?  The Erie Canal.  You know, in 2024,  we're taking a riverboat from St. Paul, Minnesota  to New Orleans.  Ooh, man.  I don't know if we go through the Erie Canal.  Twain.  Well, no, the Erie Canal is there.  There is a, the Erie Canal is in New York.  Yeah, yeah, I know.  It's there.  I don't know this geography thing,  but the same cruise company,  Viking does a river cruise  that does go through the Erie Canal  and through the Great Lakes.  So that'd be kind of fun, a great experience.  That would be cool.  I see America first, you know what I'm saying.  And peru at twit.tv slash H-O-P,  he's also our community manager  in the fantabulous Club Twit Discord.  You have had some great events lately.  What's coming up?  Anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we just had Mr. O Doctor,  O and JJ Stone on AMA.  Oh, wow, how'd that go?  Talk a little bit about you, Mr. Jarvis.  We have coming up a Insight Twit conversation.  I believe it's on the 17th of March  with Mr. Michael Sargent's gonna host  our very own Mr. Patrick Delahansy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is something Michael wanted to do  and I'm really glad he's doing it.  He said, you interview all the hosts,  we should interview the people who make all this possible.  So, yeah.  And so Patrick Delahansy, who's our coder,  our engineer, one of the engineering team.  And he's in Boston, but he'll be great.  And John, you gotta do it.  John and Burke say they don't wanna do it.  I've been asking John and Mr. Burke

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  from day one and they both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can I interview Burke?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, God, Burke.  Maybe that'll do it.  Stacey will interview you.  How about that?  Come on, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know anything about, well, I don't know.  Burke has stories to tell.  And you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's from Texas, so you two get along  really well together, I think.  He does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He likes the same science fiction books as I do, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, Burke, Burke, Burke, Burke, Burke.  When I officially got the title,  I had already said, hey, I wanna talk to these guys.  They kept looking at me like I was crazy.  People hear their names, but they don't get to know them.  No, we don't wanna be on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're smart.  They realize the hazard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What about Scooter X?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Scooter X.  Two?  Yeah, our chat manager, our chat, yeah.  Yeah, maybe some others in the chat.  I think the chat mods kinda like to stay anonymous.  They don't want anybody.  Yeah, that's true.  They've been targeted.  They get a target on their back.  But I think Osnet and Scooter X  and some of the others would be fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You could do one of those, you know,  change the voices of the control.  And the silhouette behind the.  Yeah, that'd be fun.  Exactly, yeah, I like that.  We could put a bag over the head with eyes.  And then they like that Scooter X, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stacey's Book Club's coming up March 24th  with the ancillary copyright bread.  That'll be great.  That'll be really great.  I will mention to Corey that you're gonna do that.  Maybe we can get him to pop in as the author.  That would be cool.  Paul Thurotte at the end of the month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, he could lead the book club, actually, if he wants.  If he wants.  He could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel that the author really didn't get the idea here.  Be like pulling out Marshall McLuhan saying,  you have no idea, you have no idea what my work means.  So if you're not a member of Club Twitter,  there's so many. You know nothing of my work.  You know nothing of my work.  How did you get to be a professor?  If you are not a member of Club Twitter,  twit.tv slash club twit,  it really is the best seven bucks you'll spend this month.  It's fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just one coffee a month, folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah, that's where you can put the image  of me searching for the set.  Oh, that's a meme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a meme.  That's a meme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is a meme.  I've already marked it.  Oh, we gotta add that to our animated gift collection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
