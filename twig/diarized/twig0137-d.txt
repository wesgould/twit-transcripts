Yes, you should not mention this book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Lifehacker book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Lifehacker book.  Lifehackerbook.com.  Now it's third edition.  Lifehackerbook.com.  Third edition.  Yes.  See what I did there?  You were good.  You're good.  Are you headed off for South by Southwest after this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not.  I'm not going this year.  No, none of us is going.  First time in six years.  I'm feeling kind of sad about it.  You know, it wasn't worth the time and the travel for me this year.  Although I am regretting it seeing some of my friends talking about it.  Everybody is going.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, that's the FOMO, fear of missing out.  But I try to do, you know, no FOMO here.  I try to be present where I'm at.  But yeah, I'm regretting it a little bit.  I think it's going to be nuts.  I think that's going to be great.  I hope everybody who goes has a great time.  I want to hear about it and see pictures and all that stuff.  We had a great time last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a social event now, really.  That's why we didn't, you know, we had to decide whether to cover it.  Sarah Lane is going.  But we had to decide, do we want to cover it?  And I just decided there probably wouldn't be a lot of news there.  Unless something weird happens.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not the sepia of 2007 where Twitter launches or Foursquare launches.  It just isn't that anymore.  As much as I think a lot of new startups want it to be that.  I don't think it's that.  You know, it's just similar to Comic-Con here in San Diego.  Like it's just so grown, so far out of proportion that it gets kind of watered down and difficult to enjoy.  Although I love the South by folks and I hate to feel like I'm slamming them.  I'm not.  It's been a great event.  I've gone every year for the last six years.  And I might go back next year.  We'll have to talk about it.  Maybe the three of us will go back.  It's the same here, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I got into a little bit of a semi-public tiff on Google Plus because of their contract for speakers that doesn't let you speak anywhere else.  And I just decided that I was going to try something else this year.  I do regret the expansion to all the campuses.  And it's just hard to stand in the hall and see your whole world swimming by.  Which is the way it used to be.  And that's gone now with size.  And it's inevitable with size.  I have a friend of mine who runs another conference in Europe.  I won't say what it is because he said that his partners would kill him for thinking this.  But he said, you know, it's been around five years.  It's a really good conference.  It's grown big.  Maybe it's time to kill it.  And that there's a natural size and a natural time.  And if you grow really big, one of two things is going to happen.  You're going to be Ted and become very exclusive.  Or you're going to become South by.  And you're going to become so damn big that, you know, you lose your charm.  And, you know, success is a wonderful thing.  I don't I agree.  I love the South by people, too.  I think they put on an amazing conference.  They do a phenomenal job.  They've obviously brought our whole tribes there.  But there was a dinner that I've had the last three years there.  And somebody started to organize it again this year.  And every single person that was saying, not there this year, not there this year, not there this year.  Yeah.  Well, maybe it's new tribes.  Maybe it's new people.  Maybe we're just too old for South by.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  From a news point of view, I think because Twitter and then Foursquare and then Gowala launched so big and it really put them on the map, three successive South buys now last year, there were hundreds of launches there.  And so no one could launch big because there was there was too much competition.  And so that's why I feel like I don't think we're going to miss any big launches.  You know, I don't know what is the is highlight going to be the big app this year?  Do is any any thinking about usually they tend to be social apps location aware in the last couple of big launches.  What do you think?  You guys, even though we're not going to be there, you're going to make any picks.  Anybody know what?  I don't even know.  And I just I wait.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I feel I feel I feel a little FOMO.  I love that phrase.  I'm going to use that from now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel a little FOMO myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I feel a little FOMO.  I love that phrase.  I'm going to use that from now.  I feel a little FOMO myself.  Yeah.  It's a Katarina fake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's one of hers.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it?  Yeah.  Perfect.  And I'm hedging my bet a little bit because because Sarah will be down there.  I said, Sarah, if anything big happens, you know, you'll be on TNT and we'll have some coverage down there.  But, you know, of course, last year, there was a huge story with an Apple pop up store because the iPad 2 went on sale during.  Right.  South by this year.  It's going to go on sale three days after South by.  And so maybe maybe we don't need to be there for that.  I don't know.  Let's I guess I should mention that we are recording this the same day Apple sucked all the air out of the room by announcing they don't they didn't name it just the new iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why do you love that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love that they dropped the model number that it's not the three or the two S or I like that it's just the new the new iPad.  I think it's just simple and clear.  This is this is this is what it is.  This is although tech writers are going to say the third generation or the new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the only thing I don't like is that they were going to be somewhat required to do that.  Right.  Is it the last iPad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The ultimate somebody.  I'm serious.  Yes.  This is the last one in the next one that they have in mind.  You know, Steve's next product is something different.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You think so?  No, I don't think so.  No, I think this is.  Oh, good.  I'm pre ordering right now.  And we'll talk about ourselves.  Would you mind?  You got it.  You got to watch.  I cannot think of an example in history in the history of the world where a company created a product for which there was such instantaneous demand.  And product at this price, starting at five hundred dollars and going up to eight hundred twenty nine dollars, that there was so much demand that they could not even the website just which means it must be more than a million people trying to order.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, full on Leo, you don't think that there is that's not somewhat engineered.  It's like it's like run out, run out online all the time.  And you know, they have more in the back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I disagree.  I don't think Apple needs to play those games at all.  Some people do.  Apple, Apple, I know the iPhone they did for the iPhone.  I think maybe the first time, but I think they can sell every single one they can make.  I think they've been making them as fast as they can for at least four or five months.  And they would love to be able to fulfill every order just like that.  Why not?  It's just money in the bank and they don't need more marketing.  I don't think you can make a case anymore.  I mean, maybe you could in the first iPad or the first iPhone.  You don't need to make they don't need to they don't need to do nothing.  They just need to sell it as fast as they can.  They need to upgrade their servers.  I can't think of anything like this.  I just there's no other it's it's amazing.  Somebody's saying, well, what about the bag of crap?  OK, you're right.  You're right.  It's the iPad and the Wouk dot com bag of crap.  There you go. Right there.  That says it right there.  Those are the two.  This is what a consumer economy we live in.  That's a good point.  The website goes down every time when the bag of crap.  They actually they have some sort of bizarre lottery scheme if you want to order a bag of crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel like as a Google fan, it's my duty to make some sort of snarky remark about how Apple doesn't do web apps that scale well.  But I'm going to refrain from that.  No, I disagree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think you're right.  I brought this up in MacBreak Weekly.  Facebook can figure this out.  Google can figure this out.  Why can't Apple figure this out?  It's not just their store.  It's Siri.  You know, it's more germane for Siri, which is only half the time.  And notice they did not put Siri on this new iPad.  They put voice dictation, which will probably be just as broken.  And I think that this is a failure.  I think that is a failure.  And I think you're absolutely right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, one could argue that it would be fiscally irresponsible to build your entire server infrastructure for two hours a year.  Right.  And so, you know, it'll be fine.  And we get it.  We get a fringe benefit of that.  People are going to talk about it.  It doesn't hurt.  That doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  But Siri is a year in, year out.  And they and, you know, I think that you can scale it.  I think you call Mark Zuckerberg's people or you call Larry Page's people and you say, hey, how do you do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but that's like saying that Google could design better devices by just calling up Apple's people and being like, hey, how do you do it?  I mean, I think just some companies are just better at certain things.  I mean, Apple's incredible at building amazing hardware and amazing software, you know, installable software.  But the cloud, the cloud part, they're not not so not as great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They've never done a good job, have they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They haven't.  But again, I don't want to trash Apple because the iPad looks really good.  I didn't watch the the live announcement today and the coverage because I just I got caught up with some work stuff.  So I'm not quite as frothy about it as everyone who has been watching.  I haven't even attempted to order it yet.  I probably will want to get one at some point, although I'm sure that it's going to sell out and, you know, it'll be a few months before I get it.  But it sounded like a really solid update.  I mean, it sounds like a really great, great new update.  I mean, I think for casual users on iPad, too.  I don't know if upgrading to the iPad three.  Oh, yeah. Wait, will you see the screen?  I mean, yeah, I imagine the retina display is a movie.  I do love that.  Was that it, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  There's really nothing else that new about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, there's a better camera.  There's a decent camera for a change.  Oh, faster processor.  But no, it's all about the screen.  In fact, they call it on the front page of the Apple dot com site resolutionary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that was a little gimmicky.  That was just that kind of showed some.  It's a little cheesy.  It's a little cheesy.  Yeah, I mean, for a company that usually does very elegant marketing,  that whole resolutionary, I was like,  I don't think that would have gotten past Steve.  I'm sorry.  Steve, you know exactly what Steve had done that?  Yeah.  But OK, I'll give it to them because the retina display is really great.  I love it on the iPhone.  And I'm certainly going to go.  I want to see it on the iPad.  I think it's one thing to see it on a three and a half inch display.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Another thing entirely on a nine point seven inch display.  I think you I suspect people will be so blown away that this will be a product  that will outsell anything they've ever done by several orders,  by maybe an order of magnitude.  I mean, it's going to be very significant.  And really the big story and we touched on it a little bit,  but I don't know.  We got the big thinkers.  We got the big brains in here now.  I think the big story and Apple certainly pushed this is this is a post PC device  in a way that, you know, Steve, you, Jeff, you know, boxed up your iPad one.  You said it's just it's a content consumption device.  I was wrong.  No, you were wrong.  I have it.  But you weren't wrong on the iPad one.  I got to eat my crow.  That's a delicious crow.  No, but I think that the third one in the way that it's evolved in terms of speed,  capacity and and and and screen is now and it's clear that Apple wants it to be a  content creation device, I think, merely for video and pictures alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah, they clearly do.  Go ahead, Jeff.  No, no, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go ahead, Jen.  They clearly do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But, you know, I watched the promotional video, you know, the dad taking video of his kids  playing in the sand at the beach with the iPad.  I just first of all, I don't bring my iPad to the beach.  I live here in San Diego, so I go to the beach a lot.  That just seemed that seemed crazy to me.  And the table with people, people sitting around a table with garage band up with each  of four iPads kind of all linked together playing, you know, the drums and the piano  on the iPad.  That kind of bummed me out.  Really?  You don't like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You'd rather see him play real instruments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Get some get some instruments.  You're such an old fart.  Yeah, this is definitely my old fart mode.  I was like, people get some pictures.  I think is great.  I still think it's weird when people take pictures with their tablet.  And Neil, my boss, Neil, put together this this milkshake feed of pictures, photos of  people taking pictures with their tablet.  It's dorky.  It's completely dorky.  I mean, it's so dorky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I don't think I think that's going to change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like the idea of putting together a commercial or a movie of my kids birthday party on the  iPad.  It's just not something I've done.  And I'm not convinced yet that I'm going to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does Apple does sometimes do that where they FaceTime is a good example where they can  make a very compelling commercial and say, oh, you're going to really want to do this.  And you even might get sucked in initially.  And then you never use the feature.  I think Siri is on the edge.  FaceTime.  Definitely.  That's a case.  And people will always say, oh, no, I use it.  But really, I don't think it's vastly widely used.  So it's very easy to make a commercial that looks like, I really want to do that.  It's the dad on the beach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  I mean, come on.  Would you bring your iPad that close to the sand?  I'm just too particular about my devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But why are you actually you're going to learn something right now?  I never go to the beach because I can't stand getting sand in my socks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm looking at you and thinking this is a man who's never been in the sun.  Period.  No, I don't.  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't do it.  I'm sorry.  You cannot see even the retina display in the sun.  And because I live in San Diego, so I know this for sure, especially if you sunglasses on.  You turn it the right way.  The sunglasses interact.  But anyway, I'm not going to pick the commercials.  It looks like a really incredible device.  And I I definitely want one.  That's right.  I'll admit it.  But do you have one now?  Do you know?  I do.  I have the iPad, too.  And I have to say, I love it.  I love it.  It is my favorite computer.  I love it so much that I bought the keyboard.  I bought the stylus.  I draw on it.  I do things on it that I and I normally don't do on a computer.  It's my play computer versus my you know, I code on my MacBook.  And at night I kind of draw and play and browse on the iPad.  And I think that's why I love it.  Kind of, you know, the lean back computer.  So I do love it.  I held out to the iPad, too.  And I sort of begrudgingly fell in love with it.  But yeah, really love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right.  Enough. Enough of that.  OK, yeah, I feel like now I'm frothing.  And somebody pointed out and I think this is really true that cloud services.  Microsoft has had some problems.  In fact, most recently, their Azure service went down on leap day because somebody didn't program February 29th.  Into the computer.  Oh, my God.  It's pretty pathetic.  Maybe you could call Facebook and ask him for that algorithm.  I think it has something to do with divisible by four.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Chromium blog, February 27th.  They announced the ponium rewards for exploits.  Sixty thousand dollars.  If somebody discovers a full Chrome export, forty exploit, forty for partial, there's a twenty thousand dollar consolation prize.  Somebody has just claimed the sixty thousand dollar full Chrome exploit.  This is since Sundar Pichai posting on Google+.  He's, of course, the guy in charge of Chrome OS.  Congrats to longtime Chromium contributor Sergei Glazunov, who just submitted our first ponium entry.  Looks like it qualifies as a full Chrome exploit.  You've got to admire a company that actually publicizes the fact that their browser has a massive hole in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Open source, baby.  Turn the crackers, you know, make them work for you.  Sixty grand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a lot of money.  He says we're working fast and a fix will push via auto update.  This is exciting.  I love this is this is I don't know if this is spin or if I think he's sincere.  That's what I love about Google.  This is exciting.  We found a big hole.  We're going to give you 60 grand.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's that's a heck of a lot less than the headcount they'd pay to somebody.  Certainly all week after week trying to do it.  Oh, yeah.  60 grand is cheap.  That kind of engineering.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  So and I don't think this is spin.  I think this is really them saying, no, we want people to bang on it.  And and and we're going to let you know if there's a hole and we're going to fix it.  By the way, if you're a Chrome user and you're interested, we did a really interesting security now yesterday on speedy the SPDY technology that Google is starting to implement in Chrome that they say will speed up websites three times.  Websites that support the speedy technology three times faster.  And that is another thing.  Google's done a really good job with is speeding up the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Someone in the chat room mentioned that, you know, bug bounties in open source culture are very long, very common.  Yeah, even in close source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Microsoft used to do that.  They have pizza parties and they give you.  But but on the other hand, I don't think that they would make a big deal about a massive exploit in a shipping product saying, hey, we found one.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's true.  It's true.  You got to love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Three times faster.  Not does not the same as three times as fast.  I'm told by up in the chat room.  I don't know, Professor.  What?  Three times faster, three times as fast.  I don't know what the difference is.  I think that they're right, but I'm not going to.  I could tell you the Apple Store is not using speedy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's here's the funny thing.  I shouldn't say this on the air.  I'm not I'm not there.  I haven't bought yet.  But I got farther in Safari than I did in Chrome.  Oh, what a surprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, shock.  That's one thing I do.  I don't know.  Maybe it's just me.  But Chrome does not work well on my Macs.  I end up using Safari because Chrome seems sluggish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it is.  YouTube videos get it confused and then it bogs down and I've got to restart Chrome.  Meanwhile, back at the Apple Store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had the disabled flash in Chrome to make it to get to me.  Is it flash?  It helped me a lot because I was beach balling often.  Yeah.  So I so I just I think I installed an extension that's flash block.  So it shows you if there's flashing you turn it on.  If it's something you definitely want to see.  And that helped me a lot.  Although I know what you mean.  It is a bit sluggish on on the Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Larry Page shared this link.  Calcu Doku puzzles.  This is actually a fascinating page.  Calcu Calcu Doku dot org.  They analyze the usage data of the Calcu Duku number puzzle website for years 2010 2011  consisting over one million solved puzzles as a site that solves your sort of Google  puzzles attempting to determine the numerical intelligence of users of IE Firefox and Chrome.  I don't know.  I don't know if I should even mention this.  Chrome users are smarter apparently and faster than Firefox users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they have more sex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is this is this is this is this a joke.  And then IE users more likely to give up on a puzzle than Firefox or Chrome users.  They just go.  Oh no I feel like we're.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They get frustrated.  We're trash talking.  They get frustrated.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh the unwashed masses.  They give up on Sudoku puzzles.  We're elitists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We weren't from Apple elitism to Google elitism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just love it that Larry Page posted that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well of course.  Wow.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think there was a hoax last year that did a survey but I don't think this is it.  This is something completely different.  But anyway go ahead Gina.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We should we should talk about Google Play.  That seems to be the big.  This is bizarre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So if you go to market Android dot com it's not there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is no longer there.  It's gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh it changes it over to play Google dot com.  Because apparently even if you're buying an app what you really want to do is play.  Focusing obviously on movies music and and not apps and books because I don't think you  can play a book unless it's audible.  And I guess you could play an app if it's a game.  This is also on the Android devices right.  There's an update.  In fact I should check my my Android device and see if there's an update on the on the  store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Clear your cash and then you on your market Android market.  You have to clear the cash.  No no no but I'm just saying no no it says it no I did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's doing it.  If you haven't gotten it yet.  Yes it says play play play play play play play play play play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you should have the new icon too.  Oh that's what I mean.  Like if you want the new I have the old icon so I have to clear the cash to get the new

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  icon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or just wait till it rolls out to you.  Whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  So why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's much better branding.  I really like the new name.  I like the new name.  I like the new icon.  I don't like that it sort of subsumed the Android brand inside of it.  You know like you can buy Android apps inside the Google Play Store which I'm actually not  used to saying yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gina isn't that because you can also buy songs and books.  Well right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  Yes exactly.  But like the but the Android brand isn't part of the name and I thought that was that was  just an interesting kind of interesting thing.  If you read the name literally I mean you know for me as a maker of a to do list app  I was kind of like well where do the productivity apps go.  You know when I when I say like get an app at the Play Store I imagine that you know  they're going to be games but you can't really take them.  You know take the name literally the iTunes store is a lot more than music.  I really like it.  I think it was a smart smart kind of rebranding a good move.  I like the word.  I think it sounds just a lot better than Android market and I think it kind of differentiates  a lot more.  But it's going to be kind of rough.  It's kind of kind of rocky transition here especially for tech writers and developers  like they emailed out developers of Android apps and said hey you know your app is now  in this place called Google Play and like here are some banners that you can put on  your site that say you know go play this on Google or whatever they're little you know  phrases and I was like I'm not putting that on my apps website just yet you know and just  wait until people get used to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They also updated the videos app.  It's now called Google Play movies and you have to download that.  And the reason I know that is because they're offering 25 cent downloads in glorious bastards  is 25 cents and oh wow.  They've got a lot of 25 cent albums.  Look I can get blown on the Carter four by Lil Wayne for just 25 cents.  I am so excited.  I am so excited.  So you.  It is me.  It is me.  Lil Wayne.  He's my man.  Anyway that's 13 saw 18 18 Lil Wayne songs for a quarter worth twice the price.  So there and I notice other other albums too is 25 cents is great.  Does that mean does that mean oh hey this is interesting scooter X says you cannot read  a movie from play movies on a rooted device.  So that's interesting.  That is something to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there is there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  So I get because why because because there's no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cup of DRM no DRM baby flick flick golf.  So their apps to flick golf extreme is a quarter right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a bunch for 49 cents to have in a big sale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is good.  I guess.  Do the developers only get a nickel or what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No what happens is I think that they still have to guarantee Google subsidizes it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look at all the movies for 99 cents.  Dirty Dancing the original people should watch that instead of that bad remake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a good promotional opportunity to get people to set up their their wallet account  and just load up on content and get used to the idea of how to you know of how it all  works.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The way that it's sorry.  The way that Amazon does it with the free app of the day.  Yeah.  Well no with Kindle Lennon library is that they have I think it's six hundred thousand  dollars this month that they'll divvy up among all those who have been borrowed in  the library.  So if you're on Kindle and you own a Kindle and you're on Prime you can borrow things  for free and then Amazon ponies up that proportion since I only charged 99 cents for my my here  I am.  Where is it here.  My watch me call it my my e-book my Kindle single.  Then I'll probably make more from the share than I will from the book.  Wow.  Just because of the massive sales and.  Well yeah.  And just because that's only 99 cents.  Whereas if you're going to make something that's that's that's ten dollars you'll get  the same I will.  Right.  So it's hard to make lending structures terribly fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But wow this looks good.  This is HD streaming on the this is the Galaxy Note.  This looks this looks this in glory glorious bastards.  It's pretty good.  You have to zoom in a little bit to see it.  So you're streaming.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I didn't download it just streaming streaming and high quality.  Are we to get pulled from YouTube for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they just it's pretty good.  I shouldn't show this parts where they baseball bat and all that stuff.  But still still that's pretty good.  I have to say for 25 cents the quality is excellent.  But they have to because of course Apple has now started with this 1080p and they've got  a new Apple TV.  This is I love it because for those of us who like to like content and stuff.  This is this is the industry is completely reinventing itself.  Yes.  It's all streaming.  Netflix made a deal with Apple that you can use your iTunes account to pay for your Netflix  subscription.  Netflix is integrated right into the Apple TV HD 1080p from Netflix five one zero.  Netflix five one surround.  Forget forget you know physical media.  It's dead.  And what Google is doing and Apple is doing huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Netflix is is letting customers so they're giving sort of making Apple a customer entry  point.  So they're yes they're.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  You don't have to buy a Netflix account through Netflix anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  I wonder what that deal is though for them.  I mean given their Apple's history of keeping customer information from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a good question.  That's a good question.  I think it's a big win for Netflix.  I'm not surprised they would do it just because of the volume.  And Netflix you know like a lot of companies wants to get out of the physical media business.  That's what they struggled with.  Right.  With the quick stir and all of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  I just I hope the terms weren't no any.  I hope the terms were good for them.  I like Netflix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do too.  I really like those guys and I know they got a lot of heat because of their flip flopping  and all that stuff.  But between.  But I'm just saying between this Google Play what you're really seeing is this move towards  streaming everywhere.  Yeah.  And it makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well which it has more control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well it's for the movie companies for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The movie company it's what they should have been going through ages ago.  Yeah.  You know and also I you know the next the next thing to conquer is get it when you want  it and get rid of these windows.  Right.  Because that's the argument is that that's the primary driver of piracy.  I can't get what I want now.  So the heck with you.  I'll go get it.  If I could get it now the more people would.  That's that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the oatmeal cartoon where the oatmeal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  Oatmeal is my new verve.  Oatmeal.  I tried to pay for it.  I couldn't.  I want it now.  I want it now.  I downloaded it with the intention of paying for it when I am able.  That's oatmeal.  That's key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the key in oatmeal is OK.  It's OK to download a pirated version now as long as you buy it when it's available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  I try wanted to pay for it.  I tried to pay for it.  I was unable to pay for it.  So I downloaded it but I will pay for it when I am able to pay for it.  Just don't forget.  Right.  That's the yeah.  I just right.  Well that's right.  Oatmeal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oatmeal.  We like it.  Yeah.  What it says in the end is a company has a choice of whom to piss off their their their  old sales channel or their customers.  And they didn't have a relationship with the customers before.  But that's the essence of the disruption that's going on.  And when they learn that it's stupid to piss off your customers then goodbye sales channel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what that when you frame it that way.  That's fascinating.  That really makes a lot of sense.  And that's what's happening.  The relationship is changing from channel to customer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See I think that the retail as a whole is you know I'll get in trouble for saying this  but but but but nearly doomed that the reason to buy something physically right is is that  it's perishable or you need right now.  And that should be a premium.  And it is that's true in books.  Now you buy the same book on BNN.com.  You can buy the bookstore.  You're paying a premium to get it there.  Everybody knows that the economics of that do not work anymore.  It's going to go away.  Best buy.  And you name the place.  And so that's what that says is the whole notion of the sales channel is that you're  going to be able to sell your book to the people who are going to buy it.  And that's what you're going to do.  And so that's what that says.  And so that's the whole notion of the sales channel.  It goes away.  Now that's true and not true because there's a new sales channel right.  Amazon is a new sales channel.  Apple is a new sales channel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But sales channels are meant to be disintermediated.  Mm hmm.  I think that's absolutely true.  Although Apple is makes the in-person retail experience a very very premium.  Moment I had gone to try.  But any other day, you know, they make it.  When I bought my iPhone, it was amazing.  I had a friend of mine went and bought a phone under Verizon's store and I went to buy my  iPhone kind of on the same during the same week.  And the experience was completely different.  I mean, it was just a nightmare for her.  It was this one like a computer is slow and what model do I get a paradox of choice and  the upsells and a crazy at the Apple store.  You know, the guy never, you know, he was standing there with his iPhone, with this  big number by an iPhone, have it set up without without leaving the table I was standing at.  So I think there's still room for that premium experience and doing that in the experience  really well in person for sure.  But I think you're absolutely right.  I think that the experience is is, you know, there's that there's there's a market for  that anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And, you know, I worked with a with a group that was we tried to take over the  this large white elephant mall in New Jersey called Xanadu and our bid didn't win.  But the idea of this brilliant marketing guy working with I mentioned in a sentence in  public parts is that retail space becomes about marketing rather than about fulfillment.  And, you know, in a sense, that's what the Apple store's real value is, is that it's  marketing space.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can get it here.  But it doesn't make any difference to Apple whether you buy it there or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Come for the come for the classes to just look and try and touch and all that.  Yep. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In any store today that doesn't encourage you to hang out.  I mean, I've said this to Best Buy in the past that they should be turning on their  Wi-Fi for everybody.  There should be a hangout.  There's an opportunity to create a new third place right now.  It's Starbucks.  It could be bookstores.  It could be.  I mean, Apple is not a third place where you're going to sit down because you can't.  They used to have stools in the 14th Street store in New York.  But there's that idea of having a social hangout as a new form of marketing and retail  becomes really interesting, I think.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're talking about Google, the cloud, Apple, whatever is on our mind.  Jeff Jarvis, Gina Trapani, more to come in just a little bit.  But first a word from our friends at Citrix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just an update.  New animal.  Is this like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is frozen planet dot com.  They have like just I guess this is a guess.  Sea world.  Oh, it's a show.  It's a show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just a life.  It's just a life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And those are those Emperor.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The Emperor Penguin walks.  What was it?  It was so funny.  Billy Crystal on the Academy Awards.  He does that thing where he's reading people's minds.  He reads Morgan Freeman's mind.  The Emperor Penguin walks.  It was very well done.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it was really well done.  And then it's again snowing.  And then the polar bear.  Yeah.  Where there are polar bears, there's snow.  After the ad.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So since we're in sort of an iPad haze after the announcement today, I have two questions.  I didn't watch the iPad announcement, so I'm curious if Tim Cook said anything that was  very obviously about Android.  And the second question is what does Android have to do to compete with the iPad now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I had a bet, which I did not lose.  I said I will drink an entire bottle of Crystal Head vodka on this show if the word Google  is mentioned at any time.  And it was not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, that's the golden rule.  You never name your competitor.  There will be no Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's funny because Google kind of even backhandedly, Google talked about Apple at  I.O., but Apple doesn't know.  It's actually interesting.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He didn't make any cracks about.  No, nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought I saw somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought I saw some tweets saying that he said something about page load being skippy,  but it could have just been my friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There was a graph that he showed, which was interesting, about sales in which he showed  Dell and Acer and a bunch of PC companies and said, and this is the point Apple would  like to make, if you include these post PC devices, the iPhone and the iPad, we sell  more PCs than anybody else.  They would really like what they would love you to include iPad sales in their sales figures  because then they are, in fact, much bigger than anybody else.  You can make a case.  I don't know about the iPhone.  You can make a case that the iPad should probably be in that.  It is, especially as they get more powerful, it really is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's talk about that part that you mentioned at the top of the show, but is the laptop  the next dead thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Boing is right.  He did take a cheap shot about how Twitter looks on, what did he say, on an Android tablet  or did he say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Samsung.  It was on the Samsung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you're right.  He did mention the Android stuff.  Android apps, Yelp and Twitter and how bad they look and how well integrated they are  in iOS.  He did.  We weren't watching the stream.  We were just watching the live blogs because they don't stream it, of course.  Oh, right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But did they post it after the fact?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They posted it almost immediately after the fact, which is a little different for Apple.  Usually they take a day or two.  I guess they, I don't quite understand it.  That isn't mentioning Google, is it?  Right.  I hope not because I don't want to drink a bottle of vodka.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Saved by the bottle of vodka.  I don't want to drink it.  So what does Google have to do to compete with the iPad?  I felt like the Google Play announcement yesterday was sort of a little bit of a half heart  attempt to be like, hey, we're still here.  We've got a thing happening this week too.  It's over.  You think it's over.  It's a done deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think Android competes well with iPhone.  I'm an Android user and I love the note and I love the choice.  But there's no tablet that's even the Asus Transformer Prime, which is I think arguably  the best, that comes even close.  The Kindle Fire is the only Android app that is even in the ballpark and it doesn't say  Android anywhere on it.  NASK Amazon, they won't say the Android word.  So I think that, and boy, when you look at how they've leapfrogged again the competition,  I don't know.  I think that it's not even close.  I really don't.  And I'd love to, I mean, I love the, I far prefer Android phones.  The things that I can do with my Android phone far outweigh anything I can do with an iPhone.  But in the tablet, it's not even close.  Alas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hope that changes.  I hope they at least have something that's at least a little bit of a contender because  more competition, I think, is a good thing.  But at this point, it does feel like the iPad is so far ahead.  I don't know what Google could do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, Jeff, you said this is the death of the laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'm just asking.  I mean, you know, to try to not look pink and weirdly dead when I'm at home doing the show,  I went out and bought one.  I didn't buy what you said.  I bought the cheap new Asus X101.  Actually, those are nice little PCs.  Yeah.  269 bucks.  Wow.  Yeah, which is pretty amazing.  But just looking around, you know, I thought, well, okay, do I buy a desktop?  How silly.  You didn't really buy that anymore.  There are a few.  But why would you possibly put this big honking box, right?  Laptops.  I'm walking around all the time with my Logitech keyboard and my iPad.  And yes, folks, I did rebox it, but I do have one and I do like it.  And I'm trying to buy another one right now and failing at it and then I get pissed.  But, you know, is the idea of the computer over?  I mean, when I do talks now and I talk about, pardon me for the great, great time, folks,  that Gutenberg's invention was originally called automated writing, the horseless carriage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, really, it was called automated writing.  Yeah, it really was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because we always define the future in the past.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Horseless carriage.  It's a carriage without a horse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was the scribe.  The fonts were designed to look like scribes.  Right.  That was the whole point is you could write fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In fact, they printed Bible, nothing but Bibles for 30 years because they couldn't think of  anything to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So why do we still call this a phone?  Of course, that's ludicrous.  Right.  I was talking to somebody the other day who said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So not a phone, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somebody said that when their kid wants to communicate or wants to do something, they  don't say, hello.  Right.  What they say is.  Yeah.  Right.  They say fingers moving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a texting device that happens to have some phone capability.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like phone calls, the thing you make in order to find your friend's phone that's stuck in  the, that's lost on the couch.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's good.  We need a phrase for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  So the whole idea of.  Find your phone.  Yeah.  So that will go too far.  That's what I do.  That's what I do for a living.  I go too far.  Is the computer dead?  Is the idea of having a computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well that's what they're saying with a post, when they say post PC.  And I, yes.  It's not dead.  I hate when people say dead.  Dead is a ridiculous thing to say.  Nothing's dead.  But are we moving into, you know, I mean for laptops kind of superseded desktops for most  people about four or five years ago.  I think in that same way that they, they're still desktops, but that laptops became good  enough to use instead of a desktop and had enough value to use instead of desktops.  I think that's what's happening right now with the iPad.  And this is the first one that's that good I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  These devices are the most personal of all computers.  Yes.  Right.  I mean if you're going to take the name very literally, that they're actually growing  into these devices are growing into the name instead of growing out of it.  It's the most personal device we've ever had.  The phones particularly, right, because they're in your pocket.  The iPad you still kind of have to carry.  Right.  But I mean what are they if not if not computers like what are you what are you are they communications  devices or they that's the you know the Star Trek flip up.  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Communicator.  Because it's something new that we don't know what to call it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean I guess I guess the word computer sort of connotes like giant calculator.  It doesn't really encompass encompass the connectivity and the mobility.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what it is.  It's a calculator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the internet it's a communications device.  Pre calculator I mean pre internet it's just a calculator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's more like personal communicator.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it changes exactly it changes everything.  It's not that people don't still use their computer as a calculator because they do they  still do Excel.  They do spreadsheets.  But it's really become a communications device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep.  Communications and media.  And media.  Consumption and creation.  Yeah.  And varying flavors and proportions.  Yeah.  And so I was reading a wonderful book.  There's a guy named Nick Diakopoulos who's working with us at CUNY doing a map of opportunities  in media slash technology.  It's really a cool paper.  I'll link to it and put it up.  But in there he was talking about computer what defines a computer versus a journalist  is algorithms.  That both take information and they do all these things to the information.  And the difference is simply that one is human one is algorithmic.  And so when you start to think of a computer not as the hardware but as formulae.  As scripts as programs as as well you know what Gina makes.  And that's what a computer is.  A computer has never been the hardware the computer is the program.  Right.  That's that's that's what makes it do what it does.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely.  You're asking a programmer this Jeff.  I mean it's a set of rules for you know for.  Ask the designer he'll say it's a CPU and a RAM chip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So ask ask a sys admin and you'll get spat on.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But no I agree I think it's the software and then you can abstract it to another layer  which is software is just really a way of describing a problem.  Yes absolutely.  So I think it's just it's a fascinating.  When you bring it back to Gutenberg that really I think that kind of contextualizes it in  a way that makes sense.  Now it starts to make sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a really that's a really great example.  You said that there's it's a communication device but it's also a consumption or it's  a media device which is kind of a consumption device.  But I think that's what's different now is that consumption and communication go hand  in hand.  And creation and creation.  And creation.  Right.  So we don't do these things alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This stuff is all of a piece.  It's all of a piece.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we don't really we don't even have a word that that that that covers all that that  describes that.  I'm watching a movie with my friends online or I'm playing a mass.  Yeah.  Multiplayer online game.  I'm you know I'm pair programming over Skype with my other developers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So whatever to add to Apple's complete and utter dominance of every area of technology  they've now extended an olive branch according to the Dow Jones news wires to Android device  makers.  They've said we will cut a deal with Samsung and Motorola.  All we want is remember now Microsoft's getting we guess ten dollars a handset for their patents.  All we want is fifteen dollars a handset and you don't have to worry about court ever again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So explain that to me Lucy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well it's called licensing.  I mean that's what happens with patents.  The real question for a long time in my mind was and it came up because of Walter Isaacson's  biography is Apple suing Samsung and Motorola and others because they just and this is often  the way businesses gets done because they want the license fees.  Look those are our patents.  We try to make a deal you said no.  OK pay up or because they want to scorch earth and just destroy competition and win outright.  When you read Steve Jobs saying I am going to murder lies Google I'm going to spend every  penny and every last breath to kill Google because they stole the Android phone for us.  You might think it's the latter but in fact now the Apple says you know we're willing  to license it.  Actually they're asking for according to Dow Jones Newswires from five to fifteen dollars  per handset for some of their patents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK so that goes that's going to go straight through to the consumers.  Absolutely.  So it becomes an Apple tax.  It's the Apple tax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You should know that on 70 percent of Android devices we're already paying a Microsoft tax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me just work out the numbers here.  So how many Android devices were supposedly this year.  We see the new numbers every week.  Right.  Well what's what's the number out of I don't know.  Eileen.  50 million a hundred million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought it was three hundred fifty.  It's a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So three hundred fifty times fifteen dollars is please help me.  Somebody with a computer.  Gina.  Calculating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Working.  Working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Working.  Working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Working.  What.  Jack Rowe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Three hundred fifty thousand times fifteen bucks is what.  What's the bottom line.  Go to Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Three hundred fifty million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Three hundred fifty million devices.  Right.  You said.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Zero.  Five point eight five million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Three hundred million total devices.  Eight hundred fifty K activations a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK.  So three hundred million.  Good.  That's easier.  Times ten would be three billion plus another half.  Well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well.  Well.  You know it's chicken feed.  It's four and a half billion but it's chicken feed compared to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's Apple's gross these days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh God.  I mean I don't know.  They make they make more than that in a week.  So it's chicken feed.  But it's so it's interesting because they don't need the money but they would like the  money.  They feel I think you know that they these are we invented this stuff.  So slide to unlock.  You better pay us if you want to have a slide to unlock on a phone.  In some ways I'm relieved because it's a lot easier to pay fifteen dollars or something  per handset than if the company wants to kill you.  And and I was really afraid that that's really what Steve Jobs wanted.  He wanted to he wanted to kill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And do you think maybe they this is the olive branch because Steve is not here anymore.  They knew they had to.  OK.  Well you know.  We'll mollify Steve.  But the truth is it's not good business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well right.  It isn't good business.  And in the you know you're not going to kill and read you just going to piss people off.  The question is you know a will these companies go for it or I mean will will motor let's  say Motorola with with all the cloud of Google behind them.  Will they do this or will they say no we're going to fight this to the death because we  think we have the right to use the swipe to unlock.  We think there's prior art.  So it may not be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well then you're then you're then you're mitigating risk.  Then all business is about risk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But then.  Well OK.  But understand it's like extortion right at that point.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like the mafia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like it's like a protection racket.  Well yeah you got a choice.  You could fight us in court you might win you might lose or you just give us 15 bucks  and we'll we'll be it will be done.  So there's an economic factor.  Right.  On every device forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well we're in.  And so what happens is do do do Android devices become too expensive then.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you know it does hurt the third world market the very very very low cost phone market  and they may go to end up going to Windows.  It might actually you know maybe the big victor here is Microsoft because Nokia of course  which makes the bulk of cheap low end feature phones may just say they're already going  to deal with Microsoft.  I don't want to pay the Google tax or the Apple tax I should say so I'm going to I'm  going to make a Microsoft phone.  That's why I'm sure that's why Microsoft did it.  And Apple doesn't license its OS.  So it's an interesting question.  It does change things around a little bit.  Apple and Google are meeting with a member of the Senate to talk about privacy Chuck  Schumer Chuck Schumer.  What do you what do you mean.  What are you saying here.  Chuck Schumer Chuck Schumer has something to say about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Seems like you're upset about that.  What's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was screaming at the TV only this weekend because Chuck Schumer is famous for having  press conferences every Saturday.  Yeah. When no one else has press conferences they have lives.  And so he gets his stupid fecacca story on the TV news.  You get the news.  That's to get gets this cycle going.  And that's where it is now.  So he comes out with oh my God they're stealing things.  And so there we are.  Bingo. Right again. We got to meet with him because he got his attention out of it.  Adam Thayer, Thayer.  I hope it's there. I don't know.  Who's a good really good libertarian writer online released a white paper today 80 pages  long. And I think I put on the rundown.  That's really, really good so far.  I'm a quarter of the way through it about a topic that I was working on before, but he  did a much better job than I would have done on moral crises, moral panics rather.  And he calls them and it's been called by others this techno panics.  Right. And it goes back to the story I've had about about Kodak cameras causing causing  all kinds of fears and coming out of the wall and cartoons, comic books, all these  kinds of things that cause moral panics.  And that's where we are right now is there's this illogical argument of possible harm and  uh ohs and politicians can grab on it and then my God, we need a law.  Oh, good. Now we need all kinds of people to regulate that law.  Now we I'm going down tomorrow to Washington to speak to a thousand chief privacy  officers. I'm going to carry a mask so I don't get hit with tomatoes in the head.  But that's why it starts this whole structure going.  So they're forced to go talk to Schumer because Schumer knows he's going to get attention  for it. It's a cynical act.  But problem is, that's where we are with last week's discussion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm starting to believe all politics is cynical act.  It just is.  It is. Yeah.  So, Mr. Schumer said, does Chuck have a strong accent?  He said, we asked them if they could find a way on their own to prevent apps from having  access to private info.  They were friendly and open to the idea that this ought to be changed.  That's Apple and Google.  They were friendly and open.  You know, what are you going to say?  No, Senator, I disagree.  Oh, yeah. Yeah, you're right, Chuck.  That ought to be changed.  We ought to fix that.  Neither Google nor Apple had a comment.  The stick, of course, is he has also sent a letter on a Sunday to the Federal Trade  Commission asking them to investigate Apple and Google on these privacy issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I learned something reading the White House's privacy proposed privacy bill of  rights and guidelines.  Yeah. And I learned a little about the law and they're much more reasonable in Europe's.  I still have some issues with them.  I'll write all that. But what their structure is and it's said this oftentimes, even  without legislation, the FTC shall do this and this and this.  What they say the FTC is going to do is that if you're a company and you warrant that  you're going to have a behavior, either because you have your own policy or because you  subscribe to an industry set of guidelines, if you if you fail at that, that's when the  FTC goes after you. So they don't need a law, which is exactly how the FTC has gone after  Facebook and Google so far, because their contention was not that they violated the  law, but that they violated their own policies.  And so if you get an industry to create a policy, then the FTC can go after you basically  for a form of fraud.  It further says that if you subscribe, you say that you subscribe to an international  set of behaviors, that is to say the EU's privacy regulations and you fail on that in  the United States, the FTC would persecute you on that basis without legislation or

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  courts. Well, as long as I got your head up, new German bill wants Google to pay for  new snippets. We're just going to throw it's like I'm poking Jeff with a stick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you've got a nice German lady there in the studio who's probably shaking her hand.  She's laughing. She's laughing.  There goes Jarvis about the Germans again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  After more than three years of intensive lobbying, German news organizations appear to  have convinced politicians in Berlin of the need for a law to protect the use of their  content on the Internet and for a compulsory licensing scheme to use it.  I guess it'll go up for a vote in the next few weeks.  Apparently, Belgium did the same thing, but nobody noticed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Belgium, there were court cases on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Court decided it wasn't a law. That's right.  Right. Right.  Marcus Bechtol, the editor of NetzPolitik.org posted, for now we're relying on the  intelligence of the German parliament not to implement such nonsense.  If the German parliament's anything like our Congress, I wouldn't rely on it.  They're probably smarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're busy these days because they're running Europe.  Germany is in charge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's fine.  So I was just upset.  I stopped poking him.  Google slashes storage prices.  But still no G Drive.  Google dropped prices on cloud storage.  I noticed that the other day I was actually talking about it on the radio show and I  went to look at the pricing and it dropped a lot.  Well, not a lot, but it dropped a decent amount, a couple of pennies per gigabyte.  Google's facing competition from Amazon's S3 as well as from Dropbox and Azure and  SkyDrive and all the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you upload a lot of stuff to Google Docs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't. But you know, that is one of the things that I think we've talked about, but  I think people don't know is that you can upload any arbitrary file to Google Docs.  It is cloud storage.  It is.  I don't know if people know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it doesn't have the...  We talked about this before, but it just doesn't have the functionality.  It's not easy.  Right.  It's easy to manually do it and I forget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess I don't...  I'm sorry.  I'm a little distracted.  I apparently have just ordered 22 Apple TVs.  I'll take one.  Thanks.  $2,178 worth of Apple TVs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.  $3,800 worth of Apple stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't really want that many Apple TVs.  One would do.  I don't know how to get out of this though.  I'll pay you back for one.  Maybe just continue shopping.  Yeah.  Apple TVs for everyone.  One year we gave Roku's to everybody.  All the hosts.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  Yes, you did.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You did.  I'm going to take a break.  We have a few more things to talk about.  And then of course, Jeff's number, Gina's tip, my tool.  Everybody, I'm getting...  Are you getting a lot...  And then polar bears.  I'm getting on Facebook all these things from saying, join my network on branch.  What is that all about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't that the new...  That's the new product from...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Obvious.  Biz Stone, Everett Williams and Jason Goldman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Obvious is investing in them.  It's a curated conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I saw an example of it with Meg Horahan and Ev Williams.  I think it was that.  I think it was on branch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was branch.  And that was a really good conversation that Neil organized that.  Oh, sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe I should...  So I should say, okay.  When somebody says join my branch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  If someone asked you to...  So from what I understand, you get invited to comment on a thread.  So Neil was able to get together with the original Pyra team who built Blogger to ask,  how should blogs evolve?  And then so everyone kind of gets to watch this conversation.  It's a little bit velvet ropey, but that was a really good conversation.  It was a very good conversation.  Interesting.  Yeah.  Okay.  That all of them kind of participated in.  Matt Howey...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who else was in it?  Matt Howey, Ev.  It was also interesting to see Meg Horahan and Ev, two of the partners who started Blogger,  disagree or trying to probe their mutual memories.  Oh, interesting.  Do you remember?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Don't you remember that time we looked at those wireframes and talked about building  that thing and we didn't?  Yeah.  That was it.  I can't believe you didn't remember that, Ev.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yes, I did.  But this is what I meant.  Oh, okay.  It was kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then Ev said, you know, later at Google, we talked about this.  I mean, you know, we should post that link in the show notes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But Branch looks pretty interesting.  Is there a website?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a Branch link.  Is it branch.com?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that it?  Yeah, that's it.  So you have to give them your email address.  Oh, what the hell.  What could possibly go wrong?  And then auto fill your...  Tell me more.  Okay.  So you go in through here.  We're working around the clock to make room for you.  In the meantime, tell us what you hope to find on Branch.  Huh?  We could use that.  You know what we used for our live coverage of the Apple announcement?  We used Google Hangouts.  It was what I decided to do.  I'm trying to figure out how to incorporate Hangouts into our stuff.  And this worked pretty, pretty well.  So we had our live panel.  And then I invited only tech journalists into the Google Hangout.  And I just, you know, I have a pretty large group, hundreds of tech journalists,  and Mike Elgin, Steve Garfield, you know, about eight people responded.  They were all tech pundits.  It worked great.  And it was kind of like having the second channel of conversation going on.  I thought that was a very interesting way to do it.  I'd like to explore that maybe for this show.  I think it'd be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it'd be great.  I'm all for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It works better, I think, if there's an event, a special thing going on,  as opposed to just a regular show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just added the link to the...  Thank you.  ...undown of that conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could now...  I mean, this is how Trey's show is done, right?  You can also record it on its own.  And that is the show, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I did that.  And it will be...  It's on YouTube, I guess, because I did it.  Actually, you know, I never checked to see, but I think it would be on my YouTube channel.  Because I got invited to do that.  No, that's just the Twig time-lapse.  So I don't know.  I don't know where it went.  It went somewhere.  Would it be on Google Plus?  Well, we'll figure that out a bit.  I got to do a commercial for Squarespace.  A commercial.  That's a good question.  Because I pushed the button that said, record this, and I say, it'll be public.  We got 146 pluses, 59 shares, 208 comments.  I didn't even see the comments.  Wow.  But now how do I...  Do I go...  These are Tim Street, Russell Holly, Steve Garfield, Mike Elgin, Lamar Wilson, and Jesse Steyn.  It was great.  It was a great panel.  I don't know how you then watch it.  I'll have to figure that out.  Yeah.  Anyway, moving on.  Squarespace.com, the secret behind exceptional websites.  I'm so excited.  They've got Squarespace 6s in beta right now.  And I was able to wangle.  You'd think I could just pull strings, but no, I had to wangle an invitation to the new  version 6.  And I'm so excited.  I'm moving my blog over there.  One of the things they said, which is I think kind of interesting, I think this is the state  of the art in design now.  They said, you design for mobile first.  That's telling, isn't it?  You don't design a website for desktop and then as an afterthought say, we're going to  have a mobile site that looks different.  You design a site that looks good on both that you design for mobile first.  And you know who's done that with I think great effect is Om Malik on his personal blog,  which I think is om.co.  It's a beautiful, simple design that works great on mobile, but then has additional features.  I guess on the desktop.  So this is what Squarespace is doing.  This is very exciting.  If you are responsive design, right?  Yeah, it's called responsive design.  That's right.  Very nice.  Yeah.  And so they're making it so you don't have to be, you know, I'm hired a designer is very  expensive.  Like, trust me, I know we're doing another design for one of our sites.  It's very, very expensive.  Define responsive design for me.  Gina, you're gonna have to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a web page designed in such a way that if you resize the browser viewport, it organizes  itself in a way that it's readable at any size.  So if you visit the site, it looks on the iPhone, the modules basically stack themselves  in a way that it's readable on a screen as small as a smartphone to a tablet.  That's what Lullabot said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For a couple of bucks more, you can get a responsive design.  I said, I'll take it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if you resize your browser, you watch the page kind of reorganize itself and it's always  readable and usable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And really that it looks good on mobile, first and foremost.  Anyways, we could go on and on about the philosophy of this, but here's a great deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Squarespace team was at the tech meetup in New York, I think last week, and I didn't  get to go, my students went and they were just wowed by them.  Just absolutely wowed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's neat that they're in New York.  They decided that they wanted to, Anthony who started the company was in Maryland, University  of Maryland, but he decided he wanted to be in New York and that was the place.  Yay!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  New York is the place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Silicon Alley.  California, you're such a cliche.  You're fooling yourself.  You're so with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You just wish you lived here.  You just wish you lived in California.  Actually, you used to.  You moved to New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I actually tried to come back.  I came here and then I tried to rebox my move and go back to California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love New York.  I would live in New York, absolutely, except I kind of stuck here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Years later, it helps if you marry a Jersey girl.  Years later, I now say that I have to be here, but at the time I left California and I said,  it's too easy here.  I got to New York and I said, you idiot.  What's wrong with life being easy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Life is a lot easier out here, but I got to tell you, if I started a company, I would  do it in New York.  I would do it in New York before San Francisco for sure.  Yay, Gina!  Oh, yeah, definitely.  There's a burgeoning tech community.  There's some really interesting stuff going on.  There's some really good companies, really good investors going on in New York.  That's where I would do it.  Of course, I was born and raised there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was born back East and moved out West.  Jeff, where were you born?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was born in the Chicago area and then I went to four elementary schools in three states  and four high schools in three states in three years.  That explains why I'm so neurotic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or so brilliant.  No, neurotic.  Oh, so brilliant.  Google getting into the airline ticket business.  I'm surprised that they did this after the whole thing over IATA.  Google bought, remember, ITA in order to have airline schedules on the search results.  Well, now they're going to sell tickets direct.  Now it's just with a little tiny New England regional airline called Cape Air and Nantucket  Airlines.  But their software, their booking software is powered by Google.  I think this is very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it is too.  Doesn't it make every industry now nervous?  The content industry, I keep saying that Google can't own content because of its channel conflict,  it's going to be in trouble, blah, blah, blah.  Well, now if you're in the travel industry, in any mediator role, Google is just going  to go in and attack you and does that lead to antitrust, monopoly, too much power or  arguments?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I'll tell you where it does with the price dumping problem.  For instance, these 25 cent movies and records are clearly for simply to get you to sign  up for Google Wallet.  And it turns out now when you sign up for a new Gmail account, I know none of us have  done that in a while, it asks you for a credit card.  You don't have to give it to them, but they really want to get people into this payment  system.  Same thing here, they're selling tickets.  It may not even be about the tickets.  It may be a very small part.  It's about getting you into the Google ecosphere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Amazon is the best analog for this.  Amazon with the 999 books pissed off every publisher.  They marshaled through it.  And now you know what?  It doesn't matter.  That's why they returned some pricing power to the publishers because now Amazon is a  publisher and it's in a position to be so because of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't envy regulators now because when you look at a purchase like ITA, there's a whole  lot more to think about.  And this whole idea of price dumping is the big issue.  Google can lose money on stuff because they have a secondary way of making money.  And that jeopardizes businesses that this is their primary business.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I didn't know about that credit card during the Gmail sign up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I didn't either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But yeah, it's interesting.  So it's a promotion for Google Wallet saying, hey, you know, set up Google Wallet now while  you're here, while you're signing up, give us your credit card and then you can buy stuff  in the Google Play Store while it still says Android Market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I still I certainly don't regret doing that.  I use the Google Wallet a lot.  Same Amazon.  I love it.  It's great convenience.  You don't have to re-enter your credit card.  No one wants to do that.  Just say buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll take that.  Yeah.  Yeah, it is more convenient.  And it'll be interesting to see if mobile payment systems actually do kind of take off.  I think that'll be that if they do take off, which I kind of hope to see them take off.  I don't want to deal with cash or credit cards.  I just want to be able to wave my phone and not have to touch the 30-10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was surprised I was at Kmart and I could wave my phone at Kmart and pay.  Which shows you shop at Kmart.  Kmart is your saving place.  Nice shirt, nice shirt, Liam.  Now this is a Scott Evest.  Scott Jordan's, by the way, going to join us on a triangulation this afternoon to talk  about Shark Tank.  There's a story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love Shark Tank.  I love it, love it, love it, love it, love it.  I show it to my entrepreneurial students.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you know that in order to get on Shark Tank, you have to give them equity in your  company?  Give Shark Tank the company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're talking about the TV show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  You give ABC the producers of Shark Tank.  You give them equity in your company in order merely to appear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because they know they're adding tremendous value.  Whether or not you get money from the Sharks.  Doesn't matter.  Doesn't matter.  What a great business model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I should just start doing that.  Just give me one share, man.  That's all I want.  Just one share.  Just one share.  Anyway, we're going to talk about Scott Jordan was on Shark Tank last week.  We'll talk about his experience on triangulation this afternoon.  Which was his business?  Scott makes this.  He's a Scott Evest.  Yeah, he makes the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He was going to get money.  Why did he make it?  He doesn't need money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know.  I don't know.  I think he's starting a new venture.  He was careful not to mention Scott Evest on Shark Tank or they would get equity into  an existing company.  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it is a new business he's doing.  Right.  Something like that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's kind of like American Idol.  If you go on American Idol and you got to sign up basically with...  You have to sign with their record company.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  By the way, it's the same guy.  It's Mark Burnett.  Yeah.  There you go.  He's a very...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What I like about this is entrepreneurs as stars.  is becoming cool and the creators of companies are becoming stars.  That's me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  NBC has partnered with YouTube for the 2012 Olympics.  They're going to provide the video player and live streaming infrastructure for the  Olympic Games on NBC.  That makes sense.  Nobody knows better than YouTube how to do this stuff, right?  NBC says they're going to broadcast every live event in some form showing more than  3,600 hours of Olympic coverage.  So YouTube will be the official video on demand partner at NBCOlympics.com.  That's good.  I like...  Especially when it's a different time zone.  It's not so bad for you East Coasters, but for our West Coasters it went eight or nine  hours difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's the worst.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the worst.  It was really bad in China.  You couldn't see anything live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, at least you don't have to stay up late for the Oscars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's true.  I was so glad that was live.  The Grammys was taped delayed.  It makes me crazy.  It's like this thing is taped up the road and I have to wait three hours to watch it.  It's kind of the Twitter world where people are talking about live events.  It's so frustrating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the Google map car, the Street View car is coming to a neighborhood near you.  Are you ready?  Are you ready?  The Canadian Nathan Fillion says, yeah, I'm ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is this a new house you're in?  Yeah, well it's a new house to me.  They didn't just build it, but it's a new house to me.  I moved not too long ago.  There's always a...  You're very excited about the new house, but there's always things you're going to miss  about your old house.  One of my big things I was missing about my old house that kind of made it hard to move  was if you looked it up on Google, the Google map, you did that street feature where it  takes the map, pulls it up and you're looking at the front of your house.  You can see my cat.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  My cat.  Made it into the picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really?  I was like, hey, there he is.  So I was kind of like, oh, I'm not going to have that anymore.  Were you looking at it regularly?  Do you?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  The cat doesn't move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know you can shoot it up the one time.  So you'd look, you'd go like, hey, there he is.  I'm going, that's a cat.  Okay.  And I was a little disappointed because I wouldn't have that feature in my house anymore.  I'm standing on my porch.  This wasn't three months ago.  I'm standing on my porch and the Google map car is coming down the street.  There's a car?  You can't miss it.  There's all these big Google.  Oh, I've never seen that thing.  It's got giant robot eyes all over it and devices on the wheels and they know exactly  where they are and they're taking pictures everywhere they go.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here they come.  They're coming right down.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I need a Google map pose.  And I think, I think this is very important and something everybody, I'm looking at you  guys, everybody should think about is if the Google map car is coming down my street, what  am I going to do?  And this was my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Of course, Nathan Fillion, not a comedian.  He was now from a serenity and he's now got a TV show called Castle, which actually is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  On the other hand, there's the guy in France who's suing because the Google street view  picture took a picture of him peeing in front of a truck in a driveway.  And as somebody put out today, that's that just it invokes the Barbara Streisand rule.  Right.  Don't bring it up.  The whole world knows this guy was peeing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He says, I live in a, he says, I live in a small town and even though they blow up my  face, they recognize the rest of me.  I don't know what they are.  And they are mocking me endlessly in my little town.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This should be a lesson to all men.  Why do men do this?  Because we can, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you're just jealous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's disgusting.  I listen, I am jealous about the convenience of that ability.  I am, but I wouldn't use it to pee on the side of it in public.  What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is true.  It is a male thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They should skewer this guy.  It should be a lesson to all men who've ever peed in public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gina, this is the nation that invented the Pissoir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's true.  In France?  The Pissoir.  You don't know what that is?  But in Paris they used to have these little metal things where you go in and you pee and  you're basically in public.  I mean, you know, there's a little barrier, but they don't have those anymore.  Jeff, I don't know.  I keep looking, I kept looking for Pissoirs and I couldn't find them anymore and they  don't have them anymore.  I'm sad.  That was a very nice thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm too shy to do that.  Even I am too shy to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to say, it seems like it would be a lot of pressure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have.  It is.  I am proud to say that I have peed on a tree at the Bohemian Grove.  That's what you're supposed to do.  There's no women there, so it's okay.  And the trees are very stunted looking.  Jonathan Franzen, one of my favorite novelists, he wrote The Possessions in his most recent  book, what's it called?  I'm sorry, The Corrections, his most recent book is called Freedom.  Fantastic.  He says, Twitter is the ultimate irresponsible medium.  You old farts.  Twitter is unspeakably irritating.  Actually, I agree with him on that.  Twitter stands for everything I oppose.  It's hard to cite facts or create an argument in 140 characters.  It's as if Kafka had decided to make a video semaphoring the metamorphosis.  Or it's like writing a novel without the letter P.  It's the ultimate irresponsible medium.  People I care about are readers, particularly serious readers and writers.  These are my people we do not like to yak about ourselves.  Oh my, oh my, oh my.  Old fart.  Yeah.  I've revised my opinion of Jonathan Franzen.  No, I still like his novels.  All right, time for Gina's tip of the week, Ms. Tripani.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  This is a good tip for fans of thank you and please for nice people like myself, a big  fan of please and thank you.  Google has added a little feature to search results.  We all know that you can see if one of your friends has plus one search result and those  will show up higher in your results if you're signed into Google.  Now if you search for something and say Leo has plus one, the link that I found useful,  there is a link to thank the person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you can click thank like right there.  What?  Wait, I got to try this.  So Google's incorporating that now and into search results.  And it's interesting.  This kind of there's a story.  I think maybe it was last week.  I think it was after our last episode about how Google plus is this ghost town and no  one really uses it.  But then Vic and Dutra came out and basically said, you know, Google plus isn't a product.  It is the product.  You know, it's not going away.  The Google plus is Google period.  So and I like to see them do things like this, you know, incorporating that this kind of  use of the service inside of their their their premiere service, which is the search engine  results.  So I'm seeing the thank you links now.  I don't know.  Are you seeing them?  Are you seeing them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Leo, I think they're rolled out.  I tried to but I don't see I don't see any social links at all.  So I might I might have turned that off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's I might turn that off.  OK.  Yeah.  So if I Google the word Google, I see that several of my friends, many of whom are Googlers,  have you know, it says these these people have plus one this and then I get this thank  them link.  And it's so nice.  It pops up a way for me to just send them a message on Google plus saying thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's nice.  You're so right, Gina, because because everybody fears that the Internet is rude and nasty  and awful and is ruining civilization.  It's just a nice little touch.  So I say thank Dan Patterson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this is the thing.  The Internet has to build in mechanisms like this to encourage good behavior.  Right.  Yes.  Because it's so easy to be a jerk.  Right.  Behind the screen.  You know, it kind of encourages you to be a jerk.  So I think apps especially social web apps have to kind of overcompensate in this way.  You know, say thank you.  That's a that's a nice.  I mean, it's a little finger waggy.  You know, mom, eat your vegetables, brush your teeth.  I don't like it.  But it's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's only to Dan Patterson.  It's not public.  So it's not like I'm going to be spamming Google plus with this.  I think that's nice.  Not all thank yous go to Dan Patterson.  Just that one.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Just that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's needed.  Yeah.  Saying it now online.  That's really cool.  Jeff, your number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, me.  Oh, I love that, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's just let's just watch Jeff frame.  Oh, I'll do my I'll do my tool and then we'll do the number of the week if the tool shows  up.  So we were talking last week.  Jammer be John Salin, my studio manager and one of our greatest contributors said that  this is this maps GL thing new.  And we decided it wasn't new.  But now he said, no, it is new.  And it's on.  If you go to maps.google.com and I'm still waiting for it and you need to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The person whom you're trying to reach is currently unavailable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you need to do this in Chrome, I think.  Experience maps GL view 3D buildings fly over 45 degree aerial view imagery swoop quickly  into Street View without a plug in.  So this is just something you might want to try enabling.  My my system is kind of slow right now, so I don't know what this is going to look like.  Chrome does not work well on this Mac for some reason.  OK, now it's enabled.  Welcome.  Let's go take a guided tour of maps.  Click here to start the tour.  Anyway, you might want to do this on your own system.  Shall we see Westminster Abbey?  Yeah.  OK, I'm in satellite, so I'm going to choose map map mode first.  That's one thing you have to do.  And then let's go to Westminster.  Abbey, London.  Get the pop up out of there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want the Google map cameras to go to the castle in Downton Abbey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I know.  I know.  That's cool.  Zoom into the slider is here.  OK.  Do you see T T T T?  See 3D buildings now?  So you could do this before, but but now you're actually you're actually doing it.  Now we can zoom and pan.  And these are these are supposed to have to change the angle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Shift or shift some zoom in and pan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you do do do do do do do do do do do do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do do do do do do hold the middle mouse button.  What middle mouse button?  That's a very googly thing to say.  Hold the middle mouse button.  Anyway, I'll leave it to those of you who have middle mouse buttons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a pad that clicks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just have a pad.  See, now we're seeing some some some 3Dness.  Yeah.  Oh, I wasn't in the map mode.  That's why.  There we go.  There we go.  And now anyway, Jeff, are you back?  We can't get him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's not back now.  He's left our document.  Probably restart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think his whole system is offline.  Well, that's OK.  We had a number.  What?  I should go to the Google Doc and see his number.  What was his number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twenty million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Twenty million.  Gag hits that number.  Oh, Gaga Gaga Gaga.  All right.  Maybe gag was some sort of subliminal thing.  Lady Gaga hits 20 million Twitter followers.  Unfreaking believable.  I remember when I was the number one guy on Twitter.  Of course, it was 2007 and I had five thousand followers in 2007.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That should go up on your wall of achievements.  Being the biggest follower, having the biggest follower on Twitter is a big deal.  It didn't last.  It didn't last, but you were early.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was early.  It's back when having five thousand followers on Twitter could make you number one.  And then Kevin Rose, I don't know if you remember, and I had this little battle about who was number one on Twitter.  And then Lady Gaga came along.  Justin Bieber, 18 million.  Katy Perry, 15, 7.  Shakira, 14, 5.  My problem is my hips do lie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yours and mine both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They don't lie.  It's similar.  Wow, that's amazing.  She also has 48 million.  Oh, is Jeff still?  No.  I don't want to do his number without him.  48 million fans on Facebook and 800,000 circled on Google.  Actually, that isn't very many, but that's because she joined Google Plus way late just a couple of weeks ago.  She'll be big there.  You know why?  She will type stuff.  And I admire that.  Unlike a lot of people.  So no luck with Jeff.  That's all right.  I think probably City University of New York's a big crater right now.  Yeah, he's not back in our dock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And he's still not.  I've called him multiple times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis is a professor of journalism at the City University of New York.  CUNY, they call it.  He also is the author of a great book called Public Parts.  You must read it.  His blog is BuzzMachine.com.  Gina Trapani is at SmarterWear.org and the author of ThinkUpApp.  And should have as many followers as Lady Gaga.  And the fact that she doesn't is a massive crime against humanity.  Oh, I don't know about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gaga's pretty fabulous.  But thank you for saying that, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She said she did a picture of me on the monitor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, well, welcome.  That's nice.  We've had an audience all day today.  It's been really fun.  I love having people in here because I'm so proud of the studio and everything.  We probably should start getting rid of those Macs, however.  That's not a permanent display.  We can leave them for this.  I don't know what the hell we're going to talk about today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, we got polar bears again.  I mean, it's kind of raining over here.  There looks to be some frost.  Something's happening.
