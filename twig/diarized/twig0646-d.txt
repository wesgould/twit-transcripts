Ant Pruitts here from Hands On Photography hello Ant.  Hello Mr. LaPorte how you be sir?  I am great I just drank a bunch of nootropic energy stuff so if I start to get strange.  Start to?  Start to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it will just be another Wednesday?  It will be just another Wednesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Also with us the Leonard Taub Professor for Journalistic Innovation at the Newmark.  Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York hello Jeff.  Hello.  Good to see you.  Good to see you.  And Stacey it was a little under the weather we're giving her the day off but good news we got Mike  Elgin in her place.  He's back in the US MikeElgin.substack.com home of his newsletter.  Hey Mike.  Hey how you doing?  Are you gonna do this standing up?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is a physical humble brag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah I thought about doing that before.  No.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  The truth is I spend so much time sitting it's really almost dangerous so any chance  I get to stand up it's great.  That's smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why you have a rear end is to use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like your attitude.  We got these you know elevating tables I guess the theory was that I could stand up and do  this but then we realized.  You're going to be able to stand up as your chair going down.  The funny thing also is as I get older I'm gonna blame the cushions in the chair becoming  less resilient but I think it's actually me shrinking.  I'm starting to get dwarfed by this chair.  I'm just getting tinier and tinier in the chair.  Pretty soon it's just going to be me and now it's time for Dwayne.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo if I may.  Yes.  In the old days we remember we used to have unboxing.  Yeah you got something.  I have an unbagging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Unbagging.  Very important.  What do we got in the bag?  Kachoi Pepe Puffs from Trader Joe's.  Did they send them to you?  No.  No.  I've held on to them.  Hashtag sponsored.  No you bought these with your real money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is my first try.  I could have opened them two days ago but I said no I'm going to try them on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just for background Jeff loves the Kachoi Pepe for real at Trader Joe's.  Is this anything like the Kachoi Pepe in the bag at Trader Joe's?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Judging from Jeff's face it's a little odd to get a hold of but the aftertaste is wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Aftertaste is wonderful.  That's good we'll put that on the bag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My wife went to buy them and the nice lady she deals with all the time at Trader Joe's  saw her reaching for them and said oh no.  I thought I don't know what's wrong with them or they're going to go to this dinner.  The lady said those are so addictive.  Uh oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh God he's going to crunch the whole show isn't he?  Oh this will be great.  Somebody's saying the Taco Bell now has subscriptions that might be something you'd be interested  in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes they do.  But for tacos not burritos.  I'm in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like a taco a day or something.  Yeah 30 days of tacos for 10 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the Taco Lovers Pass.  Choose from one of seven select tacos.  But a taco at Taco Bell is like a 30 cent.  I mean exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a taco lovers pass as in pass.  I'm going to pass if I love tacos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're so tiny you only get like two ounces of meat on them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I wouldn't even use the word meat for whatever that is.  I said air quotes.  Well you could tell how much it's worth 30 days for 10 dollars.  Do the math.  Okay Taco Bell is the master though of marketing aren't they?  They really are.  Oh they are.  They're kind of amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they used to be you know I've loved them for years and years and years and years.  People made fun of me and now it's hip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is.  It's hip marketing.  It's hip like Mentos got hip thanks to marketing.  In the early days of MTV I know this because the guy who was our program director at Tech  TV used to was a programmer at MTV.  And he said Mentos before MTV was grandma's thing.  It was the thing you'd get in the cut glass crystal when you went to grandma's house.  The candy no one wanted.  He said but then they started advertising on MTV the Freshmaker.  That's right.  And it became suddenly hip.  So it's really it's just marketing you know.  And now by the way it's back to grandma's except grandma watched MTV 30 years ago.  What goes around gets old.  Grandma's never end.  I am happy to tell you proud to report according to Mike Elgin in the Computerworld.com you  can safely ignore Web 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh appreciate it.  You got to tell the rest of the web that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's funny we had on Sunday we had we would have been our futurists panel.  We had a science fiction author.  We had Kevin Rose.  Everybody got sick.  So we ended up just being a priest and Amy Webb who's an actual futurist.  So I kind of thought it was like well we got the medieval point of view and we got the  future.  But one of the very first things we talked extensively about is this notion of Web 3.  Maybe Mike because you wrote this article you can explain what Web 3 is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well OK.  So Web 3 is the idea that the next version of the web is going to be based on the blockchain  tokenization and distributed decentralized decentralized radically decentralized.  Interestingly you'll notice that the mission of the Web 3 decentralization power to the  people instead of the corporations the governments.  This was the this was the mission of the what formerly called the Internet.  This is the the techno utopian hippies that created TCPP and all the protocols that that  our current Internet and later web would be built out of.  That was their intent to you know.  Remember John Perry Barlow's manifesto where he said you know we won't be subject to governments.  We won't be controlled by anyone.  Well that turned out to not work out so well because as the Web 3 enthusiasts will tell  you Web 2 the current web where content creators have to deal with these gigantic corporations  that really have all the keys and control everything.  Well the problem with this whole thing the idea of rebuilding the web based on NFTs blockchains  cryptocurrency etc etc is that it's fundamentally incompatible with human nature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this is by the way the nature of technology but but go on and the nature of business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly Jeff.  And this was this is where Jack Dorsey chimed in and basically said that look because Jack  Dorsey is in fact committed to decentralized communication which is why they're working  on what is it called Jeff.  They're working on the loose guy.  Which is actually a decentralized project.  His point is that the problem with with the vision of the utopian Web 3 crowd is that  everybody wants to invest in it because they want to make money which means they have these  corporations that want to grow and profit heavily involved heavily in control because  that's where the money is coming from.  And so as he said the Web 3 will never escape their incentives.  Their incentives are to use their power that they have from their investment to direct  the nature of these products to profit themselves.  This is in direct contradiction to the notion of this democratic the people in charge the  crowd is in charge kind of ethos.  So it doesn't really work.  And I think Jack Dorsey had a great point in that regard.  The other two ways that it doesn't work is that the giant tech corporations that in fact  do control many of the services that we use aren't going to go along.  And the public is not going to go along because it's all too complicated.  People people don't want and this is sort of touches on what Jeff wrote about brilliantly  I might add in his buzz machine piece which is that human nature doesn't really you know  content creators want to create content.  They don't want to be mucking around with running their own servers with doing all this  stuff.  They're not going to go along with this.  And so it's kind of a non-starter.  But the problem the beef I have with the journalism around this and the same something similar  happening with the metaverse idea is that every cryptocurrency thing every blockchain  thing every tokenized thing is called Web3.  Well it doesn't really mean anything if we're just talking about individual applications  running on the Web2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Web3 is basically how Taco Bell got cool marketing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the 5G of the internet.  It's just but 5G is.  I could argue 5G is actually something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We will actually actually connect over 5G.  Whereas the idea that you know it's a very different proposition to have what we have  now which is some cryptocurrency stuff some blockchain stuff we have NFTs services around  those things we have Bitcoin wallets we have all that stuff.  There's a big difference between that which is inevitable and all that stuff will grow  as well and having the internet be based on that sort of thing.  That's the part that's not going to happen ever.  Right.  And if that isn't the Web3 and some people you know nobody really fully agrees on what  this is.  But if that isn't the Web3 then it's just it's just a word that means all that stuff  that the Bitcoin bros love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jack's tweet is the short version which is you don't own Web3 the VCs and their limited  partners do it will never escape their incentives.  It's ultimately a centralized entity with a different label.  You know what you're getting into.  And of course he was immediately blocked by Mark Andreessen.  Mark Andreessen because Mark Andreessen and Andreessen Horowitz are basically the chief  proponents of Web3.  It's kind of a portfolio deal for them.  I think maybe the long version of this which is kind of technical but I think worth reading  is Mark's Moxie Marlin Spike's blog post at Moxie.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's brilliant.  The guy that resigned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  He's a former CEO of Signal.  He invented Signal.  Two days ago.  Yeah.  We'll talk about that in a bit.  But he makes I think I'll see if I could summarize this.  He makes the point that one and this is really important people do not want to run their  own servers.  Right.  And they never will.  I happen to run my own server but I understand why nobody with any idea of you know public  scaling or anything is going to run their own even big companies run their servers on  Amazon.  That's why Amazon is so successful.  So that's problem number one is you can't decentralize something that's by its very  nature centralized.  You're not going to get people to run their own servers.  He also points out and this is this is a deeper insight but actually really good that a pro  that and this is going to be a little hard to understand a protocol moves more slowly  than a platform.  To give an example that really is a germane to our audience IRC is a platform.  It's been around for 30 plus years and he says people are still trying to standardize  sharing a video reliably over IRC.  Meanwhile Slack lets you create that should not only do that but create a custom reaction  emoji based on your face because it's a it's a it's a platform not a company.  It's a company that is controlled.  Yes centralized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Control and that's control enables that speed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So he says if something's truly decentralized it becomes very difficult to change and often  remain stuck in time.  This is a brilliant way to put it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought that was the best of the post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah I think a really great insight.  But once you understand that that's that makes makes you realize why it's hard to hold on  just a sec.  I'll get to you in a second.  It's hard to to propose a decentralized web because nobody's going to run their own servers  and it's not going to move along very quickly because the platforms are just going to leapfrog  it.  He also talks about it kind of peripherally making an NFT.  He makes an NFT.  I'll tell you what how this ties in in a second but he makes an NFT that looks different depending  on where you look at it.  So the first one is on OpenSea.  The second view same NFT is unwearable and if you do it in your wallet you get a poop  emoji.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The punchline of all this is that when you buy an NFT what you actually buy what's registered  on the blockchain is a URL.  Is a link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So if and furthermore so he's able to change this because you know he can change it depending  on where you come to it.  But then the punchline on this one is OpenSea blocked it because they didn't they said well  you violated terms of service in some vague way.  And as soon as it's blocked on OpenSea which is one platform that is very popular for NFTs  none of those versions of it got seen because it turns out crypto wallets don't do the rendering  nothing does the rendering they all use OpenSea's API to find out what's in the NFT.  Centralization strikes again.  Completely centralized and if OpenSea blocks it it's gone which really is I think problematic  for this whole notion.  I'm sorry.  So then.  We've got to pop the stack in order.  So this is a this is a life oh stack.  I think I owe you a comment first Ant Pruitt go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well there's two things as anyone even considered where the people running the infrastructure  stands on all of this we moved to say this whole Web 3D centralized that stuff still  has to run on top of well infrastructure that's going to be controlled by big companies.  Guess what their thoughts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Those people are the ones promoting this like Andreessen Horowitz.  And you know why because they're going to make money.  Who makes money in NFTs.  People like OpenSea the ones who mint it not the people so much selling it.  OK now.  And then I also OK.  Yeah go ahead.  You're not fully popped.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So with OpenSea blocking it that sort of reminded me of Apple Podcasts and how Apple Podcasts  seems to be the end all be all for the podcast industries when you go and look up a certain  podcast application or whatever they're usually pulling from Apple's database right instead  of going to look at the actual creators source.  Of course.  And that's still sort of centralized.  Unfortunately.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK.  I popped the stack and now it's Mike Elgin next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it feels to me like and you've mentioned the idea that cryptocurrency is a kind of  a Ponzi scheme.  It's Ponzi scheme or pyramid scheme whatever.  And it seems to me that the people who are investing in this sort of thing want massive  universal buy in because that's right very profitable in general across the board.  So they've got this sort of double think sort of self-fulfilling kind of language thing  going where they say they make the claim that Web 3 is all this stuff that I'm invested  in and that's the future of the web.  And so ordinary consumers of technology news will get the sense from the incredible hype  around this concept that Web 3 is the future.  So I better start investing in all these startups.  And it just seems like a kind of a it seems like a grand marketing scheme similar to the  metaverse thing.  And I don't know if we want to talk about that later.  But it seems like a grand marketing scheme to legitimize something that is really that  a certain minority of people are super passionate about.  And the vast majority couldn't care less.  They don't understand it.  They don't care, etc.  And they're trying to get the masses sort of the majority of people to just go along  with it, to invest in it, to make the world safe for this sort of thing for their own  profit. I think it's always easier to market something that doesn't exist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes. It's the Vanna White principle.  When somebody asked Peter Jennings why everybody liked him, he says the Vanna White principle.  Vanna never says anything.  So you project upon her your your at the attributes you like.  You assume that she's like you.  And I think that that's the same thing with this marketing.  You assume it's what you want because it isn't anything you the best paragraph in your  column, Mike, is the two biggest buzzwords in tech right now.  The metaverse and Web3 describe platforms that don't exist, aren't expected to exist even  by boosters for a decade at least and probably will never exist.  Of the top 100 concerns for tech pros, Web3 is 101.  All right. Popping the stack, Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So then I read it to me.  I got it. Moxie's piece is really smart.  Yeah. But it's difficult to get through.  But I was wondering whether to assign it to students.  It's it's very dense with ideas and technology.  So I read it a couple of times hoping I would get it.  And then Matt Mullenweg, who I admire greatly, founder of WordPress, tweeted this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Also very smart, very smart.  Good guy. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We didn't. Oh, yeah.  And we didn't talk about it last week, but there was a really good profile of him in  protocol. Yes.  Yes. Which I highly recommend.  Yeah. So Matt said people seem to be redefining Web2.0 as Facebook, et cetera, that own  data. Web2.0 at the time was platforms like WordPress, Odeo, Sixapart, Flickr,  Technoradi, and Delicious that had open data and interoperate.  So I was thinking about this and then I started riffing on it on Twitter that became a  post that said that I think that we make a mistake here in thinking that Web12,  123 is a progression.  Second, we make a mistake in thinking that we're at Web2 or 3 anyway.  We're at Web.00001 or 000012.  And you know my shtick Gutenberg, it's early days.  Fourteen seventy five. You've heard that spiel before.  But same true with the Web.  It's very, very early. We don't know what it is yet.  It's not as like we've graduated from something.  The problem with periodization, the problem with thinking that the dark ages were there and  they were worthless. And the Renaissance was a good thing.  It's the same problem with saying, well, Web2.0 should be discarded and Web1.0 should be  discarded because now we're Web3.0.  No, we're not.  And what Matt said here, what struck me is there's things to learn.  And in a way, what Moxie asks for at the end of his wonderful piece, in a way, Matt  and open source answer the questions.  Because I remember when the Polaris VC, VCs, who called me when they were thinking about  investing in WordPress and they did, they said, is it nuts?  He's going to be open source.  How does that work?  And I said, he's already beat movable type because he's put something out there that  because it's open source spreads widely.  How much of the Web does he now serve and gets updated?  And so in a sense, we've seen Web3.0.  It was Web1.0.  It was called open source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  With a similar mission of power to the people and the crowd and also to Wikipedia, for  that matter, interested, passionate people will have a bigger influence than the casual  user, et cetera, et cetera, to build this thing without top down policy.  Yes.  Yes.  It's a creator's tool.  Right.  Exactly.  Right.  Yes.  But what's one of the differences though, is that the whole web, the whole open source  phenomenon was so much less naive than the Web3 phenomenon.  For example, one of the big benefits of blockchains is you can is that is that the  ledger is permanent and public.  Right.  The greatest doxing tool ever created.  You can you can make a purchase somebody's NFT and is part of your notes.  You can dox somebody to smithereens and nobody could ever remove that information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting.  Ever.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The blockchain is permanent.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Another one is like, oh, we'll use the blockchain to cure fake news.  What we'll do is we'll make sure that every source of content is registered on the  blockchain and then we'll know exactly where it comes from.  Well, that doesn't address fake news at all, because the problem with fake news is  that is not that people are misled about where it comes from, is that they think the  New York Times and the Atlantic are fake news and they think everything on 4chan is  real.  That's the problem.  Blockchain isn't going to solve that at all.  So there are no solutions to the problems of of moderation.  Like face everybody likes to dump all over Facebook for moderation.  But either they do something about hate speech or when they don't, we get to yell at  Facebook either way.  That's better than just hate speech running rampant in the sort of kind of somehow we're  kind of in charge of it, you know, as a group.  Like I don't there's nobody has articulated how that's supposed to how that's supposed  to work.  Other than other than we're all blockchain enthusiasts and so we're all people of  goodwill, which is essentially how the original Internet was supposed to be.  They didn't foresee spam.  They didn't foresee any of this stuff.  Yeah.  Because they thought, wow, once information is free, then everybody will be on their  best behavior.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You talked about marketing previously, and I think it makes perfect sense that they  they would be able to capitalize on it because of this being a pandemic and where people  are emotionally and socially these days with the whole resignation and wanting to just,  you know, take more control of things for themselves instead of depending on their,  you know, their jobs and whatnot.  And then there's also the group that say, man, I remember Bitcoin up 10 years ago and  man, if I had just put $10 in it back then, I would be rich and blah, blah, blah, blah.  And I think they're going to just sort of continue to market to that group and say,  hey, you don't want to miss out because you missed out on Bitcoin back in the days.  Don't miss out on Web3 and just just stick with us, even though it doesn't exist just  yet. Just stick with us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I remember talking to the Secret Service once about scams like the Nigerian Prince scam.  Oh, yeah.  There are really no new con games.  The Internet has just taken them off the street and put them on the Internet.  And this does strike me a little bit as, you know, watch your wallet because, oh, this  is the hot new exciting thing.  Now it's just watch your Bitcoin wallet.  Watch your, yeah, well, I wish I could, but  best place it could be is locked up right now.  I'm telling you.  Best thing.  You mentioned Moxie Marlinspike, who has the greatest name in technology, probably not  his real name, stepping down at Signal.  I don't know if that's anything we should draw any conclusion from that.  In his post, he said, you know, Signal, which he invented, is growing, is doing well.  And every day he says, I'm struck by how boundless signals potential looks.  And I want to bring in someone with fresh energy and commitment to make the most of  that.  That's a normal transition.  I don't think there's any reason to think that that means anything for Signal.  So, yeah, it was unsustainable.  Yeah, he's great.  And I hope he works on something else new and exciting and different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What did you think about Casey Newton's point about Signal and untraceable financial  contributions?  A, what do you think about that and security and the world?  And B, did that have anything to do with Moxie's departure?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, that's what kind of some people, and even in my mind, I kind of thought, well,  because Signal's been getting into crypto and they want to have transactions over Signal.  But most messengers, Facebook Messenger, Apple's Messenger, Android Messages, all,  most messengers have financial transactions.  The difference is Signal is considering adding its own mobile coin, which is, you know, kind  of anonymous, you know, and it's built on the Stellar blockchain.  It's completely fair for Casey to say, you know, look, we wouldn't ransomware has taken  off because of Bitcoin.  When ransomware first started, you had to go to, they would say, go down to the 7-Eleven  and buy some money cards and mail them to this post office box.  It wasn't a very good system and they didn't do very well until Bitcoin became well enough.  And in fact, even then, when the first Bitcoin ransomware came along, they had a whole pages  of description of how to set up a wallet, put money in the wallet, send us the Bitcoin.  Now, though, it's very, everybody kind of knows Bitcoin.  And so it's really been good for ransomware.  So that's I mean, Casey's point is well taken.  But, you know, they've been saying that since PGP came out.  I remember Phil Zimmerman, who invented PGP said, I interviewed him on triangulation.  I said, well, what do you say to people that say, you know, terrorists can use encryption?  He said, well, yes, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they use telephones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's that's life.  You and doesn't mean you shouldn't have something just because it can be misused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It can also have a whispering conversation in the parking lot.  Right.  That, you know, it's like people are going to have private conversations.  And the risk to people who are trying to protect themselves and who aren't doing anything  terroristic is much higher than, you know, than the damage done by terrorists who will.  Anyone who's a criminal or, you know, a serious terrorist or whatever,  they're going to they're going to know when they're being spied upon for the most part.  And they're going to find ways to communicate without anybody knowing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And we do have a very private form of financial transaction.  It's known as cash.  And it's completely private.  If I give you a million dollars in unmarked bills, the problem is,  because of bank reporting laws, it's getting harder and harder.  So government is kind of closing in on that.  I think the primary reason for the crypto existence of crypto is because  people want that privacy that cash gives them.  But it's getting harder and harder.  Financial markets are moving towards credit cards and other easily traceable products.  Bank reporting requirements, etc., make cash less anonymous.  But we did not use cash because it could potentially allowed for unmarked bills in banks.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And we have to acknowledge what a great thing credit cards are.  Because if somebody somehow gets ahold of your credentials and they ring up,  you know, they go buy a Ferrari, you don't have to pay for that Ferrari.  Right.  Right. Because you're protected through the credit card system and through laws that are associated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A lot of people say, but I want the privacy.  I want to be able to buy stuff without being tracked by Google.  You know, and I understand that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But get ready, get ready, get ready.  Here it is.  There is a touch to push the button.  Rather than saying where is the harm or what could go wrong and why don't I want this?  It's just privacy Google bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The moral panic button is broke.  Oh, there you go.  Okay.  All we saw was a black screen.  Mr. Jeremy was just really quick.  You need a longer loop if we're going to keep this up.  I think really my point is there's downsides to everything and there's upsides.  Yeah.  And so I don't think you could say, well, signal doing crypto.  Oh, bad, because bad guys could use it.  I mean, cash, bad guys can use cash.  Bad.  Let's get rid of cash.  He does point out the DM, which is the Facebook created cryptocurrency has  committed to following any money laundering laws.  How?  Well, this is the problem I have means report everything.  Right?  You report all transactions and you set up a system where there are no anonymous transactions.  Well, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Facebook is so eager to do whatever government would tell them to do to  take them off the hook for what they don't do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Facebook is the last person that's going to take a stand on this.  Die on that hill.  And by the way, this is the commitment they made.  In the early development of the Libra network, its members are committed to working with  authorities to shape a regulatory environment that encourages technological innovation while  maintaining the highest standards of consumer protection.  I mean, it's not like, okay, here's what we're going to do.  And they, by the way, they say as with any currency or financial infrastructure, bad actors  will try to exploit the network when the network is open and accessible to everyone with internet  access.  The network's main endpoints will need to follow applicable laws and regulations and  collaborate with law enforcement.  In addition, transactions on the blockchain will be in clear text like many other blockchains.  So it's possible for third parties to do analysis to detect the network.  So it's possible for third parties to do analysis to detect and penalize fraud.  Again, they're saying, yeah, well, law enforcement comes to us.  We'll work with them.  And people, Bitcoin isn't anonymous.  You can see every transaction.  What's anonymous is your wallet number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Facebook says that they'll work with law enforcement, but who's law enforcement?  Right.  North Korea's, China's, Russia's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the typical bulky boilerplate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not easy being Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I feel bad for them.  Yeah, poor Facebook.  Now, the FTC, which has been trying to get Facebook to divest WhatsApp and Instagram,  can go ahead.  U.S. District Judge James Boasberg wrote that an amended complaint the agency filed in August  offered more robust and detailed evidence to suggest Facebook has an alleged monopoly  on the network.  He actually started his pleading with second time lucky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Lucky is associated with the VR product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, Palmer Lucky.  He had thrown out the original antitrust complaint saying you didn't even say they're a monopoly.  So apparently this time it's better.  Use the M-Word.  Yeah, they can use the M-Word.  So there is some thinking that maybe the judge is giving them the green light to try to break up,  or at least force Facebook to divest Instagram and WhatsApp.  While the judge's decision, this is from the Washington Post, acknowledges the agency has  overcome some of the shortcomings of the initial suit, Judge Boasberg signaled it may be challenging  for the FTC to ultimately prove Facebook is a monopoly.  It's anyone's guess whether the agency will prevail.  Though the agency may well face a tall task down the road improving its allegations,  the court believes it at least now has cleared the pleading bar and may proceed to discovery.  So I'm sure Facebook is not thrilled about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ironically, it feels to me in Europe that Facebook is an absolute and total monopoly,  let's say in the US.  Everyone I know in Europe, all my European friends, literally use Instagram, Facebook,  and WhatsApp and nothing else unless they own a business, in which case they might have a website.  But beyond that, a huge number of people in Europe and probably elsewhere in the world  use only Facebook products to use the internet.  It's astonishing how-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I had to install, when we got to Oaxaca, I had to install WhatsApp so I could text you in the mirror.  Yes, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, so you can text Amira.  Amira, yeah.  I don't use WhatsApp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, she's the only person in my WhatsApp phone book.  But no, clearly, certainly WhatsApp has a monopoly in many nations worldwide.  Yes.  Not so much in the US.  And you know, I think, I don't know if Facebook has a monopoly or in the US,  I don't know what the competition is for Facebook.  That's part of the problem.  Is Twitter competition?  I don't know.  What's the competition for Facebook?  But I think I talk to people all the time and they even say it in an apologetic tone and say,  well, I do have a Facebook account.  And I say, don't apologize.  That's how you keep up with your family.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that alone is not a monopoly.  It's one of many, many things we use.  Well, that's the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's the competition for Facebook?  Is it a postal letter?  I mean, that's the question.  Is it a phone call competition?  A monopoly in what realm?  Yeah, is a phone call competition?  What in what realm?  There isn't anything else like Facebook.  Yeah, not yet.  LinkedIn?  No.  Nope.  Friendster's gone.  Friendfeed's gone.  MySpace is around, but it's not a competition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you mentioned Friendster.  Wasn't Friendster purchased by Facebook and then killed?  Yeah, okay.  Well, that's why it's gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But yeah, well, no, it was already right.  It wasn't doing that.  It was a little peaked already.  Yeah.  MySpace though is still around.  I think it's a kneel dash that imagine though if Friendster had won,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  or Friendfeed had won.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Friendfeed was great.  I really liked Friendfeed.  Yeah, Friendfeed was great, yeah.  That was the Google Plus before Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I don't think there's-  Don't make Mike sad.  I know.  He brought it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is, you know what?  God damn Google.  I'm sorry.  I apologize to all the Christians out there.  But I do want God to actually damn Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apparently they already have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But honestly, what haven't they destroyed?  Look at the messaging mess.  And then they, and now Hiroshi Lockheimer has a temerity-  We still have Gmail.  We still have Gmail.  We still have Gmail.  We still have Gmail.  Yeah, that and search.  And search still works.  But boy-  There have been reports that search isn't all that good anymore either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just saw that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I haven't, I don't know if I agree with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Back to the messaging thing.  Yeah, that was a, so Ron-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ron Amadio in the Ars Technica, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wrote, it's one of those things where it's like, why didn't I write that?  It was a great piece.  Oh, so good.  But he basically points out, first he lays out the case about how Google is complaining  that iMessage is too powerful that they use bullying.  They actually, Google accused Apple of bullying by making people who use Android devices green  instead of blue.  How dare they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, this is taking off on the Wall Street Journal article, which because there was  nothing else to write about, the journal suddenly discovered that people who are using Android  Messenger feel left out of Apple Messages conversations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But after laying out the case that Google is making against Apple, Ron just eviscerates  them by pointing out that since Apple launched iMessage in 2011, same year they launched  Google Plus by the way, Google launched Google Plus, Google has launched 13 messaging products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think we've used them all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The only person I ever talked on Allo with was you, Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know, and that's, you're the only person I ever talked to.  Somewhere out in the cloud is our conversation.  Allo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Says, oh, this is dumb, yeah, I think it's pretty dumb.  Ron's headline, after ruining Android messaging, Google says iMessage is too powerful.  Please stop kicking our butts so badly.  Google failed to compete with iMessage for years and now wants Apple to play nice.  How many?  Mike?  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  13 that they've launched in total.  They've killed a bunch of them, obviously, because it's Google.  But now even today they have eight and they're even incompatible with each other.  Jeez.  So today they have eight messaging solutions.  But imagine, theater of the mind, imagine if you will, ladies and gentlemen,  after seeing Apple launch iMessage in 2011, Google launched Google Messages in 2000,  let's call it 2012, and said this is the only messaging platform we will ever support.  It's on the cross platform on everything.  It supports all the bells and whistles.  You can make phone calls.  You can do this.  You can do that.  You can have it on an iPhone.  You can have it on an Android phone.  They would completely dominate this space if they had done that.  Right?  Because iMessage has always been primarily for Apple users.  Yes.  They could have made it cross platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They could have had the WhatsApp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It would have been like WhatsApp.  But no, they are so disorganized and visionless that they just couldn't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Ron also points out because we've talked about this, that Google is saying,  well, everybody should just use RCS.  If Apple would only add RCS to iMessages, we'd be happy.  He says even if Google could magically roll out RCS, Rich Communication Messaging Standard,  Rich Communication Standard, it's a poor standard to build a messaging platform on  because it's dependent on a carrier phone bill.  Carriers.  It's anti-internet.  It can't natively work on webpages, PCs, smartwatches, and tablets because  those things don't have SIM cards.  They don't have phone numbers.  The carriers designed RCS.  So RCS puts your carrier bill at the center of your online identity.  Even when free identification methods like email exist and work on more devices,  Google is just promoting carrier lock-in as a solution to Apple lock-in.  And unfortunately, I have to agree with him on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but the solution, as I intimated a minute ago, is for them to have  an alternative that isn't lock-in.  Right.  To have something like WhatsApp but from Google.  They could have put it everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is what they did with Chrome.  Chrome has been hugely successful.  Yes, yes, yes.  Just make it free, make it available.  Google benefits because people use it.  And just have one.  See earlier discussion of WordPress.  Just have one.  Yeah, Google is only Google.  Hangouts would have worked.  They were great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Ron Amadio points out that Hangouts is the best messaging solution that Google  ever came out with.  And they killed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  It was solid.  It wasn't perfect, but it was definitely better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the reason Messages works, one of the reasons Messages works, besides the fact  that it's the default messaging app on every iPhone sold and you can't turn it off,  the other reason is it degrades properly.  So it uses the internet for data like WhatsApp, but it will also use SMS.  And so you can have some assurance that you can iMessage everybody.  And then it has desktop.  It works.  It's a very Apple-y thing because you can't use it anywhere else.  And it's actually very secure.  And it's secure.  Apple knows what you're doing, but other than that, it's secure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I don't think even Apple...  Well, I mean, theoretically, they could find out what you're doing, but it's like  it's heavily encrypted, so no third party is going to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a hell of a lot better than most stuff.  I used Hangouts for a long time because it worked on my iPhone.  It worked on my Android phone.  It worked on my desktop.  Android Messages will kind of do all of that.  I have it on all those places, but it's not as good as Hangouts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Hangouts was definitely the solution for our family.  Yeah, because we could use it everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So no, you can't bitch Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What was the rationale for screwing it up?  Can you imagine what went through their heads?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ron wrote a long...  Or somebody did.  Ours had a long 25,000-word history, yet it was Ron's history of Google's messaging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I did that once too.  I wrote something like that for Computer World, and by the time it was published,  it already was out of date because they changed yet another thing.  So I'm not even going to touch it anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's fun if you go through all the different apps.  Google Talk, Google Voice, Google Wave, Google Buzz, Slides Disco.  I don't know what that is.  I don't know.  It's in the article.  The Google Plus Era, Google Plus Hangouts Video Chat, the first Hangouts,  Google Plus Huddle Messenger.  Huddle.  Oh, God.  Do we remember that?  Now it's a Microsoft.  I remember that.  I remember Huddle.  Google Docs Editor Chat, Google Hangouts, Google Spaces, Google Allo 2016,  Google's Dead on Arrival WhatsApp clone, Google Duo, which I still use with my daughter for  video calls, Google Hangouts Meet, they renamed it Meet, YouTube Messages, Google Hangouts Chat,  they renamed it Chat, Google Maps Messages.  Did you just say YouTube Messages?  Oh, wow.  Yeah, in 2017, he actually says, yes, this really was a thing.  Google and RCS, Google Photos Messages, Google Stadia Messages, Google Pay Messages,  Google Assistant Messages, Google Phone Messaging, Google Chat Part 2,  and then the last bit, is anyone in charge at Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the answer is no.  To answer your question, the elevator pitch for or the short version of the answer is that  just like Microsoft used to do under Balmer, each division has its own messaging app,  and they don't talk to each other, and they're competing with each other,  and there's nobody in charge, there's no Steve Jobs, there's no  Sacha Nadella even to say, no, this is the one we're doing.  That's it, period.  Everybody, we're putting all the wood behind this particular arrow.  Nobody ever did that.  I've been maintaining for several years that Sundar Pichai is a horrible CEO.  Nobody ever says that, but look at the result of what's happened since he took over.  All this stuff, the closures, the failures, this kind of thing,  this is all getting worse and worse under Sundar Pichai's leadership.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Remember that great cartoon?  I agree with you.  It was making fun of Microsoft where all the divisions are shooting at each other.  Yes.  I have the original on my wall at home, actually.  The artist sent it to me.  Apparently, Google decided that was a good way to do business,  and they adopted the Microsoft method.  Meanwhile, Microsoft had the good sense to stop doing that and to kind of at least try to  unify themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it's sad.  For a long time, this spaghetti throw it against the wall and see what sticks approach  was great for Google.  They got some major hits.  Gmail was a 20% project by one engineer initially.  The idea of having advertising was just some engineer had to talk Larry and Sergey into  doing ads, and they were against it.  And they're like, no, no, we should do ads.  And so for a long time, most of the things that were best about Google were the result  of this kind of like every engineer kind of like spinning up their own thing, and then  we'll try it and see what happens.  But Google grew so big and they became so successful that they could no longer be that  kind of a startup-like company.  And so now you have people betting their businesses on their infrastructure.  You have all kinds of billions of people using their products.  And so you can't have that sort of scrappy startup, let's try it and see if it works  kind of mentality.  You have to have a vision about what you're going to do, and then you have to execute on  that vision.  And they just can't seem to do it.  Who needs ADD treatment?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is Manu Cornet's organizational trees for all the different companies.  Here's Microsoft where they're all shooting at each other.  Actually, Google's is still, I think, fairly accurate.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That looks like their new building.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Everybody reports to everybody else.  Amazon's very hierarchical.  I think it still is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That looks like Amazon's atrium.  It is.  It's the downtown Seattle atrium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Facebook looks like a giant bean bag.  Everybody's connected.  Apple, this is from the era of Steve Jobs, era of centralized point, although I think  it's probably still the same.  And then Oracle is like a giant legal division, a little engineering division.  Manu, you got it.  You still, and I'm very proud to have this on my wall.  By the way, Sachin Adela, I didn't realize this in his book, hit refresh and the first  page mentions this cartoon and says this was the thing I was trying to solve.  So Google apparently did not get that message.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where did that cartoon originally run?  Just on a site or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, Manu published it on it's gone now, unfortunately on bonkers world, but it's  no longer there.  But I am very proud to have a original version of it from a man who sent us because we talked  about it all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're going to make it in an NFT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now you're talking.  All right.  Let me take a little break.  We hope Stacey's feeling a little bit better.  She's under the weather, but we're thrilled.  We got Mike Elgin in.  It's great to have you glad to be here from Mike Elgin.  Substack.com.  And of course, don't forget gastronomad.net.  The Morocco tour is sold out, but there are more to come if you go to gastronomad.net  and click the experiences tab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, our next one after that is Prosecco, which is going to be nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nice.  And of course I was on the Oaxaca trip and highly recommend it.  Morocco's a longer one, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Two weeks, two full weeks.  And we go to, I think something like eight or nine, ten cities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is there still room in the spring trip?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The spring trip?  No, that's sold out.  2022 is also sold out, but 2023 is already getting people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nice.  Very nice.  A lot of a lot of twit listeners on those trips.  So you'll be amongst good people.  I must say so much fun.  We're going to get you on, I think next month, you and Amira on to the club.  February 11th.  To talk about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that'll be our Valentine's Day episode.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Also, Jeff Jarvis from the City University of New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My gastronomical experience right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And Mr. Ant Pruitt, hands-on photography who did not go to CES.  And that's my fault.  And I'm still healthy.  Are you okay that you didn't get to go?  I'm totally fine, sir.  Yeah, it would have been fun.  Father Robert was there a quarter of the normal attendance, about 40,000 people.  So it sounds like it was pretty empty.  There were some cool things, but I feel like it's a very gimmicky show.  And I don't know how much stuff really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everything I love is one vendor put up just plywood or two by fours and plywood and QR codes.  And no hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The only advantage I would have seen at CES this year is it would have been a little bit more  intimate for us when you go to the booths.  Yeah, very intimate.  Because there's not as many people there.  A lot of times they are literally trying to flush you through so they can get the next  press person there.  But this would have been nicer to sit down and spend a little more time.  But it's all good.  We still got the gist of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There are a lot of these companies just did Zoom conferences and virtual conferences.  Mari Barra from GM didn't go, but she gave her keynote via Zoom, things like that.  Samsung had scheduled an event yesterday.  The Exynos 2200 was supposed to be launched yesterday.  They didn't tell anybody.  They didn't show up.  They didn't do anything.  It was like dial tone.  It was like the Golden Globes.  Yeah, that was weird.  I told my wife we're watching the football game.  I said, oh, shoot, it's the Golden Globes tonight.  But you can't watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All it was was a few members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association tweeting.  So they tweeted, here's the winner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They held it on Twitter.  That's all it was ever worth.  They held it on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Samsung finally did tell Business Korea that they are planning to unveil the new  processor when they launch the new phone.  There are no problems.  That is all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's how you do a press release.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nothing more.  There's nothing to see here.  Move along.  Yeah, I was someone looking at Twitter watching the Golden Globes thinking, oh,  I wonder if Tina Fey and Amy Poehler will host it again this year.  Maybe they got Ricky Gervais.  No, it's just 87 old white men tweeting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that was part of the problem.  Oh, Lord.  Completely out of touch with the Zeitgeist and really should never have had the prestige  that they had.  I mean, it was just, you know, it was a hundred.  The journalists, the foreign journalists that made up the Foreign Press Association  were barely even bloggers.  These are people from third rate, two bit little regional newspapers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who freelance a little bit here and there for some of the daily disgrace of Morocco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I just want I just wish, though, it was a great car wreck of a TV show  because everybody gets sloshed and they would hire people like Ricky Gervais,  who would just insult them right and left.  It was fun.  So just do that.  Admit we're out of touch.  We don't know what the hell we're talking about.  We're just going to give some awards.  Come watch our party.  It was a good party.  I feel bad.  I think I guess it's over, right?  I mean, how do you come back from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's definitely over.  What's funny about Ricky Gervais is that he did some bits, some of his best bits  in hindsight when you when you look through and find out what actually happened to them  are just accurate depictions.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's telling the truth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He had this one joke.  He said, oh, there aren't any nominee any black nominees because the Hollywood Foreign Press  are very, very racist.  Well, that was hilarious until it turns out that's just a plain statement.  True.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He didn't care.  Oh, God.  Thanks.  Another casualty of COVID, I guess.  You know, we'll see.  You think CES will be back next year?  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which was the Foreign Press Association?  No, it was a casualty of scandal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Scandal?  Was there actual scandal or just people realized they were?  Actual scandal.  There was actual scandal.  Oh, there are multiple cases where bribery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People bribe them.  Yeah.  It started with Pia Zador.  I remember that in the 80s.  She was best known.  Her husband, her husband, like took the entire Foreign Press to Vegas and wined them and  dined them and she won best actress or something for a horrible performance.  And that was the first one.  But there's been several since then that were kind of like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But we knew about that.  That was decades ago.  Right.  We didn't care because it was just a status quo.  That wasn't exactly the word I was going to use.  It did begin with S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the racism bit is the thing that hit them in.  And I don't know, it didn't get a lot of press, but Tom Cruise actually returned  his three Golden Gloves to the organization.  So I don't want him anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was Cruise.  Why was I thinking it was Tom Hanks?  It was Cruise that pertained.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't quote me.  I think it was Cruise.  Maybe it was Hanks, but I think it was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Kind of think Hanks would have done.  I can't see Tom Cruise really caring, but okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought it was Tom Hanks that did that.  Okay.  I thought that was interesting.  Somebody named Tom.  Let's be frank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think the Academy Awards are much better, are they?  I mean, there's no evidence of bribery.  Tom Cruise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there's less evidence of bribery.  All these award shows are...  They're all BS.  They're meaningless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's a party.  I like watching celebrities get drunk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but actually...  That's entertaining.  Yeah.  I'm shocked that I'm going to be defending the Oscars, but they actually have thousands  of members.  They tend to be...  They're in the trades.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Super luminaries.  If you won an Oscar before, you're probably a member.  Steven Spielberg, all these people.  But they had their own race scandal two or three years ago, if you recall,  and they responded by increasing the membership by like 25%.  Almost entirely people of color.  So they actually put their money where their mouth is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the voters are in the field that they're voting for, except for the big awards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Social media made a huge difference.  Hashtag Oscars so white.  So white.  Big awards.  Yes.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was, by the way, Tom Cruise.  Credits to Tom Cruise.  Yes, it was.  He returned his awards and NBC dropped the ceremony.  I missed this article last year.  That's why I wasn't on TV.  NBC said it wants meaningful reform.  Good for them.  This is a defining moment for Hollywood, says Time's Up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just think they should all be just deported and that'd be the end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, as long as everybody understands what a crappy thing it is, we can still enjoy it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They should rename it to be the Trash Oscars or something.  Yeah, the Trash Oscars.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't, you know, I'm not, I don't know, maybe not.  I don't know.  Maybe it does carry, it unfortunately carried a lot of weight.  It was kind of the precursor to the Oscars.  Right.  Yeah.  So that is unfortunate, I guess.  But I did like watching it fall apart on live TV.  Ricky Gervais was cold on that.  Tina Fey and Amy Poehler.  God, it was funny.  What is, what is streak, sir?  Oh, thank you for bringing that up because it is time to mention our sponsor.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very, very well done.  You protect the boss from himself, Ant.

Transcript:  What is this streak I keep hearing about, he says.  What is streak?  If you use Gmail, you know it's a goldmine.  It's a database of so much valuable information.  Streak is our sponsor and runs, I guess you would call it a CRM,  a customer relationship management engine that rides right on top of Gmail.  In fact, it's directly inside Gmail.  You're in, I mean, the thing that Gmail did so well, so right,  is that don't delete your mail because everything in there is a value.  It's kind of a database, a history.  It tracks what you've been up to, sales and fundraising and hiring or support.  Streak optimizes this in an incredible way.  It kind of turns it almost into a spreadsheet of information.  You can use streaks free email tools to check if your emails have been opened,  to send bulk emails with automated follow-up emails to improve your response rates.  It's part of your everyday workflow.  You're already using Gmail, right?  But you can then inside Gmail see details about your leads, your customers, your investors.  No more switching between Gmail and other tools.  If you're prospecting for new customers or raising a fundraising route or growing your team or  managing support tickets, Streak's pipelines, which are very cool, by the way,  you can use them to track all your processes directly from Gmail.  You can set up a pipeline in a couple of minutes.  It's very easy to get started.  Customize the pipelines based on your needs.  This is, I think, a very cool way of thinking about mail, the process of mail.  Streak makes it easy to collaborate by automatically sharing emails and notes with everyone  and anyone on your team.  Google Technology Partner of the Year.  So Google loves them too.  It's used by thousands of founders, entrepreneurs and small business owners.  750,000 to be exact.  In fact, all you have to do is ask around.  And it won't take long before the conversation goes to Streak.  People who use Streak, they have to tell the world, have you seen this?  Have you tried it?  It's amazing.  You can try it today.  Right now, it's free to use on your own.  That's to get you in the door if you want to use it with your business, with your team.  There's a pro plan.  In fact, you'll get 20% off your first year of their pro plan, their most popular option.  20% off their first year by going to streak.com slash twig.  S-T-R-E-A-K.  Streak.com slash twig.  And I want you to use that so they know you saw it here because I want them to  stick around.  Streak.com slash twig.  And you get a big 20% off for your whole first year.  But as I said, the free plan you can use on your own if you want to dip your toe in.  Streak's pretty, pretty, pretty cool.  Streak.com slash twig.  We thank them so much for their support of this week in Google.  Google.  Did you put this in here?  The cats that are sleeping on the Starlink dishes.  I love that.  So a good headline too.  Yeah.  Cat on a hot satellite dish.  They're heated so that they don't get iced up.  And apparently the cats figured that out.  And the other problem is it's kind of hard for Starlink to work through a cat.  One customer.  Well, I'll give you their revenge.  Yeah.  Here's five cats.  This is a tweet from Aaron Taylor.  Five cats who have discovered the warmth.  They're in the snow.  They're all bumpy.  I wouldn't have thought you could get five cats on that dish, but apparently can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The great thing is cats always have that, you got a problem with this look?  Yeah.  Like the mice were here.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Cats are funny, aren't they?  They know they're doing something wrong, but unlike a dog which will run off,  a cat just looks at you going, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I dare you to challenge me.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's your problem?  That's hysterical.  Why is Zynga worth $12.7 billion?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fake hay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fake hay.  Do they still do Farmville?  It's the NFT of the day.  I did Farmville for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Farmville 3 for mobile is coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The original Farmville, which died in 2020, has been replaced by games.  They've acquired quite a few.  Gram games, small giant games, peak games, Rollic, Ektra.  They're really the masters of the free to play, the freemium game,  where you get people hooked and then they give you lots of money for fake donuts or things.  So Take Two, which publishes Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption,  Bioshock and Borderlands Civilization, really big Kerbal space program,  all the 2K sports games.  They're a big gaming company.  Just bought Zynga.  A name?  It feels like a blast from the past.  $12.7 billion.  Which means probably you'll see Grand Theft Auto mobile, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why not?  There's the horsepower for it.  Yeah.  These devices now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You'll be able to mow down farm animals or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow.  It's funny.  I thought Zynga was in the old tech TV building and I thought,  they got to be gone by now.  What are they doing?  So last week we mentioned that Norton 360, the antivirus program,  installing a crypto miner.  I don't think by default.  I think A, you had to have the right hardware and B,  I think you had to opt in on people's computers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought it installed it, but you did have to opt in to run it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe that's it.  And they take 15% of it, as Cory Tocque de Rope pointed out.  Now it turns out they're not alone.  Avira, which was purchased by Norton, is now doing it too.  Avira has a big half billion users.  It was a free antivirus, very popular for a long time.  They have now introduced something called Avira Crypto.  This almost would feel like the opposite of an antivirus.  Wow.  But I guess, I mean, to me, it's already a problem with Norton slowing your system down.  Right.  To like molasses, but to add a crypto miner, not to mention the energy waste.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Again, I question why are we still pushing antiviruses when Windows already has something  pretty good already built in?  Why are we still pushing these things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because they're money.  There's money in them, they're hills.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You are Mr. Leo Laporte.  Can you tell people to just use Windows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do all the time.  On the radio show, people ask me, should I get an antivirus?  I say no.  Steve Gibson says the same thing.  There are reasons you might want an antivirus in business.  We run antivirus here.  Russell has us run into an antivirus because, well, we're a business and the last thing we  want to do is get shut down by ransomware.  If you've got a teenager, you might want to consider it.  If the hardheads use the family computer.  Because you know I have the solution to it all.  What's that?  A Chromebook.  Did you keep your Acer?  What is that?  What one is that?  No, this is the Google one.  You went back to the Google one.  Which is that the Go?  The one with the nubby butt?  Yeah.  It is.  The nubby butt.  Nubby butt one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I still use the Pixelbook, the pre-Go one and I share your smugness, Jeff.  I just feel that.  I'm not in a smug, I'm right.  Come at me, man.  What are you going to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like it's the same reason I hate Wordle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It makes sense.  Wordle works on Chromebooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I will never know that.  Why do you hate Wordle?  I hate being spammed by all these people telling me, look, I can spell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you don't hate Wordle.  You hate Twitter.  See, this is the problem.  This is the problem.  He will defend to the death Twitter.  But this is really a Twitter problem, not a Wordle problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's the problem of Wordle sets up this function so that everybody shares it.  Like I should give a good rat's rump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do Wordle every day.  I don't share it on my Twitter.  Must be the people you're following.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I have jerks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everything on the web is shareable, sir.  Everybody on their web page has that little icon that says,  click here to share to Facebook or to Twitter or what have you.  It's a news story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fine.  But it's your stinky little word game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, look, this is another way to share it.  Here's somebody who's cross stitching her Wordle scores.  Look, she got that word in two notes.  That's hard to do.  I think that's luck if you get it in two words.  I really do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mr. Jarvis, do you think I play Wordle?  No.  Oh, actually I have, but no, because I didn't share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't share it.  I'm pretty proud of my Wordle score.  You don't share.  I don't share it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Whereas I don't play it.  Until I really played it maybe four times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All bad.  I never remember to play it.  I got other stuff going on in my brain.  Yeah, that's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've got a lot of life.  You know, just fine.  You want to do it.  You want to have orange juice breakfast.  You don't have to tell me every day.  It's like the old days of people.  People tell me, oh, bloggers just say what they have for breakfast.  Well, now everybody on Twitter just says, oh, I just played Wordle.  It's weird because everybody was talking about me.  You're all going to be replaced by an algorithm.  Artificial intelligence is smarter than all of you.  It's on GitHub now.  It can get the words faster.  Everybody's going to cheat.  It's over.  Wordle is already over.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Take my word for it.  What will we be talking about Wordle next month?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As in, everybody remember Wordle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Wordle's actually been around for months.  Because these fads, they don't go so quickly.  They do.  They do.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm an angry bird on Wordle.  I get up at four o'clock in the morning and I start reading and writing basically  and thinking and thinking a lot about words.  Jesus, farmer Mike.  And so I...  Those cats...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You milked cows too?  Those blog cats got to be milked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I...  Well, actually, as you know, Leo, I lived on a farm for the second year I worked at  Twit and sometimes...  He had a farm.  The farmers went on vacation and I literally got up at four o'clock in the morning to  milk the cow, to feed the pigs before coming in and doing TNT.  So that actually happened.  Don't recommend it.  But I checked out Wordle today.  I figured, wow, it must be fun.  Everybody's talking about it.  I went there and I'm like, I don't want to have to struggle with more words.  I do this from first thing in the morning to dinner time.  Yeah.  What's the right word?  That's what I do all day, every day.  It's like enough already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's a good question.  How many writers actually use...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually play Wordle?  I use Wordle because I do a lot of coding exercises.  So I don't want my brain to develop too big on one side.  I want it to the other side.  I'm trying to keep my lobes even.  You do it for vanity.  Yes.  I don't want to have a big bulge on one side, on the right side.  I should have something on the left side.  So that's why I do Wordle.  I crossword puzzles too.  I try to balance language and math.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apparently, I started playing at some point earlier today.  Oh, there you go.  I totally forgot about it.  There you go.  You didn't even finish.  You just got two words.  That just shows you how much I really care.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So will the Sonos be...  Will the Google devices be banned because of Sonos'  victory in the international trade war?  They're not banned.  They're just taking away things, right?  Yeah.  Well, Google's solution to this is to take away features.  So the final US ITC ruling last week, Google infringed on the Sonos patents,  but the ban will not...  They probably will not ban them because Google has gone into crisis mode and  stripping away features from their devices.  You can't set the volume now, for instance, remotely through a device.  On multiple ones, right?  On multiple devices, yeah.  Which makes me mad because I don't want to use a Sonos.  And the whole reason I was excited is I had the same...  I guess that's the point of the patent.  Yeah, I was going to say, have you met a patent, sir?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Our expert witness, Mr. Lepore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oops.  Little fuel in the fire there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why can't they just pay Sonos for the right...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's my question because Apple has many of the same features.  Apple must be licensing it.  Some type of license fee, right?  I guess Google doesn't want to do that.  I don't know.  It would set a precedent.  I don't know.  An open letter from the CEO of YouTube to the world's fact checkers.  I'm guessing you put this in, Jeff Jarvis.  No, two.  I didn't.  And it's an open letter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Two YouTubes from the world's fact checkers.  Now you see why I didn't put it up.  Because, oh no, we're going to do moral panic.  That's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Dear Ms. Susan Wojcicki.  They're worried that YouTube is promoting misinformation.  Yes.  Is there an organization of the fact checkers of America?  Oh, it's a fun...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can imagine what a fun convention that is.  Yes, there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think you had a ham sandwich for lunch.  Is that a ham sandwich?  I don't think there's any ham in that ham sandwich.  Look at all these organizations.  Africa Check, Animal Politico, Aus Fatos, Bolivia Verifica, Boom, Check Your Fact USA.  There's all of these checking organizations.  Yeah, they're big ones.  The Polish Demagogue Association,  Fact Check Ghana.  We have quite a few in the US because we got a lot of fake facts in the US.  My Go Pen, Taiwan.  All right.  Pravda in Poland.  I don't think it's the same Pravda.  I doubt it.  The Healthy Indian Project, FIP.  There's Pravda.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Trump's new social network is called Truth Social.  Would that be translated as Pravda?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I guess it would.  That's the word Pravda in Russian is truth.  Have I shown you the picture of five cats on a dish?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll be here all week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Dizzy McDishface, that's the name, the official name.  Perfect.  Perfect antenna.  Perfect antenna.  Did we do the worst of CES last week?  I think we did.  No, we did another show.  Oh, okay.  I do so many shows.  This is actually good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Last week we were talking with Ms. Geller, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kathy was great.  By the way, you're welcome.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And now I feel like ancillary copyright has become part of the English language.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Repeat after me.  Holy cow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We spent half an hour on ancillary copyright, Mike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo's sitting there thinking, how do I break into this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I literally am sitting here thinking, I don't want to break into it.  It's a very good conversation.  It was a good discussion.  But I also can feel people turning the...  This is from my radio days, turning off the radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was only 15 minutes for me, Leo, because I was listening at double speed.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Then it was faster that way.  So that's a good way to do it.  The worst of CES.  This is six right to repair advocates who assembled last Friday to present  repair.org's second annual worst in show awards, a selection of the least private,  least secure, least repairable, and least sustainable gadgets at CES.  Corey Doctorow was the host, perfectly appropriate.  He says, it's our job here today to talk about the hidden or maybe not so hidden and  completely foreseeable failure modes of these gadgets.  Award from the founder of iFixit, Kyle Weins, good friend of the network.  He gave the Mercedes EQS electric vehicle the award for worst product.  This is amazing.  Because you're not supposed to open the hood.  When you actually turn on the car, this shows up, Kyle posted this on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Notes on the hood.  Only the specialist personnel of a qualified specialist workshop should open the hood.  Access by the customer is not permitted.  Not permitted.  Not permitted to open the hood.  Consult a qualified specialist workshop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The reason they give, and I think this is not unfair, it's an electric vehicle and  there may be, you can get a shock.  You can shock yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a reason to buy the car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but I have to say, the only real car mishap I ever had was when my car had overheated  in the desert when I was a kid driving across country to go to college.  And I don't know why I decided to open the radiator cap.  That was a mistake.  What came out?  Steaming hot water in a gusher.  I managed to dodge it.  I didn't get burned, but that's an example of why you don't want to open the hood.  But you did have the right to open the hood.  I had the right to do it.  I had the right to hurt myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Didn't Rolls Royce used to lock the hood only to be opened by a qualified Rolls Royce person?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe, but if you're buying a Rolls Royce,  do you think you're really going to go check the oil yourself?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Probably not.  You've got Dijon mustard on your hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pardon me.  Do you have a dipstick I could borrow?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it turns out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dipsticks, I didn't know.  Was it Mercedes that piece?  Yeah.  That they got rid of the dipstick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's another thing.  This is not the first time Mercedes has gone in this road.  Wien noted a few years ago the company removed the dipstick from its C-class vehicles,  arguing that only an authorized technician should change the oil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the automotive equivalent of an audio jack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  Audio port.  Yes, maybe.  No dipstick for you.  Apparently, I've seen on a number of blogs and probably on Twitter,  it is possible to open the hood.  There's a secret handle that's covered.  You can remove the plastic and find the secret handle.  Cindy Cohn, the executive director of the Electric Chronic Fund Tier Foundation,  gave the award for the worst privacy,  and I wish Stacey were here for this,  to the Singled Smart Health Monitoring Light Bulb.  The light bulb.  This is a light bulb, says Cohn, that's supposed to be monitoring your health,  but really it's monitoring the humans in the room.  The light bulb could track your sleep, heart rate, body temperature,  and if you put a light bulb in every room all over the house,  this is one of the things she said where some people are like,  we can do this thing now, let's find a need for it.  And then I guess the need for it was in case grandma falls down, she said.  Of course, grandma has all sorts of other ways to tell you that she's fallen down  that are really only about surveilling her and that she can control,  as opposed to this one, which is outside of grandma's control.  Cohn said, the idea that you need a light bulb to monitor your heart rate  is just creepy, weird, and unnecessary.  And of course, they don't say what happens to the data.  They collect it.  Nathan Proctor, national campaign director for the public interest non-profit US Perg,  talked about the new Samsung TV that has its own NFT aggregation platform built in.  We did talk about that briefly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did we?  Yeah, we did talk about that briefly.  It's such a crock that it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A ginormous OLED Samsung TV.  What does it even mean?  You can use it to buy, sell, and display your NFT artwork.  Geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're going to have the wordled TV next.  It'll last about as long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's right.  Nathan says, if you don't know what an NFT is, I'm honestly jealous of your life.  Paul Roberts, founder of SecureRepairs.org,  chose John Deere's fully autonomous 8R tractor.  This actually was big news at CES, a tractor that you don't need to get into.  You could just get set it and go back to the house or milk your cows, as Mike does.  Yes.  Of course, he's criticizing it not because of known vulnerabilities,  but because of the way John Deere engages with the security community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's been a problem for many years because tractors are so automated.  This is another case where you're not allowed to look under hoods,  so to speak, of the electronics in their tractors.  This tractor, if John Deere's claims are correct, is really astonishing.  It'll literally drive itself out of the barn, down the public highway, to the field,  and then it will do all the work in the field perfectly, and then it can work 24 hours a day.  It's really an astonishing piece of equipment.  The problem is, of course, that it costs $900,000,  and farmers will have to go into debt, more debt, and then they won't be able to fix it  or do their own repairs, etc. Or it'll replace workers in corporate farms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, yes.  Some of these combines are so big, it's like a living room on wheels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're pretty fascinating when you see them in person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's also a nice tidbit about the John Deere tractor is that the remote  control for it is actually a phone app. They actually control it with a phone.  Remember the James Bond from 15 years ago, where he was controlling a car with his phone?  It's just like that. You can take remote control of the tractor with a phone,  and again, this thing is the size of a building. Then you can monitor what it's doing,  check its fuel, find out all the activities that it's doing. So it's pretty amazing.  It's a fundamental advancement in automated farming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Speaking of automated farming, here's a teenager, David Colombo, who has  took full remote control of over 20 Teslas in 10 countries, and there seems to be no way to  find the owners and report it to them. This is his tweet. He says, it's not a vulnerability in  Tesla's infrastructure, it's the owner's faults. He can remotely run commands on 25 plus Teslas in  13 countries without the owner's knowledge, including disabling sentry mode, opening the  doors or windows, starting keyless driving. I can query the exact location, see if a driver is  present, and so on. He could also play Rick Astley on their Teslas, and Rick Rollam. He says,  stop the cars or mess with the throttle or anything like this. I guess it has to do with  the app Tesla's security team is investigating. In fact, there is a CVE assigned. It's good that  it was this kid who discovered it, not a malicious hacker. It's a great plot for a cheesy, low-budget

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  B-movie where somebody gains access to 20 Teslas all in the same place and can drive them and has  a swarm of Teslas that terrorize little towns all over across the country. Auto-mates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Bloomberg interviewed him, verified it by seeing screenshots and documentation,  but he didn't want them to reveal the specifics because there isn't a fix out there yet.  But it basically involves an insecure way the software stores information that's needed to  link the cars to the programs. It's authentication tokens, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, but why does this young man know this?  Because he's a good little hacker boy. 19-year-old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wonder if I can get into these Tesla cars.  He's in information technology, security, specialist. Look, we shouldn't knock people  who do this as long as they do what he did, which is disclose responsibly.  Because the other option is somebody finds it who decides to play with these people  instead of going to Tesla and saying, he's a self-described Tesla fan. He lives in Germany.  He started coding when he was 10 years old, frustrated with high school coursework.  His father helped him petition German authorities to let him go to school  two days a week and spend the rest of his time expanding his cybersecurity skills.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that makes more sense now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tesla does have a bug bounty program.  Honestly, I know it's a little scary, but we should not condemn people who do this.  Thank God they do this. And as long as they responsibly disclose and reveal it,  they're making things better.  I agree.  Although it's embarrassing. I'm sure Tesla would be afraid to not tweet that.  It's a little embarrassing. Anyway, that's the right to repair worst of CES  for 2022. Oh, I didn't give you the worst in show overall, which Corey says was Lenovo's new smart  clock essential with Alexa. This is a device that you put next to your bed. He says that if you make  an unintelligible random sound, turns on and starts listening to everything you say. I think we have  one of these actually in our bedroom. Dr. O said, please, please, please, please, please,  close your wake by sticking your nose up your head in the air.  Oh, it's like the  question gaining information by calling one who knows where in your head and rejecting the  snapchat meter, these are all dead.  Hahahahaha  I've been a butler and open ears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Microphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I have a sleep.  No, that's the way that's the way Google's works.  I have the sleep, the sleep beauty rest sleep tracker, which is just a paddle underneath  the mattress. And I think it's using radio waves to see movement and so forth.  And I to say, oh, that's breathing.  Oh, that's heartbeats.  Oh, that's rolling over.  OK. Oh, that's a small animal.  Oh, that's four people in this bed.  That kind of thing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, Leo, you say who the hell cares?  You you have it in your bedroom and stuff like that.  But the difference is that you spend all day every day thinking about technology, learning,  you know, learning what's happening in technology.  You write code, you understand fully.  You are a full participant in this thing and you know what it's doing and you're OK with  it. The vast majority of the consumers of these devices have no idea.  And if they did really understand what was happening, they wouldn't like it.  Maybe that maybe that dislike is irrational, but they still wouldn't like it.  So that's the part of it.  I know people find it creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know. Is that is that is that a reasonable criterion, though, for  prohibiting technology? Oh, it's creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think I think that Google actually does it a lot better than Amazon does.  Google is very upfront about reminding users we're gathering this data.  We have your location history.  We here's here's a link to the page with all the stuff we're capturing.  Click here if you want to stop this.  Click here if you want to delete that.  They're very good at that. I'm not aware of much of that at all for Amazon, where  people are buying all these products.  You have a lot of third party products you use and people are installing them in  their cars, the bedrooms, et cetera.  And they don't Amazon seems like they don't really want people to know exactly  what they're doing. They probably don't want people to know.  What their robot is going to be doing in terms of mapping the house.  They don't want people to know what their flying security camera is doing in terms  of tracking things, recording video, uploading video and all that stuff.  They see it seems like they they're just hoping nobody will notice and nobody  will care. And I that really bothers me.  I would like a giant company like Amazon to be more responsible about it.  Do what you're going to do, but give everybody full disclosure and give them an  easy option to opt out for whatever their reasons are.  It's really none of Amazon's business what people's reasons are, whether it's  rational or not. People should know what the product does, and especially in terms  of recording conversations.  Remember the fire phone, the disastrous smartphone that Amazon came out with had  a single button. If you wanted to recognize a carton of milk and what the  company was or whatever, you'd pointed out and you push the button.  And when you did that, it recorded audio, 15 seconds of audio and uploaded that  audio. So people are thinking I'm taking a picture, but it was capturing  everything you were saying unnecessarily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And was that that was probably a bug, not well, it was a it was a bug in

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Amazon's culture. That's my point.  They just don't care about that stuff as much as they should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I guess I mean, I feel like I'm being made to feel guilty for not really caring  if somebody hears me snoring or, you know, I mean, it's like, but you know what

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's doing and you agree to it.  And that's fine. I'm in the same.  Yeah, I agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Amazon should have more clear.  I have literally in my bedroom an Amazon device, a Google device and an Apple  Siri HomePod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're all bored to tears.  Somewhere each of those companies, somebody say, would Leo finally do something

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  interesting?  Even if even if Lisa and I had a fight or I said, I just want to let you know,  Lisa, just between you and me, I'm going to murder Jeff Jarvis tomorrow.  Even if even if that I don't think there's plenty of cause.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, it's like, who cares?  And if in fact, I did murder you and the police got a hold of that, they would  rightly put me in jail and that would be good because I should go to jail for  murdering you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But there are people who know as much as you do who oppose it.  And I understand that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's my problem is their opposition is limiting what I can do.  So it's it's fine for everybody to make that judgment and not.  And I know lots of people, including people on the show, refuse to have these  devices in their house.  That's fine.  But but I don't want some moral pan.  Oaks.  I'm sorry.  I knew you were headed there.  Yeah.  God damn it.  You got me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got me.  Win a free Amazon Echo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a game we're playing to see if they can get me to say it.  And I lost.  No, I don't.  I don't want somebody else's, you know, kind of nebulous, creepy fear to stop the  technologies that I think might be useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree.  And I that's why I say that it's about disclosure.  They should do all the things we're doing.  But have you be able to go?  Nope, I don't want.  I mean, like what Apple did recently with the tracking thing for third party apps,  they have a new feature where it said when you install a new app, it says this  app would like to track you across the Internet.  You want to reject that and you just click one button and you're out.  That's right.  Yeah, that's the way to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think, you know, I got to point out that that Apple button is  meaningless, that Apple is simply turning off the Apple ID for advertisers.  And there's plenty of other ways to track you across the Internet.  So in a way, that's a kind of a misleading switch.  There's ways for Apple to track you, but not the little app.  Google could track you.  I mean, there's there's lots of ways to track you that don't require IDFA.  And I think Apple knows that.  And I think Apple's a little cynical saying, look, see, we care about your privacy.  Yes.  Yeah, there's double dealing there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but I mean, there are so many stories about flashlights that were  uploading data to China and stuff like that, that's like, well, that's not right.  I wish I would have had the option to say no to that kind of thing.  Yeah, but I don't know.  Yeah, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And everybody always says, oh, you're you're in the privileged position.  Blah, blah, blah. That's fine.  Yes. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. Well, I mean, the thing as a journalist working with, you know,  confronting all the different tech companies about privacy issues,  Amazon is the worst.  I mean, they they they just stonewall you if they don't want to talk about it.  They they're very cagey. They're very secretive.  They're very problematic in terms of their relationship to the press.  Google is one of the best companies in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wish Amazon be better.  I think Amazon sidewalk, for instance, is a really cool technology,  which is a nonstarter because people because people don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it's payable. It's PR.  It could be. It could be so easily, which is Mike's point.  It could be so easily fixed.  They can fix it. It's just PR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, always. Yeah.  But they yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Mike's point to is right. It's also about culture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  Yep. Move fast. Break things.  All right. Let's take a quick break.  Our episode this week brought to you by this is a new sponsor.  Want to welcome New Relic.  Not a new name, I think, probably to most people listening.  If you're a software engineer, you know, you've heard and I hope you've tried.  If you haven't, I want you to know you can try it for free forever.  You don't even have to give them a credit card.  New Relic. What is it?  Oh, I'm glad you asked.  New Relic instruments your entire stack so that when you get that three a.m.  phone call, something's gone wrong and the app isn't working.  You don't have to scramble around calling people,  dreading the call from the CEO.  What's going on?  You can immediately fix it.  You've we've all been there.  If you're a software engineer, a network engineer, a sysadmin,  you know, you're fast asleep.  Phone rings three in the morning.  Something's broken. Something's wrong.  The server is not working. The app's not working.  You're going, what is it? Is the back end?  Is the front end? Is it global? Is it the server?  Is it the network?  Is the cloud provider? Do I have slow running queries?  Oh, God, did I push a bug in my last deploy?  Oh, my God. The whole team's scrambling.  They've got all these different tools they're trying.  They're messaging each other like crazy to find and fix the issue.  Now, if you had New Relic, like all these companies do,  you wouldn't have that problem.  You'd go to the source, you'd fix it, you'd go back to bed.  Sad thing is, and this is a new we had a great conversation with New Relic.  They told me half of organizations, only half have are implementing  observability for the networks and systems.  Only half. That means the other half are getting up at three in the morning  and scrambling like crazy people.  The report shows that maintaining network  observability continues to be an issue for companies around the world.  It shouldn't be. It will not happen.  Just get New Relic.  New Relic combines 16 different monitoring products,  things you might put together yourself separately.  But as a whole, they give you complete  observability across your entire software stack in one place.  Of the 16 tools, there's application monitoring.  There's an APM, which you could put in your apps or your microservices  It even, it even, it can give you the line of code.  It could say, it knows the symbol table.  Say, this function's breaking.  This database query is frozen.  That kind of thing.  Use Kubernetes. You'll love Pixie.  Gives you instant Kubernetes observability and then availability.  Distributed tracing.  See all your traces without management headaches  so that you can find and fix issues fast.  There's network performance monitoring so you don't have to guess  where the issues are.  Ditch those data silos for a system-wide correlated view and so much more.  Pinpoint issues down the line of code.  So you know exactly why the problem happened.  You can fix it and fix it right.  That's why all these companies, the devs and ops teams at DoorDash  and GitHub and Epic Games, 14,000 other companies  use New Relic to debug and improve their software.  It's not just for Ruby anymore.  New Relic is amazing.  It does everything.  Whether you run a cloud-native startup or a Fortune 500 company,  it takes five minutes to set up New Relic in your environment.  That 9 p.m. call is just waiting to happen.  That could happen tonight.  So don't wait. Get New Relic now.  You'll be able to set it up fast.  You can get access to the entire platform and 100 gigabytes a month of data free forever.  No credit card. You don't even have to give them a credit card.  You'll have it set up in five minutes.  You can go to bed tonight and sleep through the night.  You'll love it.  Sign up right now.  New Relic dot com slash twig.  There is zero reason why you should be in mystery the next time you get that.  The servers are down.  N-E-W-R-E-L-I-C.  New Relic dot com slash twig.  I know a lot of people rely on New Relic.  And if you're not, why not?  New Relic dot com slash twig.  E3, by the way, is a great service.  E3, by the way, has announced that they're not going to have an in-person event this year because of Omicron.  E3 is in the spring?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's Los Angeles, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, LA's locked down. California got heavy lockdown all of a sudden.  There is, I did see a group of people come back from CES with the vid, with the rona.  Paying them a visit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For all the number of people who got sick with something is way down this year.  I mean, every year in the past, it was a super spreader event of every flu and virus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, God, everybody goes home sick, right?  Yeah.  I actually beat it the last time.  We were there two years ago and I almost washed my hands raw.  This is before COVID, but I washed my hands at every opportunity and that actually helped a lot.  Yeah.  If I'd known about it, I would have worn a mask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're going to see masks at CES from now on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Masks everywhere. Why not?  We've learned about masks. We now know that you need a good N95, you need a good seal.  We kind of know how to wear them. Why not?  Wash your hands.  70 South Korean attendees at CES have tested positive now for COVID-19.  I think this is just the beginning.  Just the beginning. 70 cases.  That's because they test in South Korea.  Samsung, SK, Hyundai, Heavy employees are testing positive.  South Korean health officials are turning and urging anyone who went to CES to get a PCR test.  Nevada says no evidence linking that surge with CES.  Oh, jeez.  Tip the y'all went to CES.  Okay, fine.  Fine. South Korea was doing a good job and had really cut down.  That's why they're very aware of all of this.  Many Korean business people who attended CES are now confirmed to be infected with COVID-19,  said a senior South Korean health ministry official.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I really feel like Omicron is, you know, it's really slipping past a lot of the mitigations  and your best bet is just to be vaccinated so that if you get it, you don't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think we're all going to get it.  And yeah, and if you're vaccinated and boosted, I think the boosting is pretty important.  My kids both got it. They're both vaccinated.  They were fine. I mean, you know, they got it. They were unhappy.  They didn't have to go to the hospital.  I think Jennifer got it too. Their mom got it too.  But again, boosted, didn't have to go to the hospital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm debating. My 95-year-old father has an appointment tomorrow.  He gets back-to-generation shots in his eye twice a month.  And the place is always crowded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And, you know, I don't know.  Yeah, that's the other...  I mean, I'm really trying hard not to have a heart attack  because this would be a bad time, wouldn't it?  Right. You schedule that for later.  I'll schedule that for later, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's amazing. I mean, I've been this last year...  Well, last year, went to Europe three times, went to Mexico like six or seven times.  And I've never gotten COVID. It's astonishing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Me neither. But I think that this is a different beast now, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so. And really, that's the future because it's going to become endemic.  It's going to be floating around.  People are going to die from COVID every year from now on.  Tens of thousands of people will die from COVID.  Just as they do with the flu.  60,000 people a year die of the flu.  And there's going to be new shots every year, every two years, whatever it is.  And that's just life now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But let's not get too cavalier about...  I mean, the people I know who have long-haul...  There's not long-haul flu, but there is long-haul COVID.  People I know two years in.  We just don't know.  At Omicron, it's too new to know what the impact is going to be.  So it's still freaky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Was it you who put this story in about the guy's genitals shrinking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did I put that in there?  No, I'm sorry.  I put it in my Twitter feed.  Oh, that's where I saw it.  So here's the funny thing.  So I'm checking Australian news sites constantly because I want to see what's going on with Novak Djokovic.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Boy, what a horrible story that is.  Geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I put up this thing from news.com.au, which is the Murdoch portal.  Man's penis shrinks after COVID diagnosis.  Now, go to the other one first.  It's in a thread.  So it gets better when he says it was his above-average manhood.  It was above average, man.  Right, which strikes me as this is a reference to the George on Seinfeld.  Shrinkage.  COVID is the new shrinkage.  Shrinkage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was above average, I swear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The best part is doctors warn it will likely be permanent.  That's Rupert right there in a nutshell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's basically the opposite of long COVID, if you know what I mean.  Short COVID.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm so glad Stacey's not here.  What do you think of this?  I don't know what I think of this.  I saw this in the New York Times.  A 22-year-old actor, he came to New York City from a small town in Georgia,  tick-tocked like crazy about his tiny apartment, how he came to New York to achieve his dreams of stardom on Broadway.  Said, I'm going to be, tomorrow I'm auditioning for a Juilliard School's undergraduate drama program,  one of the most prestigious acting schools in the world.  He does a live stream when he gets the verdict from Juilliard after his audition,  reads it aloud for his audience of 2.4 million followers on TikTok.  It was a rejection.  You are no longer under consideration for admission for fall 2022, he read.  This is New York Times.  Mr. Weber looked crestfallen.  Now we're going to have to find a different way to be an actor.  Thanks for watching the journey.  The next night, tens of thousands of fans flooded Juilliard's Instagram account to express their anger.  You are so done for not getting Axel in.  21,000 likes on that comment.  Users started the hashtag justice for Axel.  Left more than a thousand one-star reviews of Juilliard on Google,  tanking the school's search results with negative reviews.  Some fans spoke of planning an in-person protest at Juilliard's campus.  Weber, by the way, to his credit, is not encouraging it.  He says, I do appreciate all the responses, but people are absolutely tearing them to shreds.  I'm grateful. We don't have to bash Juilliard.  I want to spread positivity.  Maybe he had something to do with all of the TikToking, right?  He was working as a bouncer at a pirate-themed restaurant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I love the pirate theme. It's just perfect.  That's just the greatest touch.  I, I, probably what he wanted for his audition.  Arr!  He probably played a pirate.  I'm the pirate! That's all I know now.  I have a monologue.  I'd like to share with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's too bad he got rejected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But again, if he didn't fit what they were looking for, he didn't fit. It happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was going to apply to Juilliard, but I saw they only had two stars.  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they've really gone downhill.  They only accept 20 kids a year. It's not a big program.  Does not mean that he is not, you know, he's just not right or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He didn't fit what they were looking for at that particular time.  That happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Two million followers, including many influential content creators.  It looks like he's in LA now. He'll do just fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's hilarious is like, oh, I'll have to find another way to be an actor.  He said to more people than saw the last, you know, the last James Bond movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're on fire, Mike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true.  He, anyway, so that's, I don't know.  Is this good or bad or is there anything to say about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is bad if Juilliard comes back and says, hey, you know what?  We made a mistake.  That would be bad.  You're hired.  That's, that's, that, that would, I would have a problem with that because that means they only reacted because of some fans on a social media platform made them look bad.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He does now have a talent manager in Los Angeles, Diomi Cordero, who also represents an actor on Euphoria.  I think he's probably going to find.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was a series of stories a few years ago about how, you know, Hollywood TV shows and Hollywood studios wanted to get in on this whole influencer thing.  So they thought, oh, we'll, we'll bring in some YouTube, you know, influencers and have them be have a guest spot on our show.  And so they would send, you know, they'd send a note to the influencer saying, hey, you know, we have a huge opportunity for you.  Finally, you're going to make it big and you can be on our show.  And they, and they, they get a reply from the agent saying, well, Mr.  So-and-so or Ms.  So-and-so is willing to do that under the following conditions.  They need $10 million and they need their own trailer and they need it because the power was really at that point with the influencers and Hollywood hadn't gotten the memo.  So the. Yeah.  So it was like it was really the YouTube influencer doing a favor to the TV studio.  They didn't get it.  They thought they were doing them a favor.  Exactly.  So I think, you know, I think this guy's already got his medium.  I agree.  Clearly, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tick tock is kind of amazingly powerful.  It really is interesting.  Yeah.  Get ready.  Android 12 L beta two is rolling out for Pixel phones.  That means if I'm saying that it must be time for the.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  In fairness, there's no way to see that.  That was really mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's somebody taking a little break thinking I'm going to have a catch you a pepe puff.  He's going to do another story before I have to worry.  I waited until John got up and started to walk away.  And then I did it.  Of course, I was very mean.  I was very mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's really edgy.  Enjoyed it.  Way too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just kind of, you know, I can blame it's all I blame the no tropics.  That's what's that's what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google is still not still no word.  I keep checking my pixel every day.  Still no update.  You know, you are joined now by Marquez Brownlee, who said that his aunt hates his Pixel 6.  He says super buggy.  Marquez says I'm taking the SIM out.  This thing is gotten bugger and bugger and I'm putting it back into my Samsung S21 because I can't I can't use it.  I haven't had the same problems, but maybe there's hardware issues or it's clearly for me is clearly software.  I don't think it's a hardware problem.  I think it's the OS and it's so annoying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The little things that I do, I hit the back button and I get a message from the software.  The little things that I do, I hit the back button and the screen goes back three times, two or three times.  Versus some like software.  Bluetooth still just randomly drops in the middle of me listening to the audio book that we're going to discuss in the club.  But club and how does the fingerprint reader work for you?  That's been that's OK.  It's definitely not as good as the hardware button.  I just have to tell myself really press because it doesn't work if I don't really press on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, because I reason I ask is Mary Jo Foley also uses a Pixel 6 Pro says it just doesn't work at all for her.  But I think she may.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I have a screen protector on too.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's Marquez's tweet.  My Pixel 6 Pro has slowly gotten so buggy since launch I can no longer recommend it at nine hundred dollars.  Combined with the latest botched update, it's just been a bad experience.  My Sim is back in an S21 Ultra till the next review.  Oh, wow.  That's pretty harsh.  And he has a lot.  He carries a lot away.  He's not a tick tock star or anything like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But he has also been one to bat Google's Pixel projects too.  You know, this isn't just sour grapes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He says lots of small annoying things.  The display constantly drops way below 120 hertz.  The fingerprint sensor is still slower than the rest.  The lock screen and auto brightness bug out all the time.  Now the camera app has started slowing down.  Why that's sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Camera did slow down for me.  Part of my pick of the week, which we'll get into later, I was out on a shoot using the camera and it was a bit slow that day.  And I'm thinking, what is wrong?  I thought it was just me, but I noticed it was a little bit laggy between making the contact with the shutter and even navigating through the files.  But yeah, it all seems like software to me, not hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He says he's on the November patches, as most of us are, except for those unfortunate few who got the update by accident or early and lost all connectivity.  That borked it more.  That borked it even more.  Anyway, they're doing the 12L Beta 2 right now, which means we might be getting close.  They had said it'll be delayed.  You know, the update, which supposedly will fix many of these issues, was supposed to be released in December.  It'll be delayed.  They say there'll be one more beta next month before the consumer release.  What?  In Q1 March?  That's ridiculous.  Oh my gosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what?  I'm starting to agree with you, Mike.  Sundar Pichai.  Not doing the job.  Somebody needs to take the control of that company.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Say, look, folks, we got a big OS right now with an expensive piece of hardware that people can't enjoy.  We need to fix this.  It's our flagship.  It's already gone through testing before we released it.  So yeah, this needs to be priority one.  You know, maybe Rick Osterloh lost his mojo or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know.  12L is not the PixelFix.  Sorry.  OK.  12L is something else.  Sorry.  That's coming out.  I don't know when the PixelFix is coming out.  Here's what Google is changing to speaker group controls and device setup to appease Sonos.  The first change applies when setting up and updating your smart display or speaker.  A small set of users will need to use the device utility app to complete product installation and updates.  Geez, Louise.  You may receive a prompt to download and run Dua, and it will ensure your device is connected to Wi-Fi and receives the most updated version.  It only has to be used once during the initial setup of devices that don't have the latest.  I get it.  The non-infringing firmware.  So the Dua will immediately fix your firmware to be non-infringing, and then you'll now have to adjust each speaker individually instead of being able to use the group volume control.  That was a nice feature.  I remember on my Sonos speakers, one slider would turn everybody in the whole house up and down.  It's not so bad.  You're going to get, this is an example on the screen, a number of sliders, and you can control those.  Third party devices have to be updated to new cast firmware.  Besides the volume change, Google says speaker group functionality remains the same.  Most speaker groups should continue to function as expected, unless you have a speaker group containing other brands of cast based devices like JBL or Lenovo, then they need to be on 1.5, 2.27, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, or higher cast firmware, blah, blah, blah.  So, you know, the trade commission ruled against him, said we're not going to ban your devices, but you better fix this.  And this is the fix.  The Pixel Launcher at a glance widget.  If you are using a Pixel phone is going to have doorbell camera previews.  This is also part of the Android 12 update.  You'll be able to customize the at a glance widget and even look at that.  Even have a little picture on the at a glance.  Yeah, right there.  If somebody your doorbell, that's kind of cool.  Yeah, sure.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Whoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It means nothing if the existing platform isn't working.  I think you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's not worry so much about that.  Let's get the thing working.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And phone fix people.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is good.  You may remember that Google started doing system patches to Android through Google Play Store updates because they could push those without the carrier blocking them.  They could push them to older phones and so forth.  So now they're finally, and they never did this, giving you a log of what's been changed when you get the Play System update.  Just as you do when you get a version update.  Now you can go and click the Google Play System update and it will tell you you can manually update, but it also tell you what is happening.  There's a new support page that spells out what's new in the patches.  Here's the January 22nd.  2022, I should say, patch the critical fixes.  And here's the Play Store.  Play as you download feature.  So this is one way Google is updating phones that are not part of the monthly security update.  So that's good to get that information.  Now available on your phone and also online.  And finally, Google launches Ripple.  An open standard that could bring tiny radars to Ford cars.  So I didn't know this, but Google has been building radar chips for about seven years.  That's what tells you how you sleep.  That radar in my paddle.  Not that paddle.  The other paddle, the sleep paddle under my bed.  You can control.  Wait, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want a diagram of all the electronics in your bedroom.  Just stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where do you put your paddle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anyway, in the basement, of course.  Oh, yeah.  The dungeon.  Well, you got to.  OK, so you have one in the dungeon, but you might need one.  There might be discipline needed at other times.  I'm just saying you can control.  The company's solely radar.  That's the solely, of course, was in the last Pixel phones.  That's the one where you could go like this to your phone and make it do things.  Now there is an open source API standard.  If Stacey were here, she could probably explain this, called Ripple,  that will basically put solely in S.O.L.I. in automobiles and other things.  Ripple, quote, this is from Ivan Puparev, the man who, I think, was the first person  Ivan Puparev, the man who led the team at Google's ATAP skunkworks that came up with S.O.L.I.,  Puparev says, Ripple will unlock helpful innovation that benefits everyone.  General purpose radar is a key emerging technology for solving critical use cases in a privacy respecting way.  The Ripple project is open source on GitHub.  Oh, well, maybe not. It's copyright. But it is on GitHub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I thought it's open source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it depends on what you define as open source.  Publishing the source does not necessarily make it open source. It's the license that matters.  It's open source-ish.  You have to sign a Google open source license agreement to participate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A couple of things. When they first rolled out S.O.L.I., they were talking about a very sophisticated technology that could detect the finest movements.  They were promising that someday Google would have S.O.L.I. on smartwatches and you'd be able to change the time by just moving your fingers ever so slightly.  I love that. Oh, yeah, I remember that.  But it could be a problem in a car if it's implemented and somebody accidentally flips somebody off and then that's perceived as a gesture for turning the radio on full blast or something like that.  I don't know. I'm not sure how this is going to be implemented.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ford would not tell the Verge what it plans to do with S.O.L.I. but only that it's looking at using, quote, interior radar to do things its exterior radars aren't doing today.  What could that be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, people should know that the self-driving cars of the future will have as many sensors pointing at the dash as there are sensors outside the world.  How come?  Because a big part of how they'll function is they'll constantly be detecting emotions, stress, conflict.  They really want to see who's in the car so they can customize information settings in the seats and all that kind of stuff.  So there's a huge amount of effort in Silicon Valley to build up all these sensors.  They want to see if even before the self-driving cars are self-driving, want to make sure that if people are falling asleep or if they're drunk, they want to be able to tell all that through sensors so they can turn on or turn off certain safety features, certain self-driving features.  And so this it looks like Google has decided to jump into that existing nascent market with an existing technology.  It was originally promised for smartphones and wearables.  So that basically appears to be what this is.  And they, you know, they talk they don't talk so much about super future stuff because they want to get in early.  There are certain startups that specialize in this kind of thing that are kind of gobbling up all those things.  They specialize in this kind of thing that are kind of gobbling up all the mindshare for car makers.  But so I think Google wants to sort of get in there and establish themselves as a technology that car makers want to use and build into their cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not just car makers.  There's like pet chip, pet collar chip makers that want to measure your dog's internals like blood, you know, pressure and heart rate and temperature with one of these things.  The Amazon's apparently looking into bed sensors to measure sleep.  So lots of uses for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's actually the fact is that with AI and increasingly better sensors, everything and anything, including as we learned light bulbs, will be able to detect state of being in multiple ways.  And this is especially going to be true inside cars and in our homes and our desks and so on, but especially in cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's another company, Blumio, has a dev kit for a radar based blood pressure sensor.  So that's interesting.  So there's going to be a lot of health implications as well.  So good.  Solely's not dead.  It was a cool technology.  The Pixel 4 did not show it off well.  Nobody used it.  And so they took it out.  But I think there are lots of uses for it.  And now it's called Ripple.  And that's the Google change.  Couple more stories before we get to our picks of the week.  The Associated Press is going to sell NFTs.  Now that makes them totally uncool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so nobody's going to do them anymore.  But when I was a kid, I wanted to wear a Nehru jacket.  My parents wouldn't let me.  And Johnny Carson wore it.  OK, now you can wear it.  Johnny's wearing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You probably put this in New York Times by the way.  And New York Times buys the Athletic.  What is the Athletic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Athletic is a fellow non-jock here.  It is kind of the major brand for a paywalled service covering major sports.  Ant can probably tell us more about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you subscribe to the Athletic, Ant?  I do not because it was paywalled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh.  Right.  Ant is also not an athletic supporter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I paid for a few things and that wasn't one.  No.  Of 1.2 million subscribers, what it tells me is that the Times is going to create a  whole bunch of subscription products.  When they were there, how many subscribers did they have?  8 million subscribers.  That counts separately but included in one bucket.  The new subscribers, the food subscribers, and the puzzle subscribers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I subscribe to New York Times Crossword Puzzles, New York Times Cooking, a wire cutter,  a wire cutter has a subscription, right?  And then in the newspaper.  I think though I buy one subscription that covers it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the point here is that if all you subscribe to is food, you are counted as a New York  Times subscriber.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, why not?  That is his revenue for the New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think what they did was they got a million too added in.  And so my friend Aaron Pilhoffer who is at Temple University, who is brilliant, actually  New York Times ex-guardian wrote this piece that I have in there saying that this is dangerous  for local newspapers.  There has been a lot of debate about this.  Does this mean the Times is going to come after the local newspapers?  And if you subscribe to The Chronicle just because you want Giants coverage, you say  well screw it, I'll do the New York Times and the Athletic because they offered me a  bundle deal and I don't like the local papers and that's it.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is what has happened in cable television.  All the cable companies including NFox and others have created sports channels where  they do local sports in direct competition to the local channels.  And they furthermore they cover local sports probably better in more detail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was going to say I have enjoyed that bit of a pivot myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It has been good for sports fans, absolutely.  Can you get Clemson games here?  Probably through a...  I do.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Streaming or...  That sounded like you didn't want to confess something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I haven't.  No, I'm saying I haven't missed a beat.  What is it?  FS1 I believe is how it is.  Yeah, Fox Sports 1.  And it's been great to be able to see the regional stuff.  I know no one over here cares about App State University but I'm curious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's the idea with the Athletic, right?  You've got 270 teams, 47 markets.  You get local coverage and I think that could be a threat to The Chronicle and other local  newspapers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it came also when it started, they said, and they did this, we're going to steal all  the best sports writers from all the newspapers in the country.  They did.  They got them.  And then they built a subscription product.  I don't understand this, maybe Ant, maybe you can explain this to me.  ESPN as I understand it has kind of been on somewhat of a downward slope but I don't understand  why that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because ESPN has been sensationalizing things that shouldn't necessarily be sensationalizing  in my opinion.  There's a lot of what they call them top plays that are nothing and they just play it over  and over and over and over again and it's not connecting to the true sports fans.  It's more generalized.  It's link-based.  Basketball is a great game but not everything in basketball is a slam dunk.  And that's what ESPN has been doing for the last several years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's really true.  I never even thought of that but it takes away from the idea of there's a strategic  hole, there's a plan, there's a way a team plays.  You're just focusing on that one shot.  I never thought of that but that really does take it away.  YouTube TV has this feature.  I was working on Sunday during the big Niners game, the last game of the season where they  had to beat the Rams to get in the playoffs.  Play LA.  But when you go home and watch YouTube TV it has the key plays and there's 49 of them  which shows you what a crazy game it was.  So Lisa and I sat down because she didn't watch it either.  It was too stressful for her.  We sat down and watched the 49 plays.  But it's completely out of context.  It's actually not a very satisfying experience.  You're seeing the touchdowns and the great passes and stuff but it's like boom, boom,  boom, boom, boom.  You get the shape of the game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't have a problem with highlights but I think there's a nuanced way of doing highlights  to report the story of okay, team A played team B and team A was down for a little bit  but team A was able to prevail and win the game.  I think there's a nice way of doing that and not just having every single thing shown be  a touchdown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think there are a number of factors here.  One of them is sports betting.  Yeah, there's that.  Because it gets to the point where all you care about is the over-under.  What's the score?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the other point of this purchase is that the athletic has been pure subscription  revenue, no advertising.  The New York Times can bring advertising to it but what's the big advertising in sports?  In the old newspaper days it was tires.  Now it's sports betting.  It's gambling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And how much does the New York Times want to be known for betting?  I think concerning they take a cut of sports betting.  So suddenly they're profiting based on the take.  Which I think is complete.  Let's put Pete Rose in the Hall of Fame in that case.  Right.  Same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's completely...  Well here in New York, because New York just opened up sports betting online, Caesar's  has been advertising like crazy and you see players in the ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, same thing.  Yeah, well that's all gone.  This is more of the, you know, we're old timers.  The world has changed.  So I got a question for you, all three of you.  We've been approached by a sports betting, very big name, group to do advertising.  And I said no.  Should I say yes to that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why not?  Well, I don't look at it any differently from us talking about crypto because that's a bit of a gamble.  We do some crypto ads, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, we don't do ads specifically for crypto but there's a credit card with crypto, rewards.  I think we have Coinbase.  So yeah, we have some crypto on here.  And for a while I was a little funny about that.  We don't do e-cigs.  I don't know, it's a little weird.  I mean, what do you think, Mike?  Should I...  Am I being old fashioned?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I think you called it.  I mean, I've always loved your advertising because they're actually really great products.  And I basically, I think I've bought every single thing you've advertised that a person who doesn't have a house could possibly buy.  He's gotten me like that too.  Yeah, and so it's like, so there's stuff where it's like, yeah, I want that.  I know I want that.  And there are other things where it's like, well, I don't know if I want it or not, but if it's being advertised on Twitter, then I probably do want it.  So I'll just get it.  And if you veer off into, you know, I think a lot of tech people are like me, which is that not interested in sports.  A lot of tech people are interested in sports, of course, but I don't know.  It just seems like it's a detour from the policy that has worked very well, at least for me as a consumer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, because advertising has been a little scant in our natural environs, we've been willing to, you know, people still give me a hard time about doing manscaping ads.  But so I accept ads in a broader range of categories than we thought we would just to keep the lights on.  Yeah, keep the lights on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But see, when you do manscaping ads, you're going after really, really good products.  So I don't know anything about sports betting or any of that world at all.  If it's a superior product or if it's, you know, something like that, if you personally would use it or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't like to, I feel like, I think my personal philosophy is gambling is a sucker's bet.  And I don't, I think I don't want to promote, I wouldn't take lottery tickets either.  That's the problem. I'm the same way with lottery.  And yet, I mean, I don't want to be, I'm not, it's not a moral judgment. I just, I don't know. I had to really think about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it is a regressive redistribution of wealth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But so is everything.  I would like to redistribute some wealth myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like I said, the same can be said about the stock market.  The same could be said about crypto. It's all gambling in a certain way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is. And so it's a, it's a, you know, it's a challenge, you know, it's a, yeah.  Not to mention the fact that my wife is, runs the business and sells the advertising.  So I have to deal with, deal with her when I say no.  So that was another gamble.  Yeah. She's actually really supportive. She, you know, she said, well, you don't want to do this to you.  I said, no, we were, we were in agreement on that. So, yeah.  Let's take a little break. Final words, your picks of the week.  Thank you so much for being here, Mike. I really appreciate your filling in on last, last minute notice.  It's always great to have you on. Really appreciate it.  I want to tell you about Codecademy, by the way.  I know a lot of people ask me how I want to get into coding. It's one of my passions. I love it. It's my hobby.  And they say, where's a good way to do it? I think Codecademy is a great way, whether you want to become a programmer.  And if it's a really good place, if you want to get a new career as a programmer, you're just getting out of school and you want to brush up your skills.  But it's also a great place. I've taken their classes just to kind of learn a new language or brush up.  They've got some, they actually have some really great, what do they call them? I can't remember, but the little cards with the reference cards and stuff like that.  There's lots of great tools. Codecademy is a great place to learn to code.  There's never been a better time to become a programmer. With Codecademy, you can code in your own terms.  Over 50, this is an amazing number, 50 million people already know Codecademy is the best way to learn to code.  That's because Codecademy not only teaches you job ready coding skills, it helps you build unique projects for your portfolio.  That's very important. Earn certificates. That's also important. Even prep for technical interviews.  One of the things I love about Codecademy is your coding from day one.  And they have classes, I've taken their Python classes, but they have classes in HTML, CSS.  They've got a whole new Swift track. If you want to learn to write for the most popular smartphone platform, Swift is a great language.  Apple's all Swift now. With Codecademy, you can learn at your own pace.  It's a great way to get qualified for jobs that are in high demand, whether it's building basic websites, to artificial intelligence, to robotics, and everything in between.  You don't need to be experienced. You can start from zero and you will literally be with your very first day writing real working code in minutes.  And I think that's very important. When you hit that submit button, you'll know immediately. Instant feedback.  Did your code work? Why not? You get feedback so that you get on the right track.  SQL, JavaScript, I mentioned Python, HTML. Here's a great way to start. Go right now to Codecademy.com.  C-O-D-E-C-A-D-E-M-Y.com. Use the promo code twig so they know you saw it here.  They have a little programming personality quiz, which is nice because it's not like testing you for math.  It's merely asking you how you think, what you like, and it will help you decide what area to go into.  When Lisa did it, it knew immediately she's a numbers person. They said, you should learn R, you should learn statistics. You'd be good at this.  They said, I should get into computer science and algorithms. They're absolutely right. Absolutely right. That's my passion.  So the course recommendations after you take the quiz will be based on things that you're interested in. It's really cool.  It's an interactive platform, as I mentioned, you're going to learn by doing. You can build your portfolio.  When you build those projects, it's great to get them up on GitHub. People really do look and see what have you done to see if they want to hire you.  You'll also get a certificate of completion. You can put that in your LinkedIn portfolio or your resume.  It's a great way to get a dream job in web development, programming, computer science, data science, tons more.  And it's just a lot of fun. I really think they've nailed this platform.  Join over 50 million people learning to code with Codecademy. See where coding can take you.  You can get 15% off your Codecademy Pro membership. Just go to Codecademy.com. Use the promo code twig.  You'll get 15% off Codecademy Pro and we'll get the little pat on the head from sending you there.  And that's important to us. So please, Codecademy.com. Promo code twig.  Codecademy.com. Great way to learn how to code. Best thing you'll ever learn. I got to tell you. So much fun.  Let's see. Have I told you the story of the LAPD cops who instead of answering a radio call to a robbery in progress at a local mall decided to play Pokemon Go?  Have I told you that story? This happened in 2017, but they appealed it saying, hey, this digital in-car video system, which caught our comments and conversation, shouldn't be used against us.  So they...  It's a privacy case.  Yeah, it's a privacy case. California Appeals Court upheld the firings from four years ago. So, you know, I guess it is a privacy thing.  But on the other hand, I think public safety officers, we make them wear body cams. There's good reasons for that. And honestly, there was a little malfeasance here.  They were on a patrol when a radio call to respond to a robbery in progress with several suspects at a Macy's in the Crenshaw Mall came in.  They told their supervisor they didn't hear the call, but the recording showed they ignored attempts to reach them. This is from the actual court ruling that came down this week.  After communications made a second attempt to contact petitioners, Officer Lozano asked if they should ask communications if there's a message.  Officer Mitchell replied, well, it's up to you. Whatever you think. I don't want them to think we're not paying attention to the radio.  Lozano responded, screw it.  Officer Mitchell alerted Lozano that Snorlax, a Pokemon Go character, had just popped up at 46th and Laymart.  We have private...  All units, all units. Snorlax, 46th and Laymart.  After noting that Laymart doesn't go all the way up to 46th, Lozano said, oh, you know what I can do? I'll go down 11th and swing up on Crenshaw. I know a way I can get to it.  Mitchell suggested a different route, told Lozano, we got four minutes. For approximately the next 20 minutes, the in-car video system captured petitioners discussing Pokemon as they drove to different locations where the virtual characters apparently appeared on their mobile phones.  On the way to their Snorlax location, Officer Mitchell alerted Officer Lozano that a Togetic had just popped up just south of 50th.  Mitchell caught the Snorlax, exclaiming, got him.  And then, let's go get the Togetic. And they drove off.  When the car stopped, the recorded Officer Mitchell saying, don't run away, don't run away, Lozano described how he buried it and ultra-balled the Togetic before announcing, got him.  Mitchell advised he was still trying to catch it, adding, holy crap, man, this thing is fighting the crap out of me.  I think there's movie rights to be purchased here.  Eventually, Mitchell exclaimed, holy crap, finally, apparently in reference to capturing the Togetic, and he remarked, the guys are going to be so jealous.  We're unemployed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the crooks got away, the Togetic not so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Togetic not so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A lot of people don't realize, I don't know how this affects law enforcement, but in the United States, the laws are very friendly for surveilling employees in general.  Yes.  And so, first of all, part of it is the dereliction of duty, apparently.  Part of it is the use of taxpayer-funded resources like gasoline to chase Pokemon characters and so on.  So I don't think this is really so much of a privacy issue.  Right?  They were in a police-owned car using police-owned equipment to actually do something purely recreational in dereliction of public safety.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There is a notice that they were given that for this, the DICVS system is used as a tool for crime documentation and prosecution, not to monitor private conversations.  But there is a notice that says it won't be used to initiate a personnel complaint investigation or used against an employee in the adjudication of a personal complaint unless there's evidence of criminal or egregious misconduct.  And the court said that notice is sufficient to protect for minor or purely private communications, but it's too much to ask the commanding officers be forced to ignore egregious misconduct that is unintentionally captured on the recording.  So the court said, no, no, you can fire these guys. In fact, they did four years ago.  But they got the Snorlax, and that's really all that matters.  That's all that they cared about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you imagine the conversation at home? You got fired for doing what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In all fairness, this is 2017. Pokemon Go was all the rage. I remember Lisa and I, many of the times we've come into work late or had to stop somewhere in a dereliction of duty.  Dereliction of duty. We've done it. I admit it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jammer B sitting there in the booth waiting.  There's no Leo still waiting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Interesting new plan from Wyze.  Wyze. We're fans of them. I would I would love to get Stacey's take on this one as well. Well, she'll be back next week.  Yeah.  But we love Wyze. Wyze's stuff is very inexpensive.  What I didn't know is after nearly going bankrupt during the onset of the pandemic, we launched Cam Plus, our premium service.  It's a subscription service with AI and cloud storage features.  Last year, after much soul searching, we had some of a light bulb moment and started experimenting with a name your price concept.  So when we gave a premium feature to users with no obligation to pay for it, many users voluntarily paid for it anywhere to support fellow Wyze community members.  I think this is one of the services part, not the hardware part. Yeah. Yeah. The hardware you still pay for.  But it's like they're cheap. There's like 20 bucks and they almost went out of business.  I didn't know that either because of the pandemic. A lot of businesses have gone, of course.  And so they tried the subscription business and they thought, you know what?  This is and this is a measure of the goodwill people have to Wyze. Yes.  So they're going to expand the name your price experiment starting now to all current users.  It's called Meet. I'm sorry. It's called Cam Plus Lite.  12 second event recordings and Wyze person detection and whatever price you choose, including zero bucks.  But their faith in their customers who do, let's face it, love them.  People love Wyze. Right. I think that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're such an innovative company. It's really astonishing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I'll be very curious about this experiment. But good on them.  They're going to make a fortune. I also got another email from Wyze.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a free upgrade to something for AI package, including person detection, pet detection, yada, yada, yada, yada.  For people that already have whatever this Cam Plus package is.  Heck, I thought I was already getting that. But how much? It just says free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not zero dollars or whatever you want to pay. It's just free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This says, Hey Cam Plus users. This is a free upgrade for being a Cam Plus user.  Interesting. Interesting.  And then I thought that's what you just read came after that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry about that. Wyze is going to start selling COVID tests.  Yes, I saw that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They also sold masks for a while.  Yeah. You know what though? This is an example of make a company people love that gives good value for a dollar and people will help you.  They'll support you.  They'll stick with you.  And they'll stick with you. They think it's great. Good for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're also one of the few companies that's similar to Apple in the sense that if they come out with an entirely new product, people just buy it.  They assume it's going to be a good value and it's going to work great.  And that's pretty rare. People don't wait for the reviews.  They preorder products in an entirely new category like the vacuum cleaner and all that kind of stuff.  And they've got really, really a passionate user base.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nice. I'm going to also give a little credit if you want to learn to code to your son Kevin's wonderful project.  Tell us a little bit about is it?  Chatterbox.  Chatterbox. That's right. Is it? Hello. I always can't remember the URL.  HelloChatterbox.com.  Hello Chatterbox. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's right.  This is a smart speaker for anyone ages nine and up.  You build it yourself. It's the outside is made out of cardboard, which is very inexpensive.  And once you've constructed it, you have a smart speaker that does literally nothing until you go to this Lego like skills builder and build any skills you want.  It does. It does anything.  Any smart speaker does, but you have to build each and every skill yourself.  And in doing so, children learn that AI is just something that's been programmed by a person.  They learn how they work. They learn all the parts.  And it basically teaches what what Kevin calls AI literacy.  So kids who are alive today are the first generation ever to grow up in a world where a artificially intelligent voice is talking to them every day.  And so it's important for this generation, especially to understand what it is that's happening there, because this is the interface that's going to be with them their whole lives.  And they learn all kinds of STEM skills. They learn logic skills and language skills because they're they're basically constructing conversations.  And it's very flexible. So you can say things like if I say, what's the weather? How's the weather outside?  Do I need an umbrella? You can you can have any number of things that trigger the response to go using APIs to get the weather and so on.  What age is what age is? These are pretty little nine years old and up.  Now, I'm guessing that a lot of customers are adults who just want a smart speaker that's super private.  Fun to play with. Yeah. Super fun to play with.  And but but it's it's really targeted at schools and and and also parents who want to buy one for their for their kid.  And again, anyone who wants to tinker. I mean, it's very if people want to to use a Raspberry Pi, for example, a lot of Raspberry Pi's out there.  This is based on Raspberry Pi. This is like the most fantastic thing ever to get.  You can get the version that has no Raspberry Pi with it if you've already got one and just use the Raspberry Pi you have.  But it's really fantastic. And it has some features that actually Alexa and some of the other smart speakers should have.  For example, it's got a button on it, so it doesn't listen to you.  I really like that idea. I agree. And then all the communication is disentangled from the user.  So there's no way for Chatterbox or any of the companies that that have APIs that Chatterbox accesses.  There's no way for anybody to know who's using it.  So there's no possibility of monetization of privacy and violation or any of that stuff.  So it's very, very secure. And one of the things that Kevin talks about is that it's it's a good idea to get kids  used to the idea that the privacy is not being violated because part of the Ronald McDonald business model of a lot of companies is just  by the time kids are old enough to make their own decisions, they've been surveilled.  Their data has already been collected. Their biometrics have already been collected.  This is true of people by the time they're 10 years old. All this has already happened and they're used to it.  And this is you know, this is by design.  This is this I think is why Amazon, for example, has all these children's products.  They want kids to be used to the idea that, you know, their data is being used and then it's being used for marketing and so on.  And so Chatterbox doesn't do any of that stuff.  It gets kids used to the idea that they have total privacy.

Transcript:  Love it. Hello, Chatterbox.com.  And and of course, Mike's the gastronomad will be off to Morocco.  When do you leave?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we're going to leave in next month.  If you can. I think on the 16th, if we can.  We're going to Spain for a little bit and then we're going to Morocco for a while.  We always spend a lot of time before the experiences to touch base with everybody to make sure that everything's awesome.  And so we're looking forward to that if it happens.  We think it will. Nice.  But keep our fingers crossed. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was so much fun going to Oaxaca. I can't wait to do more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm so glad I had a great time. Yeah, I do.  With you guys. It was so fun. So great.  It sounded wonderful. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You saw us dancing to the pulque.  That was before the show. Thank God.  Jeff Jarvis, a number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this week, Jack, the one named Jack, Jack Dorsey, just tweeted simply a link to a technical product piece, how to standardize on UTC to support remote work,  which makes perfect sense.  We hear about UTC on the show all the time.  And it just brought an idle curiosity to mind because it struck me that UTC is the is the is the successor to Greenwich Bean time,  which is an incredibly colonial way to look at the world.  That's where we use UTC. Yeah.  Well, even though it is Greenwich Bean still. Right. Right.  So I wonder what is the most populous time zone?  Time zone. Oh, like that should be where it's got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the center of the world. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is the UTC plus eight here, which covers one point seven billion people, 24 percent of the world's population in that time zone, parts of Indonesia, East Timor,  Western parts of Korea, parts of Northeast China, Eastern parts, parts of Western Australia, Singapore, Malaysia, Inner Mongolia, some parts of Russia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's more fair. I mean, I wish we would use UTC everywhere, but that would confuse people when the sun rises at 2 a.m. and stuff.  But so UTC plus eight, UTC should start there instead of. That's the center of the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was just an idle curiosity. And God bless the Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I look and took one second to find that. If you want to disrupt the fewest people, a quarter of the world's population, UTC should start there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then I wonder where. So what is UTC to Australia?  Where does is it Sydney where we always see the first New Year's Eve stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. So it's that's the it's actually that's farther east.  It's the time zone is the easternmost parts of Western Australia.  So Sydney is UTC plus eleven. Yeah, that's a big difference. Three hours difference. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a good question. Yeah. So it's just a curiosity. I actually had a number two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, this is from Ben Beharon, who is actually quoting a Morgan Stanley note on autonomous vehicles.  Morgan Stanley said autonomous cars are the mother of all IOT AI projects.  But this is the number that's interesting. It'll unlock more than a trillion hours a year of human attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which we which is the scarce commodity people want to buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We spend that much time driving.  Morgan says we forecast total human hours, including passengers, spent inside cars will rise for more than 600 billion hours today to nearly 750 billion hours by 2030, 1.2 trillion hours by 2040.  What's an hour of human time worth in a car with nothing to do depends on what you ask.  And this is just our view. 1.2 trillion hours times anything is a very large number.  I guess I would invest in audiobooks, but that's why they want to put screens in these cars so you can surf the web and so forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that that number is the answer to the question. Why would Apple? Yes, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's exactly right. The car is going to be as it could be as important to them as the smartphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You might spend more time. Apple can either get a big piece of it or they can just cede all that attention to who knows who.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it just shows you again Google going what?  What do you mean? What are you talking about? Oh, Lord, Google. Oh, Lordy, Lordy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We could do. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. In line one twenty one twenty three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Three. There is no line one twenty. Oh, yeah, there is now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is a. I have a tick tock. I have a tick tock for every occasion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tick technology was never supposed to make your life easier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  People whose jobs have been basically looking at a screen at home have been told by Boris Johnson that they must now go back to looking at a screen in a bigger building miles from their house.  They must go to this building.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right, you win.  That was a good one.  And your thing of the week, your things of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's muted. Shout out to Mr. Steve Brazel. Oh, I love to come to Russia.  Yeah, they had me on their show last week.  They're behind the shot dot TV and image critique show.  And folks, if you're getting into photography, having your images critiqued is really, really important because a lot of times you put your stuff up on social media and everything and you just get all the likes and so much nice shot and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  But you're not necessarily growing because there are some things that you can do better with your photography and having other photographers critique your shots can help you out.  They're not trying to be mean, not trying to be rude or anything like that.  But I highly recommend have some regular image critiques.  And his show does a good job of that about once a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I was on Steve does great concert photography.  Oh, yeah. So you weren't a subject.  They weren't critiquing.  You were part of the judging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was part of the panel. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I was part of the panel.  We have the link to that in our show notes.  And next up, Hardhead was a model for me and Mr. Jefferson Graham.  Jefferson Graham was on my show Hands on Photography.  A handful of episodes back.  We went out to Balmy Alley here in San Francisco and did a photo shoot, which was sponsored by Flipboard and all that good stuff.  I love this shot.  And Hardhead just had a ball because he's so into fashion and photography.

Transcript:  He's a sophomore in high school.  He's a high school kid. Look at him.  He's a sophomore in high school.  That's great.  But we're linked to that to show you that photo walk.  It's on this YouTube channel.  And I put a couple of images on my website, AntProt.com, that we shot.  And it was all based on smartphone photography.  So some pretty good stuff there.  And we even made a Flipboard magazine that people can contribute to and share their stuff if they'd like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What a handsome fella walking around the city.  I bet you had to beat him off with a stick, didn't you?  So he's like into fashion?
