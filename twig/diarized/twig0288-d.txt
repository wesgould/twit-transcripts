Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I  Was actually I'm gonna circle back to you about television criticism because that's the other thing Jeff's very famous for  many years a TV critic founder of  entertainment weekly  And I was just thinking the other day about you  While I was critiquing a TV show I was thinking about criticism in general  But we'll get to that in a moment. We'll get to that because we have more important business first  We have to introduce a new guest on this week in Google Lindy Johnson  Hello Lynn welcome  Then comes highly recommended a friend of Gina Trapani's she is a  Content and community consultant developing content and community strategies for brands, but she's also worked at fast company  vibe spin  Vibe Vixen Wow  Are you she is a vibe Vixen ladies and gentlemen, we're so glad to have her  They don't even want to ask what that was

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's okay. What was it a magazine? Yeah, it was it was a magazine and an online component as well. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Women or

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So vibe magazine is a pop culture  Publication yeah multi-cultural. Oh, but Vixen was aimed at women. It's the new style of sexy  Basically, there you go. Oh you found it. Oh, honey. We find everything fast here

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  we are fast kittens on the keyboard ladies and gentlemen, I  warned Lynn not to go in the chat room because  well, just because it's distracting but  She's in there. So if you want it, what is your what is your chat handle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't even pick one yet because I was I was trying to do it. She's doing the web

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I have to get a client right now. Yep. I'll do that. You know, we'd love it if you do you don't have to do it  right now  Right now might not be the right time  So speaking of right time timing is everything if you're selling shares of your company  Larry Page is Sergey Brin have decided to according to a filing with the SEC  some off some shares  Sets nice as of January 30th of this year  They had a total of 44.6 million shares of class B and 44.6 million shares of class  C stock they're gonna sell 2 million each of the class B common stock and  of course only Google founders and  Googlers can have class B  So it'll convert to class a upon sale and then another 2 million shares each of the non voting class C  Which I presume will also convert for a total of ching four point four billion dollars

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you're they're only selling 10% of their holding right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, they're still in there still the major controllers of the company. It doesn't you know, it's yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they'll own eleven point nine percent, but they have 52% of the voting power  They really when Google went public this was considered at the time  They did some really interesting things when they went public  Including that it was a Dutch auction they did but they also made sure that they kept a lot of the voting power

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So well in the split  Aimed even more control as I remember, right? Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right. They converted some shares. So 52% of the voting power. Nobody's gonna change the plans at Google anytime  Soon  Class B shares mostly owned by Bryn Page and Eric Schmidt have ten times the voting power. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look this picture. This is from Business Insider  That's Larry

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's 2006. They're a little older than that gray air. Yeah  in that picture, but I  Don't think there's anything wrong with that and I don't think anybody in the market, you know  Stockholders should worry that they're selling it. You know  It's ten percent cash in a little stock. I wish I could cash in four point four billion dollars worth of something

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wonder what that leads to leads to things like philanthropy and estate planning and  Probably buying another plane or something, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Investing gets to be a point that where you have so much money that you don't even really  It's absurd. It's a different it's got to be a different world where you don't even have to I mean, I don't I can't even imagine  It's just a different world  There is a burden though. I don't know how philanthropic is are they and how philanthropic is Google?  There's a point where it gets to be so much

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do they yeah, yeah Google.org don't forget they pledged  portion of equity portion of revenue, you know, Benioff is the leader of that in  San Francisco of pushing companies to right pledge  portions of revenue and portions portions of revenue portions of equity and portions of employee time each year Google.org donates a hundred

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  million dollars in grants a  Billion dollars in products in 80,000 hours in Google or time. That's pretty good  Yeah, yeah, but do Larry and Sergey have their own is there a you know a page foundation or a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think one of them does related to health stuff. That's right. I think it's Larry. That was Larry right?  So, yeah  You know the other thing is  There's nothing to say that they have to be public about it, right and and you don't know what they give

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In fact, I think that's the way to do it. The left hand should not know what the right hand is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, but I was thinking about that  I was gonna I was almost gonna call into the Stern show for some reason I forgot the peg was and ask Howard because  He's very public about his wife's charity, which is the Long Island  Animal shelter that she's building for cage-free cats. So so he does stuff he does a calendar  He takes the photos zones reports, you know that he does other flan three. He mentions it very discreetly good  But doesn't talk about it, but you know, I was but I was wondering about this and I wanted to ask him  What and I guess I understand why it's a matter of humility  But it also is an opportunity to promote a cause or charity that you care about and by not saying I give to blank  Then you give up that opportunity. I understand where you don't both from from, you know  Let's not trumpet my charity says rich person and also because once I mentioned one charity, they're all gonna come running

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like universities like this one, well, you'd also want to be a role model, right? Yeah, I think so

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, but I think part of why you don't disclose is because it it could look like you give preference to certain groups over others

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, wouldn't it wouldn't know the right kind of disclosure be something like I give 10% of all my  income to charity  period and  then you know choose the charity of your choice and  But but do I mean this all comes from this perception? I don't know if it's real anymore  But for a long time there's this perception that Silicon Valley was minting millionaires, but they were not very  Progressive in their charitable contributions. I don't know if that's still the case

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know I don't know either but if you're if you're a millionaire and you have a really good accountant an accountant is gonna  Advise you. Yeah, that's a good, you know to do that, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually it  Actually, I should be because I have an accountant and  And the truth is that they keep the federal government keeps raising the threshold  For of your AGI for what you could deduct and so let in fact  They are not in sending giving as much as they should you're disincenting it all the time  I can't remember what the threshold is now, but I think it's over it was 4%  I think it's gone up  And that's wrong that means you have to give more than 4% of your income before you could start deducting it that first 4% is  Taxable on you. Yeah  Just the same thing they do with medical expenses and I that doesn't seem like the right  Way to promote philanthropy  What we I don't know if I should talk about this  It turns out that you can deduct from from dollar one if you do something called community development  So when we and we give twit gives a lot a lot of my charities look all my charity almost is local and  That's one of the reasons because then you can deduct it  From zero from dollar one if it's called community development as opposed to charity

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway, there's ways in ways. That's why you have an account. I have two major charities Tufts University and the next one and  The next one. Oh my daughter's my daughter. Oh the next university. Yeah, tell me about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, tell me that I have two kids in college. That's a charity  Yeah, they're both nonprofits. Yeah  Yeah, no kids Lynn yeah kids not in college it not in college the teenagers yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One teenager one toddler. Oh my oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My that's what that's why we lost Gina. She had a toddler. Yeah, and a startup

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know which is more

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Challenging exactly Google was getting it got a little heat  Because it revealed flaws in OS 10 to flaws in OS 10 one flaw in Windows  Before the companies had a chance to patch it Google said hey we give you 90 days if you don't patch it in 90 days on day  We're gonna reveal it to the world to put some pressure on you this really irritated Microsoft  Microsoft said we asked for a little more time because it was off off our normal patch cycle and Google said no  In fact then revealed three more bugs  Google now says well, okay, maybe we were a little harsh  I feel like they're still pretty harsh because now they're saying okay. We'll give you a 14 day grace period  So if we go to you the 90 day expert, so what happens with it says Google has a large team looking for  Exploits vulnerabilities in operating system software and other software when they find something they call the company Microsoft in this case and say  Hey fix it and in 90 days. We're gonna reveal it  If a 90 day Google now says if a 90 day deadline will expire  But a vendor lets us know before the deadline a patch is scheduled on a specific day within 14 days  Then we'll delay public disclosure  I think that's fair and we're gonna only count  This is a weird one. We will not reveal a vulnerability on weekends or US public holidays  Yeah, I don't know, you know, it's Ramadan. I guess they don't care. I don't understand why it's a US public. But anyway, I  Think there are being a I  Have I've mixed feelings about that we talked about this yesterday on security now on the one hand  I understand that if you don't have any pressure on these companies to fix these flaws  The company sometimes put it off and then hackers find the flaws and now you've got a real problem  On the other hand, this is Google kind of acting like oh, well, we care about your users, but obviously you don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  well, but if you if if you wait a  Hundred four days to fix the vulnerability that affects users then isn't that true? Well, maybe there's good reasons

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe there maybe it's hard to make the patch or there's side effects or  I mean, there's there can be a lot of legitimate reasons for holding on to a patch  I think implying that Microsoft or Apple don't care about security flaws is a little arrogant

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What Google arrogant I mean, why does Google even have this power to do to do this in the first place? That's that's kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They've assumed it nobody gave him the right they just decided I

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For one have no problem by new masters

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good this is not Google does this all the time and this is another issue that we've talked about on security now with Steve  It's kind of a in the weeds, but it has to do with certificate signing  most  SSL certificates, you know for secure browsing are signed with a an encryption technique that is  It is secure has not been cracked has not been broken  But as computers get more and more powerful  One can predict that at some point  In a year five years ten years, but at some point computers will be powerful enough to crack this hash. There is a stronger  encryption technique available  You can get certificates signed with this Google has decided that any day now  I think they're gonna start warning people in Chrome if this older technique is used for the signing  It's not that it's insecure. They they want to thrust people forward  Into a new way of signing certificates and this can cost a lot of money it can also  Take a lot of time and if you are issuer of these  Certificates it could be a significant  Burden  So and Google by the way  Doesn't have to worry about they stay use the old hash, but they don't worry about it because they expire their certificates  Every three months. It's kind of a complicated subject, but it's another case. I think of Google  It's like the United States foreign policy  you know  the old white man's burden well  We know better. We got to make sure that everybody in the internet is protected from people like Apple and Microsoft. They're just too dumb  to protect people I  Don't think this is Google. I think this is Google needs to be a little bit more collegial on this. That's just my I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Agree with that. I mean, I don't feel like they're partnering with people there  You know partnering with Apple and Microsoft. It's it's kind of being  You know police right?  Yeah, it's it's it's kind of I don't know I kind of see it as like, you know when when people call Google Skynet  This is another example of that, right? But it's it but it's protecting

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Users in the end, but it's but it's but it's on its own terms  so for instance Microsoft has agreed that they're going to retire these SHA-1 certificates and  Start warning people in Internet Explorer, but in 18 months  And  Google has decided no, that's not soon enough  We're gonna move along Bruce Schneier has done some calculations and says it  Bruce Schneier the security guru and my personal savior  says that based on the cost of Amazon computing a  collision attack well with that isn't using a  Brute force collision attack is well within the range of an organized crime certificate could practically budget by  2018 and a university research project by 2021  So yes, we need to move from SHA-1 to SHA-2  But do we need to do it tomorrow?  And Google says well, it's dangerously weak, but it's not that there's a problem  So if you use Chrome, you're gonna start seeing these warnings and this is what's interesting  You see this third warning so the first warning is just a yellow triangle over the HTTPS  it may be you know, watch out man, but but in if  soon  In six months, you're gonna get a X over the padlock the HTTPS will be red and struck out  Not because the site is insecure or or the certificate is not good, but because it's using a technique that  In a couple of years  So basically you won't you won't be able to visit the page unless you you'll have to okay. Well, I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not clear whether it'll say don't go there or it'll just give you this weird warning

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But but Google feels respond because Google is the search engine that sends you to all these places Google feels responsibility

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But what this screams for I think is a standards body  Isn't there one to to isn't that isn't there a collegial place where you get together and have a conversation?  Isn't there a collegial place where you get together and have a really boring meeting talking about this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You'd think so I don't know I probably shouldn't be talking we should get Steve Gibson on if we're gonna talk about this cuz

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  God I can't imagine anything worse  That meeting yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you know, I'm I feel bad because I'm so I  Can't I can't even go like I was on the city councils in Petaluma's  Digital advisory board I couldn't even take that  Like I had a quit after three weeks. It's like you guys are driving me crazy. I just want to do something  No, no, no, I can't do anything. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was on the audit bureau go ahead Lynn

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I was just gonna say those are the kind of meetings where everybody has to vote on every yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's wake me up  I am not big I'm not good with process which is too bad because I think this is probably not uncommon  That this really smart technical people who they you need on these kinds of committees probably in general  Are not the people who want to sit on a committee? That's true. I would guess I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The worst one I was on was the audit Bureau of Circulations which audits the circulation publications. Yeah, they're  Task force to decide  Digital standards so we had meeting after meeting after meeting asking the earth-shattering question. What's a page view?  Right, what's what's an ad impression? Oh my god  What's an emoticon shoot me? Oh, well, this is this is way before that. This is stone ages

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway this  Eric Mill has written a good blog post in which he says this is at  KONKLONE.com  This SHA-1 push should have started years ago any annoyance at Google for amping up the pressure should be channeled toward the certificate authorities instead  For allowing nothing to happen for so long  So  I and I'm not technical enough to learn this Steve Steve has said and he is technical enough to  Have an opinion. He said he feels that Google is pushing this  Microsoft said we'll do it with Internet Explorer, but they gave everybody a little more time. It's the same thing where  You say well just more time just means you're gonna put it off. So  It's like a school teacher  It's like a school teacher  It's a little school Marmee saying if I don't give a deadline for your homework, you're just not gonna do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, but but but Google needs to protect its users right from malware from other things  All right, there's no there's no actual threat here. I I gotcha but but so really what your quibble  I don't think you would argue that Google needs to protect users from sending people to places with malware, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We've had we've had that you know malware alert on our site some years ago because we did like to have malware on it  And I was grateful to Google exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so what you're asking for is I think two things one a more reasonable line and to a little scotch of  Collaboration in discussing where that line is, right if there is nobody that does this there really isn't I think  Yeah, yeah, so so maybe that's what is needed. So Microsoft what Microsoft should be doing  Is saying let's let's get a committee right committee solved everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well in the in the chat room  Web 87 47 says what's crazy to me is that Stephen Leo believed Microsoft is right to set the deadline in 2017  But Google's not right to put it in 2016  Yeah, I mean, I guess you're right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You say tomato I say tomato, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it definitely seems like there should be some standards here without standards  It's like anyone's gonna do whatever they want to do whenever they want to do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, let me ask you this  when a bad  Exploit happens when something bad happens suddenly like Sony I  Presume there is a back channel from all the security guys and all these top companies  that that  Connect and and compare notes and and see what it matters to them. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think that's what the president's actually  Trying to get that's true on Friday. He spoke to Silicon Valley saying promoting information sharing  Also with government which is yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He said you got to work more with us  And there has been some conversation about that as well I  Just I feel like I'm not probably as technical as I need to be to talk about the Shaw one lord knows I'm not  so we'll just

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So did you see that dancing that that animated gift for the cat through the house?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I could talk about that I can I can talk about that  The president did sign  He was at Stanford University with cyber executives Eric Schmidt did not go by the way  He was invited but sent somebody from Google that knew about technology  Same thing with the CEOs of Facebook. I  Think it would be good if mark went but he didn't and he's busy he's got other stuff to do and Mercer Meyer didn't  Go either  He at the event on Friday. He announced he was gonna sign an executive order to encourage the sharing of information  Regarding cyber threats between private sector and the government and he did

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The order was signed. He said the Internet or how do you how does an order encourage?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Think it's probably only affects the government right so he's telling I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He said the Internet is like the Wild West. Yeah, I didn't like that. I that pissed me off

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everybody is online and everybody is vulnerable

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's that's this is that the tech no panic man not good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He also called cyber attacks one of the greatest threats to national security safety and economic issues  Business leaders here he's speaking to the assembled  Silicon Valley leaders want their privacy and their children protected just like consumer and privacy advocates here want America to keep leading the world in technology be safe from  See the the president is wanting a very narrow line here because on the one hand he absolutely is encouraging the NSA to gather all that information  He's refused to block the mass collection of information, but the other hand he told Kara Swisher in an interview at recode  But I want encryption I understand why you want encryption you should be able to be private he can't have it both ways and maybe you can't  Can you have it both ways?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, if they can have encryption backdoors, which means you can't have encryption. He's never said backdoors  But people in his administration have floated that balloon, right?  And the Brits have certainly floated a flotilla of those balloons  Cameron has

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ben Desjardins who is the director of security solutions with radware a cybersecurity firm said the new proposals  He's he's quoted in this this article  Ben Swan calm the new proposals face significant headwinds  Both legislatively from Congress and cooperatively from Heverweights in the tech sector  Many companies and I think this is the case feel burned by the government after the Snowden leaks and are very reluctant  To let the federal government continue what they see as a takeover of the internet  White House says executive order is only a framework and with it the White House aims to allow private companies access to otherwise  Classified cyber threat information. Well, that's alright. I mean  As long as that sharing is in that direction  As long as that sharing is in that direction

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, but they're also calling for a voluntary creation of a common set of standards here so  Which I think is a good thing but then the problem with that is they're not really giving the companies any incentives to participate

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and companies feel burned already by all of these, you know, the national security letters they're getting and they feel like  Nobody outside of the United States is going to buy cisco products or microsoft products or apple products or facebook or  Google because they don't they think that they're all  tools of the u.s. Government

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's another one I don't I think we should just move on I guess  Just depressed. All right. Sometimes this show is like that. Lynn. I apologize.

I won't do it right now, but you can do it  And you get a guy or gal at google  They're very googley looking and they have a google set and everything  And I thought it must be helpouts. We even asked him remember

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, is this how it's not? Oh, yeah, I thought it's old muse. No, no, that's not helpouts. No, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then two days later we find out google's killing helpouts. Whoops  Um, i'm surprised I thought this was such a great thing. I guess nobody used it helpouts was a form of hangout

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did I I don't think you googled it a little bit of advertising  But I don't think it ever gave it the level of support it needed to launch something new it thinks  Oh, we're google will come out with the people will run to it  Um, you know it disappeared from public consciousness and it requires  Helpers and help ease  To make it work and it never got to critical mass because I don't think google  I think it was an orphan child  It was such a good idea. It was a great idea. It remains a great idea  And you know you start something like that and then just dump it  It's it's one matter to put out a beta and said what do you think about this but you launch a product?  I I think a lot of companies including google are too cavalier about killing things that they start the people some people are depending upon

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean doesn't it really depend on how high the adoption is?  I mean and but with google, I guess that doesn't matter because they had high adoption rates for google reader  And they yeah, we were all peeved about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Poor Gina's wave  wave  Wave right. I mean at the scale google's at high adoption. What does that mean millions, right?  Yeah  If you were a startup and you had hangout or helpouts and you had, you know, 100 000 people using it. You'd be pretty happy  Of course  And I gotta feel bad for the people who um,  Like Mitchell Dillman who's teaching sheet metal art for beginners on a google help out  He uh, and his first help out's free charges five dollars for 15 minutes. So this guy's giving classes  And that's that in april come april 20th. That's it  You got to find some other way of doing this because no more sheet metal art breastfeeding help  Here's a psychotherapist. I think there were quite a few people  I think there were quite a few people there were there were quite a few I think doing uh, psychotherapy coaching counseling therapy session  Arizona health care pet wellness information anxiety management  A lot of breastfeeding help  It ain't easy leo try it no latching on that's the challenge. Yeah  um yoga wait  There's actually I think the number one category is breastfeeding help  There's a lot of uh sports nutrition. There are a lot of therapy  I feel like somebody who is either too shy can't afford  Psychotherapy but wants to try it out. This is such a great platform for that. It is it is an altruistic

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's it means basically it's hangouts with money  Right  And and the uses could be amazing. It could be a journalistic help  Yeah, I I was very sad about about this cooking there's a lot of cooking i'd forgotten that it existed

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's the problem. We talked about it. We we were real excited about it. Then did I ever use it? No

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, well because leo, you know everything you don't need to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I could have probably learned a few things javascript tutoring  excel spreadsheet customization  Um, I bet you henry  Could have taken courses in logic pro here for instance. Yeah  Digital audio recording and editing I mostly just feel bad for the people who  Did through threw themselves into it and really took the time to do it  And I bet you people got cameras and mics and you know, spend some energy making this work  And I think there is a risk if if you kill things too, uh bruskily and uh abruptly because  Then people are less likely to adopt the next thing you google. Yes  You know, maybe there'd be you know, you know  I think it was a real  I understand they're a business and they they can't maintain something they don't make money on  Damn it now. We have to watch a cat video because i'm just depressed again  But this is worth it leo. There's a cat in the snow  Okay, she's opened her door and apparently whoa  Oh  All right for those of you listening you understand the vast majority of people who uh, who uh,  Consume the show aren't seeing this so i'll describe it  Obviously somewhere in probably syracuse. She opens her door and then halfway up to the halfway up the door is just a wall of  Snow she's putting a little dish for her cat to have some food and the cat just burst through  into  The cat knows how to get in. Uh, excuse me. I uh, there's some snow in the way a out of the way snow

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  boom  Boom  Okay, that's a good cat. That's a good cat. That's a great cat gif gif or jif  So lynn, this is what we do. Yeah, if glen

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cat chips, oh jif no lynn. No, no, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's gif  You call it whatever you want  She's losing the boom  All right. We've repeated this enough. Actually the chat room came up with a bunch of  Uh cat gifts jifs. Yeah, of course they did  Let's see here  Snow cat attack. Is this the same one?  Yep, this is the same one  Great minds think alike  Um  What else  Sparrow  Here's another uh, something that's going away. I really liked sparrow was in a mac and ios app  That was a really good email app google bottom  And we knew I think the end was near. Uh, they kept it going for a while. This folks who?  Developed a sparrow french startup said they would continue to support sparrow  Users and but they weren't making a lot of improvements on it  Uh, it was two again. I only feel bad for people who bought it was two dollars 99 cents  On ios it was ten dollars on mac  Uh, there was a free app sparrow light  But it's been incorporated and I think some of this must be in  The inbox app the google inbox app, which I really like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I was about to say I mean  This uh sparrow sun setting comes as no surprise. I mean  We we all expected once they bought them that they were gonna just you know, use their developers to to learn new things

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right product designer. Jean-marc denny went to work on inbox  Um  So I imagine much of this was an aquire aqua hire hire  And uh, the app is gone, but the people live on  Making inbox better. It doesn't feel like do you use inbox lin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have used it. I love it  Well, I just felt like um for me it it took a lot of uh,  Adjustments. Yeah to get it to work. Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Most people I know feel the same way but  I just really liked it and I just feel like they haven't done a lot of new things in it and i'm  See, this is what happens when you kill things  I'm worried now  They're gonna kill this you're gonna kill this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If they did just just still use gmail you don't lose you do just gmail, right?  I just lose you lose a nice addition. Whereas with with reader and and helpouts. That's a good point. You lose the function  That's right, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And what will happen with gmail probably is they'll they'll put some of the functionality into gmail, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well as jeena has pointed out on their show poor jeena may wave rest in peace, you know for her  She wrote a book on it. The poor woman. Geez a hell of a lot of the waves  Thinking is is now elsewhere in google and and has value

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right and and that's the same with I mean I edited a book on google voice  You know, and though voice still exists. It's really part of hangouts now, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you know what the dummy's guide to google voice was a good book  That's the one I edited. It was a good book and it needed to be written because  google voice is one of those really great things that uh,  Are of I think huge value to normal people but a little intimidating  So and google doesn't document stuff very well  So I think that was a book that was well well worth it and anybody who invested in google voice isn't losing anything  I still use google voice  Non-stop you just migrate some of the features to hangouts eventually maybe all of it  No, I don't that's an example of something if they killed voice  Uh, I think we would storm the gates of mountain view  Unless they put everything into hangouts  So what is this obama defends google against euro techno panic  This must be I detect a jeff charvis's fingerprints all over this there you go

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh in his interview with with recode and by the way, I saw some great tweets  It said the greatest branding exercise you can imagine is getting the president of the united states in your red chair in the red chair  I noticed they did that  Yeah  He defended google against uh companies in europe that are going after google at all and company  Because they're competitors. Yeah, and uh, and a little defense of america

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Technology. Yeah in defense of google and facebook said the president sometimes the european response here is more  commercially driven

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Than anything else. I don't know if that's fair. I think it's very fair in certain cases the get ready for it folks  Leistung schutze, right?  That's commercial. You're right is entirely commercial. It's publishers saying protect us but not the right to be forgotten. That's not a commercial

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He I thought he made a good point the attitude the attitude that leads to the right to be forgotten and leads to  killing street view in germany

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And and those have any roots you're saying it's anti-corporate. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  He said there are some countries like germany given its history with the stasi the east german secret police that are very sensitive to these issues  That's nice that's fair but sometimes their vendors their service providers who can't compete with ours  Are essentially trying to set up some roadblocks for our companies to operate effectively there  We have owned the internet said the president  Our companies have  Companies have created it expanded it perfected it in ways. They can't compete. This is this is that's red-blooded

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Americana, yeah, but that's that but the problem is that's that's a that's a red not a red chair  But a red cape in front of europe. We have owned the internet  China and iran. Yeah, all of them who say america has too much to do with the internet  Well, yeah, because we did it but you might not want to put it that way

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When it came to privacy president obama said I think you own your data. I think I own my data. I think I think  No, you you own all of our data president, I think we own our health care data we own our financial data  Uh, I think this is an era where ironically sometimes I also have tensions with silicon valley folks are quite keen on talking about government intrusion  But some of the commercial models people have set up are fairly intrusive  As well, there's a big difference. We've talked about this before  The president has tanks  google does not  Yes  And you can be arrested by the federal government for the things they think they know about you google's not going to arrest you  The worst they're going to do is sell your name  And you're going to get diaper commercials  Part of the answer here  Is people knowing ahead of time what's going on?  I agree with him there people knowing how their data is going to be used much greater transparency  In terms of the potential of it migrating over to some sales and marketing scheme of somebody else's the more trans  This is all off the cuff. So I have to respect that he's this off the cuff. This is good  It shows an understanding the more transparent we are the more customers can make a choice  He also said everybody has to learn to code  If jean and we're here she'd be going yeah, i'm not sure I agree with this  Then how much of a coder are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um, i'm an old school coder. I mean I was coding a fortran or punch cards what?  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow when you were four

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, yeah grandma jesus what I don't want to I don't want to say how old I I I was or am but um

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the light of the fireplace jeez

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fortran punch cards or tran punch cards. Wow, that's that's that's that's serious. That's  Pascal unix. Yeah pascal. I can dig unix. I can dig but fortran on punch cards  Yeah, it sounds like that's that's a long time ago

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was just uh, uh a particular program that really wanted you to learn it I see

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. Yeah, it's like the photography courses now in high schools where they say you really need to learn how to use film in a dark room  Yeah, and I want to say, you know, you don't  No, you don't  You need to learn how to drive a buggy before you can buy your first car. No, you don't  I think we can safely leave those technologies behind now. Let me let me ask you a question about this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So son jake is a computer science major and  He should learn lisp  Well, what what should you?  Learn still and what should you not bother learning anymore in languages? I think that's very hard. Don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean in fact i'm on the board of our local high school over here  Um at the school my kids went to and we talk about this a lot and I say you shouldn't teach kids microsoft word  That's stupid  You shouldn't teach people how to use an operating system. That's stupid  You need to teach your mental lower level understanding of what's going on so that because I can guarantee you when they enter the marketplace  It's not going to look that way

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, I mean no you make a good point there because you know when I learned  How to use a computer that had any kind of microsoft on it. I learned dos commands, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's really held you in good stead hasn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I mean but I can always I can always default back to that when i'm troubleshooting a problem on a windows machine

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true. Well, still I still write dos commands. I learned cpm

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, i'm also i'll also have you know that i'm glad I don't ever have to worry about troubleshooting jack on a microsoft machine

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't get near him anymore. Well, I mean I use a mac too, but I have people in my family that use

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff still knows how to use pip

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the cpm copy command intuitively named pip. I I could probably pick up my wordstar

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Keyboard commands in about oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay dot k or uh command control ks  I remember that and the doc you remember dot commands

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff, do you remember teletext?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, hey, hey, hey, watch it lind watch it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I I and I agree that we need to have kids learn stem and they need to learn things like I think it's better  To learn scientific method for instance and what that is than a need  So his point he says what's true is that our lead will erode  Uh our lead in technology will erode if we don't make some good choices now  We've got to have our kids in math and science couldn't agree more can't just be a handful of kids gotta be everybody  This is where I maybe disagree a little bit. Everybody's got to learn how to code early  I I maybe I don't disagree in the sense that when you're teaching arithmetic, uh, maybe you teach some  You know boolean logic didn't we do that with turtle graphics and logo?  you know, uh  For years, what does it mean to learn? I mean, I I that's the problem. I don't think teaching, uh,  a fourth grader  pearl

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or python is going to be very valuable here. Here's the way I we just hired somebody who's wonderful who's trying to you know  Update our technology thinking here at our journalism school named jui yang and and I was talking about this just yesterday with jui and  The way she put it is she wants to demystify coding for  journalism students  and  I like that a lot and and my response was  Each journalism student probably has a different need where this can really pay off for their work and they can say oh  The scales fall off their eyes and they see the value of it. They see how far it can go  We're not going to turn out journalists as coders that's a unicorn. I believe uh, there's a few of them, but but not a big herd  But  The idea of demystifying technology the main skill you you give and joy also argues this  Is that you're obviously what you're teaching people is to look it up and learn it  We had another student in our program who has a company called skill crush to teach particularly women how to code  Because her problem was that when she learned to code around men  in her view it wasn't a  welcoming atmosphere  for what she was doing and  You know at the end of the day if she said what happened was every time she'd go to somebody and say  Uh tell teach me how to do this the person would end up looking it up online  You quickly learn that what you do is you look it up online and then you teach yourself, right?  So what we what you're teaching people is how to teach themselves. I agree. That's really what it is  You still have to answer my question if you're in a cs program now  What languages should you still learn?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm really old school. I'm really old school on this. You are it's too late  It's too late for jake jake because he's already yeah, he's jake started by writing  apps for facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So he's already completely ruined with ph right and I and I think it depends on need right like  At cs school it depends on the specialty that you're going into

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, but but but you have a curriculum that teaches everybody and you have requirements  so  Again, i'll get off this quickly, but but if you're a graduate of a program, let's say a cs program  What should the world expect you to know and what should the world say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a weird point of view on this which i've expressed before but i'll express briefly here  Uh, and it's no longer. Oh courant in uh universities, but in  A decade or more ago at mit and duke  they wrote a  Really good book that was part of programming 101 at mit and duke for many years no longer is  And the theory of it was that it was really programming for everybody including liberal arts majors the theory of it was  That instead of learning how to control a computer  You should learn how to express a problem and solve a problem in a algorithmic way  Yeah, this is useful for  In the same way, you know people always say why do you teach math? Well, yeah, you need arithmetic  But why why do you need geometry? Why do you need to learn brulee and logic?  Why do you need to learn trig or or calculus because it's a rigorous  Pro it's it's almost teaching how to think in a certain kind of way. It's a rigorous  Discipline that helps you develop your mind in ways that will be useful in non-mathematical ways and I think this is the same  Thing so they wrote a pro they wrote a book that is available online for free  um, and and I still recommend it was the um  Oh now I can't remember  structure and control of computer  languages s i c  S i c p, you know what? I think I probably have it in my bookmarks here. Let me just look real quickly  Yeah, here it is how to design computer programs  This is copyright 2001 mit. That's when they were still teaching this  Um, but you can download it's online  at  CDP how to design programs.org  And uh, it uses lisp  actually a variant of lisp called scheme and you could download the doctor scheme interpreter and  It has a teaching mode and so forth and this is really aimed at  They say in the introduction, which is great  Is we really hate when kids learn programming in high school?  Because they they learn everything wrong and now we have to reteach them

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This isn't about learning computer programming  They say we we believe the study of program design does the same central role in general education as mathematics  And english everyone should learn how to design  Programs it teaches analytical skills like math, but unlike mathematics working with programs is an active approach to learning  It I think it's it's also really fun but  Um, so they have a really interesting point of view here  MIT has abandoned this as as has duke in favor of a more career-oriented  Curriculum, I think there's pressure from students and parents  But wait a minute. You got to teach me a job skill. I don't want to learn this airy fairy philosophy stuff  I want to know how to write a program in c or c plus plus or c plus c sharp  And uh, and so they teach java they teach c sharp they see c plus plus  But really, uh  The best program and you know eric raymond's always said this best programmers learned lisp first because they learned  How to express problems in a rigorous fashion and express the algorithm of solution independent of the machine  It was it's a mathematical language for so anyway  If if you ask me tell jake to go to ht dp.org  And start reading

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Lynn that sounds  Good. I mean, I think I think it's more about the thinking it's thinking actual than the actual language  It's the thinking because like jeff the point jeff brought up before because of the background I have  I can almost learn any language very easily, right? Um, but one thing that's interesting that I just found  google  New york city schools are going to teach 100 000 kids in after-school programs google cs first. Oh lord  How's that going to help them in life? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are they going to learn go? What are they going to learn?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know cs first cs will be will be offered to all kids enrolled in 857 after-school programs

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I see I do love the idea of computer literacy  I do love the idea of rigor and learning how to think and learning, uh how computers work  And I mean we do need this he says they uh, carah asked, uh, if uh,  President obama had encouraged sasha malia his daughters to learn to code  Uh, he said I think they got started a little bit late part of what you want to do is introduce  coding with abcs and colors  You also and I I think is the right kind of coding. Yes the the way of thinking about stuff. Yes  Not actually controlling a computer. I don't know how important that is

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Particular attention. He said needs to be paid in helping girls and other underrepresented groups in stem  Including african americans latinos. I think that's true, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's uh the problem with the u.s tech industry when we see a litany of tech companies report workforce statistics that are routinely  70 white 70 male  Um, he's uh, the president said I think part of the problem is just generally our school systems aren't doing as good of a job  On this period full stop  The risk of this though is then you get things like core curriculum, which i'm  I think is a mistake  Yeah, and then he says and then part of what's happening is we're not helping schools and teachers teach it in an interesting way  That may be okay  And and he also says you need role models and I agree we were talking before the show about this with lynn  um  I feel it's a big burden to get more women and people of color on our shows as role models  so that  Kids who are watching can say oh, yeah, i'm not a white man. I guess I shouldn't get into tech  That's not what you want

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. No, and and you make a good point with that. I mean I had no role model when I was in high school  Programming, you know basic on a commodore 64, but you did it. Why did you do it?  I was a math major. Yeah  And so it was an elective math course and I I liked, you know  gaming enough at the time so  It um, it kind of just followed suit but that's really unusual  I don't know. I had also taken a data processing course  If you remember data processing with punch cards

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In high school really yeah in high school. That's a good school

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For something. Yeah, actually getting kids young is important  I think about the story of bill gates who got into computers at lakeside high school in seattle fancy private school  But they didn't have a computer there  And his mom had a and other moms raised money through bake sales and stuff to buy a teletype  connected to the time sharing computer down the road and then that's where bill and uh,  His buddies including paul allen went there and started banging on uh  Banging on the teletype and writing programs  gates had actually a company when he was a  High school student I think was called trap. Oh data. He wrote  You know those rubber hoses they put across the road and then the car goes bump bump and they count how many cars go  Down a road. He wrote software that would analyze that  That was his first business am I am I making this up?  When you get to a certain age sometimes you think oh I hallucinated that  Traffol you think you're brian williams. Yeah  Oh, yeah  I was looking right down the barrel of that or traffol data was a partnership between bill gates paul allen and paul gilbert  To read the raw data from road rate traffic counters and create reports for traffic engineers  This was before microsoft. They were still in high school when they high school students at the lakeside school in seattle  So I did not make that up  Either that or I edited this article on wikipedia  There's also a possibility  All right, let us let us we we're all in agreement and and maybe you can disagree about what kids should learn  but I think we're all in agreement that um  That should be part I think it's as much as math should be part of the curriculum some sort of  Logic and and I don't know  I don't know  And yet there's people like you lynn who despite all odds  Just fell in love with it and you just you were bold enough  Uncowed enough that's really the problem is so many people get cowed  You're uncowed enough to say I don't care if you know, i'm the only girl doing this i'm going to do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  right  Right. Yeah, I mean I didn't know I don't really know anyone else  Like me doing it, right? I guess I could say at the time, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um, but you didn't let some guy or some math teacher tell you. Oh, no, you you shouldn't get into this  No, actually I was encouraged. Oh, that's nice. It's encouraging. See there you go. That's that's what we need  I was talking, uh  A couple of weeks ago. We had a visitor young woman who was a student at cal  She's graduating this year. She starts at google in the fall data analysis  And I said, that's so great. How do you tell me about what how you got into math?  She said well, I wasn't because I got encouragement. She said my math teacher who was a woman said  Oh, no, you should math is too hard for you. You shouldn't be doing math

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Isn't that terrible? It's terrible. I mean what what happened to me really was um,  You know, I started the reason I became a math major is because I took algebra before I even went to high school  And when I got to high school  The math teacher I had there said how about you be a math peer tutor for me great  So I think that's what started me loving math in that kind of way, you know, my daughter's facing this. She's 23

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's a sophomore in college  Right now she she's really has a hard time with math  Uh, she blames me because I did not force her to learn her multiplication tables when she was online  I tried  Um, but we did a lot of software enough. Yeah, maybe not. We did a latin math adventure. I mean we did stuff  but uh  I think most of it was she was I think she's super smart and she wants a science career, right? So she needs math  right, um, so uh, but she's I feel so happy she's found a professor  Uh who is oh it was a woman who says oh no  You should be at a higher level in math and i'm going to do a tutorial with you  And we're going to do two years of math in one semester because you are smart enough to do this  This isn't hard  And i'm i'm going to help you get over this  Uh block you have and i'm so grateful to that professor. We need more people like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, definitely. I mean math block can be like writer's block. It's exactly like that. It can be yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's exactly like that  I did teach her how to play the ponies though. So that's good. I'm just kidding

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Um

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That actually wouldn't be a bad skill, I mean i'm just saying  How to online poker leo online poker that's the one so yeah gambling you teach the odds, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, how to bet against the actually that's a good way to learn math. It's math. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we were we were speculating what mattel was going to announce  Uh, they had an event, uh  with uh google  And and the speculation was correct. It is cardboard  They're going to do a view master based on  The google cardboard here's a u.s. A today  interview  Is there a demo of it? I let me see if I can skip ahead and find it  Yeah, there's a demo. I saw a demo earlier today. I love that idea. So there's what it looks like. It looks just like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Transcript:  You know who you are?  Our show today brought to you by ld products  This is good for the environment  So, uh, we all use printer ink toner cartridges ink jet ink

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And most of us sometimes because the companies make us buy it from the company that sold us the printer  But you don't go to the car dealership to buy gas  Why should you go to the printer manufacturer to buy overpriced and I mean overpriced ink and toner?  LD products offers a quality alternative at a fraction of the cost as much as 75 less than the oem cartridge  We're gonna make it even a better deal for you. They've been in business for 15 years.

Yeah, even their building  Is environmentally friendly?  110,000 square foot platinum lead that's as good as you can get  Uh for environmental certification, that's really really cool  ld products  They have your printer needs covered remanufactured compatible brand name products.

It's the most expensive fluid known to man  Not it really is so save some money  Use ld  So, uh, I guess google not only having uh trouble in europe now russia  Yandex  This one's commercial clearly, right?  Yandex asks russian antitrust authorities to probe google over bundling android with google services  Yandex is guess what the google of russia  Should google be feared

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everybody should be a fear to russia, but that's the difference. Yeah, um

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yandex  You know, we've talked about this before so there are two ways you can have an android handset one is  Just pure open source, but you get no google services  Uh the other but your customers. I think if you're making an android phone want google play store  google maps  Google voice all of the nice google stuff the google-y stuff  And for that you have to get certified by google and I imagine pay them a little bit  Um  And those are not those are proprietary. Those are not open source those those  apps and services  Um, if you want to put google play store on your device, you have to install the entire suite of google  Services gms services and google by the way also has to be default search  on your browser  Uh, yandex also complains that in addition to that not this is news to me device  Manufacturers are increasingly prohibited from installing any services from google competitors on their devices  That's kind of interesting it makes me wonder about this rumor samsung  Uh, and we'll we'll see the galaxy s6

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Probably at mobile world congress. How long off is that now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it's march 5th, right?  Yeah, mike elgin's going we're sending a team out there because I think this is  Increasingly the most interesting conference because this is where all the all the new  Phones and tablets get announced  um the rumor, uh  And I think this might be a good rumor because it makes a lot of sense. It seems plausible to me  Is that the galaxy s6 will not have samsung apps?  They'll still have to have google apps like the google play store  But will not have samsung apps but instead  microsoft apps

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I saw that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which I think is very intriguing

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It won't have samsung apps, but we'll have microsoft apps. Yeah  in android

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah  So microsoft so sam so it'll still have the google play store and google services. I think i'm guessing  Because that customers do want that but who wants samsung's crap

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  bloatware bloatware bloatware

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  S health s s voice the one I by the way, I carry a note four  Because finally and I did not want an s5 because I want google voice google dictation  I don't want samsung's s voice  Which is based on nuance and I don't like it  And it was very hard to make it just go away on older versions on the note four. I never see s voice  samsung's listening in fact  According to this rumor  Uh, you could still get the s voice if you want on the galaxy apps store  Or chip in by the way jason if you have anything to add on this because this is really all about android's beat  Uh, but they are instead of installing the samsung calendar the samsung browser the samsung  Uh contacts all the samsung bloatware. They're gonna put microsoft  In frances google calendar google mail. No, I think they still have to put all the gullies. Yeah. Oh, I see  I think it would be suicide. This is a mean at  Business people so right now when I get a note four I have two calendars  I have the google calendar or I can download it if it's not on here  And I have the samsung calendar. I have two stores. I have the samsung store. I have the google store  I have uh two music players. I have you know, it's it's because and this is true most uh skinned  Android devices, right? They have htc's version of all those apps in addition to the google versions  So what they're saying and by the way, and when I pull out my pen on my note for a samsung note-taking app launches  Not google keep  What they're saying is one note microsoft one note will launch  instead  office mobile  Skype and maybe they say a free office 365 subscription. This makes sense given the way microsoft's very aggressively pushing  office onto tablets  and mobile  Um, i'm very intrigued

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's an interesting switch if it does happen  only because for  You know the past three four years. We've gotten very used to  Kind of putting samsung in a similar category as apple in the sense that samsung really wants to provide its services front and center  And it wants that to be the thing that its users use of course  We probably talked on this show and a lot of other shows on the network that  Not everybody's using those those apps and services on samsung devices, even though they're shipped with right  But this would all if this happens. It's almost an admission by samsung that that isn't working  Uh in a sense because it's basically them saying all right cool. We tried it. It's not working here  Let's let microsoft in and I don't think you're gonna see  This release without google's apps and services. I think that would be

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Suicide because then if they put the they want to put the play store on there, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I wouldn't buy it without that. No, because I was getting ready to say why not just go stock android like stock android has all right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like why microsoft why I think for a bit. I think you I think jeff was right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've admitted that their own stuff is crap it doesn't need to be but it is  They're trying to upgrade the hardware a lot and do creative new things in the phone  Okay, that's a good way and then they're going to try to appeal to a business customer base  And I wonder what the business you  How many expensive expense account bought phones now are iphone versus android versus blueberry, right?  versus

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nokia microsoft there's another reason by the way that mary joe foley came up with this on windows weekly and I think she's accurate  samsung and microsoft  Microsoft was suing samsung saying because my samsung pays microsoft  This is really bizarre  Microsoft has always asserted that it has patents on the linux operating system that it actually owns  And has been indemnifying linux companies saying okay. We won't sue you if you pay us some money  Of course linux is the root operating system for android  In 2011 samsung agreed to cross license  android from microsoft  and  According to some court documents that were released  Samsung has paid microsoft a billion dollars a year ever since  For android for android microsoft to microsoft to microsoft  Uh, in fact, we've known for a long time that microsoft makes a lot of money on android people have estimated as much as five dollars  an android handset  But all of a sudden  Last week last week  They buried the hatchet  We don't know the details of the agreement. Okay, that all fits together nicely. Yes  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Makes a lot more sense now. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's fascinating

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If that's the case, it's still very interesting that that would be  Kind of the the straw that breaks samsung's  Back as far as their services are concerned. It's not like you can't get them  It's not like interested people can't install them  But it's if all along samsung's been relying on the fact that well if it ships on the device then people are more likely to use it  A lot of people are never going to install it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because they never have used well and and then samsung said or this rumor  I should say says that samsung would still put the samsung app store on its devices  I don't see any reason why they wouldn't right and in the app store you could get s health s voice all the other samsung apps  So it's really the best of all worlds  so the so the  What happened is that when microsoft bought nokia samsung went back and said hey that invalidates our across licensing agreements  Uh, and we're going to stop paying you  And so microsoft sued samsung saying you owe us something like a third of a billion dollars  In uh outstanding license fees  But that got all got dropped last week  So now I think it all makes sense and some apps got added. Yeah. Yeah  And maybe samsung will I don't know how it's going to work most will pay microsoft for the apps  i'm not sure but and they're not nobody's saying but  I don't think it's a bad thing as somebody who uses samsung phones. I've always hated touch wiz. I've always hated samsung bloatware  We you know, a lot of us have bought google play edition versions of samsung devices  um, I  I would not use an s5 for that reason. I like the note 4 because samsung's really downplayed the touch wiz

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh on it and I think how big is the s6 supposed to be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Screen, I don't know. Do you know what's the rumor? That's a that's a really good question  I don't know what the rumor is pointing at. I feel like I saw something that that even said it might be going  In the reverse direction. I don't think it'll be uh size wise. Yeah, I don't think it'll be note sized. I don't really know. Yeah. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um, they're saying some of the rumors are five inches, right? Exactly. Yeah going backwards. I think that's gonna that's gonna feel dinky to me now  Well, but then they have the note which is 5.7 inches. I this is such the note 4 is actually a great phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it I just saw what do you think about the third the the rounded screen the edge?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't have the edge. Yeah, I reviewed the edge. I was underwhelmed. It's weird to hold

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The edge has what do you care? What do you what do you holster?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um, I have a nexus 5 and I have a note 3

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh my and you like the big the big note 3 screen or no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do. I love it and I use I use the uh,  On my I use the you know the pen, right? Yeah, do you use that?  Yeah, you use it. I would like to have I use it. I use it in evernote a lot, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, so that's what's cool about that is the stylus which I don't ever use  But I just like a big screen and it's the best it's easily the best screen out there  It's also a really good camera. So get this this was an article  From phone arena.com. They've been doing a lot of camera phone  Comparisons, but this is a wild one. They took the galaxy note 4  An iphone 6 plus and a canon  Eos 650 d a dslr  Shot the same scene three times did a blind  testing  And guess who won  the camera phones  Wow, there's a couple of theories why one is that the iphone  Does do some over saturating of colors if you look at this tiger's nose  The left hand one is probably the most accurate. It's certainly the the crispest is from the it's from the canon  The iphone 6 though looks more vivid right? The colors are more saturated and the galaxy note 4 has all the galaxy phones  Uh over sharpened so everything's very crisp  And I think the companies both samsung and apple realize that these are more appealing  To the naked eye than the more accurate  eos  Uh picture we can look at a little bit more the iphone 6 looks like hd. Yeah, because it's so colorful  Is it more accurate? No  But but people aren't looking for accuracy  Accuracy in every respect if you look for accuracy like at this image the the the dslr is much more accurate  But the brighter colors of the iphone and the crisper edges of the note 4  Seem to appeal to people anyway, they did I mean it's a blind test  It's pretty amazing phonearena.com if you want to see those results  This is a good example. Actually the uh  And they don't tell you which is which?  One do you like the best of this russian building?  d e or f  I I think f must be the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  dslr, but I don't know but I like d

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm like a d that's definitely a note 4 I could tell I could tell and this would be the iphone because the color  renditions, but uh  Let's see do they tell you  It's a blind comparison they don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'll never know you'll never know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have to tell you hey they do somewhere. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's the there's the actual picture that's got to be the yeah, this is the high resolution  dslr version that's got to be an iphone. I don't know  It's fun, but just shows you what you may think  According to the article the galaxy note 4 dominated the comparison beating both other cameras

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like the note 4 camera I do  And you can see the poll results and they got 16 000 votes on this in this one seen the tiger knows  Uh, the note 4 actually did not do well the iphone 6 plus 1 that's because of color, right?  Yeah, yeah the note 4 in comparison looks pretty flat. So uh, oh I got it wrong  The middle one of the building was the uh  Dslr the note 4 was the one I thought was a dslr see how much crisper that is  The iphone 6 plus and of this one the note 4 won handily  Not even close by the way 2 of 15 000  791 votes picked a dslr image is the best. Wow only 2  This is fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that just shows that more people are getting used to doing photography with their phone. Yeah, and they like it better

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This one the maybe our eyes are being trained because we're so used to I was so wrong

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's it's it's like uh, kind of like mp3s, right?  Yeah, lower quality mp3s, but yet over time our ears get used to it and get used to it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I hate the modern world

Transcript:  Ara is is more and more it's fascinating me just just from the fact that we're starting to see hardware manufacturers  Publish or you know kind of talk a little bit about the modules that can plug into it  There's one company that we talked about on albent android a couple of weeks ago  I can't remember the name of the company. They're currently working on 100 modules. Yeah for ara  I remember reading that sennheiser has a bunch of like high  High-fidelity audio components to plug into it  It's it's becoming less of like a modular phone and more just a modular device or an upgrade  What do you want it to do an upgradable device? Yeah, right? Yeah. Well, it's fascinating that you can create an accessory

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it's over it feels kind of similar to the helpouts thing, right?  It's like we were talking about earlier a bunch of people, you know spend their time, uh creating  You know creating their livelihood around something like when glass  You know and when many people will correct you and say glass is an ending  It's just going in a different direction  We're probably not going to see the fruits of that direction for another couple of years  So in some senses it is kind of ending but a lot of people  Uh poured their time for a year or two into development specifically for glass  Thinking that they're in the beginnings of something that's going to turn into something great and they're going to kind of ride the wave and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ultimately what happened charged we're done for now. I I think you're right jason and and google  Chose I saw some story. I think we talked about it in the show at one point  Google could have charged a lot less but they kind of wanted to charge that much money to you know, get the serious people  Google wasn't serious about serious suckers  right  Well, it was there are 2200 bucks but add in the frames which I had to buy which were then like a week later were free  And then add in the prescription expensive lenses that I have to have

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Lynn you upgraded you upgraded your glass, right? Yeah, I upgraded. Um

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I wore it, uh the morning that we surprised lucy  With uh her trip to disneyland see there you go and you got her video I bet right?  Yes, but that's that's pretty much the only time I use glass you would have the same result  Thing is happening. I want to record it without holding a device in front of me

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, so i'll put this on and you could have made a hat with a gopro embedded in it. It would have been the same completely

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, maybe it looks a little bit less dorky than a hat with a gopro. No, it doesn't. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  But I did say I didn't think it was the future of wearables though  Yeah, I think I think that wearables is going to have to be more seamless. Right? I agree

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, like like these  My argument about about this is that this is two-thirds of the functionality of class  Instructions and alerts are here and they didn't need to be here. What needs to be here or here is a camera  As jason just said and and that needs to be rethought. I think there is an idea of an always ready capture what you see  Camera, I think still has legs as long as it has a red light for privacy warning. Yeah, I agree. Yeah, that's true

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  breaking story  Just came in steve kovac writing in the business insider samsung has  Officially acquired loop pay we'd heard this rumor for some time. It's  Another way to do touch and pay although a little more flexible  Than apple pay it will work through traditional magnetic credit card readers  As well as touch to pay devices  Um  so  I the thinking is this might be a galaxy s6 feature  You can swipe your phone. Is that right?  Or you just put it near the swiper, I guess

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, so i'm confused  Each that's proprietary. So somebody has to sign up for the for the loop pay samsung thing. No  It'll work with apple pay. It'll work with what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It'll work. Well, this is the thing that's interesting first  You've always had touch to pay with any android device with nfc and google wallet, right?  Or if you use the carrier wallets like uh, and if the vendor had the right thing, which I hardly ever see right but  Well, no, you're wrong now because of apple pay  So it's compatible with apple pay all the people who have apple pay also will allow you to use a google wallet  I don't know if anybody who has only apple pay. I didn't even know that I had no idea  So you'll see an icon that looks like a fish dinner  Like the bones of a fish dinner  That's the touch to pay icon. That's always next to the apple pay icon. You can do one you can do the other  But what's interesting about loop pay it goes one step farther. Remember that card coin  The idea was you put all your credit cards into this device  It would generate a magnetic field that a stripe reader would say. Oh, I see you're using your visa card  This does that as well  Now in the past the loop pay has had a case that you'd have to put on your smartphone  You don't swipe it you just have to put it next to the credit card reader. So  in addition  So this in theory would add more payment methods  to the samsung galaxy s6  Than apple pay so anywhere you can use apple pay you could use the nfc touch to pay  Using your google wallet or your soft card or whatever you've got for a wallet  But now you'll also be able to send a magnetic field that regular credit card readers

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Magnetic field that's interesting. Yeah, this is the icon you were talking about, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like a fish dinner. Not the thing on the left, right?  Not the phone, but just this just a little fish dinner on the right there  I think this whole thing about I mean swiping is gone as soon. I hope one hopes  So, I don't know how important this is but it would give the s6 kind of a leg up  You could say everything it can everything the apple pay can do and more

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it does. I mean people want frictionless payments, right?  well  It gives a leg up

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  More options. I feel like though if a store like let's whole foods, which has  Tap to pay everybody's kind of used to it now. They all the clerks by now have seen somebody do it  They're not freaking out if but a store that just has a swipe credit card standard credit card reader  Has never done touch to pay you come and say well, let me just rub my phone against it  My dry cleaners are not going to go. Oh fine  They're going to think some sort of devil devilry is in play here

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you sure you're sure it's all card readers  It's not card readers most activated with loop pay according to steve most standard magnetic card readers

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because what it does is it makes a field that looks like a stripe right? Okay  Um, so samsung has agreed to acquire loop pay  Loop pays technology. This is the samsung press release has the potential work in approximately 90 of existing point-of-sale terminals  with no investment in new infrastructure  merchants are buying it in the u.s. Anyway, because  Of federal mandates so  Interesting though. Okay, so that's just in  breaking news  Samsung also has its own exynos chip a 14 nanometer 64 bit eight core  Processor, which they don't use exynos in the u.s. They usually  Opt for the qualcomm  snapdragon because it adds us  Freak radio frequencies, but i've had samsung phones with the exynos. That's what they sell in the rest of the world

They've stopped blocking the devices  Uh, mostly because the fcc required it at and t has met all of their almost all of their unlocking requirements  Um  T-mobile not so fast  Uh t-mobile is not doing apparently a very good job and doesn't even really know what you're talking about

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And see this this is interesting to me because years ago when I used to go overseas  I used to call up t-mobile and say hey, I need to use a foreign sim in my phone  So can you unlock my phone and they would do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now most people or many people use unlocked phones with t-mobile. I mean, that's one of the reasons I like t-mobile  I just put a sim in and I use it with my unlocked phones like your nexus 5 or my 6 or  But t-mobile will here's their policy will unlock post-paid devices  But adds restrictions preventing customers from unlocking more than two devices per line of service in a 12 month period  They also require devices on their monthly plans to been active for at least 40 days  Even if the contract expires after a month under t-mobile's un-carrier policies and all dues have been paid  um  Anyway, this is a good he's a technology fellow at the eff. Thank you cina  um, and the article is at uh,  cina.sina.is  Little report card  On the uh on the unlocking  So don't don't leap to the conclusion that unlocking is here completely  Well, let's see what else um  Real quickly running through the other headlines  We mentioned we've been talking about facebook and the memorializing of websites facebook now allows you as google does to designate a digital air  A legacy contact for your digital afterlife once you go  Uh you the person in charge can say to facebook, okay  They're gone  freeze the account  Uh turn it memorialize the account google's been able to do this too, right the inactive account manager they call it  A nice way to put it  So now when you make your will in addition to everything else you have to do like handing over your google password  And your facebook password you need to designate a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, so it's also an interesting video. It's fun. Smith said people like david caro speak their minds and tell the truth  There are few and far between there should be more

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  David cars there is today. Unfortunately david was amazing. He and I didn't agree about about some things occasionally  Uh in in the movie page one, he used what would google do as a prop for his laptop keyboard?  Um, which I think might have been a message I went to the I didn't go to get to go to the funeral  But I went to the wake  And it was incredible absolutely jammed  Carl bernstein bernstein standing to my left brian stelter in front of me three editors in the new york times there  He was a champion of stelter, right?  Uh, very much so a great line from page one that he said brian stelter was a robot built to destroy me  And then he mentored him and he mentored him like crazy and and and and with great mutual respect incredible  And uh, lena dunham spoke at the wake tom arnold spoke at the wake  They've been friends for more than 30 years for the last 27 years didn't drink or do other nasty things  Um, it was pretty incredible. Yes. Yeah, they did in their time but uh  Uh, so it was he's david was an incredible incredible character and the outpouring on twitter that night  Uh that he died was unbelievable. Yeah, my lights are going out. Yeah, um

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, that's not a that's not a metaphor or anything. Uh, his lights are actually going out

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Get those tweets ready people

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you know him at all linda or no, I didn't just write him. Yeah, I read him religiously. Um  Yeah, very sad because I had just read his wonderful piece  In the times, you know, I started subscribing to the the paper version of the times last week  And uh, you know, it's mind-boggling. That's there's a lot of content every single day in that thing  Why did why why did you just start with the paper? I just you know, we had on our uh,  On our little vacation lisa and I got the times every morning in the hotel room and I remember how much I love  Reading it what I forgot is how long it takes. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but you know, I I I tweeted that somebody from the times an editor from the times tweeted that that  Uh, who's doing the latin american stuff at the time is really interesting  Uh lynn polgren she she tweeted that um  On the new yorker. She has the scripture of the new yorker, but she has never read the paper version  She reads it online. So I turned around and asked and I said well the same thing here  The the thing is that we subscribed to the print new york times because the deal is better  Than just subscribing to digital alone, but we don't read the print paper  Now what this means from a business perspective is the times is artificially right? Um  Holding up print for obvious reasons print subscribers are more valuable than digital subscribers at some point  The advertisers are going to figure this out that some large proportion of times print subscribers  Only subscribe to it to get the better deal on digital. I did for a long time

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just got the sunday times and I would read and I wouldn't read it  I would just read the the digital stuff  But you don't get everything you get in the digital stuff where you don't see as much as you do  When you have the paper there, I think the app the android app is how I use it and it's just great and I wander through

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The times and I I give the same serendipity lynn. What about you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I well I used to get the weekend print, you know now I do the android app and sometimes mobile  But I feel like with print the findability is is easier. That's just that's just my take on it in particular for me

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  international stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like I felt like I was reading more when I did get the print yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mike elgin also gets the print version of the times and he and I were talking  And he says I don't think of it as a newspaper. I think it has the first draft of history. It's online  I can't remember who said that there's my uh, there's my cup of coffee in the new york times from I think yesterday  um  But but particularly for the news stories that I probably wouldn't read  about greek debt  And things like that I get because it's there and in front of me  I think I get I read I know more about what's going on internationally than I would if I didn't have the print

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have the times the new android beta here. Is that the paper duplicate or is that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, this is just a beta. They don't have a version of the paper. That's digital. That's the whole paper. I hate that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But now what you do is is that you just swipe from section to section  So you swipe and and roll  And and and that way it's a lot easier to find this heredity by the way speaking of swiping  Have you played with did we talk about this in the show?  Stem chance discover no

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Swipe left, uh, yeah, I think we did talk about this because neck bilton was on a couple of weeks ago  And he just written an article for the times  He explained to you why do you snapchat? Yeah, and uh, and uh  I think this is a brilliant, um  Monetization strategy for snapchat, but you know what? I stopped using it. You know why because I want stuff to live on  If i'm gonna put all the time and energy into making a video.

I love storehouse where you can take a story publish it and it's there forever  I'm not fish rap

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you may not be  but  um  The stories that appear there aren't newsy. I I think it's darn good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's really interesting what care what katie uh cork is doing with yahoo news for instance  Where it's a whole newscast and you swipe you swipe you swipe and you're done  It makes more sense for me if I think about my son for instance  Who's 20 is really into snapchat all his friends are that's their app  They don't they use it to almost the exclusion of everything else  And um, I can see him looking at the espn  Property

Transcript:  All right, all right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I think it's very interesting and I got very engaged in it after nick showed me how to use it and create stories  Lynn this is what you do for a living. Do you counsel brands and people and companies to use snapchat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um stories. Yeah, definitely. I mean it's a great way to do a breaking story, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Especially if you're a brand that caters to younger people. Well, that's the thing. It's how you can reach 18 to 25 year olds basically  It's the only way you can reach 18 to 25 year olds  What do you get if you do?  If you do this, you know brand thing with snapchat. Do you get  numbers at you know engagement numbers or

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  views we don't know yet, I mean the the the thing that you need to do  That these companies all of them need to do is they need to find they do need to find ways that you have a business benefit  In terms of douglas, you can't monetize snapchat. It's only for discovery, right?  But you you need to find there needs to be some linkage to you in some way there needs to be there needs to be more  discussion of that but nonetheless  Yeah, the the idea of making everybody come to you and your website

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not loaded. Well, I know that that's why we're redoing our whole web  presence

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just as I said, so I just said, you know websites are dead and now you're spending

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A million dollars on euros. No, no, no, we're not though. That's the whole point  We're spending on the api on the api on a public api, which the website is one consumer of but not the only consumer of  Right, but I did I did tell our news division. I talked to mike and megan. I said, you know, you really ought to think about  Uh doing a little snapchat news  But what would we gain from that?  discovery

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's it's happening. Yeah, i'm I mean that's what that's what all of using all of social media is about right?  It's about discovery, right? So how are they going to discover us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No

Transcript:  You have to be you have to you have to spend some money just like you know facebook early days  You had to spend money to be a really big brand on facebook. Yeah baratunde and nick are both using uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Snapchat to do interesting things, but it makes me sad because whatever they do, however interesting it is 24 hours from now  It's gone forever

Transcript:  But that's why you have to create these things in more than one way, right?  You have to okay. You have to tell you have to tell a story  on different  platforms

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
