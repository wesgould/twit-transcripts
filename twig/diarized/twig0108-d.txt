Great to see you once again, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Great to see you.  So glad to have the Core 3 back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yay.  I know I missed you guys.  Did I miss two shows?  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, actually just one.  Just one?  But Jeff, but neither you or Jeff were in last week's show, so I was cold and frightened.  It was lovely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As you said, on Google+, we got the band back together.  Yeah.  Jeff Jarvis is here also from the City University of New York where he teaches journalism.  He's also a blogger at BuzzMachine.com.  The author of-  On Bass.  On Bass?  The band.  Yeah.  On Bass, that's the name of our band?  No, I'm On Bass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, On Bass.  Jeff Jarvis, On Bass.  Sorry, I was going for that.  I get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is Gina a drummer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was like, is that a baseball reference?  I didn't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We are so bad.  God, we're a bunch of nerds.  I'll be the drummer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, Gina is our lovely-  Lead singer.  Everybody gets a crush on Lead Singer.  Yeah, she is definitely the lead singer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll be Courtney Love.  Yeah, Courtney Love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you're more pixies, but okay.  Okay.  I'll take that.  Yeah, not so bad.  And then Kevin Marks is also here of Salesforce Now, right?  Yes, that's right, Salesforce.com.  Great to see you, but Kevin's worked everywhere.  It's all delicious.  Including Google itself, the mothership, Apple,  British Telecom, he's an expert in standards  and everything else, including, in fact,  it turns out video lighting.  I didn't know this, but he was a BBC video engineer  when he first started out.  That's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't pass them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How did you transition from that into the internet stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When I was at the BBC, there was a group  called the Interactive Television Unit,  which was the group that made the BBC Doomsday Project,  which some of you may vaguely remember as an attempt  in 1986 to survey the UK and produce an educational  video disc and a computer system around that.  So that lot had finished in 86,  but the unit was still there in 88 when I joined.  And I got a, after I'd been doing mainstream audio,  video stuff for a while, I went and worked there  for an attachment for an internal reassignment.  And then they spun out as a startup in 1990  as Multimedia Corporation, which is where I then worked  for 1990 through 97.  And you did QuickTime at Apple,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so you kind of stayed in the video arena for a while.  That's right, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  We gotta have, you know what, Eileen,  we should get Kevin on triangulation,  because we always talk about the day's events with Kevin,  because he's such a great insight,  but I think his story is fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We might have an opening next week, Kevin.  We'll be in touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the big story, I don't need to say it,  it's probably the tech news story of the summer  broke early on Monday, so early we didn't even get  to do a breaking news feed of it.  It just happened like out of nowhere.  Larry Page holds a phone call and says,  "'We bought Motorola for $12.5 billion."  We should be specific, Motorola Mobility,  which is the cell phone division of Motorola.  But that does include, does it not, the set-top boxes?  Yes.  And that's, you know, I mean, a lot of coverage  over the patents they acquired in this purchase,  7,500 patents, something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  24,500 patents and applications across both areas.  20, well that's a difference.  $400,000 per patent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Holy cow.  But well worth it, because it gave patent,  a patent portfolio, Google only had 1,000 prior to this.  It gave them a patent portfolio to defend themselves  against Microsoft and Apple's Nortel patents, among others.  Although Motorola was doing some saber rattling of its own,  threatening to sue other people last month.  And I know they've been kind of,  people have been talked about suing them.  So does this get Google off the hook,  or does it just make them a bigger target?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it gets them off the hook.  You wrote a great piece on this, Jeff, actually.  Well thanks, and as indelicately as I say anything,  I said that it's really lawyer repellent,  or if you prefer, rat poison.  Because I think that if you look at the fact  that they got HTC, LG, and Sony Ericsson  to say the same PR statement supporting this,  it's about protecting the ecosystem of Android.  And yes, Motorola was gonna start suing them,  it's now not going to.  They have mud balls to fly back to Apple and Nokia  and Microsoft and company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This thing that we call mutually assured destruction  in the patent wars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, it's what I said too,  I think it's a tragedy and a pity  that this much capital, $12.5 billion here,  $5 billion for the Nortel deal,  did not go to investment, to innovation,  to creation, to employment.  It went to fending off lawyers in patent deals.  But fine if it finds a way for some peace  and if we can move ahead with innovation.  And what I imagine, what I hope for,  is that there may be other companies  that were waiting in the wings,  afraid to touch Android, because they were too small.  You know, the fabled iFridge, right?  The connected refrigerator or the new connected TVs  or new connected cars and all kinds of things  that can now use Android with more safety.  That's my hope is, is that having this open system.  Now of course the problem, the irony of this is,  is that Google has to compete with its own suppliers.  This forced it into channel conflict.  Larry Page said that Motorola will be operated separately,  though the head of Motorola said they're gonna integrate,  but I think I believe Larry.  They're assuring the other members of the ecosystem  that this is about protecting Android  and I think that's obviously gotta be the case.  I think the Wall Street analysts who've been dissing this,  thinking that Google's in the phone business  are utter friggin' idiots  who don't get what really happened here.  And finally, my hope is that maybe with Google involved,  we can finally fix the worst computers on earth,  otherwise known as cable set-top boxes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, well of course they got patent benefit,  but it's not mutually exclusive.  It could be that Google does want to,  you know, they have always done deals,  first they did them with HTC and then later with Samsung  to make vanilla Google phones.  I mean, I presume now that the droid line,  the Motorola droid line will become a vanilla Google phone,  so they are in the handset business, I would guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, but could you imagine a scenario  where they get out of that business?  Where they slough parts of that off?  They don't need to be, is what you're saying.  They don't need to be,  and even if the antitrust problems come, they're fine.  You know, we'll get rid of that.  Well, all they just run is a separate division, yeah.  Yeah, but as someone said,  some analysts said at some point that even if they did that,  the patents are still cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you, Kevin Marks, reassured by the partners,  Samsung, HTC, LG, saying, oh, this is fine, this is good,  we're not worried, or do you think that's lip service  and they're watching with narrowed eyes  to see what Google does next?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's both.  I think they are reassured  because this patent thing was a mess.  You know, they're all being sued by Apple and Microsoft  and everyone else as well.  Samsung's gotta be thrilled.  You know, Jeff's right, there's a rat's nest  of lawsuits around this as well.  If you look at the graph of who's suing whom,  it is ridiculous.  So I think Google historically has been good  about using patents defensively  and clearly do want the Android ecosystem to succeed.  They have more invested in it succeeding than anyone else.  So I should think there's a fair bit of honesty in that.  It's like, good, we don't actually have to pay  Bournemouth's blackmail to make Android devices anymore.  If we can get to that, that'd be great.  That was the piece that they'll be feeling.  Yeah, there'll be some concern  about Google owning a potential manufacturing competitor.  But one thing that Google has done historically with Android  is for each release, they've worked with one manufacturer  to build the exemplar for that release.  You know, if you think back,  they did it with Motorola with the first droid.  That was the one that they said,  okay, this release of Android is going out on this phone.  This is the exciting new phone and we'll do that.  And they did one with HTC and they've done it  with the others and they've been rotating through that.  They may need to rethink that  and be a bit more even handed about that  and release multiple in one go.  But I would think that that would be good  for the ecosystem as well.  The other piece of this is,  as I spoke about this before in January,  is that there are actually two bits to Android.  There's the open source bit, which is everywhere.  It's literally on all kinds of devices  and the company is too small to use that.  And a lot of the sort of weird  Chinese consumer electronics companies  that are speculatively making random devices  that you buy in Kmart or Walmart  will be Android or becoming Android devices  because it's easier than writing their own firmware.  And that piece is, that is still gonna carry on  and they're much less worried about lawsuits in that realm  because they tend to be small companies  that they can fold up and throw away if something happens.  But the other piece is the with Google part  of Android, if you look on any of the mainstream  Android phones, somewhere in the back it says with Google,  which means they've signed an agreement with Google  that lets them have maps and Gmail and the Android market  and a whole bunch of other bits and pieces.  And that's the piece that Google has used  as a licensing control to say you have to conform  to certain things to be an Android phone.  That's been their hookup to now.  So there's already been this bipartite model for Android  and I think that will continue.  The patent protections that apply to both halves of that.  But it may be that they'll adjust the way  that they do business with that.  But if they've already got an objective standard  you have to agree to to be an Android licensee,  they can use that as the wall between them  and Motorola if they want to as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Zeo, I put a document up on the, sorry, Gene,  but before you get a chance with a paragraph  with details on the patents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's your sense though?  Of the risk involved here,  Standard and Poor downgraded,  in fact they made a sell recommendation on Google stock.  Saying their analysts said that they weren't sure  if the patents would help protect Android or Google.  There's also the issue of they paid 12.5 billion.  Now Google had more than 30 billion in cash  so they could afford it.  But it is more than two years worth of Google revenue  combined for 12.5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In stock or in cash?  I didn't see that written down.  I didn't see that either.  I believe it's cash.  It's actually cash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I believe so.  That's weird,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  because I would think they would do an acquisition  mostly in stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well it's a hell of a deal for Motorola shareholders  who just got rescued.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And let's point out,  Motorola, the mobility division,  had not been profitable for a while.  In fact for a while they gave up cell phones entirely.  They had a net loss for the second quarter of this year  of $56 million.  This is not a healthy company they're buying,  which does kind of confirm the belief  that they're buying them for the patents alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well yeah, let's note that S&P downgraded America  and what did people have to buy next?  T-BILTS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, let's take all of our money.  S&P-evalued junk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Could we please picket S&P as a bunch of bloody idiots?  Okay.  Anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think what they're saying is not unreasonable.  Looking at the balance sheet alone,  it's a fairly,  I think even Google must agree,  this is a fairly risky thing.  This isn't like a no-brainer for Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, but Leo, by that account of course,  then Google stock should have cratered with YouTube.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, in hindsight, it probably should have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yes and no,  but it was, it turned out to be, no, but in-  And it was only three or four billion, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not 12 and a half billion dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was 600 million.  Right, but they didn't get it.  Was it 600 million?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They got a lawsuit instead.  Yeah.  That was-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think, is it the case that because Google lost

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the Nortel patents to Microsoft, Apple,  that consortium,  that, do you think that this deal was in process  at that point or that they,  this happened five weeks ago,  that they scrambled in those five weeks and said,  quick, we need, we needed a set, plan B.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who knows?  Microsoft supposedly bidding as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, that was one story was that my,  I think it was a O'Malley story was that Microsoft  had been eyeing Motorola.  Boy, that would really put the screws on Google  to do something.  Because if Microsoft has Nortel and Motorola.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And has Nokia as well.  And Nokia.  Yeah.  And I trust.  So the other thing that a couple of commentators  pointed out is that Motorola has a Java license  because historically they've done it for their phones,  which Google hasn't up to now.  That solves the Oracle problem.  The Oracle problem as well,  if they can convey that one correctly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Motorola also has patents in near field communications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to know why none of us saw this coming.  Why didn't anybody,  why did no tech journalist say, hey, you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was a great Monday morning.  It was such a good bombshell, right?  It was great.  It was like, what?  I know that this is mostly about the patents.  And I know that it's about protecting Android  and all that, but I'm still really,  or wondering and excited about what this is going to mean  for consumers.  I mean, my first reaction was like,  I cannot wait to see what the next pure Google experience  phone is going to be.  And no doubt it's going to be in Motorola phone  or Google Rola phone.  But that's apparently not necessarily the case.  Google's still going to have different manufacturers bid  on the next Nexus phone  and they're going to choose the best one.  And I understand they need to put up this wall  and they don't want to scare off their other,  Samsung and HT and all those other guys.  But I have to tell you,  I really would like to see Google get involved,  closely involved with Motorola,  whoever is being operated  and make just awesome, awesome phones and Google TV units.  And I got to tell you, I'd like to see them,  tighten the clamps on what they put that by Google  or with Google stamp on.  I'd like to see them say things like,  we're going to standardize the order of the buttons  on the phone.  Yes, thank you.  I would like to see them say,  no, you're not going to ship Android phones  with crapware pre-installed that users cannot uninstall.  If you're going to do that,  you're not going to use the Google name.  Like I'd like to see them take a little more control  and raise the bar for what a great Android phone  experience is.  Because I mean, I've only had-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what they should do if they really wanted  to go crazy is buy Sprint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, they're right, there you go.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that was-  I'm rooting for it.  I would love to see that.  Gina, let me ask you a question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The one they were saying that Apple should buy T-Mobile  but also said, but maybe it would make more sense  for Google to buy them,  which is, you know, that partly just keep them away  from AT&T was-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But then the regulators really get involved  because then-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll get Google closer to Germany, which is a good thing.  Yeah.  Gina, let me ask you a question here.  So I agree with you.  One of the commenters I said also said  you've got a lot of engineers on the hardware side  at Motorola.  What struck me as interesting here is that those people  could inform the design of Android to really well  to find closer ties in between hardware  and the operating system.  And the irony to me is that probably wouldn't be done  for Motorola's benefit because what's more valuable here  is Android.  That the proprietary engineering of Motorola  could end up becoming more open through Android.  Does that make any sense?  Yeah.  Yeah, that does make some sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do think that that makes sense.  I mean, if you have more communication  between the software people, the software engineers,  and the hardware engineers, that's great for everyone.  That means better phones.  And if they can make more information public  or if they can collaborate more closely,  that could be better for everyone.  I mean, it gets a sticky wicket.  That's also the thing that Samsung and HTC  are worried about, right?  That Motorola is gonna have access to maybe hidden APIs  or information sooner than other suppliers.  I mean, it gets weird.  But I have to tell you,  I think the consumer is the most important thing.  I wanna see a great Android phone on the market.  Not the Nexus 1 or the Nexus S,  where only nerds with a lot of money have it, right?  I want real consumers to have an awesome Android phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A Droid X or something like that.  I thought the Droid X was a great handset.  But, and the chat room's saying this,  thank God we can kill Moto Blur,  which is their sugar on top of Android in this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me get, we'll just advocate for a second here.  Because I'm optimist, polyoptimist all the time.  So I agree with everything we've said.  Now, on the other hand,  what happened when Google got close to phone companies  in its business by necessity?  It did the devil's deal with Verizon.  The Verizon deal, yeah.  So on the one hand, we might be thinking,  ooh, the world's best phone, cheap or free,  this is wonderful.  But then it's only gonna piss off  its own manufacturers even more  because now it's in channel conflict.  So could this in fact put Google more on the side  of the hardware manufacturers,  like the phone companies, against us, the consumers?  That's the devil speaking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'd be surprised.  I think, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd be sad. I think Google knows how to do this.  I hope they know how to build a firewall.  I think so too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the other side of this.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They've said, okay, you know,  if you look at how they've done previous releases,  they've said, okay, we'll work with one of you  to build the reference one.  And they rotate through different manufacturers  and done that.  That has been a reasonably successful thing to do.  And I think, yeah, as Gina says,  they could use this to encourage more.  They could also bring some of the hardware  engineering things and bring that out more publicly.  Somebody said-  I think the set-top box piece is also fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I wanna get to that.  Let's do it in a second.  Because there's definitely something there,  but I wanna finish the phone conversation.  Somebody said-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, we said there were a couple of other stories  talking about HD Android phones coming,  VentureBeat and GigaROM, we're talking about that today.  Saying that they've got larger HD screens showing up  that are actually, you know,  one of the four by seven-  Retina display style, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you tried the 3D phone, that makes no sense.  That's terrible, and I have seen them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But one of the reasons I liked the droid in the first place  was that it had a very high pixel density  before Apple gave that a name, called it Retina display.  This is like 256.  If you take that same density and add more pixels,  you end up with something that's closer to the,  those are the, what do you call them, the EVO Androids.  But actually, you know, this is 854 by 480.  If you grow that up to 184 by 720,  you get something that's about the size of those EVOs,  but actually is a full HD screen  and is closer to an iPad in terms of number of pixels.  And I think that's an enhancement.  I think having more pixels in a smaller space  is always good.  And I'm sure Apple will be going there soon too, but-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But competition is good.  We want this competition.  Of course, Apple's gonna-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  And I think as the, you know,  as the Heidenkirchen Ice Cream Sandwich releases come out  and the sort of the high definition UI  starts making more sense,  that will make sense in these smaller form factors as well.  That's something I do like about the Galaxy 10 One  is that that UX actually doesn't make much sense  and makes good use of those extra pixels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, I think I had some other questions,  but I think we're gonna take a break  and come back and talk more about this acquisition  in terms of the set-top boxes,  because I think it does impact Google TV.  I was just looking through Google acquisitions.  Clearly, this is the largest ever.  The next biggest ever was DoubleClick.  So you go from, this is a mashable list,  12.5 billion for Motorola Mobility,  3.1 billion, one quarter that size for DoubleClick,  that was just last year, or actually, no, 2007.  YouTube was 1.6 billion.  Oh, okay, wrong, wrong, wrong.  750,000 for AdMob.  The ITA acquisition, which I still think hasn't gone through,  has that gone through?  Has it been approved yet?  700 million.  I know that the regulators were concerned about that.  So this is a massive bet on Google's part, an expensive-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I suppose, I mean, you could express those  as fractions of cash on hand or fractions of market cap.  That's true.  Doing them in raw dollars is a bit strange  when Google is worth a lot more now than it was  when it was before YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and in that respect, they could certainly afford it.  Interesting, there's a two and a half billion dollar  breakup fee, which is outrageous.  Will there be regulator issues with this acquisition?  I guess, I suppose it has to be approved, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, anything involving Google now  is gonna be a hot button.  But it's hard to see, it's not like they're taking,  there's no monopoly here, there's plenty of competition.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it though a little bit like the movie companies  owning their distribution, the movie theaters,  is it a little bit like-  I think it'd be more so, Leo,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  if they bought the phone company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, oh, I was joking, there's no way.  I wish they could buy Sprint, but there's no way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think in this case, they're gonna say,  what are they gonna say to the regulators?  They're gonna say, Android is open, we license it freely,  we will not restrict it to any manufacturer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They may get some covenants though,  that they, for instance, can't stop doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't, you know, what are they gonna say?  Hey, you want us to, we'll license it to Apple.  Yeah, we'd love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hello?  Somebody said, and I think this is true,  that Google's learned the lesson that Microsoft's learned  that you can't just make the operating system,  you have to have a hardware partner,  Microsoft, Nokia, Google, Motorola, is that the case?  You can't just be an OS company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not buying that argument,  there's Apple envy as an argument out there,  and I'm not buying that one,  I think this is a necessity they had to get to,  but that's why I say that if they got rid of the hardware,  it wouldn't hurt them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't mean envy, I mean merely that the economics of it  are that you have to have, you have to make a handset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, because that's not the Google strategy, right?  Eric Schmidt has expressed the Google strategy clearly,  and that's what this really indicates,  is the solidity of the strategy, which is that mobile.  Right, he said late last year  that every single strategic goal for Google  in the next year was mobile,  he said a year before that,  he said the strategy for mobile  is to have the operating system that's on more devices,  thus attracting more developers, thus more apps,  thus more users, thus more value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Could they then spin off the hardware,  or just say what we got was patents, that's what we wanted,  we wanted an unencumbered Android,  or at least a somewhat defended Android,  and now we're happy, it's worth 12.5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And there's an argument that the patents would then be free,  that they could get enough value  out of Motorola hardware manufacturing,  open it up, give it permanent, absolutely free license  to every patent that there is, right,  and the defense around that,  spin that off to something else,  and the patents that they just paid a fortune,  400,000 each for, could be, end up being basically free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like that idea.  Let's take a break, we're gonna come back  and talk about the set-top box,  and then a new job for Cyanogen.  I'm gonna ask Gina about that one.  But before we do that, I wanna talk about Squarespace,  the secret behind exceptional websites,  all of you know that if you don't have a website,  you don't have a presence in the world nowadays.  If you're a business without a website,  it's like a business without a phone 30 years ago.  You just, you gotta have one so that clients and customers  and people who care about you can find you.  Squarespace is a great way to make a website,  even if you have no experience,  you've never done design before, you don't know any,  you don't know CSS from JavaScript,  from a hole in the ground.  Squarespace.com, give it a try right now.  If you go to Squarespace.com and click the try it free button,  you'll see how easy it is to set up a site.  We set up a site on Twit, and we had people designing it  before the show was over.  What was the name, I wonder if that site's...  Oh, that was funny, that was funny, what was that?  It was, what was the name of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twit Cupcakes?  Twit Cupcakes?  Yes.  Twit Cupcakes.  That's Squarespace.com, was that it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me see if the chat remembers.  I don't wanna go to some random site,  and I remember the password was omishungry,  and somebody tried to change it, I changed it back.  Why public sites are a bad idea?  I don't think that's, maybe that is it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe that is it, somebody touched it,  somebody edited it.  Oh, you know who got there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look at, it says remember, remember,  the 5th of November, V has been here.  Look at that.  But that wasn't so impressive.  Okay, that's why public sites are a bad idea.  Okay, so don't give away your password,  just do it yourself.  But it did show you how easy it was to do.  Create the site, all you need is a name,  a password, an email address,  and then you can do everything you could do  on Squarespace yourself, including the templates  that aren't templated, 60 plus designer styles  that look great, and you can modify to your heart's content  without any knowledge of CSS,  just using a mouse, drag and drop, point and click,  but if you know CSS, of course you could do that too.  That's actually nice because it means  you could take your existing site,  use the CSS there, the style sheets there,  and make the Squarespace site look the same.  Furthermore, you could use their import tool  to get the data out of your existing site.  I don't mean just the posts, I mean the links,  they stay the same, yeah, your SEO stays the same,  your images transfer over, even your comments transfer over  from all the big APIs, WordPress, movable type,  blogger, type pad, just really sweet.  And every import has an export,  kind of true to the Google data liberation front motto.  You're never trapped at a Squarespace site.  You're never gonna wanna leave though  because you get the best hosting,  the best software, always up to date.  When version six comes out, you're gonna flip your lid,  great content or stats, so you know exactly  what your visitors are looking at.  Look, you gotta try it free.

The secret behind exceptional websites,  take a look at our inside Twit blog,  that's one of our, that's our Squarespace site,  we just love it.  Ah, all right, let's talk a little bit  about the set top boxes, you wanted to get into that.  I know Kevin Marks.  Motorola Mobility also is one of the two,  there's Scientific Atlanta and there's Motorola,  the big set top box manufacturers.  Many, many, many people who have cable boxes  have Motorola cable boxes.  They're crappy, nobody denies that.  They're underpowered, they couldn't run Google TV  if they tried, but it does give-  Yeah, but it does give Google a, or does it,  a foot into this market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It gives them a supply chain foot.  I mean, also a lot of the reasons those boxes are crap  is not so much the hardware as the software  they're running on rent by cable companies.  True.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that was the whole point of the Google TV  approach at the beginning.  But they are underpowered, I mean, this was,  I know Microsoft really wanted to get into  the set top box business, and really wanted  Microsoft software to be on those boxes,  and couldn't because they just,  the economics of it were, you can't put enough  of a processor in there to run a real operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's not true anymore.  I mean, that was the, you know,  this has been true from the 80s.  When I was at Apple, there was a project-  Apple wanted to do it, that's right.  Quick time on a set top box,  and wherever that was in the late 90s, you know.  There was a whole bunch of attempts at this.  But cable operators didn't want it.  The cable, yeah, the problem is the cable operators,  the ones who are holding the chain there,  and that's the difficult part.  And that's what happened to the Google TV,  they were the ones who shut that down.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you make a Motorola branded Google TV now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Don't know.  Yes, I'm sure.  The question is, would a cable operator distribute it?  Right. Right.  Because the challenge with Google TV was they were saying  that it was, you know, going around them.  And Apple TV does that too, but Apple gets away with that  because their primary use is on other devices,  whereas the Google TV was seen as a direct threat  to their control of the channel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But does Motorola have relationships  or distribution channels that Google could take?  I'm not, I'm sorry, I'm not really sure how this all works  with the relationships and who determines what,  but I mean, it seems like this is an obvious foot in the door  for Google TV.  I mean, they're gonna at least try something with Google TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  They've got the conversation, but you know,  I imagine the way it works is that Motorola goes  to Comcast and says, you know, they bid it out  and we'll give you a hundred thousand, you know,  set top boxes for $15 each.  I know the cost is really low  and the cable operators say, oh, okay.  But I think you're right.  I think it's not merely that it has to be cheap hardware.  It also has to be, has to support their business model,  which Google really doesn't have much interest in doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. And what they value is control.  That's why they want to own the box,  put only the authorized box on there.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So maybe this is another part they spin off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But boy, it would be nice to have a nice box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We can but dream.  Gina, have you fired your Google TV up  in the last six months?  I haven't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I use it.  I use it all the time. You use it?  Yeah, it's my main set top box.  Yes, I totally use it.  I really like having a browser.  So is it much better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cause I keep thinking, oh, I should connect it up  and get the update and see if it's better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's not much better.  It has got the market yet.  So when it gets the market, do that.  When it gets the market, do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As soon as it gets the market, are you kidding?  I'm going to flip my lid.  I'm going to go there immediately.  And I don't know what's holding that up.  What could-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and it's supposed to be this month or next month.  I mean, it's supposed to be late summer.  So soon.  So when that happens, I'll let you know, Leo,  you should definitely hook it up.  I really like it.  I watch weird flash streams and I love, I love, I love-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's sitting in my, you know, my TV's here  and then I get the cupboard with the Apple TV  and the Roku box and the cable box  and every this and that and Xbox 360  and the place, all the stuff under there.  The problem is really I only have seven HDMI ports  and I have like eight devices.  So the Google TV is sitting there, not connected.  And all I have to do is plug it in.  I'll have to figure out which to unplug.  Probably the Apple TV.  I don't ever use that.  And I'm ready to go.  So market, boy, if I could put market on there,  I just think of all the stuff that, you know,  basically put all the Android apps.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's happening?  What's happening over there?  Sorry, I'm having-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Turned to a TV on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She turned on her Google TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I turned on the Google TV and everything just went to hell.  Sorry, I'm back now.  I missed that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But do they have, so did they,  part of the issue with the Google TV  was all the networks cut them off.  Does Hulu Plus work on it?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Hulu's not gonna have anything soon.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hulu's kind of almost out of business, aren't they?  Yep.  Yeah, and the main thing is,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  yeah, the major networks don't work like abc.com  or you're not gonna catch the Bachelor or anything on it.  But I really like being able to search.  I really like being able to check Twitter and search  or like watch Twitter streams  while I'm watching a live event.  And I just like being able to Google stuff from my,  you know, on my machine.  I think that having a browser on the TV  has sort of been an underrated concept.  But that said, wait for the update.  I can't wait.  Once it gets to the market, I think that'll be a big deal.  We need apps, more apps for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I like the idea of a search box on the TV,  which is basically what the point,  that was the high concept there.  And certainly my Comcast remote  has more buttons than a keyboard already.  And they make less sense than a keyboard.  That's true.  That's a good point.  At least the keyboard is something you know.  And I understand.  The other thing that makes sense here  is the thing that Apple has done so nicely  with the iPads and the iPhone and the Apple TVs  of moving stuff seamlessly between them.  So you can use, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's just rebranded DLNA.  You could do that.  Android supports it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, except if you've tried using DLNA,  I got 12 steps into the process and gave up.  The Apple one actually said,  okay, we can integrate this stuff  and make it actually work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's an AirPlay menu.  You select the device.  You click it and it starts playing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you can remote control it, which is great.  Because I've lost three Apple remotes  somewhere in the living room already.  Because those damn things are too small.  My secret with Apple remotes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is the same secret I have for fountain pens.  You just keep, and nail clippers.  Just keep buying them until they're so set,  the space is so saturated with remotes  that it'll be somewhere.  And they're cheap enough and small enough it's easy to do.  I like those new aluminum ones.  All right, so I have a few, say again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just one, Kevin, you're right.  Having a search engine on the TV is exactly what we want.  But that is precisely what this intermediates  the cable model of giving you curated channels  that you don't want to pay for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So yeah, there's a business deal that needs to be done there.  The business piece is the hard piece there, the tech's there.  The other thing to think about with this  is the moving between screen stuff.  Which in some ways is obvious.  Microsoft's been talking about three screens for a long time.  But the other thing is if you've got one of these here,  that's the same number of pixels per radian  as the television is across the room.  And as the laptop is at that distance.  So as these devices get high density screens,  they're effectively the same resolution  as the TV the other time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you don't buy the distinction  between sit back and lean forward?  Do you think it's all really the same  just depending on how close it is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It depends on how you use it.  I think it's changing.  I found that-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's to me the problem with Google TV in a nutshell is  that it is, I have a sit back experience for a TV.  Sit back and watch it.  And the keyboard and mouse requires  is a lean forward interface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, but if you've got a thing in your hand  that you were used to, instead of remote control,  you've got something like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't use a tab, do you use a tab  or do you use the phone?  There's a galaxy tab interface too, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  For the Apple TV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no, for the Google TV.  That's right, you use the Apple TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't have a Google TV.  I never got into that change.  Save 300 bucks.  I used the Apple watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now it's 99.  But Gina and I didn't wait till it was 99.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I've also used double twist on the phone  and on the thing to send stuff to Apple TV  because they reverse engine the protocol.  So my Android devices can send stuff to that as well.  So that I found useful too.  So what I was getting at with these devices  actually becoming, replacing all the other remote controls  and devices, at first seems ridiculous  because these things are far more expensive.  But that is how you get around that problem of the stuff  you get from the cable company has to be cheap and crappy  because they're making low marches on it.  If you're already carrying a device that  costs 10 times as much but has downloadable software,  then that's what you can do.  And that's what Apple has clearly done well  with the Apple TV integration with the other devices.  And it's there for the taking with Android  and these other devices too.  If they can get those sort of business deals  and the coordination together.  And that may be the piece that they can sell  to the cable companies because they're gonna be seeing  the pressure from Apple in that respect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But once again, and I'm not saying this is gonna happen  and I have some faith in Google  because I am the Google fanboy,  but if you're gonna look at devil's scenarios,  the closer Google gets to business  with evil cable companies like evil phone companies  and somewhat evil manufacturers, the worse off we are.  So at some point, if Motorola,  a major customer of Motorola's is cable companies.  And so I'm a little nervous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you know what?  You hit the nail on the head when you said  that every time they do this,  we feel like Google's gonna zig in our favor  and they zag in the company's favor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, and what's their line is that they're making  compromise to make iterative small changes, right?  To do shit, get their foot in the dirt.  All right, all right, I won't defend.  I won't do anything to the device.  All right, all right.  Sorry, I didn't mean to cough and do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm looking at the, is this the link you sent me?  The approach to innovation about Motorola?  Or just has the list of you go.  Leveraging along history and building for the future.  This sounds like a newsreel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This sounds like a newsreel.  As of January 2011, Motorola will own 25,000 patents  and patent applications worldwide.  That's a lot.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mobile devices business segment has 14,600 granted patents.  Another 6,700 pending, including 2G, 3G, 4G, H.264.  Ooh, wait a minute.  H.264 and MPEG-4.  Patents in them.  That's intriguing because of course,  remember it's MPEG LA that's claiming  that WebM is encumbered.  Google may have gotten more than just telephony patents here.  802.11, Open Mobile Alliance, and as you mentioned,  near field communications patents.  Boy, I tell you, I think the tech press  really wasn't paying attention.  We should have cut this.  If it hadn't been August, I think we would have cut this  and said, you know, I think Google should buy Motorola.  This looks like, it looks like the right move  if what you want to do is build a patent defense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A better move than Nortel.  Much better.  They got much, much more than they would have gotten  with Nortel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's point out though, three times as expensive.  Yeah, it's just one half.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  5 million is a chump change compared to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess you're right.  Larry Page, you'll find that in secretions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's about the same per patent.  Somebody did the analysis and if you divide  the number of patents by what they paid,  it's almost exactly the same as what they paid for Nortel.  In fact, someone said it was exactly the same,  which was the impetus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I heard it was, I don't know why,  maybe you wouldn't do the math in your head, Kevin,  but I thought it was more expensive for Nortels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But what was, I don't remember the number though.  It's not the number, it's really,  do you have a business in three years or not?  Yes.  Is what it really, really is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the truth is, this isn't about making  the ultimate Android phone,  this is just about keeping Android free,  keeping that status quo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, Gina, you and I are gonna believe,  we're gonna hope, we're gonna cross our fingers.  I believe in fairies.  It is gonna be a better phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If it can make, if it can make,  if it can make better phones, that's good.  If it can finally get my droid past 2.2,  that'd be great too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe at least we'll get a later version  of the operating system.  I like the Android phones a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They have some room for improvement in the tablet arena.  I think they can do better than the Zoom.  The Zoom?  The Zoom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I never tried an Atrix, but I mean,  I mean, at least it seemed like an interesting idea.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, speaking of patents,  I don't know what's going on here,  but apparently Jeff Bezos has filed a patent,  the guy at Amazon,  has filed a patent for airbags for phones.  It's an airbag that inflates around your device  if you drop it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like it.  That's kind of crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why not?  You've got the accelerometer in there.  You really wouldn't want this to inflate  while you're holding the phone into your ear.  Could be a potential problem, but...  I think that's a good idea.  Upon detecting risk of damage,  and prior to impact with the surface,  the damage avoidance system activates a protection system,  having one or more protection elements that work in concert  to reduce or prevent damage to the portable device  upon impact with the surface.  Airbags.  They also envision a reorientation element  that would turn the device so it hits the ground  on the side of the device  where the airbag has been deployed.  So it's the cat feature.  Or they could just use that feature

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  so it doesn't land on the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just flip it as it goes down.  Wouldn't that be weird if, like a cat,  you drop your phone and it goes,  whoop, on the way down.  It has on the back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like a cat always lays on its feet.  Four little legs come out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I feel like this is an XKCD comic  just waiting for it to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't believe, this is not April Fools,  I'm just checking, right?  This is the strangest...  It's actually Jeff Bezos and the vice president of Amazon,  Gregory M. Hart, who have filed this.  This is a perfect example of patent.  The patenting an idea, not an actual process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, well that's the other thing  about this software patent stuff.  Oh, it's terrible.  The one that got me this week was,  Apple was filing a patent on printing  without printed drivers.  Right, there was a news story about that  halfway through the week.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That should be a commandment of God, not a patent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But Google has this thing called Google Cloud Print  that they open sourced last year or something  that does exactly this.  I mean, if you actually read it through,  it's pretty much the same thing.  And I was comparing them and it's like, wait a minute,  one of these is designed to be obfuscated  and not make sense.  And one of these is code that you run  that shows you exactly how to do this.  Why am I allowed to patent the one and not the other?  So my take on software patents is,  okay, you can have software patents,  but I better be able to compile what you're issuing.  Oh, I love that.  You better maintain it for 20 years until it goes free.  It has to compile and run.  The point of the patent system was to get people  to document their stuff so that other people could build it.  Well, we have a better mechanism now.  It's called open source.  But okay, if you don't wanna go that way,  maintain a source code repository, make sure it compiles  and commit to maintaining it for the life of your patent  such that it's usable 20 years afterwards.  Sure, if you're gonna do that,  I'd accept software patents.  But what they do now instead is have a vague description  that's designed to be as broad and nebulous as possible  and not reducible to a mechanism.  And there was some case law this week, yesterday or today,  I'm not sure, we have to ask Denise about it tomorrow,  but saying that creating a precedent that just  because you've turned something from a description  into something that runs on a computer  doesn't mean that it's not nebulous.  That was part of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does that protection exist for physical patents?  Do you have to make like a wooden working model?  No, you just have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Historically, you used to, and they've,  that was very much the original intent of it.  And if you look at the history of patents,  that's what it was.  And you had to physically bring something  to the patent examiner's office.  And now they don't do that to the same extent.  But that was certainly the intent of patents.  There was quite a good article debating  the history of patents this week that said,  the problem with patents is that we're filing  too many stupid ones and we should be filing sensible ones.  It's your fault, software engineers, which is,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well, no, it's a fault of the Patent and Trademark Office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is the Patent and Trademark Office accepting this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the attorneys and owners of the companies,  investors in the companies who push for this.  Well, as long as the PTO is gonna,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  as long as the PTO will accept it, you should file it.  It would be stupid and imprudent not to file it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Especially now when a patent is worth  400 to $500,000 each.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Precisely, wow, that's a big.  Well, quite, I mean, that's the other thing is that,  if you work for a high tech company,  they'll give you a $1,500 bonus or something  for filing a patent.  And with the engineers now going, wait,  and they're selling for 400,000 now?  Well, what happened there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  According to Breaking Bad, the guy who invented  the synthetic diamond only got five bucks.  That's enough from General Electric.  That's another story.  That's what happens when you watch TV, you learn things.  I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I haven't followed the story.  When Obama talks about trying to create jobs  through patent reform, is he doing God's work in this?  Is this what we're talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is his proposal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know.  The Protect IP Act is another,  one of these annoying, extend intellectual property  because property is a good thing type laws.  It doesn't actually help any of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the one that lets them shut down websites, right?  Yeah.  It's not what we want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the Obama speech there was sort of classic,  this protects the small inventors.  This is good for jobs.  Which is the opposite of what we see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's actually a crazy bill.  And I really...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is no making jobs out of thin air.  No.  I wrote a post a week ago while we were off  that says we're not waiting for a jobless recovery.  We have a jobless future.  The discussion was incredible on it.  And by the way, Hacker News, what's his name?  The founder of Hacker News.  Paul Graham.  Thank you.  Paul linked to it on Hacker News.  And boy, is that the best thing to happen.  I spent eight hours on my vacation  just reading the comments and taking notes on them.  They were brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're proposing a South by Southwest panel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Please folks, go to South by Southwest,  look up my name and say yes to that.  Can I change the last minute to this topic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think this is great.  And boy, if you're looking for panelists, I'd love to talk.  Oh, great.  This is fantastic.  Yeah, everybody vote for that.  You got to link on buzzmachine.com to the...  Yeah, so I didn't mean to...  No, I think this is good.  Honey, we shrunk the economy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what surprises me so much  is to think that we could do one simple thing  and the government can make up jobs.  No, things have changed bigger than that.  This is much huger than the change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what Jeremy Rifkin's been saying for three decades.  Yep, yep.  And I think he's right.  And I don't know what you do to solve it.  But certainly you don't pass bills like the Protect IP Act.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That makes me so sad now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The one thing that I feel like people haven't been bringing up  in the patent discussion is,  have you all heard of Peer to Patent?  No, what's that?  Peer to patent.org. Oh, it's great.  And this is what Expert Labs is actually,  what the inspiration of Expert Labs was.  It's a system that helps employ kind of expert citizens  to help the patent office vet applications.  So it's basically like crowdsourcing application review  and vetting.  And it's been really, it was really successful  and it's continuing now.  And it's something I'd like us to see a lot more.  Interested parties get to review patent applications  and provide information on them  and help the patent office make good decisions.  I think often the case,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that what really happens is that we sit here as citizens  and go, guys, darn it, the government's doing a crappy job  and they ought to do better.  And really the solution is very frequently getting involved  with this kind of thing.  Part of the problem with the USPTO  is that patent examiners do not have to be experts  in the field they're examining.  They don't know prior art, they don't know what's going on,  but they could be helped.  And I've been told by congressional staffers  that Congress could do a much better job in writing laws  if people would step forward and volunteer and help.  If someone would actually read them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I interviewed Beth Novick,  who was Obama's head of transparency  until she left early this year,  wrote the book, Wiki Government, and wrote about this.  And I interviewed her for public parts.  And what surprised me most about this, Gina,  was that I thought the patent examiners,  in the classic view of a government bureaucrat,  would resent and hate this.  She said, no, they're very lonely.  Their job takes a long time.  They don't know often what they have to do.  They end up meeting with experts  that they need to meet with and hear more  and do a better job faster.  And what's not to love?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep, yep.  Yeah, she did an incredible job with peer to patent.  And I'd like to see here it come up in discussions  a little more often as a possible solution.  Kind of using the internet to employ experts  to help these review processes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Eric Schmidt has said that every government agency  should be doing this.  I agree, this is government 2.0.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep, it absolutely is.  But it starts with us.  Instead of bitching and moaning about the government,  we step forward and do it.  The government is of the people.  And so you can't complain about it  unless you're participating.  Got this great stuff.  All right, let's see.  Cyanogen.  Ooh, I wanna hear Gina on this one.  His name, his real name is Steven, was it Kondik?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Steve Kondik, Kondik, yeah.  I'd love to get him on the show sometime.  Deal.  He's a quiet guy.  He doesn't talk much.  And in fact, the story,  the story is that he's joined Samsung Mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it comes from his Facebook page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, this is the thing, right?  He didn't give an interview or statement.  He just changed his employment status on Facebook.  And I can't find that he's made any kind of comment  about this, right?  So it's like, is he contracting what?  So Steve Kondik, Cyanogen,  he created the Cyanogen mod,  which is one of the most popular Android ROMs.  And now, so now he's employed by Samsung, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He said, according to this article in Engadget,  he told his fans that it will be a,  no, I'm sorry, the Cyanogen mod is not affiliated,  but he will be working on making Android more awesome.  You're right.  He doesn't say whether it's a full-time,  for some reason I got the sense,  maybe I'm wrong, that it was not a full-time job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, we don't know.  Because he hasn't really said that.  But I would love to try to get him on the show sometime.  So my first reaction was like-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I use CM7 on my G2X, and I love it.  I have the, I put the nightlies on there now.  Just because I love the idea  that I'm getting an update every day.  So finally, you know, you wouldn't, you know,  T-Mobile, you wouldn't update me to Gingerbread.  Well, screw you, I'm gonna have the latest every night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, and that's Steve.  I mean, he's been doing some great work.  This is a huge catch for Samsung, right?  But it's one of those things is like,  is Samsung gonna influence Steve?  Is Steve gonna influence Samsung?  It's hard to say.  I'm a little concerned about the future of Cyanogen mod,  and also things get a little weird.  He was a software engineer anyway,  but things get weird when your pet weekend project  becomes your day job.  Not that they get weird,  but sometimes when it can get hard, you know, you say,  well, I wanna work on something  a little different on the weekends.  I hope that that doesn't happen.  He said that Samsung is gonna, you know,  stay a side project that's not gonna be affiliated  with Samsung.  Let's hope that his influence, you know,  helps Samsung make a better Android experience.  He's a pretty strong personality,  and he's a great Android engineer,  so I think that it will, but I worry for the Cyanogen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm in devil's mode today.  You often say you want a pure Android experience,  and we curse the manufacturers  that give us non-standard experiences,  and so now we're, are we singing the praises  of Samsung being able to make more non-standard experiences?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think I curse non-standard crappy experiences.  Fair.  That's my curse, right?  Because I mean, I think that if you,  if a company made a great Android skin or interface  that improved things about Android, Google would-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's hope of the source, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  incorporate them into the Android core.  I know that they would.  It happened with, you know, my better Gmail extension.  A lot of those features wound up in Gmail labs,  and they're available to everyone,  so if people are doing great innovation on top of Android,  the good stuff is gonna find itself back into the core.  I wanna see that, but we really haven't seen too much of that.  I mean, we've seen some pretty skins,  but we've also seen some crap,  so I think that the stuff that Steve is doing  with Cyanogenmod is good stuff that people want,  users want, advanced users, admittedly,  but I'm interested to see him use that knowledge  and that experience to help out Samsung.  It's a huge catch for them.  Good for him.  Congratulations to him,  and I'm excited to see him sort of in the Android,  the legitimate Android sphere.  I don't know, it'll be interesting to see,  but let's try to get him on the show.  I will do that in a couple emails.  We tried at one point when he was having some,  and it didn't work out.  Let's tweet him.  Yeah, well-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sometimes these guys, if you DM them, it's better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's wanting to be on the show.  It's just there's been some scheduling conflicts, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's Eileen Rivera, our producer.  So maybe we're getting there.  Okay.  Hey, there was good news, or bad news,  and there was good news.  Google announced that it was going to kill,  I was surprised to hear this App Inventor,  which is their easy tool for making Android applications,  but then the good news was they've actually seated  at the Media Lab at MIT,  the MIT Center for Mobile Learning,  dedicated to transforming education and learning  through innovation in mobile computing.  They gave them the money and they gave them App Inventor.  That's kind of perfect, huh?  Yay, and I love it.  Hal Abelson is one of the directors of the center.  He's the guy who did that great MIT class,  which is still a classic, SCIP.  You can download it.  Teaching first-time computer programmers how to use Lisp.  And Michael Resnick,  a LEGO Papert Professor of Learning Research.  I'd love to be just a LEGO Papert anything.  And Eric Klopfer, who's a professor of science education.  So they're going to focus, I think this is great,  not merely on computer science and electrical engineering,  but on education.  And I imagine this will great,  maybe we'll get some great curricula on using App Inventor,  which is fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, App Inventor, it's open source,  but MIT is going to be kind of the folks,  one of the partners kind of in charge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hal Abelson actually created App Inventor  while he was on leave during a sabbatical at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Makes a lot of sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  But they already had Scratch, right?  Have you seen Scratch,  which was the MIT Programming for Kids toolkit thing?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Very similar to App Inventor.  So if they can actually merge those two, that'd be great.  Because App Inventor, when I last tried it,  it was a bit creaky.  It was bouncing back and forth  between a giant wrapper and the browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and you have the same problem with Scratch,  which is this desktop development,  and the future really is mobile development.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So if they can sort of bring those two together  and make it such that these will generate something  that's usable as an app or other things.  I mean, the ideal for me would be  use this as an HTML5 authoring tool.  There you go.  That would make more sense.  So Scratch was built that makes little Java applets,  which is the old embedding app stuff in the App Inventor model.  But yeah, I'm encouraged that it's gone to that center,  because I think that's a good fit for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, what I also thought was interesting  is that Joy Ito has accepted,  he's gonna be director of Media Lab.  He is already there, yeah.  Which I think is amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, the other one is Ethan Zuckerman  has taken over a center there  that run by the Knight Foundation.  I went to an event there,  and I saw the culture change already.  God bless the Media Lab,  but I've worked with them years ago, years, years ago,  and everything was kind of pridefully useless.  Right.  Right?  And they gave some of the old projects they've worked on,  and they were good-hearted, but just ridiculous.  And then in came, and a lot of religion, a lot of,  well, anything that's a closed network is automatically bad.  Twitter's bad because it's closed.  And Ethan comes in and he says,  well, people are doing things with Twitter.  That's what the people are,  and let's understand it and do stuff with it.  It was a breath of wonderful, fresh Ethan air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the Dusseldorf Regional Court has said  that the Galaxy Tab 10.1 can be sold again in Europe.  Aber nicht in Deutschland.  Nicht in Deutschland.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's where Apple brought  the original complaint against Samsung.  So the EU has said, well, sell it everywhere,  but the Germans can't get the Galaxy Tab.  Don't know what to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like that it's making a demand for the thing.  I mean, I like my Galaxy Tab,  but my seven-inch one is not that great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's true.  A lot of people are saying they hadn't heard of it  until they heard about this action.  People are searching for it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  people are trying to buy it on eBay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We want it, we can't have it, we must have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, well, this, I mean, it seems almost like a,  you know, a Streisand effect for Apple,  saying this thing's a copy of the iPad.  And they're going, oh, really?  Oh, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That sounds interesting.  And it's, I think I'll take one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like the 10.1, I'm a fan of that device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do too, actually, I carried it to court.  Apart from the connector.  For my jury duty.  People thought I had an iPad.  A lot of people said, oh, I wish I had an iPad.  Oh, it's not an iPad.  It's different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I live in an iPad tab house, and they're different.  They're different sizes, the camera's at a different place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and it's a much better camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Versus landscape, there's no hardware button.  It's different.  It's different, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's nicer in some ways as well.  And it doesn't integrate with all the same bits  that the Apple one does.  It has pluses and minuses.  I have both.  But I find that if I'm reaching for one,  I'll probably reach for the tab first,  which is interesting.  Steve Gilmore said, oh, if you want to get the iPad,  you won't look back.  And it's like, oh, well, yeah, I've got that too, have I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  Well, you're not looking back, are you?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm looking at the iPad.  I'm looking on the floor, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm gonna do, we're gonna do the first twig in weeks  without mentioning Google+,  so I'm just gonna skip right over those stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We will, however, mention Glee.  Okay.  Have you gone to see the 3D movie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but Kara Swisher said she loved it.  I did, I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Opening night, opening night, I got my string backpack, nice.  I got my hat, the whole thing.  You guys are such gleeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was so charming, Leo,  because it really was a love song to losers.  It was.  It was, there's everybody on it.  You know, you look at them and say,  oh, these are people who are being made fun of  elsewhere in the world,  and they've found their place and they're happy  and they're respected, and it was really kind of wonderful.  I hate the 3D part, that was driving me nutty.  I don't go to 3D movies.  Yeah, it was good to go to 3D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's needless.  They're singing, what are they gonna do like this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What am I, it's, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My wife had on like a wig, sunglasses, and a mustache.  She didn't want to be recognized.  I was like, this is the entire time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's so funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, wait a second, in your house,  this is the equivalent of the chick flick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Basically, yes, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For years, I've been saying that this met Leportian,  so I'm just glad to welcome the gleeks into the group.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just wanted to get that in there.  We haven't done Chipotle jokes.  We haven't done Google+.  No, no, no.  We got it in glee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank you, Jeff.  Opening night, it was very exciting.  I'm glad to hear that you saw it.  You did your homework for the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and they're good news  that Google is now offering $20,000 scholarships  to aspiring tech journalists.  Do you like this idea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love this idea,  and I want to get that money for my students.  Yeah, I think it's a great thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Six graduate or undergraduate students  will each get $20,000 toward a degree  in any field that combines journalism,  new media, and computer science.  It's about time.  We need smarter press, smarter judiciary,  smarter Congress.  Anything that brings computer science education  into those fields is a good thing, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is this about Google trying to make nice  with the news corporations or?  Yeah, somewhat, somewhat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I'm gonna give them the benefit of the doubt here.  I think they're right.  I think informed technology press is good for everybody  and enough ignorance, enough stupidity.  Certainly it's something I can get behind,  ignorance and stupidity.  So let's see.  I think we're gonna take a break  and come back with your tip, Gina,  Jeff's number of the week  and my tool of the week in just a second.  Before we do that, I just want to remind everybody,  I don't even have to take any time to do this.  Get Netflix.  If you don't have Netflix, get Netflix.  Go to Netflix.com slash twit.  If you already have Netflix, tell a friend,  tell a family member.  $7.99 a month for unlimited streaming,  including Glee, Mad Men, movies, just as the best.  I live on Netflix streaming  to the constant despair and dismay of Comcast.  Another good reason to do it.  Netflix.com slash twit.  We thank you for your support.  And now, whoa!

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nice.  I had to throw it in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love the TriCaster.  We're having so much fun with the 8,500 Extreme

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and we're having a tip of the hat to NewTek for that.  Before we get to that, we have one second.  The Netflix runs on the Chromebook now this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was something that was new this week, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have a kid tab on the Netflix.  Is that what you're talking about?  No, no, it runs on the Chromebook.  Oh, it runs on Chromebook?  Yeah.  How does it do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Through software, through the power of Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought it was a Silverlight client,  so they must be using, what is the Netflix support?  Does it support Flash or WebM?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's using WebM.  You can't put it to bits as easily, so I don't know.  But Netflix isn't exclusively Silverlight.  They run on whatever's available.  But the challenge is getting agreement from the lawyers  that the DRM is suitable,  which is why they only run on some Android tablets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And why they don't run on Chrome and Linux, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, they do run on Chrome and Linux.  This is Chrome and Linux.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but not just kind of generic Chrome and Linux.  You have to have a netbook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, Chromium, the Chromium and Linux, gotcha.  Yeah, so the DRM got worked out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Obviously, it's something they figured out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, Gina, did you guys, I can't get my timing straight here,  did the whole discussion of shutting down social networks  out of the UK riots and all that happen on last week's show?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We did discuss that a bit, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was presuming that it had.  Yeah, you're right.  Yeah, because it's a great story, fascinating story.  But...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the news story since then, I think,  is that the pair who got four years  for trying to incite riots, which didn't happen on Facebook,  and others got arrested for suggesting water gun fights on Facebook.  Oh, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's gotten to be absurd.  Oh, please. Four years in jail.  Wow.  Because they created a Facebook group called, saying,  smash down in Norwich town.  He said, meet up behind the McDonald's for a looting.  He was the only one who showed up.  So it didn't really work that well.  Four years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Four years.  Four years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Four years.  And then this other guy set up a page called the Warrington Riots.  He took it down a few hours later.  His lawyer said he was drunk when he posted it.  And he took it down as soon as he sobered up.  Boy, this is the Salem witch trials.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the Bart stuff is just...  The Bart thing is amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The good news, we should just mention, we talked about it on a twit,  but this is because Bart was worried about protests  about a shooting that had occurred on Bart some years ago.  The Bart police unilaterally decided to shut down cell phone access in some Bart...  Bart is the light rail system in the San Francisco Bay area,  to unilaterally shut down cell phone access in some of the Bart stations.  The good news is the FCC is now investigating  because it's a violation of the 1934 Communications Act  to shut down phone service.  You can't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that was one of the problems around the UK,  was that they were saying...  They were going to shut down Blackberry Messenger or Twitter or whatever.  And Facebook during riots and, you know, inherent stupidity.  Clearly, if you want to proscapule for conspiracy,  this is a good way to get evidence.  If you shut it down, you won't get it.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How are we going to know?  Hosni Mubarak learned that lesson.  So thank you for that. I just wanted to get that off my chest.  The Twitter hashtag for the Bart shutdown was Mubartek.  All right, now, Gina's tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Google Labs has been shut down, but that doesn't mean that...  I know, I know.  But it doesn't mean the individual products lab sections aren't shut down.  Like Gmail has labs and Google Calendar has labs.  Google Maps for Android also has labs.  And in the latest Google Maps application update on Android,  there's a new labs feature.  So if you're in Google Maps on your Android phone,  you go to menu, go to more, and there's a labs item.  And there's a few different cool little features you can enable.  You can pre-cache maps if you know you're not going to have a signal.  You can measure...  You can increase the size of the text.  You can measure units, like distance between units.  But there's a new labs feature called bubble buttons,  which just makes the buttons that show up when you search for a place on maps really big.  There's a great big navigation button and a great big...  Oh, I like it.  ...a call button.  It fills the screen.  It fills the screen and it shows whether or not the business is open.  So if you're in the car and you go into a place, you can hit a button real quick.  It's a minor little tweak, but it's useful.  I use maps a lot.  I basically use my Android phone for email and maps.  So if you haven't checked out labs and Google Maps on Android,  check it out.  It's in the menu, but make sure you get your update first,  because this bubble buttons feature just came down for the latest update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like big bubble buttons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love big buttons.  And I cannot lie.  I cannot lie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Those other brothers can deny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can deny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When a map comes up with a great big...  Never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  ...button.  You just got to tap the map.  I get sprung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sir Mix-a-lot.  Sir Maps-a-lot.  Sir Maps-a-lot.  Sir Maps-a-lot.  I think we got a parody video here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It looks terrible.  We should be doing the Google videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis, your Numero of the Week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My Numero is six.  As in degrees of separation,  Cam Marlow, who is now data chief at Facebook,  formerly at Yahoo, has put the two worlds together  to create smallworld.sandbox.yahoo.com  to actually bring data, research data,  that will end up in a peer-reviewed journal kind of article  about trying to test six degrees of separation.  Really?  I thought that was just accepted.  Well, now it might be shorter, maybe less.  So you go on to that site, again,  smallworld.sandbox.yahoo.com  and you put in the name of someone else  and see what the system can do to route you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, so I want to play, this sounds like fun.  Wait a minute, I'm going to agree to Yahoo.  Yeah, I thought you'd like this.  Yeah, this sounds like fun.  And then I have to, oh, I have to say Facebook.  I guess that's how they're doing it, huh?  Yeah.  Using Facebook.  Okay, so I'm going to allow the Yahoo Small World experiment.  My objective, get a message to this person  in as few steps as possible.  Does it count if I use Twitter?  Idan, Ilan lives in Jerusalem.  So you can select...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff Pulver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Pulver is probably a good choice.  All right, I think Pulver is on my Facebook friends.  Let's continue the chain.  Select who's the closest.  Let's see if I have Jeff in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or Yossi Vardi, either one.  Yossi Vardi, definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I don't know if I have Yossi in my Facebook,  but I bet you I have Jeff.  Let's see.  What?  You'd think.  So this is cool.  So you get to pick one and only one person  from your Facebook friends.  There's Jeff Jarvis, Jeff MacPherson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's how the experiment works.  I mean, the original Small World experiment was  you're supposed to pick the person instead  that you should get it closer.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you'll see how far it gets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Unfortunately, Jeff Pulver is not in my Facebook.  Duncan Watts, who's a Yahoo researcher,  rereaded the experiment through email a few years back.  And the original experiment was they had  a small group of people.  Some were in Omaha and some were in Boston.  They were trying to get hold of a lawyer in Boston.  And they were told, mail this to the person  who you think can get it closest and get them to pass it on.  And most of them didn't get through,  but the ones that did get through,  the median number of links was six.  So that's where that number comes from.  That was the original Milgram experiment  way back in the 50s or 60s.  So the question would be,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  could you social media shorten that chain then?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are we in a more connected world now,  which I want to hope and assume,  where you can make this with your hops,  as we would say today.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I am going to now I have to choose  what is all of this stuff?  I guess this is just additional material  to help them with their research, right?  Yeah.  They want to know my occupation.  They never have Pundit in here,  so I guess I'll just choose media.  I'm a media thing, right?  Writer, editor probably.  All right.  So let's see.  Renee Blodgett, that's a good choice.  Yeah, Renee has led tours of Israel.  Very good choice.  Yeah, I mean, that's the closest I could come.  And then I say, how do I know her work?  She's a publicist,  I've known her for I think 10 years.  She does the geek tours.  Yeah, and she did a geek tour to Israel,  a couple of geek tours to Israel.  So I suspect, in fact, invited me on one.  I turned it down because I consider it not editorially.  I regard her as a business or professional acquaintance.  Relationship three.  Where are they?  I don't know.  OK, so there's a lot of stuff.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Boy, invite the friend to join the chain.  Yeah, that's good.  Renee's probably already.  Oh, boy.  Jeez, Louise.  Join.  Let's see.  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now it's going to look like some game.  I think this is more than a game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no, it's research.  It's science.  OK, good.  Now we'll see.  Now will I get information back?  Oh, wait a minute.  I'm going to become a target.  You can become a target.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's cheating.  That's wonderful.  You'll single-handedly bring down the system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am separated by zero degrees of separation from everybody.  I'm just going to leave what's in there from Facebook,  not add any additional features, and we'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I get recognized all around thanks to the power of Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's see what happens.  I'm going to show you my pick of the week,  which I just was inspired to talk about it  because of the Cyanogen story.  And I mentioned that I do...  Let's open the curtain on my pick of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We all want our own transition.  I don't want mine now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm starting to feel like home improvement or something.  This is the easiest way to modify your phone.  It's on the Android market.  It's completely legal.  You do have to root your phone first.  And for that, merely Google root and the brand of Android phone  that you have, you should easily find a one-click rooting solution.  But once you've rooted it, this is the way to make it possible  to save your current state, to restore it, to add other ROMs.  It's free.  It's called ROM Manager from Clockwork Mod.  I'm sure you must use Clockwork Mod, Gina,  when you do your modification of your phone.  It's really a very...  It's a great recovery tool.  And they also have a premium version for $6,  which I recommend buying,  because that gives you access to the Cyanogen nightlies.  And what's great is because I've got ROM Manager running on my G2X,  it notifies me when there's a new ROM automatically.  So almost every morning I wake up and I say,  ooh, I can screw up my phone this morning.  So far, those nightlies are quite good.  And I haven't had a problem with them at all.

Transcript:  Wow!

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's a boing!  Can I suggest a tool as well?  That's boinging up the screen.  Would you like, Kevin Marks, to make a tip, a suggestion,  add something to this comic book?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'd like to suggest a tool.  So there's an Android app called NanoTweeter,  which I've always been a fan of.  Basically, what it does is it takes Twitter messages  and turns them straight into Android notifications.  And you can put through app replies, direct messages,  and you can put a list of names and it'll check your feed  for those and pass them through.  And I've always liked this thing,  but it broke when Twitter updated their stuff.  And I was annoyed by this,  but then I realized last week this thing's open source,  so I went and downloaded the source and patched it  and sent the patch to the original guy.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so now it works again.  I love open source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, Kevin, you want to work on my app?  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll fix it, actually.  But then that was the...  I just find this...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I fixed it for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But now, what is this to this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because like the standard Twitter client,  you can say in notifications,  hey, notify me when there's a DM,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and it'll show up in notifications.  It gives you annoying notifications.  It's like those Google Plus ones that are like,  somebody commented on something that you don't know about.  Whereas this one, it just translates the tweet  directly into a notification,  and obviously you wouldn't want every tweet you can read  coming through that way, unless you only subscribe to five people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do it with DMs, probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It works for DMs, it works for ads,  and you can say, oh, I want to hear everything Leo says,  and put Leo Laporte in, and they show you all the Leo ones.  And it's very simple.  It doesn't draw much battery  if you don't set it to poll too often.  I just find it a really useful way to work with Android.  The other thing is, when you select them,  because Android has intents,  you can choose which Twitter client to view them in,  and remember the preference, and it'll go there.  By default, it routes you back to the Twitter web,  but you can route it to the Twitter client,  or Seesmic, or whatever Android Twitter reader you like.  Love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And this is the other part I love about Android.  Market.android.com,  you press the install button,  you tell it which phone you want it to install,  I have to sign in my Google account.  For some reason, does this do this to you?  It always makes me sign in my Google account each time.  Yes, it's a security thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You don't want to leave yourself logged in  and have people around you install things to your phone.  I guess that makes sense.  It's bad enough leaving yourself logged into Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So now I'm going to send this to my phone,  and when I go get my phone,  it will have installed NanoTweeter.  And that's nice.  That's why we like Android best.  Hey, thank you so much for being here.  Kevin Marks is at salesforce.com,  but is a great astute commentator on all things internet,  and we will get you on triangulation soon,  because I'd love to hear the Kevin Marks story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Can I do one more little plug?  On tomorrow night,  tummlevision.tv,  we've got Paul Adams,  who's the originator of the Google Circles idea,  who's now working at Facebook,  coming on to talk to us about  social experience design and things.  That would be great.  If you're missing the lack of Google Plus in this show,  come and listen to us tomorrow night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We left it out so you could have it, Kevin Marks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Tummlevision.tv tomorrow night at 6pm Pacific, 9pm Eastern.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  With Deb, of course, and Heather,  and Kevin,  and a great show which you must listen to.  Mr. Jeff Jarvis is at the City University of New York.  He's also online at buzzmachine.com,  and is a great guy.  At Jeff Jarvis on the Twitter,  plus Jeff Jarvis on the Google.  But by the way,  at works on the Google Plus,  which is kind of cool.  You just say at, and that could be either one.  And it's great to see you again, Jeff.  I'm glad to have you back, and I'm glad to be back.  We are so happy to have you back.  Yay! I love this show.  And of course, Gina Trippani,  who is at smarterwear.org,  and a contributor to many great sites,  and always fun.  Plus Gina Trippani, or at Gina Trippani.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Plus or at. Great to be here.  And I'm going to plug Jeff's public parts video,  which is super cool.  Wait a minute, I didn't hear about that. What's that?  There's a trailer for the book, right Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's gone.  He's gone soon.  Well, I'll tell you what, why don't we end the show  with Jeff Jarvis explaining  public parts, and we'll see you all next time  on This Week in Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is embarrassing.  Nah.  I'm sorry.  You can end it anytime.  You can end it anytime.  It's only two minutes, come on.  So impatient.  And it's fun.  You can stay in your home all day long,  but then you don't know what relationships you didn't build.  If you're a company,  you can operate with your customers and your suppliers  in all kinds of new ways.  If you're government, you bloody well should be out  having new kinds of relationships with the public.  Publicness is also about organizing.  We can organize movements,  we can organize clubs,  we can organize all kinds of things.  All these things become possible because we open up to the world  and have the faith to do so.  So I think this is the beginning  of an age of sharing and publicness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Love it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Great job, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow, Simon and Schuster went all out on that one.  Jeff, Gina, Kevin,  we're talking right now with Salesforce  about being part of the Dreamforce conference.  They want me to do a social media panel.  Oh, perfect.  So I hope maybe I can get all three of you to be on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've gone to Salesforce events  and they bring in smart people  and they're good events.  Yeah, it'll be a lot of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, Dreamforce is August 31st in San Francisco  and I think you can still get tickets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it that soon?  Have we made the arrangements yet?  I thought it was September that we were talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's the end of August, end of September.  Oh yeah, it would be September 1st

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  would be the day of the panel actually.  Yeah, that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Great, thank you all.  Bye bye.
