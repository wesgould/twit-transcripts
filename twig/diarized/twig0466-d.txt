We'll also talk about Google's quarterly results  Facebook's disappointing results a whole lot more this week in Google is next

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  As I always say co-host of this week in Google you say that I do constantly I'm flattered

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's very nice. Thank you. I'm glad that that's a good something to your skin my bio  Yes, in your bio. Yes, it is also with us all the way from Oxfordshire in the United Kingdom  Formerly Yorkshire, I don't know. It's an assure. He's an assure somewhere Kevin Marx of the IndieWeb. Hey Kevin  Hey there. Nice to see you. It's been a while. It's been a long time and I'm glad that we could get you  To fill in for Stacey. She's actually oddly enough at Google Next just up the road a piece, but she's busy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Where Sundar spoke?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was that unexpected a cloud next? Yeah, that's what they said. He says yeah, he's the CEO of Google  It seems like it's just up the road a piece. It shouldn't be that weird that he showed up  Yeah  He says we're and he said this guy feels like he said this at Google I O  I think so too. We're at an inflection point in the as an industry with AI  Just a few years in we've seen some incredible use cases, especially in  Healthcare he was talking about I guess I gather according to this story from the street  A Google built algorithm that could conduct detect heart attack or stroke risk  Through retinal scans. This is this is was this lively or this is one of the Google Health  moon shots  He also  unveiled a slew of new AI  technologies  across Google Cloud and G suite I  I  Forget can you can use G suite right Jeff? It's just that you can't merge your G suite account with your regular. Yeah, I'm on

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I'm absolutely on G suite. That's how I have my email and everything  It just means that that causes me hell, but I'm there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep, they actually could some good news if you've wanted to use Google storage as a business without using G suite  They now have unbundled that so that's good news

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Surprised that was thought I didn't know that was yeah the case all these years. Yeah. Well, that's good

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah that you had to buy both. Yeah. Yeah  they're gonna add some I think what's really interesting is the  maturation of Google's office effectively office suite on the cloud and how it is now getting closer and closer to  Kind of a mainstream desktop office suite for instance. They're gonna use the Google AI to do grammar  Now there's a but there's the story by the way  The Carson said just pull it up on how you can get Google Drive storage without getting Google suite  So that's good news, but they're doing in fact if I were grammarly I'd be a little nervous about this because everybody who uses  the Google  suite of office tools well, I gather get  Grammar underlining now in their thing  That's four million people use the G  People use the G  Let's see Google infuses more AI into the G suite several new capabilities  Features focus on reading writing and meetings on the writing front smart reply in hangouts chat. That's good. I  Use hangouts still because I'm a Google Fi customer  So you can get quick replies in your chat room I haven't seen it yet, but I gather we'll get it soon  Anybody use smart replies to use it in your gmail Jeff all the time you do all the time. Yeah  So it's pretty guilty every time I do it

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Feel like I'm gonna be found out. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't care about me. I got that reply last week Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I you know that's gonna be happening more and more and more one of the story in the rundown is that is that Google's going?  to bring its  the AI  Human voiced  Fulio people into their call centers. Oh this Google duplex thing  Yeah, so they're gonna start they're gonna start implementing that in the call centers, which means it's always been there to some extent  You always deal with the stupid voicemail jail, but presumably this be far better  Well, I you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's pretty clear when you use chat and that's how Google and a lot of companies want you to interact  At least a first-line interaction that that's a bot hi, it's David. What can I do for you today? It's clearly not David  Right  Right. Yes, and then you can actually sense the hand. Yeah, yes robot David  But then you can stay then there then after a little after some interaction  Then I think sometimes there's a handoff because you can kind of feel like oh David just became sentient  Yeah, that's a good point  Yeah, that could be a bad thing  What else new investigation tool for G suite security center, I don't know what that even means helps admins remediate threats  voice commands and hangout meet hardware  I think the grammar is a is a beta thing that you can sign up for  That you have to it's an early adopter program  grammar suggestions and Google Docs

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean they've done these things before this way for those already isn't that I remember one of a while from probably  Eight years ago that where they were trying to do this  Google school suggest or something where you started typing things? Oh, yeah  That sounds familiar. Yeah  So, I mean, I mean that was a bit Markov Cheney  It was it was amusing in that it would keep all the competing famous sentences and things right like the religious texts

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That Google Translate was offering yes, so  We so if you typed and I think they've fixed some of this but if you type nonsense in and one example was dog dog dog dog dog dog dog  dog and then had it translate to  Maori  Mary from Maori into English it would give you it looked like chapter and verse from the Bible. It looked like  Revelations who the hell discovered this how did question?  But I said I posited that it might be Markov chains because it did feel like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  More subtle than Markov chains, but it's in a similar similar issue. The discussion in there was basically saying  They don't have many parallel texts. And so they will pick up  Stuff that was in the text they have used it  I remember when they first put out Google Translate, they've used a lot of EU texts because there's parallel texts there and  They've been there sort of businessy, but they would if you put in Blair, it would say Sarkozy  Prime Minister of France  By name and there was a bunch of you can make it do things like that before and it's a challenge all these things  The other thing that they said in there is that  What they try and do they have two training courses  They have a training set of parallel texts, which is to try and find correspondences  They also have a large training set in the target language where they try and find coherence  That makes sense to the sentence  So if you give it nonsense, it will try and generate the most coherent thing it can make from the nonsense rather than giving you nonsense back  Which is which is a change from the previous previous behavior was we didn't know what was going on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It would just pass the text through right which would be the right translation of dog dog dog dog dog dog or egg egg egg egg egg  And I know to me this did not bother me this seemed to bother motherboard. They wrote the story  If you pass something nonsense

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All bets are off

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the thing is you don't know if you don't speak the language  You don't know when it's doing something a bit like that, right? The chat the difficulty with a lot of this AI stuff is  When you move outside the space that it's been trained on weird things happen  And so there was a similar thing a while back where because again parallel text problem because a lot of the parallel texts in Arabic were translated by the State Department people like that  It would give very warlike and inflammatory things if you translate to from Arabic because they'd be trying to because the text were translated from the kind of rants and things like that that they had  Whereas if you get classical Arabic literature, it gives you all translations of it things like that  And it's and that it is a hard problem because it's hard to know in translation is a deep hard problem for humans and you can throw machines  The machines have got better but you don't know  Nobody actually understands what's going on inside these things  They're building some kind of intermediate representation, but it's not something you can inspect easily  When they expected it visually we got the deep dream stuff and spooky many-eyed dogs in trees and all that nonsense  And that's and that's part because a lot of the training sets there  The original training set that a lot of the AI image recognition stuff was on was very highly populated with pictures of dogs and different breeds of dogs  That was one of the things they were trying to test it on  And so it started seeing dog faces everywhere because it had had a lot of dog faces in the training set  And it's similar things with you know as as they do more of this  The the worry about what you're training on gets get stronger  There was a great thing by Pete Warden on this if you have people on chip. No  He's he's one of the guys that Google AI who works in dev relations  He's he's he's English too. So I've obviously got a connection with him  But he's he's written some great stuff about this  And one of the things he said was  If you're doing academic AI you spend all your time thinking about models and structure  And if you're doing practical real world AI you spend all your time worrying about your data sets  And are they clean enough and are they doing the right thing and can you tighten them up and do better things with them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll see if I can find the piece but it's he's got a an article on medium from a couple years back called tensor flow for poets  How did so I don't you know, I'm not sure exactly I guess this would be a good way to  It's not writing poetry. I don't know what it's like. It's like you're in the course. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah physics for poets  Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. So it's for non-technical people idiots. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I found the one I was thinking about. I wish I put it I'll put it in the chat room  What image classifiers can do about unknown objects

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've read that one. That's a new one. This is new on his blog. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What the one I was it was two down from this why you need to improve your training data on how to do it  Yeah, it's nice that this they've got somebody

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A human talking about this  Yeah  This is good, so I'll just go ahead and put it in the chat room  I recommend this is Pete Pete warden commda petewa rd en and we will try to get him on that would be

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She should get him on he's he's he's allowed to speak for Google. He does dev relations on machine learning and things  He'd be a great guest

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  making out of that Carson be fun because honestly, I feel like often when we talk about these issues we talk from a  Ignorant point of view and which is why I'm glad to get somebody like you Kevin on and and who could set us straight  About things like this translation is this something well someone you're more more technical than I am and you worked at Google  So, you know some people  I didn't did not bother me that we were getting Bible verses  but it did bother some people and  Ag ag ag ag ag translated from Somali to English  Comes out as the name of the Lord was written in the Hebrew language  It was written in the language of the Hebrew nation Wow, that's a that's a kind of a stretch. Yeah  It shouldn't it probably shouldn't do that I  Think it's harmless, but it shouldn't do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's not harmless in that you don't know what else is going on  That's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could be giving it perfectly reasonable text and still get due to which is the problem with AI as a rule

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's and it's about how can you possibly audit the performance?  People have auditing the algorithms. That's that's ludicrous  audit the the output but when you get that kind of that's what scares me is you think you know,  You know who would think to put an egg egg egg egg egg?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  on at the output right well people have done that they put in stuff like that to make it be to do Google speech the  drum machine so  And to try and get different  like accents different languages and things but that is a  That's a this is a very straight, you know, this is a very strange problem and it's  And  It's a it's a it's a big problem with a lot of this AI stuff is you don't always know what's gonna come out  And you you don't have a good understanding. There's no there's no straightforward way of understanding  What the shape of of the world inside it is for a lot of these problems, right?  You're basically saying you're basically giving it you normally give it a training set and what you want things to look like and  Get it to correlate those and then you give it a test set. That's that's  Similar to the training set for distinct and see what it does with that, but there's less of a  Is less of a likelihood of you to give it some strange noise now  There are some there are some training models where they have what they call an adversarial AI  We have another AI who's trying to find the cracks in the first one. Right? That's where they've done things like  come up with images that for the  the  Large set of AI's that will be trained on image net for example  So you can you can change a few things and it'll think a gun is a turtle or things like that  Because you'll you'll fuck you  It's it's hard to understand you have to treat these things as black boxes and test them empirically and it's it's very hard to do  To do that when you've only got a known set of transients  And so that that essay by Pete is very good on this is basically saying the most significant thing you can do is improve your  improve your data and  Have a good feel for the data you're feeding it and what you're trying to feed it  and  One of his anecdotes in there was when he was building an app. He ended up by hand training it with  Reacting to two million images between a team of six of them  Because they couldn't get they couldn't find a way to get people to do that for them

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it brings us back to Pachai's comments at Google Cloud Next this week  Are we at an inflection point it feels like we're really still pretty primitive

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, yeah Google has been wanting to do this for a very long time and then they're better at it than  almost anyone else so  But the question is how does it work in domains where the problem isn't well defined and you you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So in other words if you're trying to find heart  part problems or  That's because that's a more it's just the same thing as I guess is a speech  Dictation in a constrained a more constrained environment does a better job than in a kind of a general

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the example example that people are raising these days  You know when it comes to dealing with fake news and harassment and those kinds of things  At a scale where they're killing a million fake accounts a day  then  You know this has to this those are those are subtle nuanced things to try to figure out

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I mean that was the well that was the one of the other  Part from the obvious shocking things like I've said last week the other one. He said was oh, yes  We're using AI's to do this. We're using AI's to lead lead our humans in the right direction is like  Okay  but also, you know, they've already got a problem that they're trying to understand nuanced communication with  minimum wage people who have a  Evaluate power target and then they're feeding the results of that into an AI and they use that to create a feedback loop to those people  So if you if you if you if you can find an ag ag ag type attack on Facebook  You can you can do the kind of influence that we've already seen  We and that is what the that is what they were blind to from the you know  Right the Russian exploit networks, which which basically system actually looked at this and said, okay  Let's experiment with the edges this and see what we can do to amplify things  If our goal is to amplify things in a noisy way and cause chaos rather than game the advertising system  Which is what Facebook was optimizing for?  Then it's a very different problems. Do you think so?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm a little cynical as Jeff will vouch for about mark and Facebook  Do you think that they actually believe AI is the solution for this or they just know that like the word blockchain AI?  Is a good thing to like fairy dust to sprinkle on any solution. I I think they believe it  So they so I don't know which is worse  cynical marketing tech speech or

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Believing something this painful. They also want to believe it desperately because I so I wrote a piece this week about you know  I finally had to come down on the you know, because I full disclosure. I accepted money at my school for Facebook  I received no money myself. I'm independent of Facebook  Because I  Had to come out and say what I thought about about the info wars stuff and my view strongly is that info wars should go down  But it's really hard to come up with a rule set. Yeah, we talked about this last week. What is exactly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is the rule you call it finding the line and I quoted I quoted you in that piece

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  because  Zuckerberg's line was that an imminent cause of violence and you said no harm  Is the is is is the right way to put the line and I agree with that but harm is hard to define right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But what if Alex Jones says that that somebody should if he mimes taking a shot at Robert Mueller  That strikes me as a threat of harm. Yeah, clearly the rules are bad  Crosses that line for sure to me. Yes, and if by the way, one of the reasons I kind of know this is  You know if you get threats on Twitter as my daughter did many years ago  The first thing the police will say is do you feel endangered?  Do you feel in at risk of bodily harm from this threat if you do not then it doesn't rise  To the car. It's not a cause for action if you do  Then they can proceed and they in fact we a local Petaluma detective got a got a warrant  Got the IP address from Twitter then went to the Internet service provider got a warrant in Chicago  Tracked down the person who'd made a violent threat against my daughter who was probably 15 or 14 at the time  He is it was a kid  And but the police knocked on his door and because it was a threat of harm. There was a  physical risk of harm  So that's why I kind of I think that's the legal standard at least it was in this case  You can't and that's the whole it First Amendment thing it's shouting

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But Facebook can make its own decisions, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, but you can't prosecute somebody unless exactly  At least that's a minimum that's at the very minimum

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Something Facebook should have at least that as it's certainly certainly the the threats to individuals and harassment individuals. Yes  I think that's easy going down same for Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even though he didn't say it out loud, but pointing a gun and saying Robert Mueller

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that's well, but so the argument of the Zuck makes here and  And I try to argue back here I think and I probably an argument I would have made five years ago is  Free speech is more different opinions this and that the more want to bend over backwards in the  Speech that's for sure. Nothing is gonna listen to me, but I said to him in the piece  Mark, you're not responsible for free speech  The that doesn't fall to you. Yeah, the Alex Jones has plenty of places where he can congregate with his cockroaches  He doesn't need Facebook to do that you don't need them you have to facilitate that yes  Yeah, they've got to break out of that idea. I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He the same thing with the Holocaust deniers. He said well, I don't know. I don't understand their intent  I don't think they're intentionally

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Denying the whole area. They're so scared of  Having to make rules that are hard to enforce that require people and expense that are gonna get them in trouble with certain  You know trolls we're gonna go after them. But you know  Facebook you're you're the you're their chump now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the part of the problem is part of the problem that social media and the amplification effect of social media  Has flipped on its head the old  Rule that the best that that free speech doesn't help Nazis  It helps you get rid of Nazis that used to be the rule. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a good point. You know, the more speech is better rule when we have  No end of speech possible  You know, I don't know the hard thing is again  We keep paying attention to the bad end of the cycle and trying to play whack-a-mole with that  We need better systems to just ignore the a whole yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The underlying problem is that the systems are optimized for engagement right and it amplifies the a holes  You know crying fire in a crowded theater is a great way to get engagement, right? So  You can  Causing stampede in the digital world is a great way to have for that too. And because of that they've poisoned the  Board of discourse too because that is now the editorial agenda is say something controversial  That will get you the hate share so that we get the traffic we need  And that's that is the sort of underlying problem with this and the challenge is coming up with ways to do this that  Something to optimize for that isn't that?  That is that is how do you optimize for reason discourse?  What how do you apply, you know the the barbarian rule of do not tolerate the intolerable? What do you make of Maureen Sullivan's?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Washington Post  Op-ed piece in which she said Mark Zuckerberg is a horror show, but there's a glimmer of truth hidden in his latest blunder  She says to follow  This is the Margaret Sullivan who used to be the media  Ombudsman at the New York Times Times right who was who was so good in that job that they  Discontinued it after she left. They couldn't find anybody  To follow Mark Zuckerberg's utterances she writes is to constantly cringe

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But then I think horror show was a little strong in the headline. Yeah. Well, she might not even have written that headline

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I probably shouldn't have  shouldn't have read that  but  So her her point  What is her point somebody better explain it to me because I don't know crap  I think her point is what I just said, which is the best way  That free speech helps you fight Nazis doesn't promote Nazis. It helps you fight Nazis  She said maybe imagine if instead of taking it down Facebook appended a prominent disclaimer atop the Holocaust denial page  Widespread censorship and chasing down every falsehood  Ought to be acknowledged as bad ideas rights Maureen Sullivan. Yes, I agree with that  Nonetheless, it's already marginalized voices that are likely to be silenced by that point of view

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's true if it's too automated, but at some point  Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg himself has the full freedom to decide what is acceptable on the platform that he built, right and  And you know that he when he talks about free speech, which again, I would have done five years ago, too  but  The internet is not controllable. Facebook is by you mark  So people some people are begging you to control that some people say no stay away. You can't make any judgments  You shouldn't be doing this, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But even worse as Kevin says maybe Facebook is actually doing the opposite simply in its normal operation  By amplifying the most objectionable speech because that it that produces engagement that's its algorithm

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's optimized that's why I think that that even even moving past clickbait and attention as the metric to try to move to  meaningful interactions between people I  Think that's gonna move from clickbait to comment bait and and so the metrics still aren't right and the metrics are too easy to game  The point here is it's not so much that Facebook is choosing to do this  It's that the bad guys recognize the weakness and and and exploit it to the fullest

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so  Following that news Facebook had its quarterly  Results today just minutes ago  stock tumbled but it's as usual and this is why I  We often don't talk about financial markets because it's not necessarily correlated to anything we talk about on the show  But they missed their  Expectations so revenue wasn't that revenue was down  It just wasn't as up as much as people had thought by a small amount frankly  13.23 billion in revenue instead of 13.3 billion. Oh  Monthly active users 2.23 billion. That's just an astounding number instead of 2.25 daily active users  1.47 billion daily active users and that was a little lower than the growth  It's not that it didn't grow again. It grew it just didn't grow quite as much. They're not dying. They're not dying

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, they they passed the point where they can grow they're running out of humans

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're running out of people one and a half billion people. That's a lot of people

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's why they that's why they're putting satellites up to get internet access

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Advertising revenue up 42 percent  year over year to 13 billion dollars  91 percent of  advertising revenue from mobile  So I've said this every quarter for the last few years  The real question about Facebook was could they make the turn going from desktop revenue?  Revenue and yes, the answer is yes  91 percent  Now the question is why they should just get rid of desktop

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow  Pretty much have what I've complained, you know two years ago when I complained about some UI thing  Just with people I know who work there on the desktop. They said

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they don't care it's it's amazing how the worm is turned or whatever it is, it's not though. It's not a worm exactly  It's amazing unless it's a worm from the dune  landscape  It's amazing. Have the giant worm has turned  It mobile is very successful look Facebook successful that stock price going down does not reflect a lack of success  In fact, if I were a trader, I would say that's a buy signal right now go go out and get it  Alphabet let's talk about their result

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's there's a bug on Facebook's would drive me nuts the last week. Yeah since the weekend  So I have tweets go you wouldn't know this Leo because you know, you've you've gone back in time  But I have tweets that go automatically from Twitter to Facebook  Oh, yeah, I've heard of that if you're retweeting something or your  The thing you're attached that is attached to your tweet often isn't coming across  So you have some statement what a surprise  Ha ha ha and then that's all that's the whole week people saying are you nuts? What's going on here?  There's no context to that on Facebook  So I go into Facebook and I kill those so you're saying the link from Twitter is not you know  Why because Facebook doesn't want any outbound links on now. It's a Brits. It's something's broken. It's just but it could also be a photo  So you're reacting to something in a tweet  Yeah, and the thing the the the the the the artifact that you're reacting to doesn't go across  So if you're listening Facebook you fix that please or Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It could be because Twitter changed something but Facebook nonetheless you could also Jeff do it by hand with something like if this than that and

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Make the challenge is it's a reply context. You're Twitter doesn't get this right moments  So right or I mean, what do they call it highlights?  So they'll display something in highlights and it's like here's this tweet that lots of people retweet is like it's very frustrating  I think that's responding to something else with a photo in it and I have no idea why this one is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  overall feeling when I read Twitter that I've had a stroke and that suddenly a  Comprehensible world has become completely incomprehensible

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that's yeah, that's just that's just that's just Twitter and the context moving really quickly all the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because we're disappearing or just disappearing. There's no context at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, but you start they start with a joke formula and then then that becomes mutated into something else  You got to show thread all the time and then you have some joke forward that it's like  I don't understand why this is funny because it's it's a new gender version

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the meme of the moment Kevin you stay up with try to keep up with us  Yeah, yes, I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, I'm sorry I derailed us there you were about to say about Google who cares all right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, we'll do it X Y ABC dot XYZ one of the best by the way, I'm downloading the latest Chrome  Let's see Chrome. Oh, I don't know. Maybe maybe I won't it's 67  I think it's with 69 that Chrome is going to start when you go to a site that's not secure  Saying danger danger Will Robinson insecure site  What do you think about that web standards guy if you're not HTTPS you're dangerous  It's a boy doesn't say dangerous it says insecure it's gonna be read in a couple of months

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's it's already read when you when you click on the little eye  Says you know if you go to my site said the connection to the site is not secure

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, is that which one a pig is a piggy big and in bottom most?  Let's not have HTTPS because yes a piggy knee, you know, you are you're on blogger I thought I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Was on blog well, it's still there. I put my I've been getting marks. So now it says you can see it's kind of hard to see

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it says not secure up here  We should be secure that's that's on blogger it's on blogger, but it's not secure and  Right now it's not Kevin's fault and right now  It's it's kind of benignly white same color as the rest of it  But in a couple of months this fall, it's gonna be a bright red not secure that to me is shouting fire in a crowded theater  This your connection this site is not secure. You should not enter any sensitive information on this site because you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're gonna be in an airport or gonna be in a hotel or somebody's company and they're gonna start blocking all of that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because it's insecure. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  well, no, I mean the other thing is there's the irony is that you've got the opposite problem, which is  When you're trying to connect through some damn Wi-Fi portal  You need an HTTP site because it can then they can put up their crappy man in the middle thing to make you log in

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I understand their desire of HTTPS everywhere. I think it's a good so this but actually they could say it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My thing there's a site called never SSL calm  really its entire point is  You put it into your address bar so that you know, you've got one site that will always be HTTP  which means it can trigger the  Hi, this is your hotel. Please enter the code you were given a reception thing  Oh because any HTTPS site can't can't trigger that. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow, that's a huge problem. I didn't know that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and this is this is this is where they're changed now  So are you talking about captive portals yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Apple has a work around this thing on they're evil to begin with but everybody uses them  That's where you have to do a login before you can use the internet  Apple just senses a captive portal and sends you to an Apple site. Well, that's still

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah  Android as well. Yeah, that was that was still work because they've got an Apple site. They're doing a redirect  Yeah  I think a couple of years ago that site went down and all the max and  IOS has lost their minds for it for a couple of hours

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and also my wife who's notoriously she moves fast. She's impatient never waits long enough for the captive portal to pop up  She says just the site's not coming up  So I go to go to I think it's is it captive dot Apple comm something like that  But it never SSL you can remember never SSL. I'll tell her that from now on that will that will be the place to go  Yes, for that was formable. Yeah, if you go to captive dot Apple comm it's actually a very happy site  You just get one word success  That's it that's a  happiest site on the internet success  I'm succeeding or never SSL comm this site will never use so  It is a good thing to have secure sites. It really is it causes problems with captive portals, but they're broken to begin with

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, we should get rid of captive portals that that would be a better better way to do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there a reasonable way to do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Reason way to do that is to post the password to your Wi-Fi on the wall on a piece of paper

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, but then I can't get you but then I can't get you to agree to all my terms and capture your your email address

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's illegal now anyway, so shut up. It's illegal in California and Europe. So wait a minute what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you they can't ask you to agree to their terms of service to use the internet  Of course you because you're using their internet their access

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They tell me they are they asked to track you and build a profile a lot of time, right?  So most a lot of them are illegal, you know, because they're tracking me  So many of these crappy portals are in retail assignments. They say give me your email address before you continue  Yeah, that is a GDPR violation. It's a California law whatever it's called violation, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although that laws not an effectual 2020  so you have a shame

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Agree cuz I'm waiting for the trunk size to ban people in California  Wouldn't that be awesome?  The LA Times I can't read from here anymore. So when they do that to LA that'll be even better

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mind you that's assuming they lost that long. So they never so this was all because of GDPR

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They never fixed tons. Yeah knows not just  Trunk papers, it's more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not it's Google doesn't like me  Anyway, speaking of Google G is for Google speaking alphabet  Investors, where's the where's we're? Oh the  Google's not a conventional. What is this? Where's the results? I want results. I went to ABC dot XYZ  Here we go is this q2 2018  Here it is. Yeah second quarter 2018 results  alphabet  Revenues, I just I when I look at this stuff. Yeah, this is three months. We're talking and  And this is in millions 32 billion dollars in three months  it  excluding fines  So I guess the fines didn't affect the revenue they affected the operating income so the the profit  Was only a mere two point eight billion dollars this quarter should have been seven point eight except for those jerks jerky jerks in the EU  That took the margin down from 24 percent to 9 percent. So they only made 9 percent. I'm sad  net income  I'm not sure how net income varies from operating income, but this is roughly the same  So everybody was happy right this is big big bucks  They don't break it down very much I really wish people like other bets lost  More money this year seven hundred thirty three. I'm sorry seven hundred thirty two million dollars losses for other bets  That's way most other bets right  Those contact lenses or other bets moonshots are the best a Google X's other bets  It's not that much money. Oh  They can afford to lose seven or thirty two million dollars. What I wonder proportionally. What did

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Bell Labs cost AT&T, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And of course they didn't call it that  Yeah  So  Let's see here change from Q2 year over a year paid clicks on Google properties went up 58 percent  Cost per click went down 22 percent  Impressions on the Google network member properties up a mere 1%  That's basically flat cost per impression on Google network members properties up 14 percent  I'm no stock analyst, but that seems like that's all pretty good  Yep  You yeah, if you make more money by charging less you're doing something, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Okay good  So they're not yet making money on any of these but that's okay. Okay, that's okay. All right  The European fine 5.07 billion obviously had something to do it so that's interesting that means that they paid it right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they had to account for it. Okay, they're putting money

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they open an account at the dime savings and loan and put the money in there  Actually, you know the even at point one percent that could add up. Yeah, I'll take it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They they do once the judgment happened. They did have that they have 90 days to end the conduct

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What should here's the thing they tried to settle this and isn't that interesting and they didn't this is why this is such a political  act on  The EU's part they didn't want to they don't want to settle they want to bring them to justice

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The settlement said that we'll stop doing all the things  You know this thing the Bloomberg story secret offer to settle was it I mean secret they what is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I don't know that was secret so much. They you know, do what you do you approach them and say  We will change our behavior

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  new yeah, did they say that with they address all of the  Issues that the EU had let's see  It didn't have to be that way  Right rights Bloomberg months earlier when the company already reeling from a 2.4 billion euro fine in the shopping case made quiet attempts  What are you gonna do announce it? Of course, they're gonna tweet it made quiet attempts tweet it in all caps

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Then but they wouldn't better off tweeting it there was better off saying we will change our ways

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They should yeah to settle the probe into do the it waited a year too long according to Margaret of a stiker  When a company wants to settle it needs to reach out immediately after  Getting the EU's initial complaint  That didn't happen in this case. And then of course it takes the route that it has now taken  So no surprises says was stiker  Hmm don't they don't I guess it doesn't say what the  Settlement offer was. I mean if how how does

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Only what if they would have negotiated but they were willing to change behaviors, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Responded I mean they have to now do it in 90 days. How do they respond to this? What do they do?  They say okay. Well stop bundling that have to stop bundling chrome in the Play Store in Android stop requiring companies that offer  Dickey Google services version of Android to from offering the  Androids big deal. Although as you pointed out quite well quite aptly Jeff last week  That causes confusion in the marketplace because you don't know what you're getting  Am I getting a Google Android phone or an Android Android phone? Yeah, but also the challenge is

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That if you offer any phone with Google services, you have to offer your phones Google services  So that's the piece that they want to break  So it means if you're if you're trying to give a parallel operating system  If you also ship phones that have Google's full approved version on  That's a that's a has to go everywhere thing. So that's that's one of the courses they're trying to break  but the the other browsers thing is a bit weird because they can't install other browsers and  You know, there is the Microsoft remedy where they they require them to give them a choice of browsers

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Install time that's as bad as the cookie the cookie announcement on the websites  Which is also in response to the EU. So Greg Farrow on Sunday made actually convinced me  That there was an issue with Google's behavior that in effect  They preempted any by giving away Android by doing what they did. They get preempted any competing operating system  they basically  Made Android into the monopoly that it is by by

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Convincing everybody Sam song. Okay, what's wrong with that? That's that's becoming the monopoly is not a problem. There's nothing wrong with that  And there wasn't anybody else stopping anybody doing it, but but it was good for consumers. It was free  It made for well, it's the same issue

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Competition when Microsoft started giving away Internet Explorer  It actually killed Netscape because Netscape was charging for their browser Microsoft gave away  One well Netscape died so consumers won  Only because along comes Apple and Google and created competing browsers. Otherwise Microsoft didn't explore browser

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We got a free browser that on its face is good for consumers. It's but bad for choice

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, it's dumping all right. It wasn't it's this is it  This is a this is a long-standing Intel did the same thing with its chips  It dumped its chips and it killed competition and then what this is Amazon you could argue tried to do the same thing with bookstore  By undercutting bookstores putting them out of business and then they can raise it to this then they get the monopoly  They can raise it that is a long-standing  problematic and  Illegal behavior by a lot of companies. You can't stop schools. What's Google raise the price on?  Well, eventually if you own Android they can do whatever they want if but they haven't done it and that's to become the only competitor  Right now is iOS and it's not much of a competitor anywhere, but the US

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, but the but Android was you know  Largely in response to iOS and because Google was very worried about being shut out of it  That was that was part of the reason to put so much I understand that but but the question is to Google's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Behavior with Android it was it really to keep anybody else from entering the market against them  No, it was a way. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was a way to come to Kevin's right was a way to compete with iOS. It was a very clever one  I understand was that but it was also but didn't did they not dump?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Android in order to prevent competition

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, well, they made an episode. I wrote I posted a link to something. I wrote this in 2011, but  They made an open source operating system, which is which is in line with Google  You know values and behavior and made sense to build open source infrastructure, but they but they also  Separately created at this contract where it was get access to Google's proprietary stuff like the App Store  and  and  Chrome rather than chromium and  You know a bunch of other things that are actually quite useful like maps  You have to sign a contract with them and so they have to so  In order to in order as you say as Jeff said in order to get like the full  experience of Android  You have to you have to buy these things you have to sign up on there to do that and initially  A lot of people built these parallel universe androids that had different stuff on you Samsung still does it  Every time you buy a Samsung phone you get two copies of everything the Google one on the Samsung one and it's confusing as anything  but  Samsung, you know what if Samsung wants to ship the Google version at all, they can't just make their own. What was it called?  Tenzin Texan something like that. Tizen. Yes, Tizen. Yeah, they said okay, let's try it. You know, we're big enough  Can we build another OS?  Well, you can but you're gonna have to build and make a set of subsidiary that only sells those phones and that you can't  Send them because you have a deal with you. So the sense right so they so in effect Google killed it  Yeah, well not killed it I mean they

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They made economically not viable to make ties to bring ties in any farther forward  The only thing that ties it ended up on was watches because it didn't violate their agreement with Google  Yeah, so that's what I'm saying is that Google that is predatory behavior and is traditionally considered  Anti-trust or trust-busting or whatever it is. What's the opposite of it's monopolistic behavior trust creating  Creating yes. So this article on your blog a pay us a pig and he is called two faces of Android from January  4th 2011 and actually initially this was my argument of why I felt like Google is being punished unfairly because they gave away Android  That's you know, that's a good thing  You have an open-source version of the operating system and so many people as you point out  Benefited for that he called it a Cambrian explosion of new Android devices and it's a different market reality

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We can't always use the the analogs of a scarcity based market in an abundance based market

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, no, that's true. And that's you know, and I'm a big fan of open source software and it is better  Apples had actually does the same pattern. It's you know, you don't really hear about it  But the underlying part of iOS is open source  It's a free BSD for Darwin. Yeah, you can you can get the code you can inspect those bits  But then there's a layer of stuff that that's Apple only and they have to get permission to use that part and Google is less  Restricted than that and that's the you know, that's the major competition  So it's a trade-off but they but it's the fact that it is open source means that you can do lots of interesting things  But people still do interesting things with with Android. I mean  Yeah  It's it's starting to show his age a bit Amazon's doing an interesting thing with the Android

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean there the fire platforms Android  Yeah, and you can even download later after the fact the Google Play Store and get the best of both worlds

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they are deadly competitors. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Man, I wish Greg Farrow were here because he'd convinced me on Sunday now you guys are I am I am like Donald Trump  I'm a tree or whatever. I talked to last  Don't know what Leo

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Microsoft winning would have been  If we'd have to use Windows Windows LA here, whatever it was called

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think here in the US we don't we have a little bit skewed vision on this because  iPhone while it's not half it's close to half and so they're really it looks like there's a very good  Reasonable choice here between Android and iOS and Android you have all these different manufacturers  It really is a vibrant ecosystem. It feels a lot like Mac and Windows  But I think in the rest of the world Android is so dominant that maybe there's a different point of view  I don't know but you know what Leo I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Would argue that everything all sin should be forgiven if they come out with a new pixel book

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I might agree with you on that. Let's talk a little bit about the data transfer project  Yeah, has has hell frozen over  Does this even to see the Facebook Google Microsoft and Twitter logos on a page all together now  How can this be?  We'll talk about Facebook. Yeah, we'll talk about the DTP in  Just a bit but first a word for  Rocket mortgage our sponsor for this episode of this week in Google if it weren't for our sponsors  We wouldn't have a show. So thank you quick and loans now  Let me tell you why you might want to take advantage of their  Rocket mortgage quick and loans is very I one of the things I admire about quick and loans very customer focused  typically in the mortgage business that mortgage folks worry more about  Interest rates they're more about their business  Then they are about you because who you're gonna call. What are you gonna do?  You're you're gonna go to someone else so they kind of dominate quick and loans  Which is the biggest lender in the country got there not just because they have great rates  But because they really are customer forward they really think about your experience. I'll give you an example  We've talked before about rocket mortgage an entirely online mortgage approval process. You could do it on your phone  at an open house get approval and  And and buy a house that is remarkable given that the industry was, you know  Really built around people going to a bank  Filling out a long application getting a lot of paperwork taking weeks to do it months in some cases  So quick and loans has already cut through the red tape with rocket mortgage now  They want to reduce your anxiety see one of the problems  This wasn't a problem until recently interest rates just started going back up for a long time for the last few years interest rates have been  flat  so this this anxiety I remember it because I've been  You know, I remember buying homes in the era where interest rates are going up, you know half a point every month it felt like  There's a lot of anxiety when you're shopping for a house and you don't know, you know  Is the interest rate gonna go up?  I gotta buy it before it goes up because even a quarter of a point and interest rate increase means tens of thousands of dollars  An expense over the life of the loan. So you want you know, it's gonna be expensive  It's most expensive thing I'm buying I got but you don't want pressure because it's also the most important thing you're buying  It's the place you're gonna live for the next many years  You want to have the luxury of really finding the perfect house?  This is how quick and loans and rocket market is doing it  They call it the power buying process and there's two things that happen first as always they'll verify your income assets and credit  Automatically they have relationships with all the financial institutions  You just have to give them permission and in less than 24 hours  They'll give you something called a verified approval another the verified approval makes you basic  So you see there's pre-qualified approval you get that in minutes the verified approval within 24 hours that is basically  Gives you the strength of a cash buyer when you're buying a house and the seller sees verified approval. That's a guarantee  You're good for it. You have the money  You the loan is already approved. That's fantastic  But the next step go down one more after pre-qualified and verified now we get the rate shield approval  Once you're verified you qualify for this all-new exclusive rate shield approval. They lock your rate up for 90 days  90 days so that means you have three months to shop with no anxiety, you know what your rates could be actually  There is one exception that if the rate goes down your rate goes down  So, you know, you're it will never know go higher and you know, it might even go lower  Either way you win. It's the kind of thing you'd expect from America's best mortgage lender  This is called thinking about the customer first to get started go to rocket mortgage comm slash twig rocket mortgage comm slash twig  Now I have to say the legal stuff rate shield approval is only valid on certain 30-year purchase transactions  Additional conditions or exclusions may apply based on quick and loans data in comparison to public data records equal housing lender  licensed in all 50 states and MLS consumer access org number 30 30 all you have to remember rocket mortgage comm slash  Twig from quick and loans. It's rocket mortgage  Reducing eliminating the anxiety in home buying  Jeff Jarvis is here  from buzz machine comm our good friend  Mentor I would say you're my mentor Jeff. No, it's the opposite. You're mine. What do I know?  Kevin Marx, he's he's a mentor too. He's the king of the open web Indie web org  Actually, I want to talk a little more about that in a bit Kevin  But first let's talk about this Google  way back when  Was it who is it? Was it Brad Fitzpatrick?  Brian Fitzpatrick who created the data liberation front. This is more than ten years ago  This was one this I'll be honest that's  What won me over to Google period it's like any company is committed to me more than its lock-in  I love and you see so many companies that are all about locking in the you know Apple just lock in lock in lock in  so so  Fitzpatrick and his team I  Always had this data great data liberation front and they even the great name data liberation front where you could get your data out of Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's takeout.com now is like the actual

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, this is the old this is actually the old  Logo which is awesome with a raised fist breaking the shackles binary numbers. Yeah. Yeah  So this Google became Google takeout  so  they're going they basically that notion of  Google takeout is now being extended and I have to think that maybe we can thank GDPR for this a little bit  to the data transfer project its data transfer project dev  But look who's involved in this not just Google Microsoft Twitter and Facebook  They are quote committed to building a common framework with open source code  That could connect any two online service providers. This is the thing that  My jaw dropped enabling a seamless  direct  User initiated portability of data  Of data between the two platforms in other words no lock-in

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's also good for the companies because they have the chance to learn more

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay. Yeah, so tell me  Tell me  Because for I don't buy it  Right, maybe from Google. I don't buy it from the other guy. Why would they do this? I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Think it's this  From a consumer perspective, it's like saying give us your email and we'll tell you who your friends are. Oh  How so I mean from this is not like you can say I'm gonna leave Twitter or whatever I did on Twitter  I can now do on Microsoft, right?  You're not you're not shifting one for one to a new service  It's the same  But instead if I give permission if I say that's my data and I want to move it across because I'm gonna get benefit there  Okay, it's easier for me to think Amazon in a way because but it's not one of them

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So interestingly not none of these guys Facebook Google Microsoft or Twitter really are in direct competition except maybe Google and Microsoft  Yeah  Yeah, Google plus

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, but I mean Microsoft's Azure and Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google services maybe a little bit right but Amazon's the Amazon's the  Thousand pound giant. Yeah. Yeah. So okay. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Even looking here even looking at this white paper  I'm getting flashbacks to open social and some of the same diagrams that we were using

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Social is a federated Twitter basically

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Open open social was our attempt to do a unified  API for different social networks out so that you could write an app and run it in mobile and social networks

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm asking on as an example and I mean there are many examples

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This was the Google project. I worked on ten years ago when I was at Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not anywhere open social social but isn't that isn't that good new good new social and all those aren't those open social

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, not really. There's bits of it that have there's some kind of and mastodon  mastodon is built on  activity streams and web finger and  The O status stack and it's now a little activity club, which is it?  So there's a set of protocols there. So can you social and mess it on there?  There's a there's a chain of these different protocols that we've been building for a long time and there's there's an overlap between them  So this this is another attempt to do this, but this is not trying to solve that problem to the same extent as as  Jeff said it's more about import export than data portability and that stuff and  Facebook was like the the big company that did that they bought up all the other companies that were doing address book import export  doctors and two or three others and  Made that their core focus of Facebook  and the and  The competitors to Facebook have been ones that use your phone address book directly as your source of knowledge  As opposed to something held by Facebook in the cloud and then Facebook bought a couple of those as well  You know, that's basically what what's that did?  They said phone numbers are your identity and your address book of contacts through phone numbers  It is your graph and we'll use that as a thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I completely then this is not this is not the Blue Moon event that I thought it was this is just

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Start of something good. Yeah, I always approve of it when companies try and do these kinds of things  and  If they if they if we can get better in trouble, that's great  and the actual work of it is lots of very very boring discussions about  What you call someone's first name and last name and how you structure things like that?  You know, we've been enough of those over the years but  Here's an example

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In a hypothetical example, this is from the white paper a Google Photos user wants to move their photos photos to OneDrive to Microsoft  They go to Google's file transfer interface  Choose the destination OneDrive and hit send. I  Mean that is that is  You know that's moving off of Google Photos  They're making it easier to leave

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, well they make it easier  You know Google has already had this with takeout, right? That's why it's more surprising to hear Microsoft saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, we're gonna do this with Google or Facebook saying okay, we're gonna do this then Google Google's the one that's always been kind of in  favor of this although  Takeout delivers it in an XML or a CSV and you know some kind of bland data format that you then have to figure out

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Import and it's not you you have to download it but but also, you know  Diffusing something that somebody can write something against the theory here is they're gonna write a common API in the middle that you couldn't  Move stuff directly, but then you have all the mapping problems that you have for those kinds of APIs, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is which is not trivial, but it's so instead of writing an individual adapter in effect  That says okay. Here's how I port my Twitter  Graph to my Facebook graph the companies will do that all for you transparently

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You said that that's the bit they won't give you  Actually this week, you know  There's I put two things in the timeline for this both Facebook and Twitter have locked down their developer APIs even further. That's that's right  They're under the run to Facebook Facebook moves to restrict this API basically  Bridgy which is one of the IndieWeb projects that's used to move back and forth in Facebook Twitter  Is having to give up on using Facebook because the new API restrictions that Facebook has put  To fight Cambridge Analytica  Mean that actually they're breaking all these APIs and Twitter has just announced that they're changed. They're limiting all their APIs  Notionally to fight bots and spam, but in practice it means that  Not alive that I used to live tweet is gonna be against their rules and I got shut down using it in Dubai last month  Because they thought I looked like a bot and now they're explicitly saying if you build an app  That posts more than 300 times in three hours, and then you're gonna be shut down

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that seems fair. I mean who would want to post more than 300 times in three hours

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If I'm live to any a conference as I do I can quite easily write I've hit

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've had a little bit. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it depends, you know, it depends what you do  Is it like any of these things?  It's like as soon as you try and write a rule  You're gonna catch some people who are using platform in productive ways as well as people who are using it for spam

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I should still say this is a good thing, but it's not as good

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's promising and we're gonna keep an eye on it, but the the underlying challenge the hard challenge is  Understanding  When when the computer is actually actually on your behalf and when it isn't  and  This is this is the sort of the deep floor that comes from unique submissions portal of well if I'm running this program  It's running as me  And if I want to write something else, I can SU it and run it as the super user  and the challenge is is that  That isn't true for ordinary users. That's a very program of a worldview  and but  The answer is not do not give users the power to do this kind of thing. It's make it clear  What which ones are doing what?  and that's the I think the  Takeout stuff is fairly clear that you are dumping out everything you ever put into this site and getting it back and the Facebook  Data dump has got better at that as well, but they're still in this and you know, they're still in this weird form  Facebook's is particularly noxious in that  They will give you your half of all your conversations  All links to other people into just their names  And so they're they're sort of stripping it of any context and just giving you a textual version of it in effect

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kevin are there are there potential businesses that can be built on top of this? You know, I add value to your photos in some way  You know give me your all your tweets and I can do something with them

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sure, I mean the theory there are and the challenge is you know, and that's actually this is this is part of the GDPR  Rule set as well. I mean part of the reason that I suspect that they're looking at this  There's data portability is one of the pillars of GDPR

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's kind of what I thought is this is a little GDPR response and and we've had things like that here with

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  mandated transfer of data for things like  Power companies and some kinds of financial services in the UK and EU as well  So there's if we  You know if we can do it  It's great if you can actually define something to move something back and forth without having to write a custom import script for every combination  That is a great thing  You know is if I've spent chunk of my life  Try to help with those kinds of standards and some of the work better than others, but the challenge is always  There are two chances one is do you actually have a mutually coherent data model?  and the other one is this permissions thing of is this app acting as me or is this app  Exploiting me for some other purpose and that's the piece that Facebook swung too far one way is now swinging too far back the other way

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, we have a bunch of we got to get Jeff out of here in the next half hour, so we're gonna

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Trot through a Facebook stock is now down 20% Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, I feel like I think well, but I think that's also that's not a response obviously to the quarterly results. I mean it's  Proximate to but I think it's also just a general feeling of malice

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, this is from from market from the from the announcement. It took a  hit right then and there and that's  loss of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  143 billion market cap. Well, I hope my blind trust by some Facebook stock right now. Yeah  Too bad it's not run by the Russians  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mean this is this is weird after our trading stuff. This is not actually yeah, that's right for our straight way after ours. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey good news 24 people have now been sentenced in India for pretending to be the IRS. I  Love it when these things get shut down  I actually held little hope but some of these people are getting prison sentences ranging from 4 to 20 years  lead defendant  M Patel was given 20 years in jail. He ran a team of  Runners from Chicago that helped receive and launder the proceeds  They pretended to be the IRS and the US citizen and  Immigration services, which is terrible to take advantage of people's fears  It's good thing good thing glad they glad they did that  Let's see. What else here?  Good news for people who believe in two-factor Google says that after employing  Hardware keys for 85,000 plus employees not a single one of them was fished  That's since early 2017 they started using the Yuba key this is from Brian Krebs Krebs on  Security and now word that Google is gonna make their own. This is bad news for Yuba key  Unfortunately Yuba key which kind of created and I use these Yuba keys  Created a hardware key that provides a second a factor now Google apparently is going to offer something they call the Titan key  Which include giving that one out at various have they yeah, it's not yet public  But eventually you'll be able to get it. They it does both Bluetooth. I think there's two keys  And this is what Google requires if you use their hardcore authentication  Which I tried for about a day until I realized that it broke everything  But you can use Bluetooth you need Bluetooth for something like an iPhone which has no USB access  And then the other one is just a hardware USB key type type a key  But you get an adapter you press the button on the Titan and it  I'm not sure if it's like the Yuba key that it generates new one-time passwords all the time  The original Yuba key was just a single long string like a typewriter  Then they got some some smarts in their processor in there and it was doing one-time passwords  I'm not clear on whether the Titan security key will do that. I but knowing it's Google. I think they probably will  It's it's a little more bulky than the Yuba key  They say they'll be they'll be selling it by the end of summer  from I should show I have my I keep my  Keep my Yuba key. Oh, I don't have my Yuba key on me. I have it my briefcase keep it on me at all times  But there's just the point is that it's even better than just an authenticator for two-factor and it just not basically not fishable

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I got a fisher fishing attempt today, I think  We try this on you critical security alert sign in attempt was blocked  From blocked them, but you should check what happened, but you should you should kick click this link, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but as well though this one was one other if you know fewer spelling errors. I got one that was really well done

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that that  Almost bit me. No, actually it didn't almost bite me, but it was pretty terrible. It says hi  Well, actually the subject is a password your password is it was a bit  It was a not it was a password. I used on sites. I really didn't care about a long time ago  I haven't used it in ages, but it was one of my passwords  Your password is this it gets your attention. Yeah, that got my attention and it said so  We figured out your password and and you were logging in  When you were logging into this porn site, we hacked your system. We videoed we made a video of you  Look at the porn site and of the porn site and oh by the way, we got all of your contacts  And if you don't send us $2,000 in Bitcoin in the next 48 hours  We're gonna send this video to everybody in your contact list  Huh, so combine that with the fact that it is my password

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not which they go from one of the possible issues

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which which and of course this is and I bet you this really works because yeah  If you you know all these data breaches if you go to have I've been pwned  You'll see that your email address the one they used and some of your passwords were leaked from target and all these other places and  Of course if you used reused your password on an adult site, then maybe this would be credible. You don't remember  so I bet you what they did is they go through the database of  You know  Breaches get all the passwords and emails and just send this email to everybody and I bet you it works pretty darn good  $2,000 the only the only thing is you have to figure out how to send Bitcoin  And I bet that's the only thing that kept them from making millions off of this scam  Yeah, needless to say I didn't send them anything. So if you get any emails with videos of me, please destroy those immediately  I  Thought that was a really good scam. I was pretty good

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can imagine the  Galvanic skin response goes yeah, yeah, cuz it's cuz it looks legitimate, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the entire web is full of videos of you Leo and they could just send that order because I know oh wait a minute

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's an article from the independent co.uk about this very scam the sextortion scam  Danny Bradbury knows your password, but don't fall for it. Oh  Yeah, this is the one I got this is exactly the one I got  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Think is there there are enough password leak dumps from something you don't do anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fortunately, I'm sophisticated enough that I immediately grok to what had happened and just ignored it  But I have to admit I thought for a minute. Well, could that actually have happened?  This is exactly. Oh except that Brian Krebs only asked for $1,400. The one I got was for $2,000  But they do say if you don't know how to send Bitcoin  Click this link for a video that will explain it  Which means I bet they got very few responses. I don't know. Maybe they made some money  all three recipients who sent their this email to Brian Krebs  said that the password is close to ten years old and  None of them had been used any time in their current computers and that's exactly the case with me  It's clearly from a password dump from ages ago  But this is why you don't use the same password over and over  According to the FBI never send compromising images of yourself to anyone  No matter who they are or they say they are don't open attachments for people you don't know and  Turn off by the way, that's bad advice because the attachments are always from people, you know  Who have been hacked and in general be wary of opening attachments even from those you do know  Even from those you do know I think be more wary of ones from people you do know  Turn off and or cover any web cameras when you're not using them, especially if you're pleasuring yourself  I've never put tape over my cameras, but I guess maybe maybe I should  So just a word of warning if you get that email, yep, you're not alone a lot of people getting it and that's exactly you  You you you got it immediately Kevin, you knew

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah  I've got a really annoying one lossic or other my wife did somebody signed up for eBay with her email address  Whoa, which which is the in the XK CD?  Reverse identity that problem but the thing is  eBay does not send you an email saying please verify your email address and give you an insane  No, this is this is a mistake  So stupid and they allow people to start bidding on things before they verify the what oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So yeah, cuz I get I get emails all the time like that  Oh, you just signed up for please confirm your address because my email address is very very well known and I just figure  I screw it but that's a that's one to know about you could bid

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, so so so my office getting these things  So I eventually went in took over their account with her event with the email address because I could yep  And then change the email address to the name of the CEO of eBay actually know that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We see how it really is Gmail's fault they're not doing the right thing they're not

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, it's eBay's fool eBay. I mean Gmail. I'm at eBay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They should not allow you to bid until the emails been authenticated in the passwords

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But also and this is this is one for the engineers listing when you send out an email saying please verify this  Give me a button to say no, I do not verify this email good point  Because because this is a structural problem the people can sign up to sign you up the point and you'd about and say no  What me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Waymo has  Phoenix Arizona and its environs are now becoming the place for self-driving vehicles  So a word of warning to pedestrians  Waymo Google's self-driving car is now down there. And this is the strangest thing. They've done a deal with  Walmart you can go to Walmart calm  order groceries a  Self-driving Waymo will appear. It's not clear whether there's a safety driver  It's just an empty car will appear at your door you get in it takes you to Walmart where you pick up your groceries and takes  you back  Clearly this is a completely unnecessary trip  Yeah, but I realized the point of which is to get you used to the idea of getting in a self-driving vehicle and letting it  Take you somewhere in back  Right, right  It's a very they're also this one makes more sense. They're gonna do it with a rental car agency  So it'll take you to the rental agency that makes sense because you need a car and you can't get there

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The guy who said Amazon should replace libraries  Yeah  I know you use cookies fast company. It's okay  Does anybody like when those cookie things come up? What do you?  There's there's usually there's not a like no. I don't want to use cookies. It's just like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Click click X but under GPR you can't require it for entry anymore

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, which is which is why I got redrunk anymore  Right not missing it actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Trunk just fired half of the Daily News

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Newsroom including the the editor-in-chief when I was there at the Daily News  We have 450 people in the newsroom. Now. They have 45 45 1 tenth the number. Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And there was somebody great  I was saying all this money is going straight to the guy they fired for being a groper because he got a 15 million dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He got a huge settlement and by the way trunk went gravely into debt to buy all these companies so the it's it's his  golden parachute and debt service  Yep  Anyway the Forbes contributor who wrote that article saying  Amazon should replace local libraries to save taxpayers money. The the piece was immediately pulled down  However preserve for posterity by fast company  So just remember when you write something stupid it's never gonna die

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the problem with the Forbes contributor and that I hate I saw something that said that that  This guy I don't know if it's true or not, but that this guy paid it to be in it, right? I bet that's true

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wouldn't be surprised  Do they vet these people at all?  They say they do but well something they do

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Something they do there's there's tears right? There's a Forbes staffer who's good  And there's kind of selected Forbes contributors who they actually do select and they pay and then there's  This guy people who are good but most of them they're idiots they must pay because what uh what would Forbes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Interest in doing it be unless they could make some money on it  Or maybe it's just free content. Oh, it's free content. It's it's huge

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Louis de Borquin who was also at trunk and and took over the LA Times for about two hours  And took over the LA Times for about two hours  This was his brain fart and it it  Massively increased the amount of content they got. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even though it's bad content who cares right? It's just it's more much of it is a little bit

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The problem is you just don't know you don't know before you go Forbes link. It might be okay, but it might be crap

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's usually amusing

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's the point but this is the structural problem I was talking about at the beginning  Is that they're optimizing for people being idiots about libraries? So they found some

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you think you think that's some drunken economist in Long Island?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Who's worried that the other thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's just a bunch of homeless people in the library and a bunch of dead trees  Oh, I just got a starbucks instead dust dust all over dust

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  dust

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that's passes for discourse now, I know it's so pathetic

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why you got to watch this show because this is good stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, right. Um  What's his face i'm just  Are you worried?  Go ahead just posted a great link about this which is  Um, I will send you the link put it in the chat room as you have been you're so good

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kevin spends a lot of time in our chat room

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hang on

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So this is this is sort of symptomatic of this an interesting culture clash. Um,  so clark there's there's  um a large profile about  goop and gwenith poultero in the new york times I was reading is  But but clive has pulled out this piece with saying goop was originally partnered with condé nass  But um gwenith would objected to them fact checking the articles. Yes, because dare condé nass group is full of all sorts of bizarre

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Propositions about yeah things to put in your hoo-ha and stuff  Yes, I did but I did the other thing I learned from this

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Rather than this because because he talks about how fact checking actually works. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Magazines, which you know why it was I uh, I wrote a piece for the aarp magazine  And I got like three or four e a piece by the way, they have very strict rules about  Attribution was a it was a 500 word piece was really short, but there were facts in it  So I made sure I had footnotes and the attribution everything. I still got called  Uh by the fact checker, which I welcomed  I thought it was great because I had asserted that the zenith tv that I watched the moon landing on  Was actually lower resolution than my apple watch  so  Uh, I had I I wrote a fairly long email explaining  Well, there's apples and oranges because that's scan lines versus dots but effectively it was  And they said okay good. I said, you know, you could if you're worried about it just just you could say approximately  That's what they I think that's what they ended up doing. What I didn't know is that goop  Comes from gweneth paltrow's initials gp  And that you add the double os because somebody told her that if you're gonna if you're gonna be a successful internet company  You have to have double os  Okay goop it's um fascinating fascinating

Transcript:  The jade egg the rose quartz soothing massage roller all on display at goop's wellness summit in los angeles in june  Um, yeah, that's interesting. Yeah. Well, you know, you know what fact checking can be a pain  Because it just you know  Sometimes you just want to say what you want to say  Orrin hatch is not dead  He tweeted he said uh google we should talk  Um, but really he should have mentioned it to wikipedia because as you can see that's where it comes this snippet  Is a wikipedia article that says orrin hatch died september 11th 2017 which was you know with wikipedia  It was probably some wag well

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
