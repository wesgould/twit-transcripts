Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This Week in Google, the show that covers Google and the cloud and joining us now from not quite the cloud, but the very snowy environs of Davos, Switzerland.  No, Davos is not the town.  It's, or is it?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It is.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's the town.  Jeff Jarvis.  You're there because you're the world famous Jeff Jarvis host of This Week in Google, right?  That's right, of course.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  How could they have?  I won the lottery among the three of us, didn't I?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And for those of you watching on video, Jeff hasn't gone native on us.  This is some sort of costume party going on.  He's got face paint.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's South Africa night here.  See the little things here?  And so you could go downstairs and get your face painted.  Oh, that's cool.  And you're wearing a suit.  I did it for you guys.  I did it for you.  It's quite a look.  I wear a tie.  And here's the official badge.  It gets you into things at Davos.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's awesome.  That's what they say here is Davos.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Clay Shirky was at another event before this last year.  And he said, people come up to me and say, are you going to Davos?  He said, why are they asking me if I'm going to get divorced?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, you're in Davos.  Davos.  Davos.  Is it part of the German speaking area?  Yes.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's a kind of German that sounds like nothing on earth to me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Sounds like Davos.  Also with us, Ms. Gina Tripani from SmarterWear.org and Lifehacker and CompleteWaveGuide.com.  Hi Gina.  Yes, sir.  So we're a little later on.  We'll go downstairs with Jeff to see what's going on at South Africa night.  Is every night a different night of the week?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, this is the soiree at the end when we're supposed to dress in tuxedos or native dress.  I saw Michael Larrington earlier and he was in the Native American dress called blue jeans.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's valid.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Surprising.  That's typical of Mike.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He's not going either or.  He's going his own way.  I have to send him your regards.  Please do.  I've got to send him one of these stickers.  So while you were in Switzerland, you got to talk to Marissa Meyer, Eric Schmidt, Chad Hurley was there from YouTube.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And David Drummond and Nikesh Arora.  Wow.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What was that?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I managed to luck into it.  They had a briefing for a certain select press and I whined and asked to get into it and so I did.  They had us meet at a cafe up the street from here and then we walked to the safe house.  It's an apartment that they do up in Google stuff.  And so we talked to them there for about a little over an hour.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And how forthcoming were they?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think fairly forthcoming.  It was on the record, though I heard there was some discussion about whether it should have been, but it was.  They said clearly.  And I think some news came out of it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You wrote a blog post about it, but here's your chance to talk about it in a little bit more detail.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, for the rest of the world, I think China was probably the bigger news.  But for our end of the world, I thought it was big news that they said that they are now going to consider being transparent about the splits on AdSense.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So why is that an issue?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, I was in a conference before this in Munich called DLD where the head of Borda, which is the largest magazine publisher in Germany,  complained to Dave Drummond, the chief counsel of Google on a panel that the Germans are really going after Google.  They're filing suits for the government.  They're trying to go after copyright.  There are all kinds of stuff.  They're just whining like crazy.  And he said, we want a fair share.  And so I asked a fair share of what?  You know, AdSense?  And he said, yes, we want transparency and a fair share.  Well, wait a minute.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't understand.  Oh, because we don't I guess they just pay you what they pay you and you don't know how much of the total revenue that is.  Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And Drummond was saying things like there are some people that are up to 80 percent and there was catcalling from the audience.  You know, who's that?  And so I think that he must have come back.  And they're saying that they've been talking about this for a while.  But it was convenient that it came right after this German confrontation.  It's a bit of peace there.  So I told the German publisher then last night that this had happened.  And there were big smiles.  So the Germans and the and Google are trying to meet with each other and trying to find some level of peace.  But what happened here that's important is that at least this one German publisher put a fence around it because there's this belief by some that Google owes publishers some of their revenue all around because you have our content.  That's rather absurd.  And Drummond said, I don't owe you anything for a search where someone comes in and searches for a camera, goes to the store and buys it.  You had nothing to do with that.  And so that's why.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Why should they get credit for that?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But the publishers are kind of acting like you use our content thus.  And of course, we all know that's dumb, but they don't know it's dumb.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But it's completely reasonable to say.  But as as as a blog publisher, publishers, the two of you, you probably would agree that if they pay you a buck for somebody visiting your page, you'd like to know that's a buck out of how much.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Exactly.  I mean, the two big complaints I had about Google in my fanboy book were China and lack of transparency about AdSense.  So, you know, they just ticked off two of them, which is which is kind of cool.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So do they have a time frame for when they might say this?  No, it was very vague.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It was we're going to consider it, but you're not going to say we're going to consider it and then say, you know what?  We thought about it.  We considered it.  And the answer is no.  No, they're not.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But I understand, you know, I mean, I understand how well they might not want to tell you what they're getting paid for that ad.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So I have one AdSense in years and years.  So if you're a web publisher, you run AdSense on your blog, you log into your AdSense dashboard or whatever, and you find out how much Google is paying you.  Right.  But they don't. So it doesn't show you what percentage of what they get paid for advertisers.  That's the issue.  So how did this other person know that someone was getting 80 percent?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Because Drummond said that some get up to 80 percent and some complained about that.  And then I saw Drummond here in Davos and he said, you know, haven't you heard of volume discount?  And so I think that to me, I was talking with the publisher today and I think that if Google releases this, it also creates motivation to try to move up the ladder of share.  You get more traffic, more relevance, better performance.  Maybe you'll get a higher share.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, definitely. I mean, like that's how Amazon Associates works.  Like if you the more you can go into a program that's tiered, right, and the more that you sell with your associate ID, the higher percentage that you get.  But but but the Germans have a problem with the ads that Google shows on its results page itself.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, that was the thing.  This publisher at Berta said AdSense and I'm not sure he knew what he was talking about.  But those are ad words, right?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's the difference.  Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And but but I then saw a colleague of mine at the Guardian still complains that Google takes our content and scrapes our content and we deserve a share of what they do.  Well, no, because then Google would have to pay every website in the world.  And you're getting the value, as Eric Schmidt has said more than once now, we send you four billion clicks a month.  It's up to you to do something about that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He also said that we're going to try to do a better job of or you ought to do a better job of making your content sticky.  And we like to do a better job of having that work for you because that helps us.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right. So Marissa talked about I asked about what they're going to do about newspapers and the press.  And she said it focuses on two things.  One is make them money and find more ways to make them more money.  And I'll come back to that in one second.  And the second is trying to improve the form of news and make it more compelling and engaging because newspaper people aren't making it very engaging on the ad side.  And I frankly didn't fully understand this, but they what they said was that their next big push in in this world is going to be into display.  They're going to bring the science of Google, they said, to display.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I read that on your post.  I don't know what that means to mean the banner ads.  Yeah. And so what they're going to do is so funny to hear them say the next big thing is display when most of the rest of the world is saying, what do we do besides display?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's where so much money is, is branding as opposed to click through stuff.  And what they said was that advertisers now buy sites.  Yes.  Google's going to enable them to buy audiences.  And I said, well, they're going to aggregate.  Yeah, they're going to aggregate audience and then give you demographics and stuff.  But I said, doesn't that yet again disintermediate publishers and hurt their branding?  Well, basically, the answer was if they make more money, dot, dot, dot.  They won't mind.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  One of our German listeners in the chat room says Berta is kind of the Rupert Murdoch of Germany, kind of old and out of touch.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, actually he's...  Doesn't sound like it actually.  No, he tried to be rather hip.  They invested in Glam, Etsy, science blogs.  They're actually pretty cool.  He asked the right question.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He wanted to know what percentage am I getting?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think transparency was a fair argument to make, but I'm not sure all fellow publishers agree.  But the point is we're seeing some movement here and it was neat to see it from one conference to the next.  And I asked Google people whether this was actually news.  They said, yep.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, that's great.  It seems very doable to me.  I mean, Amazon does it.  You see how much you get a report with everything that people bought, how much it costs, what percentage you got from that.  I mean, and it changes depending on how much you sell.  It doesn't seem...  And this aligns totally with Google's whole transparency, openness, Google dashboard thing, right?  I mean, it seems like presenting those numbers is a no-brainer.  I'm surprised they haven't.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You know, you're right, Gina.  When they started talking about display and how this becomes a platform and network that anyone can use, any site can use, then as I think about it, you mentioned this, it becomes even more important for them to be transparent about that.  Because if you're going to hand over a big hunk of your ad inventory that you sell, then you'd better know what the business deal is.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So now when we say display, are we talking about individual banner ads or are we talking about buying the entire page and filling every ad space with a particular campaign or even custom graphics on top of a logo?  Are we talking about branding a whole site or are we just talking about regular banner ads?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think we're talking basically about regular banner ads and such, you know, big-ass ads, as we call them, or other forms.  There's a whole bunch of standard forms from the IAB, the Internet Advertising Bureau.  I'm sure Google will sell them all.  And so, you know, they'll be as creative as they can.  But basically, I think that might work for a site that says, I have no sales force, monetize me.  But for a big brand, they'll give Google their remnant unsold inventory, which all sites have plenty.  Yes.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what happens at Lifehacker.  Lifehacker sells in all the Gawker sites, right?  The sales team sells custom campaigns, some of which includes branding for the whole site.  And then remnant are AdSense and other kind of programmatic banners.  But those are just banners or units, you know, versus like kind of big branding thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Great. More banner ads.  Yay.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We love banner ads. Why not?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Before we get to China, some other news from the briefing here in Davos from Google was that they're very proud now of YouTube and say it's making money.  Yeah.  When pressed about the definition of what that means, Schmidt wouldn't say, well, it depends on the accounting rules you use.  But he would say, which accounting rules?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So you make the point that it could be cash flow or it could be profit, either one.  Right. Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right. Right.  But he, you know, he praised Chad Hurley for finding the way to have YouTube make money.  He's very happy with it now that the distribution deals they're doing with big entertainment companies are working.  They did a big deal in the UK with channels four and five.  Hurley said they have double clicked now into YouTube, the ad serving platform, and they're selling ads on YouTube in 20 countries.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Hold on. Heather Gold. Gold is here.  Hello, Heather. Hey, Heather. Just joined us in the studio.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Hi, Gina. Jeff, I barely recognize you because you look so African to me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, it's amazing, isn't it?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'll start. The guys downstairs playing drums were incredible.  Oh, that's neat.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  So, Jeff, are those double click putting in video ads or static ads?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  On YouTube, they're, uh...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think they're just those slide up, slide under ads. I haven't seen any pre or post roll yet.  But, I mean, I'm sure that they would like to do that.  But double click does serve those ads that come up and sit there and annoy you until you click the X.  Those come from double click.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Yeah. And they're based on the tags with the video?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They seem to have some relationship to something.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Because there's a lot of porn stuff on YouTube.  I mean, it means that whoever's advertising there is getting a lot of stuff they may not.  For example, today I went to try to research some stuff, Gina, for the show.  And I went to my YouTube account.  And the latest comment on one of my videos is, you should have acid thrown in your face.  Great!  Which is awesome.  Yeah.  There happens to be no way to report that person.  And so, you know, you could be advertising on that. That's always fun.  Like a little homophobic terror.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I doubt it's comments. I would imagine that it's title, tags, caption.  And those things are all description. Those things are all required, right? When you upload a YouTube video.  But this is historic.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You can't control what it's...

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  I mean, just given the tenor of a lot of what's on YouTube, it seems like a bit of an...  Like, I can understand if they...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's historically the big problem with this kind of advertising, to be honest.  On YouTube in particular.  In YouTube, MySpace, it was a big problem.  Is that you just don't know where your ad... what your ad is going to be on.  And I think there's a lot of resistance from advertisers.  And the ones I've talked to say that these ads are not effective either.  That they're probably as ineffective as other display ads.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know how they're effective? People reach to close them and miss the X and click on them.  And then it looks like they got clicks. That's how effective they are.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You hit the nail on the head. That's exactly right.  You got it.  That's when it's happening, is there... as people are... click to close.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's like that flyover BS, which I can't stand. They're just like, they're so effective.  It's like, no, that's people trying to close them. That's people trying to... like not understanding what's happening.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We had Jacob Nielsen, the usability expert on Net at Night on Tuesday.  And they do the eye tracking stuff.  And he said the most effective advertising, his new book on eye tracking the web says,  the most effective advertising is text. Google AdSense style text.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  How is he judging effectiveness based on whether you like it or you click on it?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Whether you notice it.  He said, well, to give him the full quote, text and cleavage.  But if you look on the... I'm not... hey, I'm sorry, but that's...  Text in the cleavage?  No, not text in the cleavage. Well, you know, I don't think they tested that.  So the idea is what they do is they test hotspots on the page where people are reading and looking.  And so they can see that you are reading the display ads get completely ignored.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think you've just saved the ad industry and the media industry all at once.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Text and cleavage, everyone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, Hollywood's known about the latter for a long time.  I remember on the screensavers, we had a Hollywood producer come in and said, you know, it's missing on this show.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Cleavage. I brought cleavage today.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Thank you. You don't have to display it. You just have it.  That's the beauty of it.  Put an ad on, hey, Leo.  No. But if you look at Facebook, what do you see on the right?  Maybe you guys don't see it, but on my Facebook, that's what's always on the right is there's a text ad and there's cleavage.  Always. I'll go there right now.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Generally. Well, because you're a guy. If you're a woman, you don't get as much cleavage.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is that the case?

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Yes, because they're trying to give you things. I get crazy stuff that I would never be interested in.  But they try. They're trying.  That I want something pink.  Really?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You get more pink ads?

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  I totally get pink ads.  That's interesting.  And they try to pull you stuff that I guess people that you're really connected to somehow they've decided are endorsing companies, which I don't understand that.  I really hate that.  I can't believe some of the people I know, they're like, I want to call my friends and say, did you really?  What did you do that has Facebook saying you endorse this company or this ad?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  In any event, it's interesting that Google, after all of that, after all we know about what seems to work on the Internet, is saying display ads are the next big thing.  I wonder if that's a little disingenuous.  Isn't there a lot of pressure on them to say that YouTube is not draining the company dry, Jeff?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. These are two separate things.  The display ad thing is them trying to give more money to publishers and get more inventory from publishers and more information.  I think on YouTube you're exactly right.  And you know what? If it's a stop of drainage, that's fine.  We had the discussion on the earlier show that maybe it doesn't actually cost them as much as we think.  Right.  And they didn't want anybody else to own video.  You know, what he's saying is there's profound progress at YouTube.  And I think that's something.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Also, a word on the new Google Books settlement, the new one, because the first one got trashed, mostly because the DOJ said it's probably illegal.  And yesterday was the last day for comments on the new proposed settlement, according to an article in Ars Technica on their Law and Disorder blog.  Pretty much the same suspects filed pretty much the same objections to the new Google proposals.  Ursula K. Le Guin organized 350 authors who objected to the fact that the agreement would apply to anyone who didn't opt out.  She said it should be opt in, not opt out, and that it's a change in copyright policy.  The estate of Richard Wright weighed in as well in what Ars Technica called a diatribe.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  An estate had a diatribe?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The estate was diatribing.  It's like from the grave?  I don't know. Well, you know, maybe his heirs are very defensive of his stuff.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think the JD Salinger's lost book should now appear only on Google.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Rest in peace.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  One of the changes, this is really goofy.  One of the changes Google proposed, Google will help set book prices by, this is an engineer, engineers figured this out, help set book prices by developing an algorithm that simulates what the prices would be if there were competitive market conditions.  Amazon said, well, that's price fixing by a computer instead of a human.  What's the difference?  The claim, Amazon says, that this is acceptable or well-intentioned price fixing because it will supposedly mimic the market does nothing to save the revised agreement.  It also argued that some of the changes only cover direct to consumer sales and keep exclusive arrangements in place for subscription and institutional services.  Basically the same Internet Archive had the same objections.  Public knowledge objected.  I don't know if this book deal is going to ever go.  I really don't.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  So what Jeff, if you could orchestrate it the way you wanted it, what do you think it should be?  The book deal?  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, geez, you're making me think it's late at night here.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think this is, boy, greater minds than ours have attempted for years to figure this out and with no success.  So Jeff, if you can't figure it out in one minute at Davos, I don't blame you.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  This is the place for diplomacy and solutions to all the world's problems.  You know, I think what we've got to do is put the fence around the real issue, which is the orphan works, and leave those aside and give control to this, which basically already exists, to rights holders, whether that's the writer or the publisher, and get on with it.  And then we can, you know, it's like the health bill.  We can mop up the details later.  But stopping the digitization of books and the benefits that come from that, I think, is criminal.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It does seem to be that the orphan works are the chief area, although Google still would have, according to the ARS report, a significant degree of control over the future market for digitized works, essentially asserting that they're the ones who get to sell them once they digitize them.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The orphan works.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, is it only orphan works? I guess so. If they're not orphaned, then the owner, the rights holder has the rights.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, that makes sense.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  For some reason, this reminds me of a Hopi Goldberg movie I once saw, a really bad one, Jump and Jack Flash, where the evil person's plan was that they'd found a way to take everyone's half cents or somehow in their bank accounts and sucked all of them up.  Same plot point as used in Office Space and Superman 3.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Really? I'm sure it's got to be in ten other films.  It's a great plot point.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Sorry, I'm making it fine, but someone said, I know, I'll build an internet company on that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We will take the crumbs.  Well, anyway, so there's an update on the, I was asking this last week, what's the story with the Google Book deal?  And it is now, of course, in the hands of the judge, but it sounds like the same exact objections.  And the DOJ weighed in again saying this would change copyright law.  So you've got to think the judge is just going to say, well, I don't know.  What's the judge going to say? We asked you to go back.  They don't like to change things.  No, not copyright law, not in a civil suit. It's kind of anathema.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, and it is a problem. In Germany, the publishers are hiding behind the skirts of Chancellor Angela Merkel asking to change copyright law for their benefit.  Copyright screwed up, but if we start mucking around with the law, you may need to do that, but bad things can happen.  Then it gets out of control. You never know what's going to happen in the legislative process.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So the YouTube page has been redesigned. Anybody notice that? I don't like it. I can't do full screen as easily as I used to be able to.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Why? Why can't you do it as easily?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is it just me or is there no longer a full screen button on the darn thing?

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  There's a full screen button.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think that's changed.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  You mean that thing with the four arrows?  The four arrows?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You press the four arrows.  Okay, it is on some, I guess not on all videos then.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Did they add this little, what is this little two-way arrow thing? Is that new?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  See, that's what I saw. On some pages I only see that and then it's a pop out.  They added this middle deal.  Yeah, I don't like the middle deal. I don't see the four corner one on all my pages.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Is it only on HD or?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  I have to say, yeah, I don't know what the difference is, but they don't all have it sometimes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Okay, I'm looking at a page right now.  Here, I'll put it up on the screen.  Let me play with the settings here briefly so I can get it up on the screen for you.  Take it out of double box.  And this is, I don't know why, for some reason this video, you see, is like a lot of them.  It doesn't have that pop out box anywhere.  It just has this arrow thing.  Watch this video in a new window.  And then when I do that, then I think usually I get the four corner pop out.  Yeah, see now I can go full screen, but I have to, it's two clicks now.  Two clicks.  But that's not on every page.  A lot of these pages don't have this, they just have this simplified player bar.  I can't figure it out.  And then I've got the HTML5 thing going on.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  And how's that changing it?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I'm no longer using Flash, so maybe that's what's changed.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That might be it because I keep clicking and I can't find one video without.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You get it, okay.  So maybe it's because I went to HTML5.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Hey, is this camera on?  Do you have an option to do that?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes, that's kind of a neat new thing.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It lets you set the preference.  Yeah.  Oh, I see.  I didn't know that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So if you Google YouTube HTML5, then you'll go to youtube.com slash HTML5.  And then you can say, I want to enter the HTML5 beta.  And then I guess in some cases, maybe that's why I get a full screen is when you do a pop out  that it suddenly goes to Flash and now I go full screen because apparently HTML5 doesn't have full screen.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Well, if you had an iPad, it would just be full screen.  You're kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You said the I word and now we've got to talk about it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We've got to talk about it.  It was inevitable.  Did you notice that we've got a full half hour and we haven't mentioned it?

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  I knew you had it because I liked the genus links.  I was like, she's trying to not go there.  Well, you know, let's go there.  But before we do, let's do an I keep her alternative and an I pawn.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  OK, sorry, Jeff.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Jeff's looking like what?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What?  All the guys.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And I pawn Jeff looks like he should be in twilight.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I can sleep.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You look like you should be in twilight.  Avatar.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Avatar.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Are you blue?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, no, I'm happy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let me quickly do a commercial for Go to Assist Express.  We'll come back, give you a chance to gird your loins for an iPod, iPad discussion.  Gina got it.  So Go to Assist Express, my friends, is the great tool created by the folks at Citrix,  who are experts in remote access, designed specifically for folks in IT and support.  I've been using the Go to Assist since 19, maybe since 2000, 2001.  We're on the screensavers.  We used to use it all the time.  It's easy for you, easy for your customers.  That's important.  And it's very, very effective.  Here's the deal.  Even if your customer doesn't have it installed, all you have to do is send them a link.  They go to go to assist.com.  Quick 30 second download, usually less if they have high speed.  And now you're able to work on their computer, even if they're not there.  They can give you unattended access.  You can have eight sessions at once, so you can start and install, move to the next one.  The next one is really designed for the support professional.  It gives you a list of running programs, including the operating system  and any security software running so you know what you're working on.  You know what the problems are.  You know if there's spyware running.  You can copy files from your computer if you've got patches or fixes over to theirs.  I can go on and on.  I want you to try it free for 30 days.  If you're in the support business, maybe you're in IT or you have software that you support,  you really ought to know about this one.  Go to Assist Express, the new online tech support service from Citrix.  It is fantastic.  Try it free right now.  Go to go to assist.com slash twig, G-O-T-O assist.com slash T-W-I-G.  And you can be using go to assist in the next five minutes.  They have a day pass.  Try it for free for 30 days, but they have a day pass for if you do occasional support,  that kind of thing with family and friends.  Like a spa.  Yes, it's like a spa.  That's how I like to think of it.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Day pass.  Doesn't that make it sound nice?  It's like a spa.  You get a role.  So speaking of spas.  Yes.  How's that?  How's that for cool?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, very cool.  Is it super swing there?  I'm addicted to the saunas now.  Say again?  I'm addicted to the sauna.  And you're not even in Finland.  Saunas are awesome.  And down here in Davos, it's magnificent.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, it's good when it's really cold.  It's a cabin outside the whole house.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's a cabin outside the whole house.  It's a cabin outside the whole house.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  to the sauna.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Jeff, is everything paved in gold?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  that runs the world?  Here's the funny thing, Hannah.  The hotels are all sucky.  Really?  They're awful.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  They're terrible.  They're terrible.  It's a summer camp for moguls.  Wow.  Oh, yeah, I've noticed that about recent hotels.  I've noticed that about recent hotels.  But it's the best.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's a great point.  Yeah.  I mean, I think that's a great point.  You know, the hotels are way too expensive.  It's a lot of fun.  I mean, I think they're terrible.  They're terrible.  It's a summer camp for moguls.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  I've noticed that about rich people.  I went up to the Bohemian Grove for some of the richer...

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  You went to the Bohemian Grove.  Yeah, and somehow...  Now, we need to spend the rest of the show on that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The richer they are, the more down market they like.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Seriously?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I peed on a tree.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  You did?  Sure.  Do you feel closer to Kissinger?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, he wasn't there at the time.  No, he didn't cross streams.  You know, it's funny.  No, I didn't.  But even at the Bohemian Grove, the George Shultz Kissinger types have a removed cabin  distant from the rest of the...

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  And is their cabin really all that different?  No, and that's the thing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's like shat carpeting there.  No, it's rustic.  And that's the whole point of it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Is this kind of Burning Man for old farts?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  When really, really rich and powerful guys get together, it's the same.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Okay.  That is proof that the really rich and powerful people are wasps.  They are wasps.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They're wasps.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's exactly right.  I am Googling Bohemian Grove right now.  Oh, you never heard of it?

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Bohemian Grove is this creepy little place.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm not old and rich and powerful, clearly.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Here's the deal, Gina.  They don't let women go, except prostitutes they bring up.  Just for the record, I saw no prostitutes.  A little bit north of San Francisco, it's connected to the Bohemian Club, which is in  San Francisco.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Very nice gentleman's club in San Francisco.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Started years ago by journalists and artists, but it's not that Bohemian because it's mostly  George Schultz and Kissinger.  They all kind of get together.  Conspiracy theorists go bazooka with this thing like Gina.  If you start Googling, it'll be like there's a ritual with a giant owl, and the demons  come out at midnight, and they all have group sex with a twig.  People think that's how the world's getting run.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's not.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  It's not.  But it is a time where a lot of really powerful people from-

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  If there's a complaint about it, it's that they have access to each other in a way that  we don't because they get together, but they have that no matter what in their private  jets, at Davos, wherever they are.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  It's ritualized, and I think that creeps people out.  I know you dropped out, Leo, but I stayed at Yale long enough to witness the-  Skull and bones.  Skull and bones.  The boyfriend, yes, I had a boyfriend, was in Wolf's Head, and I went into one of the-  I've been in there too.  It's BS.  But they have some creepiness.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, they make up stuff.  It's to totally give people the sense that they are somehow magical.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  They're trying to feel safe.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They're trying to feel special.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  They need magic bones and stuff.  And it's the same BS.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They're just like you and me.  There's no power.  They're more scared.  They're just more scared.  They're more scared.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  That's why they need the sarcophagus and the bones and stuff.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's what I see here at Davos is what's here are the powerful who are all being disrupted.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, they're scared for real.  Really?  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I did a session yesterday.  I led one on transparency in international organizations, and that ain't coming soon.  Bankers, governments, whatever, media companies, the powerful are here, but they're not going  to be powerful for long.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But I think Apple chose the name iPad at one of these camp things.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There were no girls, that's for sure.  I'm sure this is what happened.  There were no women.  There were no ladies there.  Maybe it happened at Bohemian Grove.  Could very well be.  Could very well be.  All right.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Okay, you wanted to talk about the iPad or is it-  No, you were the one who dropped that.  Do we need to get rid of the-  I know that people are- I mean, it might not be technical.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think iPad is appropriate because it's kind of a cloud device.  It's certainly aimed at the Kindle.  In my opinion-

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Oh, and the netbook?  No.  No?  You don't think it's aimed at netbooks?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No.  I think it's very precisely not aimed at netbooks because if for half the money you could get  something that has a camera, flash, multitasking, all the things that people want, and a keyboard,  all the things people complained about.  Now I know that Steve mentioned the netbook, but I think really it's aimed at the Kindle.  It's a Kindle Plus.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Is that because you think of the kind of person who wants a netbook as someone who  might really program or use it in a more serious way?  Because a lot of the netbooks are aimed at least from as far as I understand in Europe,  and this is mostly from Clive Thompson telling me this, that those devices are aimed at trying  to make the computer more like the phone so that the device costs very little so that  you're really sucked into the ongoing data play.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, if that's the case, then Apple did a better job than whoever's designing the netbooks.  The netbooks are just little laptops, underpowered laptops that are really cheap and they sell  because they're really cheap.  But I don't think that's what Apple should be going after.  To me, it's a content device, so having a camera doesn't make a lot of sense.  In fact, I don't even understand why they had a keyboard extension on it.  But I'm curious if in Davos people are talking about it, because I would think if I were  creating magazines or newspapers, I'd be very interested in this device.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh yeah, a lot of publishers came by acting as if it was going to be the Messiah, and  the when it wasn't, they still had hope.  The publisher of the New York Times is here.  I talked to a lot of German publishers and UK and American publishers.  One of the publishers came by and said, oh yes, finally we can go like this again.  We can move the pages.  And I said, sorry, but serial media is over.  Serial media is gone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The link is up to that.  Yeah, but there is something to be said for skimming.  You think skimming's dead?  No, but I think-  So this is a great skimming device.  This is a device-

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And you can skim most anything, but I think what they really want-  You can't skim on the Kindle.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You cannot skim on the Kindle.  Kindle is a crappy skimming device.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But what they really want is something that regains their control over our experience.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well that's not going to happen.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And no, that's not.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Although Apple's trying- you know, the fact that Apple has made this ecosystem where really  most of the time you don't look at stuff on web pages, the New York Times will have a  New York Times button, right?  A New York Times icon, a New York Times application where they control the interface and all of  that stuff.  Ultimately, you and I both know they're going to have to do it on a web page if they want  to make it.  But the iPad gives them a way to make it a button.  And I'll tell you, as Twitter, that's the only way we can do it because it doesn't support  flash, so what we will do is have an HTML5-style application that has video and audio in the  chat room.  And it's going to be an excellent experience for anybody who wants to consume our content  live or on demand.  And I think that a lot of content creators, if they're creative, will think of ways to  make this a very powerful platform for them.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  I think it's exciting for creators.  Yeah.  Definitely.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What's the total penetration of this thing could possibly be?  How many units could it really-

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, according to TechCrunch, and I don't know if Mike knows something or is BSing as  often as the case, but he says 3 million Kindles have been sold in two years.  That's not very many.  I think that- and how many iPhones?  75 million iPhones in three years.  I think you're much closer to the iPhone end of the scale than it is the Kindles end of  the scale.  If you could sell- I think they'll sell 5 million in the first year.  They'll sell 10 in the second, 30 in the third.  That's a pretty powerful platform.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's no salvation.  Well, yeah.  It's powerful, but it's not a salvation.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Well, I mean, the thing is, Jeff, isn't there two things?  Is there actual business that could be in terms of wanting that saved, and then there's  the way life works as I know it being saved, and as you've been such an eloquent spokesperson  for it, that's been over a long time.  But in a way, I read a really nice little piece that Gruber linked off to.  I added it up there, Gina, by Fraser Spears.  The same thing is kind of happening for a lot of geeks too in the sense that the web  is hitting a place to some degree, not everywhere.  It's big enough to do everything.  Where the experience on this device is- I mean, it's not as geeky.  It doesn't give you all that control you talked about, Leo.  So in the same thing, post social media, there's going to be a way in which people will experience  it that talks about the touch points entertainment publishing business works on, emotion and  feeling and connection, and comes from that human experience down as opposed to from the  code experience up.  And I think that is disconcerting for a lot of geeks, and I agree with this piece by Spears  that that's one of the reasons people online have been a little wonky about the-  Oh, people are very upset about it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's as if they- there's two groups of people.  There's people who had such high hopes for it that it couldn't live up to them.  They didn't get the unicorn and pixie dust that they were counting on.  And then there's people who hate Apple and just kind of hate the idea of a closed box,  which it is, and are saying, well, it's too closed.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  But Spears is saying it's people who are doing the opposite thing what Jeff's saying the  publishers are doing, which is they liked the world in a way the way it was.  Geeks feel like you got to go through us because we make this stuff work and we know how it  works and publishers getting got to go through us because I know how things really work.  And both of them losing that, essentially.  But you can't-

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What I think it says too is that- and Mitchell Baker, the head of Firefox, the foundation,  said here at Davos that- or actually up at the DLD that the browser is out loaded now  just in the sense that we haven't seen any big changes in too long.  And so maybe one of the impact of the Apple product is that it makes us rethink the browser  and the webpage.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, and that happened when the iPod Touch came out.  Everything was application based.  But it does have a pretty full feature browser minus Flash, which frankly I don't mind losing  Flash.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Eric Schmidt here, when we asked him about the tablet and asked him whether they were  going to have one, he said, somebody tell me the difference between a tablet and a big  iPhone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, there isn't.  And that's the whole point.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  I'm planning on making the tablet my new phone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Really?  Yeah.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  How?  Which I've been tunnel vision.  I've been on a big wave.  Oh, you want to hang it around your neck?  Totally.  It's bling.  And I'm going to get to have different images on it all the time.  I actually-  I handled it and I loved it.  You know, because then where I have Wi-Fi, I can just have Skype because I hate AT&T.  I'm trying to get away from them.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I loved- I thought it was a beautiful device.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So you're buying one, Leo, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I'm the wrong person to ask because I have to buy everything.  But yeah, I'm actually- and I think if I were- well, I am a content creator, but I think  content creators are going to be very interested in this.  I think Amazon is going to have an interesting challenge.  But remember, Amazon is not really in the Kindle business.  They're in the book business.  So in the long run-  Right.  You know, it's interesting.  Macmillan all of a sudden disappeared from the Amazon store yesterday.  And the thinking is, oh, Macmillan's preparing to move to the iBook store.  But if I were Amazon, I'd be meeting with Steve Jobs like crazy right now saying, well,  let's work this out.  We want to sell books on the iPad.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Did you- the night before the iPad was announced, I can't believe I said iPad.  It's as bad as a vlog and webinar.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, we're stuck with those two.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Yeah.  Amazon announced that they reversed their split on share, on royalty share with publishers.  They went from 3070 to 7030.  And Paul Schreiber sent that to me.  Thanks, Paul.  And I did tweet it.  I can look for the link from him.  But it's like, well, you know, I always thought that share was wrong.  But-

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But Heather, is that after cost to AT&T?  That's an interesting point.  But I don't know-  More than half the money goes to AT&T.  And then Amazon was saying, well, we give you the publishers more than half of what's  left.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  No, Amazon put out a press release on their site saying that not comparing themselves  to the iPad, I'm really saying I'm assuming they put the release out because of the iPad,  that they reversed their split from 7030 Amazon published, like, book holder to reverse 3070.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So maybe Amazon is trying to hold on to the business.  They also announced an SDK.  They're encouraging developers to write third party applications, which, well, Gina, as  a developer, surely the Kindle is not the platform you can't wait to write for.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  No.  I mean, come on.  I mean, it's a nice idea, but-

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's ridiculous.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So, you know, I think the only question that remains at all is, is it is comfortable to  read on the iPad?  We won't know this for two months on the iPad as it is to read on the Kindle.  Because if it can-  The ink is the difference.  Yeah.  I've never- ink isn't that high contrast.  It's solid.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I just, you know, I just hate looking at a bright screen, a backlit screen, it's just  hard on the eyes.  Okay.  So that's the real question.  I do think that the iPad with the Kindle app and Instapaper would be a much better browsing  experience.  And I can't, as much as I have a lot of problems with it, I can't wait to hold it and try it  as well.  And I'm sure it's a fantastic experience.  It's a beautiful thing to hold.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's an amazing thing to hold.  I have to say that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So what about you two?  Are you going to buy it?  It won't be quite as comfortable to read on the eyes as the Kindle.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  I don't know, but that's the question.  Don't you read on the LCD all day?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  And at the end of the day, I don't want to look at a screen anymore.  I want to pick up my Kindle or look at the paper because my eyes are done.  I see.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So Jeff's question, would you buy it?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm not sure yet.  I don't think I'm going to buy it.  I'm going to go to the store and check it out.  I mean, to me, the iPad is just this, you know, it's just a giant iPod touch.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Would you buy it if it had Android on it?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, interesting.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes, I would.  Yes, I would.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The trouble goes, too, is that Schmidt here in Davos emphasized that the strategy is entirely  to get as many devices out there as possible.  And then the audience for it will lead to application development.  And he said the phone is the applications.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yep.  Yep.  And that's true.  And, you know, and the reason why, you know, the reason why I would get it if it had Android  on it is because, you know, my issue with it is that Apple decides what you can run  on the device.  Very close to.  Apple decides that you can't get a porn app and Apple decides that you can't get Google  Voice on your iPhone.  And maybe Apple is going to decide that you can't run the Kindle app because they've got  their own bookstore.  They haven't done that.  But they could, you know, make Apple decides.  Right.  And it's a device that's just like not that customizable.  It's not OS 10.  You know, I don't know.  Maybe everyone was like, well, why is everybody surprised that it's so closed?  This is this thing is a computer.  And I thought that maybe there's a possibility that a run full on OS 10 versus this kind  of lockdown iPhone operating system.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Do you think someone can make it run OS 10?  I'm not as.  Or Android.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  How about running Android or running Android?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, with the with the custom chip that they developed in house, it will be much more  difficult.  That's probably why they do it.  I think I have a lot of faith in our in our in our hackers.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It'll be jailbroken right away.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It will be jailbroken.  Although I'm hearing that that custom chip will make jailbreaking difficult.  And it could it could be a while.  And, you know, Apple goes out of their way to un-jailbreak with every software update.  You know, your device gets un-jailbroken and that takes time and effort.  Like they they don't want people to jailbreak.  They make otherwise known as regailing.  I would do that.  Regailing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is that what it's called?  I love that.  I like it.  I've been re-jailed.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Is this where the iPhone goes then?  Are they going to have the jailbreak proof chip?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I mean, well, you know, I feel like them developing a chip in house is a significant thing for  them to do.  I've heard a lot of a lot of reasons why they may have.  Maybe they needed a chip that was fast enough they could handle multitasking, right?  Because it's one of the big the big reasons, you know, that that Android one thing big  thing that Android can do the iPhone can't do.  Did they do it to prevent jailbreaking?  I mean, did they do it so that they can offer a different, you know, something different  than anybody else could possibly offer because it has Apple, you know, proprietary hardware?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Supposedly, it's ARM code.  It's an A9.  It's a custom ASIC part with the A9 cortex on it and or ARM chip on it and and custom  GPU on it.  But really, I think you hit the nail on.  I mean, it's not so very different than, say, a Snapdragon or the Tegra.  In fact, it's a lot like a Tegra 2.  But Apple controls what code can be run on it.  So I think it's really I think you probably hit the nail on the head that the real reason  for a custom chip is not performance, but control.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Control.  Wow.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  This all said, I mean, I like you'd say everything, but he I mean, he's mostly writing about performances  first.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We didn't know about the chip.  And it's only lately that that started to leak out.  And it's not coming from Apple.  And it may not be true even.  But it's OK.  But some but some bloggers are saying, oh, there's one blogger.  I'll see if I can find the link to it who says I talked to the foundry and he said and  that they said, yeah, this is the A9 in here.  So Apple's being very cagey.  Apple's not saying all they're saying is we designed it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's not this all said, I just want you all to know that I'm going to do my best to get  my book in the in the iBook store.  So you know, well, and think about this, think about this, Gina.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Now, not only is it a book, but it's a book that can have video and audio and multimedia.  It's a much richer experience.  It's a Harry Potter book.  It could come alive.  It can come alive.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So it's the EPUB format.  But it's with lockdown.  So EPUB is an electronic book standard, right?  A pretty open standard, from what I understand.  I actually I've just gotten into this whole electronic book publishing thing.  So I don't know a whole lot.  But from what I understand, there will be DRM.  So you will only be able to read the book on your iPad.  Or I'm assuming there's going to be some sort of limit to the number of devices you can  read it on.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  EPUB doesn't require DRM.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  No, it doesn't.  But Apple is going to include DRM.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  If you sell it in the iBook store.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  If you sell it in the iBook store.  Right.  So does EPUB support multimedia then?  It supports video.  And that's fantastic.  Yeah.  So I'm excited about that.  So as much of a problem as I have with it being sort of a closed platform, and as much  as I don't want to have a device where Apple decides what I can run on it, what I can't,  as a publisher, I am going to put my book in the bookstore because people aren't going  to buy it.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  There's so many more people to digital books.  I mean, maybe I'm the most pedestrian one, probably of the four of us, but I'm probably  going to get it.  But my thinking is, you know, I got the iPhone so early and I'm really hoping my contract's  done soon.  And once that happens, I might just go back to this other phone and use that for everything  else.  Because when I travel, for no other reason, it is like I travel a ton.  And the idea of carrying something that's one pound around is one and a half pounds  is nice.  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Do you travel with a laptop too?  Yeah, I travel with this MacBook Pro and I love this computer.  But, you know, I really would like to limit my weight on me.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So you what if you have to do a long email or something?  I'd get that little docky thing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Really?

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Yeah, I would. I mean, I'm pretty good on the phone.  Like I have teeny weeny hands, but it's pretty tight.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's better than the phone. It's pretty tight.  I'm sure it would be better than the phone.  I mean, it's got the keys are almost the same size.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  I want to try the physical little thing where it stands on the little stand and I would  type because I can see and I write a lot in airplanes and I can see that as a really  nice little simple way to.  For me to do just basic writing.  I mean, I wouldn't, you know, I wouldn't be doing video editing on it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But it's my guess that people who want a laptop out of it are going to be a little disappointed  that it's not quite there yet.  On the other hand, Apple clearly thinks so because they're offering pages, numbers and

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  people's use of a laptop.  I don't know what the ergonomic experience will be, but it'll be sufficient because I

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  think most people don't use it.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  They don't use much.  Not maybe, you know, probably people in the Twitter army, but I certainly can think of  lots of people who don't use it.  Slide deck.  Right.  I mean, unfortunately, I have more slide decks.  That's unfortunate.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Leo, how does the file system work?  Like with iWork, if you launch it on the iPad and you create a file, then what?  Do you email it to yourself?  Do you sync it with iTunes?  What is that like?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, this is, it's very unclear and it doesn't appear to have an accessible file  system.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  There's no explore.  You can't look at your file system.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But nor does the iPod touch.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Like the way iTunes, you'll control the sync.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's really, as far as I can tell, it's running iPhone 3.2.  It is an iPod touch with a big screen.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right.  So, but you're creating files in iWork.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, you're clearly creating files somewhere.  Now, it may be, remember Apple has a cloud solution for its iWork already.  Does it?  Yeah.  And in fact, it works.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Not MobileMe.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, it works quite well.  So, it's possible that they will support that.  I would expect them to support that.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  That's not MobileMe.  They have a separate cloud solution.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, maybe it's linked to MobileMe.  But if you use iWork, you could just say, I want to save this up to the cloud and share  it.  And it works quite well.  You can share it.  You can have it accessible to yourself.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Ryan in the chat room says, when you connect iPad to Mac PC, you get a file system mount  point with shared docs.  How does he know that?  With iPad apps, it'd be a Gruber.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I wonder how Gruber knows that.  I mean, we got to play with it.  We didn't get to connect it to anything.  He just touched it in his mind.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  I could tell.  He knew everything that was in the device.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, there are questions in that.  They're going to have to solve that.  And certainly, you could probably sink it.  To me, it seemed very odd that Apple released these three applications and a keyboard because  that seemed counter to me to what this device natively is, which is a content consumption  device.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It sounds like it doesn't know what it is.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Then that's a mistake.  If Apple...  I think Jobs made some mistakes.  He shouldn't have mentioned Netbooks because it's not where he's...  He should have mentioned the Kindle more than the Netbook.  He shouldn't have made these applications because that implies that it's a computer.  I don't even know if he should have had email.  It's really a content consumption device.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  But what about all the people who like really cheap computers, who use them unbelievably  simply for a little bit of word processing?  Maybe.  And most people think for those people, it is a less expensive laptop where Apple competes  with other companies that have less expensive laptops.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think the $499 price point is a key part of it because if any more than that, it's  too much.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  They're seriously in the content business in a big way to me.  That's to me.  They want to be in the content.  That's the sweet spot.  They're going to replace the interface for the television.  I've known they want to work...  I did some work with Tony Fidel who helped make the iPod happen at the startup before  he went to Apple.  It's one of the things I know he's been thinking about for an awfully long time.  I know he's left Apple, but I'd be very surprised if they weren't thinking about how do I get  the main interface to all this programming because that's going to be a tremendous point  of business control.  Just tremendous.  And frankly, the interface from Comcast and every other company is so horrible that it's  a big opportunity.  So that's my entertainment background sense of the device.  No, I'm with you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And I think that that's when the device explodes is when all these content companies start  building.  Gina, you may not want to publish a book in the iBook store.  You might want to make a complete Google Wave application instead.  A lot of publishers do that, which would give you a lot more control.  And by the way, look at the kind of ecosystem Apple has built recently.  You can have in-store, rather in-application sales.  So games do that now.  They'll sell levels within the application.  You never have to exit the application to buy another level.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, there's a lot of capability here that I think content creators are just going to  die to get involved in.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  And it makes the form of content you work in more malleable because we've had, I mean,  you know, Jeff, the entertainment businesses traditionally had all these separate revenue  windows and they've done it by having it be a separate form.  And they've been very attached to the form.  It's a book.  It's a CD-ROM.  It's a whatever.  And now, because right away, even the publishing itself has multimedia within it, you're already  shifting your content experience past those static forms.  So I think it has, I think that might.  I think you're right, Heather.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But it also increases the cost of creating content.  It was no big deal to have a little something.  Well, wait a minute, wait a minute, though.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But you don't, there's no dead trees and no trucks and no, doesn't it reduce the cost  of content?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So you make a movie and you make it for DVD and you add some scenes.  You make a book and you.  Yeah, but.  But now you're going to be expected to add stuff.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Isn't 30, isn't the cost of the New York Times only 35 percent of the cost of the New  York Times is actual editorial?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But that's what I'm saying is, Leo, that when you add the need to create that content in  another format, you have increased the cost of the content.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, I can tell you New York Times does video online and they never did that before when  they were just a newspaper, that kind of thing.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.  But they're going to save all this money on dead trees.  Doesn't that pay for it?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's a separate issue.  It's a British.  What I'm saying is that this doesn't eliminate the dead trees yet.  I think it'll happen, but it doesn't eliminate that.  But it does increase your cost of content.  So you make something for the paper, then you make it for the web.  And now there's this new richer experience and you have to make it for that.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Now, what I'm saying, Jeff, is I think we change the production process, which I think has  slowly been happening, which is you don't iterate.  You make the stuff more all at once.  The production process shifts.  I don't think it's we made one item and then we shift everything into separate forms.  Well, you're right about that.  I think the creation process changes.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  All I'm saying is you're going to have to have new expertise and new thought through  this.  And I think that what we're going to see at first is shovelware so everybody will be  underwhelmed.  Right.  And then somebody will come along and do wow-y stuff, but then you've got to hire people  to do the wows.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That might be the big risk for Apple here is shovelware because that's what killed CD-ROMs.  Right.  People were not willing as content creators to innovate.  Right.  And it completely killed the format.  And I could kill the iPad if content creators don't step up and say we're going to take  advantage of this medium.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  But the difference is between CD-ROM and this is think of all the iPhone app makers.  There is a lot more room.  If you're letting all the independent filmmakers, all the people that whatever at IC, at South  by who are already making more transmedia kind of forms, who are making films that involve  gaming with the film, that involve book elements and you create.  Yeah, but your audience for all that stuff is much larger, Heather.  I'm just saying that the competition doesn't only come from HarperCollins and the other  big publisher.  It also comes from independent creators.  Yeah, yeah.  In a much, who have a much faster way to distribute than they ever did with CD-ROM right next  door, like on the same screen, the same shelf space as so-called shelf space is the next  publisher.  So, and with more of a sense of, I think that kind of linear model is still the mentality  of publishing better than me.  But from what I know, they entertain business.  They're still very slow to think.  They think across synergies in terms of objects.  Oh, absolutely.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's why they talk about this desire for the serial experience again, that they can  put out their magazine.  It's basically the new PDF in their minds.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  But if they were creating transmedia from the beginning, it would be a different process.  I'm not saying it's simple, but I know I spent five years on my own talk show trying to develop  a kind of shoot one to run anywhere model.  I mean, it's weak and it's small and it's indie.  But I think if you had a little more resource, and studios certainly do, there are ways to  do it.  There are ways to create.  If you put a little more time and money in front of the creation, then you've got it.  You can make the app piece of it that lets you upgrade.  And the social gaming possibilities to me of this device are pretty awesome.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It'd be better if it had multitasking.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's the only, no, it's the first thing I thought of too.  And it kind of bugs me because it's almost like going back to DOS where you can only  do one thing at a time.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  What if you make an app that puts multiple things in the app?  You'd have to do it that way.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  In fact, that's how we would, if we did a twit app for it, that's what we would do.  Because I'd like to have chat at the same time as you're watching or listening.  But in order to do that, you have to make an app that has it all built in.  You can't just kind of have one going in the background while the other is going.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  But then at least you'd see it all along.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's not ideal.  I wonder if the reason there's no multitasking is because it needed to be compatible with  the iPhone and the iPod touch and they don't, for good reasons, they don't support it.  I mean, when you have such a limited device, I can see, you know, I crashed my Nexus One  Gina today.  Really?  Well, I was trying to listen to a podcast and Listen hadn't downloaded it.  So I put Dogcatcher on there and it started downloading in the background and it used  up all the CPU cycles and I couldn't dial the phone.  I couldn't do anything to the phone.  I rebooted it and I had to kind of trick quickly before Dogcatcher launched its task,  get in there and uninstall.  I mean, it took me 45 minutes before the phone was functional again.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Really?  So when it crashed, it just froze completely and it only responded to the power button  or was there some sort of...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So you push the application button and the application slowly...  It was so tied up.  And this is the problem with multitasking is you've got these very limited processors  with very limited RAM and it's hard for them to do more than one thing at a time.  And when it's a phone, I think it's okay to say the phone has to be able to work as  a phone all the time.  It cannot be tied up.  But when it's a pad, then I think it's okay to have multitasking because, you know, first  you have a little more RAM, presumably you have a little more power and maybe you don't  need to be so concerned.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But get out of mobile think.  So Heather is sitting there on her couch.  She's using this device and she's got Bluetooth headset on and it's her phone.  Well, that's...  Yeah, right on.  It's still a phone then.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Why do I need both?  I mean, I do for when I don't have Wi-Fi, but when I have Wi-Fi, I'd be really happy  for it to be my phone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, presumably they'll allow Skype on it and it does have a microphone.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  That's why I want there to be a camera.  I do tons of video chat.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I'm sure version two will have a camera.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  I'm sure version two will have it too.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Heather will be doing podcasts with you, Leo, on her new pad.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know what?  It could be that we could rename it the padcast.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  And I'll be running around the neighborhood so you can get a tour while I do it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Are you ready for padcasting?

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Padcasting?  I hated podcasting.  I can't even imagine calling it a padcast.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  I'm going with the iPone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  iPoned.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, the question, the multitasking thing, I mean, this is a computer science problem,  which has existed since, you know, for decades at this point.  You know, this isn't a new issue.  We're just dealing with limited resources again.  It became less of an issue when you had really powerful desktop computers.  It seems like, I have to say, if your Nexus One froze like that and couldn't recover itself,  didn't know well enough to kill the process on its own or whatever, that's just bad design.  It should know that if it slowed down to that point, it took you 45 minutes to get it back into a functional state.  That's just unacceptable.  I agree.  Definitely.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I agree.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And, you know, the iPhone, when something crashes on the iPhone, it just shuts, you know, just closes, right?  Like the process, you know, just closes, which is also kind of weird because it doesn't give you an error message or whatever.  But at least it just closes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You don't lose phone functionality.  And that's the kind of the key to the whole thing.  And I can understand why it needs to be that way.  But I don't understand on a pad.  But unless you're starting to now use it for communications.  I would.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  And I think once they put a video camera in it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, that's going to be the MaxiPad.  That's the next generation.  MaxiPad. Oh, you've already named it.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Great.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Can we just go back to the name thing?  It's a little offensive.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  You know, the offensive.  Not because.  Go ahead, Gina.  Take it away, Gina.  All the jokes have been made, right?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I just I just want to make it really, really clear to all our male listeners.  I don't want there to be any doubt in anyone's mind.  Like when an American woman hears the word pad, she thinks MaxiPad and Crunchpad is OK and ThinkPad is OK because like the first word is the focus of the word.  But iPad is pretty much all pad.  The word pad with MaxiPad.  So so what amazes me is that there was this like meeting of like Apple's marketing department and they decided that they were going to take the risk of having 50 percent of their market associate this device with a MaxiPad.  And like some.  I had no idea.  You guys is never.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And this is true to me.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Most things that people call sexist or racist Washington's I speak for racism.  But it's not like the thing in of itself is that horrible.  It's that it's clear that you ignored all these people and you never considered them as though they were part of and they clearly weren't in the room or couldn't say anything in the room.  That's funny.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What's the Barnes and Noble e-book they called again?  The Nook e-reader.  Nookie.  And so again, they didn't they didn't ask you in a teenager.  Right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And hey, the we.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And the we.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But the we.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But this is the thing.  Like the we is kind of a goofy name that maybe three year olds use to describe, you know, their private parts.  You know, the nook is kind of like also a teenager.  Pat, it's just it's just not it's not a good women just don't have good.  I have a hard time writing about it.  Like I don't want to I don't want to write it.  I feel kind of gross.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, it's funny.  My wife and daughter said the same thing to me yesterday.  And it's true.  A guy doesn't really doesn't leap to mind.  It's funny because you'd think it would be a guy would be more offended by it than a woman.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  The defense is not that it's bad that you mention something.  Mesturation.  Mesturation.  I mean, I don't care about that.  It's the business.  It's the ignoring people in the process and acting as though you're not going to buy it, nor were you going to name it.  It's not the people.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But women wouldn't wouldn't avoid it because of the name.  Right. You wouldn't know.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Women know.  But it lets you know that they ignored you and they thought you weren't really part of the whole thing.  It's like, well, can I say just in defense, it's not named for me to get well, maybe me.  But, you know, I don't.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But can I say in their defense, it's not it wasn't it was they just didn't know.  We didn't know.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Why were there no women in?  There are no women.  That's a bigger complaint.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's what I'm talking about.  But there are women in the marketing department.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Someone would have said someone would have put the brakes on it.  This is the thing that's so incredible to me is that I think it's one of the biggest marketing faux pas that Apple has ever made.  It's kind of amazing because they're so good at marketing there and they're pretty good at names.  I mean, I think it's getting a little old, but for the most part, it's worked.  And I think that their marketing is always just absolutely pristine and perfectly straight on.  But this was bad.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Steve Jobs when when Walt Mossberg asked him about it, Steve's response and some video.  Kara Schwisher was there with a flip camera and his response was, you know, people hated iPod, too.  They'll get over it. They'll get used to it. They'll incorporate it.  I think I think there's a real cluelessness.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Well, they will. But it also doesn't it doesn't relate to me.  It was a long time ago, said Apple, but it definitely wasn't that gender savvy back in the day.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah. So at some point it goes to a company being open and point as antithetical as it is to think so, to release the names beforehand and be clued in by their users.  Gina, you were right on it saying, are you nuts?

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Right, right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Spider in our chat room says he's developing a stylus for the iPad called the Tempen.  Tempen.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Here we go.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I hadn't heard that one anyway. That's a new one.  There aren't that many new jokes, though.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  I said the pricing model was light, medium, heavy.  I mean, it's never.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So there's two issues here. One is that the other big bigger real issue is are there actually no women?  But do we know that there are no women? I know there's there women in the marketing department at Apple.  Maybe they don't have any clout.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  I haven't been there in a while long enough to know. I mean, Katie Cotton used to run the PR.  Katie Cotton is still there.  She's still there? I used to work with her. That's how long she's been there.  Yeah.  Yeah, but you know, it's one thing to work there. It's another to have any real input that someone listens to you.  That's the question.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Were there any women on stage at that event?  No.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  When is Apple? I ask you, everybody out there who loves Apple, including me, when have you seen a woman on stage for Apple? Never.  You never do.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I've seen her before Apple, but a partner was on stage.  Which partner?  Her name. She was terrible, by the way. That's why I remember her.  She was with Sprinter, one of the other people, and she was a partner when the iPhone announcement.  It's just sad. It's just sad.  But that's one woman in four years.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  It's pathetic. I don't know if there's ever been a senior.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Roz Ho. Thank you. It was Roz Ho.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  When has there been a senior woman executive at the top?  She was with Microsoft business here.  At Apple. Other than, well, I guess PR. I mean, Katie's pretty high.  OK.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Who will you see quite a few?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Marissa Meyer would never have allowed this.  Marissa Meyer, start with.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It would have occurred to her.  Marissa Meyer would have stopped this dead, I'm sure.  She's probably laughing.  This is just my prediction. I would love to ask her about it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  She's probably laughing. But it's just the name. Come on. Right? I mean, it's just the name.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's just the name. I'll totally get over it. Yeah. And I'm not going to... We don't ever have to talk about it again.  But, Gina, you're going to call it your tablet or something else?  I mean, when I write about it, I call it the iPad because when people Google the iPad,  I want them to find the right things on my site.  But it's just one of those things where I just think it's important.  There are a lot of jokes and people are saying, well, it's not that bad. It looks like...  You made the right point, Gina. That is the point.  That's the point. And so I'm over it. And maybe we will get used to it.  Maybe I won't ever think about it again. But for right now, it really felt like, wow, this is a really big mistake.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And my wife and daughter who are not in the tech industry and don't really care about it had that immediate reaction as well.  That's what they're trying to sell it to. Yeah. It's going to be a universal reaction.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Yeah, pretty much. It's a pretty big strange thing.  What else? I could talk about the iPad forever.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, Jeff doesn't have a number, but Jeff was. In lieu of a number,  Jeff was going to take us downstairs to see the party. You want to do that?  No way. Yeah, let's try it. He's on a laptop.  Jeff. The big gala is going on.  I keep talking while I'm walking. He's missing the big Davos gala right now.  Is Angelina Jolie down there? I'm sure she is.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, there are no stars this year. No stars? Not even Robert Scoble?  No stars. No. Charlie Rose, I think, is probably the biggest.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Oh, he's a star. That's pretty much it. He's a star.  This is cool. There's an adjective that goes into that name.  This is... Yes. I know the word.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I may have dropped out earlier at Yale, but I know the word.  You're smart.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think we could do every show walking.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  I know. I love this. It's really cool. I love that. Oh, wow.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is something you cannot do. This is what you're missing people

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  by not running a Fortune 100 company, if that's not what you're missing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Or being a blogger. Jeff's here as a blogger.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  You're so dressed up, Jeff. Okay, I'm going downstairs in a second.  I'm still adjusting to him.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I could take you by the YouTube booth.  Here is the South African Schwag we're going to get.  It's a 2GIG thumb drive.  I don't know what that has for South Africa.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, there'll be press materials on it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm going down the stairs  into the main conference room,  trying not to fall on my ass doing so.  Okay, here we are  in the main party.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wow.  We're on the internet. Wow, we're on the internet.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You're from South Africa, yeah?  What's your name?  Tibisu. So you're on a podcast called

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This Week in Google. Jeff, you're going to have to hold the microphone up to him.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, we can't hear him. Unfortunately, we can't really hear him.  Thank you very much. We're three of us to party.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's an ice sculpture of an Ibex, I think.  How white is the party, Jeff?

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  I can't hear you.  She wants to know how white the party was.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  How white is the party?  Here's a gentleman painting.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, that's pretty.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's neat.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Okay.  You want me to go into the hip room where the

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  rock music is? Yeah, let's see if you can find  Eric or Sergi or Larry.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  You know what I want, Jeff? Let's have some fun.  Please find a venture capitalist or a very leading politician  and make them dance with you for us, please.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There was video of Bill Gates dancing.  That's awesome. It was pretty funny.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  I want to see that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I've danced with Bill Gates. He does the white man's underbite.  You've danced with Bill Gates?  Next to him. Parallel dancing.  I wasn't holding him.  You want too much manly affection.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  We just lost Jeff's connection.  Leo, I would have paid a lot of money to see you dancing  in parallel next to Bill Gates.  I'm getting such pleasure from thinking about that.  Can I show you? This is how he dances.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Do it. No way.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It is totally the white guy's overbite.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Totally.  You had his butt stuck out.  I think there's new video of him dancing.  I remember seeing this on the internet recently.  It was at Sundance.  He's a philanthropist now.  Probably couldn't get an invite to Davos.  I want to find Bill Gates dancing.  Gina, can I ask you a question?  How do you feel about how much people in this

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Twitter army like you?  They adore you.  It's not in this kind of gross, you're a pinup girl.  They have mad respect for you.  I feel like I can never measure up to you.  I know that.  That is very sweet.  I'm deeply, deeply honored and privileged.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  The feeling is mutual.  Everybody loves everybody here.  Let me ask you a question.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  If Twitter said, we're going to have you be in this,  Vanity Fair said we're going to do this article,  will you compose naked in a raincoat and high heels?  That's what you do.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Vanity Fair would never.  Nice. Bill Gates dancing on screen.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's fantastic.  It looks like he's playing air guitar.  I can assure you, Vanity Fair will never ask me

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  to get naked into a raincoat.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Did they do that to somebody else recently?

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  I saw that in Tummelvision.  They did a piece a couple of weeks ago.  They picked a bunch of women with large follower numbers.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  There's a weight ceiling on that, which I am well above.  To be quite honest.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I thought that was completely horrible.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  It caused this big response in the social media blogging world.  I try not to dip into too much.  It was kind of weird.  It was a very disparaging piece about Twitter,  the platform in general.  People talk, you know, the same old thing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's Vanity Fair.  What did you expect? Deep thought?

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Then they had a larger piece on...  Oh, God, who was it the next week?  Let it not be Ashton Kutcher.  Kevin Rose?  I'm sure.  There we go.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm back. I'm in the YouTube booth.  Sorry, the Wi-Fi ended on the way to the hit party.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  See any finger knot?  Yeah, we got a great view.  This is Jeff Jarvis in Davos, Switzerland.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Now I'm in a chair that swivels so I can make you all...  I'm getting sick!

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is how James Cameron did Titanic, actually.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  This is great.  You're taping something that's going to be on YouTube eventually.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, Jeff Jarvis dances.  Bite your lower lip and you got it made.  We're going to wrap this up with our usual tip of the week  and tool of the week.  We won't do number of the week because Jeff...  Got a party instead.  That's right.  Although I think I bookmarked something that I thought you might use for a number.  Let me see if I can find that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What was it?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't remember off the top of my head.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Gina, what's your tip of the week?  Okay, my tip this week...  I'm giving this a little blind because I haven't used an iPhone in a while,  but my tip this week is for Google Voice users who are using the new web app on the iPhone.  I had Greg from DC wrote me and said  that a really good thing to do with the Google Voice web app  is that you can actually bookmark contacts  and put them on your iPhone's home screen.  That gives you access if you want to search for a contact from your quick search box  or if there are certain people you call over and over with Google Voice.  Since it's a web app and not a native app,  it's not integrated with your contacts on your iPhone.  But if you bookmark a contact, each contact has a permalink.  You can just tap that person and initiate a call through Google Voice easily.  So thanks to Greg for sending that one in.  I hope someone will correct me if that doesn't work as advertised.  That's great though.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That gives you like 90% of the functionality you'd want to get in a Google Voice app.  It'd be nice to have my voicemail and all that.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  That's the Chrome extension?  No, it's for an iPhone.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  On the iPhone, you can just add it to your home screen.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Was it Google that did this?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, this is just the Google.com slash Voice.  It's just the web app.  If you visited on the iPhone, it's a brand new overhauled interface that they just launched this week.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Fantastic.  They're suggesting in the chat room that a number for Jeff would be 270.  That's how much it costs, according to one Wall Street analyst, to build an iPad.  Thank you, chat room.  That's a good number.  It's a profit built into each and every one.  I find that a little hard to believe.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We'll see the tear down soon.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Don't forget there's development money that went into the chip.  Right, good point.  All the money they spent coming up with the name, that was expensive.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That branding guy, boy, he cost a lot of money.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Wait until you find out that it was a woman who did it.  That would be a good one.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  To be honest, there are always people who will work against their own interests.  I know in Hollywood I worked with plenty of women who were happy to advocate tarting stuff up in bizarre ways.  It's possible a woman theoretically could have done it in an odd way.  I think, by the way, the use of the word tarting is offensive to tarts.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Can you cut that out?  Sorry, strawberries are green.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Here's another number.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  One more number. This is from Eric Schmidt.  It comes from an article in the City Herald University of London.  The prospect that Google's business in China might not reach its fifth birthday must be particularly difficult for Eric Schmidt.  As Google's chief executive, he claimed to have, and here's our number, 5,000 years of patience for Google's business in China.  That's about as long as China's been around.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh well.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  A couple of numbers there.  My tip is a Google Friend Connect tip.  I use Friend Connect on my blog. I think it's kind of cool.  In fact, I'll show you my blog at leoville.com.  It allows people to sign up and become your friends, I guess.  It adds some social to a blog.  It's a little widget you can put on your blog.  I have 1,100 members of the blog.  You can sign in and so forth and you get avatars.  But here's a new feature.  I should sign in because it'll show it on my blog.  It also now allows you...  Oh, don't look. I'm going to enter my password.  You didn't actually have to look away. That's okay.  Heather looked away. I thought that was very sweet of you.  So now, if you go to your blog and you have Google Friend Connect on it, it says,  Find out more about your visitors' interests.  Perhaps not the best language Google should have used,  but what it is is a poll.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  I like that they didn't assume they're your friends. That's kind of nice.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You can now add a poll gadget to your Google Friend Connect.  This is kind of nice.  Basically, just by embedding Google's Friend Connect into my blog,  I now have the ability to add polls.  I can ask them all sorts of stuff.  I can say, what's your gender? Do you like the name iPad?  They resell this data to everyone.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Oh. I'm sure they do.  Never mind. Forget I mentioned it.  I'm sorry. I spent some time with a friend who does all this SEO crap the other day.  You think they really use that?  They sell not only stuff based on what people purchase or click through on your site.  There's a lot of tracking the cookies of who comes through and then running crazy algorithms.  Who knows if it works? I don't know.  They think they're finding out trends of who goes where.  There's multiple levels of sales of so-called marketing traffic data.  I'm sorry. That's the first thing that came to my mind.  I like the poll.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is what, for instance, if I just added that poll.  Congratulations, Leah. When they join you've just joined Leahville.  Let others know more about you. What's your gender?

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  If you want to be PC, you add another dot.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I should add a third.  Pick your own.  Your choice. Unknown.  Yeah. Take your choice. Self-destruct.  That's three, four, nine.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  There are so many genders at this point, Leah, when I perform in the alphabet community.  It's so confusing.  I just let everyone pick their own.  Pick your own. You know what?  You could be a Cylon. You could be whatever you want.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We're postmodern here. We don't have gender.  You may not have one.  Who may? Genders.  You may have multiple.  Arcane concept.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You may be trans-species.  Cylon is a good choice.  Cylon. I'm Cylon.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Why not?  Okay, you know what?  Put that as an option.  I'm adding Cylon to my poll. That's fantastic.  But of course, you know, when you do that, 99% pick Cylon.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Can they get to add their own option in there?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Sure. Sure. I can add all sorts of stuff.  Oh, you mean they add their own.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Yeah, like, I like that in polls where you can give an option for people to input more descriptively.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes. It's actually, I was very impressed.  It's a very sophisticated polling widget that actually gives you more capabilities than,  so you can add text, paragraph text, multiple choice, checks boxes, choose from a list.  It's a very flexible polling widget.  I really like it.  You know, it's nice.  So that's my tool of the week if you want to add polls and you're already using Google Friend Connect,  or if you're not using Google Friend Connect, you might want to take a look at it.  This way all your friends' information will be known by Google.  Why should they have any more privacy than you do?  Think about it.  Gina Trapani is the creator of SmarterWear.org.  That's her blog, but she also is seen in many other venues,  including, of course, the Harvard Business Review.  We won't hold that against her, Heather.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  She's the coolest thing on the Harvard Business Review.  Lifehacker. Yeah, she is.  Pretty much.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And in a raincoat or out, we all love her.  Thank you, Leo.  CompleteWaveGuide.com is where the book is.  Jeff Jarvis did yeoman duty, taking us to Davos, Switzerland in the middle of the night.  Yeah, everybody's tired. Everybody's gone home.  The YouTube booth's empty.  Yep.  There's nobody there.  We'll go ahead and flip the switch and just do something funny.  Do something weird on YouTube.  They left the server up.  Thank you, Jeff.  Jeff's blog is BuzzMachine.com.  That's where you can see the full article on what he learned with his special,  exclusive, super duper meeting with Erica Schmidt and Marissa Meyer and the gang.  Heather Gold is a performer, a comic, and the host of Tummelvision here on the Twitter network.  Is that every Tuesday night?  Every Thursday at 7.  Thursday night.  At 7 p.m. Pacific.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Pacific Standard Time.  And I actually have some kind of, are we allowed to plug at this point?  I just plugged them.  I have a, I'm doing a couple of workshops, one here in San Francisco.  We've added a second one the 5th of February, and there's one March 27th in New York.  Unpresenting.com, Speaking Skills, how to tumble, how to engage the room,  how to be yourself in public and feel good about that.  Unpresenting, you call it.  Yes, because half of it's unlearning.  That's great.  The bad crap that people think they have to do to get listened to.  Don't try to be Steve Jobs.  Just be you in public, a little better.  It works really well.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I have, I've been reading a book called The Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs,  and I realize I can't.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  I totally had an argument with that guy on Twitter.  I think it's a giant mistake.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's got good information, but you can't be Steve Jobs.  No, you can't.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  So it's a waste of time.  Be you.  He also cannot be you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's true.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Why assume that you don't, you may have some massively important thing.  You certainly wouldn't have called your device the iPad, so you've got one up on him.  There you go.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Thank you, Heather.  Great to have you.  We'll catch you Thursday night on Tummel Vision on live.twit.tv.  Tummel with M's.  I know it's a new weird word.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  We explain it on the show.  It makes sense.  It's a Yiddish word.  I like it.  It's a Yiddish word.  It means the act of social engagement, someone who mixes things up.  Yeah, and that's your expertise.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes, and we have lots of people.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  We had Kathy Sierra last week.  She was awesome.  She's great.  I think she's fascinating.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, I have next week, I have to say, I'm pretty excited.

She wrote the theme song to Friends, and she's an incredible artist in multiple levels  and has been doing online community stuff since super early days.  She's a super infamous party thrower.  I'm going to talk to her a lot about parties, and I think I'm going to go to one later this month.  So she's pretty cool.  I would tune in for her.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All this Facebook stuff really is just throwing a party, isn't it?

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Yeah, how do you get everyone out to have a really good time?  Very much.  Very much that's what you want, right?  You want people involved and engaged.  Yeah, well, that'll be fun.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I can't wait to see that.  She's got a cool site, too.  She's got incredible stuff.

Speaker: Heather Gold
