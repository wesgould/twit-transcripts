Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just the right height for you to scratch your nose.  These are, these are impossible rules and I don't know how I could go all day  without touching my face.  It's just one of those things that just like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We can drive.  We can drive.  Aren't your eyes itchy right now, Jason?  They are.  Don't they itch?  They're a little foggy right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Karsten trolls the host.  Yes, that's right.  That's my job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pushes buttons when Kevin doesn't know it.  Why don't we start with the most joyful and joyous topic of all, and that is  the coronavirus.  Ah, this topic.  I'm done.  Like I'm done with it.  And I know it feels like we're kind of, yeah, it feels that way.  Like we're still very early or maybe we aren't or maybe we're overreacting or  maybe we're underreacting.  We don't have data to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's no data because we're not testing.  So we don't know.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really frustrating.  I saw this tweet from a woman in Seattle yesterday and I think it kind of had its  little viral tear through Twitter.  So to speak.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No pun intended.  And it was, you know, it was basically just her saying, look, you know, I felt  sick. I feel, you know, I've got a history of respiratory illness.  I felt like all the all the boxes were checked.  And so I got on the phone to see, like, what I need to do if I feel like I could  possibly be, you know, part of this, this whole coronavirus thing.  Like, and I don't want to infect anyone else.  Like, I'm going to do the right thing.  She basically was tossed from phone call to office to phone call to phone call.  Totally like spun around in a million different circles.  And in the end, they basically said, well, you're not suffering enough for us to  treat you. So, I mean, essentially the word was come back to us when you're dying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, to test you, not to treat you, just to test you.  Right. Just to test you.  There is no. I mean, unless you're dying, there's no treatment because we just  don't have one. But yes, you cannot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, no, I saw I saw two doctors arguing because there's a doctor, Jeff  Travis, who's an actual doctor.  Oh, and he was discussing with another doctor that they're going to have to triage  things like intubation because they're not going to have enough.  Right. And they're going to decide.  So there are no there is things they will do.  Well, yes, but you have to be closer to death.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like if you feel feverish and like until you have trouble breathing or your fever

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  spikes, there's what you want to know whether you're carrying it so you can be  responsible to others.  Stacey, I got a few questions for you.  Can I start off here? I got two geographic questions for you.  So I want you to put on your Austin cowboy hat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was going to say, is this about South by?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it is. Because I've been fast.  I've been reading the South by tweets all weekend.  And it's and as you know, there's now a change.org petition to cancel South by.  That's up to almost 50,000 signatures last I checked.  And the tweet, the tweets are a mix of, hey, I'll be at Booth 47.  Come on by with cancel this thing.  And my sense is that the locals who you might have thought would say, no, we want  the business. The locals are are seem to be adamant saying no, two hundred  thousand people come with new germs.  No, get the rid of them.  And the mayor and the organizers are saying no.  So I'm curious, what are you hearing from your old Austin friends?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this this petition has actually been around for a couple of days.  And I got it from a local friend who, yes, but who is also freaked beyond belief  and stupidly freaked about what's happening.  So I feel like the initial signers signatories were panicked people.  The other thing to think about is South by Southwest is like a three hundred and  fifty million dollar impact on Austin.  And Austin has a huge tech community.  And for them, it's a chance to show off a lot of people.  It's a chance to show off a lot like how legit we are.  It's a chance to network and have everyone come to your town.  So for the most part, people were fine until the tech firms started pulling out  and then it started looking irresponsible.  So Austin, for the most part, yeah, there's a couple of freaked out because Austin  also has this weird hippie dippy.  Wellness anti-vax community, too.  So those people are like, ah, science, scary, partly because they haven't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  vaccinated their children even against the flu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't get me started on how contradictory that is.  So I do think South by Southwest will probably end up becoming untenable  and thus become canceled.  And the organizers will try to make it seem like.  They were doing the best thing.  We still have in what we still have a lot of time.  And they just actually announced.  Yeah, they just announced new Chris Evans and Camille.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So now go to Seattle, where you seem to be in the ground zero of covid  here in the US thus far, because we don't know because we're not testing.  So we're going to find other things.  But right now, there was two confrontations.  The tragic deaths have occurred.  So what's the meaning like there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What was it? Was there two deaths?  There are nine now.  There are nine confirmed deaths.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But so the thing is, OK.  So, yes, the first people I think did come off from there was the case.  One of the first cases in the US was in Seattle.  The challenge is the next cases were in a senior living facility.  And those people are dying quickly because they're they're very sick.  So that's that's one thing to think about.  The scarier stuff is that that person who originally came back and was ill  many, many weeks ago, apparently it's been circulating in our community for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you're on an island.  I'm on an island. So I mean, it's not really I mean, it is really an island,  but everyone who lives on the island goes back and forth.  So it's not like a true island.  Anyway, so I am I am in this weird space where.  If and there was a stat article based on this guy in the Fred Hutchinson  Institute here who talked about we really need to act now from a public health perspective  to quarantine Seattle because he believes it's going to be like Wuhan  several weeks ago.  And if you quarantine it, we still have a chance of stopping this thing.  That's this one guy.  And it's really uncertain.  It feels like.  If we really could stop it, we probably should quarantine and like really,  that would be freaky is all belief.  But if we just decided that it's going to run its course, we probably should just say that  and be like, yeah, we're not going to because it feels like right now we're still like,  will we won't we will we won't we will see what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What would what would quarantining the city mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that's my question.  What is a quarantine like?  I like I have an a sense of what a quarantine is.  But what does that look like?  The umbrella.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it could be a big globe over it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If the public.  So so most of the companies in Seattle have said they will follow whatever King County,  which is the county King County Public Health in King County is working with  squad of psychics.  I can never say it.  So no mesh.  Snow, homeless,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  so this snow, homeless, snow, homeless, snow, home ish, snow, home, interesting.  It's a fake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I saw it a little bit at my house.  I haven't I haven't lived here long enough to get all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But yeah, and I live next to so qualomy, but that's different anyway.  The point is those guys will work together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No qualm.  E.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, I there's no snow in my so called.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's no qualm.  It's it's it's so qualm ish is different.  Oh, so qualm ish.  OK, that is that's where so qualm ish.  No qualm ish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can see why I'm a look.  I challenge you to make their show today.  OK, so anyway, yeah, that's that's the pass.  I was there two weeks ago.  It was lovely.  OK, I don't know where I was now.  Oh, so they'll they'll say you were in the Karst and vortex.  That's where you were.  They'll say quarantine.  And what will happen then is all the businesses  who've agreed to follow that will voluntarily quarantine themselves  and shut down.  The schools will shut down when the county says to.  So then you've got work from home, schools shutting down.  If you want to make it a super crazy type quarantine,  I think you have to get the federal government and the CDC to declare it.  And then at that point, they can shut down airports.  They can do whatever they want to shut down in her inner  state, interstate highways.  I was like intercontinental highways.  So that's how that works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then but but like a true quarantine,  you know, because people are, you know, in some cases stocking up on food  because they want to make a couple of weeks of food.  They're taking all the masks and all this kind of stuff in a true like,  oh, no, the CDC is involved type quarantine within the city.  People are willing are able to do whatever you're  I think they're like in a loop on you could run around.  Yes, you just can't leave the area.  You just can't leave the area.  OK, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's there's a neat story about this.  Hold on. We put it in here in the in the rundown chat.  Washington Post had a story yesterday, but during the bubonic plague  in the 17th century, a village knew that they were badly infected.  And so they quarantined themselves.  Really, a really, really soulful thing to do.  1665 and  people would come and leave food on rocks outside of town for the villagers,  grateful to them that they were not leaving town.  The villagers left coins that were doused in vinegar,  thinking that would clean the coins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Vinegar does help clean coins or clean clean off bacteria.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So in fact, it made a difference.  14 months went by and nobody went in or out of the village for 14 months.  There's a house in the village in the picture here called Plague Cottage.  I can't imagine its real estate value is very good.  But it's phenomenal.  So that they they, you know, one family, one woman,  a woman buried her children and her husband  called Gotha, the place of skulls.  260 of the 800 residents perished during the quarantine,  more than double the mortality rate of the great plague in London.  But because of their self-sacrifice,  the nearby towns did not have it.  After 14 months, it was lifted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So wow. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sacrifice. No kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I am prepared to self-quarantine should after I do.  You work at home already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I am totally going to play cottage on my next vacation.  You would. Yes. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we thought it's a Carson thing to do. It would be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We had a rundown yesterday at school on on hangouts  so we can run our classes that way and make sure.  And Google has upped all edu accounts and many corporate accounts, too.  So that was that we have 100 people per hangout.  Now it's 250 per hangout and we couldn't record the hangout before.  Now they added that into our our thing.  So that's until the end of July.  I think it is a lot of hangout accounts are are quite upgraded  to be able to handle this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. My daughter's school is using Zoom and she is already freaking out  because not because of the coronavirus.  Most of the kids in her class are just like, la la la.  That's fine. It will kill all the old people.  With the true callousness of youth.  I'm like, yeah, I was like that once.  But they're using Zoom, but she's freaked out because he's like, OK,  we need to synchronize our watches and at 10, 05 exactly.  I'm taking attendance. So you should be on the Zoom call.  Technical difficulties are not an excuse.  And my my child being very anxious about stuff and very conscientious  is already like, OK, we'll have to test it beforehand.  What if oh, what if our Internet sat down?  I'm like, OK, we'll log in a half an hour early.  Calm the heck down.  We're going to be fine. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But mom, good on her, though.  Good on her, though. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So so thank you, Stacey, for that.  You were in I was going to say two vortices,  but you also have a Karsten Vortex Vortex two of this.  And I was thinking about you all week with that.  But then we have Google and Facebook and South by Southwest  and everybody else in the world.  There's there's so much coronavirus news in the rundown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I have to tell people first off that there is actually no toilet paper.  I know people are like the media is exaggerated.  I don't know why there's no toilet paper.  But there is truly no toilet paper because people are hoarding it.  That's a real thing that's happening in all the grocery stores.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, absolutely.  Certainly no hand sanitizer.  Bottles of alcohol are running out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can buy spray Lysol.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you order the what you need to do is order.  You can still get isopropyl alcohol and aloe vera essential oils.  And no, actually, if you mix the aloe vera with  alcohol, then that's that's the same thing as pure out.  What's the you want to smell nice, you stick an essential oil in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  You know, what's nice is mint,  because then you can clear your sinuses as you're doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You shouldn't be smelling your hands in any case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, my gosh, you guys, calm down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They know you're doing it.  Oh, no. It's over.  Your face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't touch your camera.  Spread it over here.  Don't do it.  Not that we're overreacting or anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I'm I'm I'm working on Kevin, if you want to take my my.  Yeah, I'm working on I'm working on a kickstarter for this mask right here.  I'm going to be selling these masks on Kickstarter soon.  They're totally not good.  They're not N95 or anything, but they look cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They look like they do something.  Yeah, exactly.  This is that's like a window into our Mad Max future  that is right around the corner after all this.  All the dust settles here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what so now in the Bay Area, guys, what's the what's the reaction?  And no, I owe no F8.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah. So we haven't even talked about that, right?  I guess last week, I assumed last week the F8 news had had broke  in time for the show, but I guess it had.  No, we heard Facebook, you know, was canceling F8.  It's developer conference.  The second I read that news, I was like, Google IOs going away.  It's not going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google I would first straight out said, no, no, no, no, no.  We're talking about it.  It's still going ahead. They all do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They all say that while they're still calculating.  And then they're like a day later, they're like, oh, actually, yeah,  we're going to cancel to.  I never understand that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just just just say no comment.  Yeah, I suppose so.  Say no comment because you don't know.  You know, you know, you just said you're doing it until you're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's that Carson?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You got to say you're doing it until you're not doing it.  Because you are still doing it at that moment.  You're still doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You haven't made the decision to not do it.  We're being very careful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're going to follow the guidelines, but we are monitoring the situation closely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's always that thing, you know, in there, which is basically they're out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, a lot of places are giving refunds to and I think this is an interesting  option or way to do this a little  offer the refunds to people if they want to cancel their tickets.  And then when you see that 60 percent of your people have canceled,  you're like, OK, no, it's never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So Google said the people who got into 2020  will be able to buy tickets for 2021.  Yeah, no lottery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's a that's a little bit of a bonus, a little bit of a silver lining.  If people were selected for the lottery for 2020, they won't have to do that.  They'll automatically get the offer to purchase the ticket next year.  It's not like they get a free ticket or anything,  but they have the opportunity without entering any sort of lottery.  In the rundown, there's a box story about the economic impact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. It said that the total impact so far was the four hundred eighty million dollars  was the impact of Mobile World Congress alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Alone. Twenty million for I.O.  Wow. I mean, such a 450 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bye. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and yes, it says if South by cancels, which I mean, let's be real.  It's going to cancel. Right.  Like, it's it's I don't know.  I don't know. I guess we'll show losses would be total around 900 million.  So, I mean, this is no no small deal.  I mean, I feel like every day a new event is is canceling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's important to think about how quickly things are changing.  So, you know, last weekend nobody had died in Seattle. Right.  And then all of a sudden we're like on the crux of their canceling Comic Con here.  And, you know, two nights ago, I was like, well, we'd still go if it was happening.  But now, you know, all the guests have pulled out.  So we're like, oh, well, no, no, I don't want to go.  So I feel like it's just changing so fast.  So by the 13th, maybe it's wise for South by to be like,  maybe cases will stop increase.  I know that's not likely, but maybe cases will stop increasing.  And then if we were testing, I'd feel better about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But we have no idea of the extent of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're just starting testing. Yeah.  No, I know. Being in a place.  Israel has told 60000 people to quarantine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a lot of people. Wow.  Yes, a lot of people.  We've tested like 50, something like that.  Some small number. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We talked a little bit about it on all about Android last night  with the impact that Mopar World Congress and, you know,  all of the hotels losing money and so on and so forth.  But I didn't even think about the locals and like what he was talking about.  And I feel bad for like didn't even think about those folks,  how it's going to impact them having all those people

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  swarming into the area and how do they feel about that?  Potentially bring in germs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I didn't even think about that. That's so that's that's that's what is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're right. I presume when I started looking at this  SXW tweets, I thought that would be the case.  No, no, no, it'll be OK. I want to sell my tacos.  People. Well, you have to remember who's on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, these are true that the people I mean, I guarantee you the hotel  workers who are like suddenly looking at like not getting tips and not getting

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  those people are like worse on the poorest.  We don't know who earn very little, who don't have time,  six days off, who don't have health insurance.  So true. Yeah, indeed.  So the dumbest thing I've seen, but this is so classic out of geeks.  It's on the rundown.  A bunch of a bunch of geeks in Austin plan to hold a hack  coronavirus meeting.  And maybe they'll come up with a new a new hands at the bottom of the story.  They'll come up with an alternative for the handshake.  Oh, we need that hackathon.  We need some post-it notes where you figure that out.  And then they'll post notes saying, don't handshake, do this.  Thanks, guys.  You got together to hack the coronavirus.  So you got into a room where you hack all over each other and you all get the  coronavirus and you're all hacks.  She says I take back everything nice I've ever said about tech people.  That's just dumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look, we have a replacement for the handshake, isn't it?  The elbow tap is not what they're saying.  I mean, I want to have right there in the article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We already began pitching and eliminate the handshake and replace it with  something like a fist bump or elbow or a foot tap.  Just a state.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't understand how fist bumps are no more sanitary than they're not good.  You know, this bumps are done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're right.  I think about will be good.  A Japanese bow or.  You can't do the Wakanda because that would be cultural appropriation.  Yeah, I'm thinking like a half Wakanda.  I just a head nod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why don't you just do the head nod?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just a statement nod.  Yeah, that's what I did.  No, not a nod like that.  It's the chin lift nod.  I can't do anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The sup nod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that's that's a snot.  Do that again. That's a snotty.  No, no, no, it's not.  Do that again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not in some cultures that is seen as snotty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, OK. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm clearly because when you do that, you look up someone's nose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Looking down your nose at someone.  They're looking up your nose at both ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Today, I learned some cultures, it's a sup and some cultures, it's snotty.  All right. Today, I learned something new today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or you could just be like in Texas, like people, like when they drive down the street,  you're just like sup, sup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. You could do the Queen's.  It's just like the friendly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not that it's I do two to three fingers, but you could.  That's bad in the UK.  Fingers get you in trouble.  It's like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Transcript:  So my fingers don't always do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's hard. I have to do it manually.  I have to force them apart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We we are so far down the rabbit hole.  We're only in the first story.  There's lots of good stuff.  Well, yeah, I know. Looking through here,  I didn't see this link before.  Don't lick ballot envelopes.  Probably just probably just envelopes in general.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Yeah.  Don't be like an envelope anymore.

Transcript:  Are you guys Jason?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're really blurry right now, but I'm not touching them.  How's your nose? Is your nose a little itchy?  It's OK. It's calm down.  Don't go there. Sometimes my allergies.  That's all it takes is like they know that you're talking about them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you feel that little tickle there, Jason.  Yes. Yes.  So we're going on your cheek.  Stop. Stop.  This episode is hilarious.  Other things that are happening, Cro.  Other things that are happening coronavirus related  outside of these events, canceling left, right and center is just the sheer fact  that all these companies are putting limits on travel now.  Or and also working from home,  insisting that employees work from home.  I mean, it's just that's good.  Don't another Twitter is good for the environment.  Employees globally to work at home.  Apple has restricted employee travel to China, Italy, South Korea, Salesforce,  prohibiting international travel and restricted all but the most critical domestic travel.  I mean, company after company putting these these changes in place makes you wonder.  I mean, similar to the events closing and people wondering after the fact,  well, are the events necessary?  Maybe. I mean, do you think that this might these experiences  some might result in like longer term change as far as how businesses run,  what things are essential?  No. No.  I'm a hard no.  Well, it's going to all revert back to the way it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The reason I say that.  So there may be the occasional and we may see like lagging conferences die  like South by Southwest, wouldn't that be cool?  But what I think what's going to happen is we'll go back to normal  because there is a huge amount of value in FaceTime with people.  And a lot of these.  That's what that's about.  I mean, and has I mean, I don't know how often y'all have sat through webinars,  but they are excruciating and no one should have to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.  I don't enjoy them nearly as much as going to an event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we're social creatures.  And there's a lot of value in and there's a lot of value  that isn't conveyed well over video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, I'm not going to say I'm a social creature,  but but you do get a different vibe being right there in the same room.  You know, just a different energy that you can feel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think the the remote office is about as likely as the paperless office.  That can happen. Yeah.  But I feel I just feel terrible for the travel industry.  Lufthansa is has already decided to ground more than 20 percent of its fleet.  The airlines are cutting flights after flights after flights.  I forget which airline  I think United offered any of its employees to go on unpaid leave.  Thank you very much.  It's going to be bad out there for some time.  I've got conferences coming up in June and July.  You think I'll be going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. I have one in May.  And build was canceled.  Was build canceled?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Build has not yet been canceled as of me  checking an hour ago. So OK, sorry.  Where is Bill?  But I mean, you know, I always may.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so I have one.  Isn't too far out when you consider where we're at right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although so I'll give you this.  I'm talking at an event tomorrow in Seattle.  And it is that you're checking every hour, aren't you?  I am checking every hour.  But this morning they had four of their people are now video  giving their talks via video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then two canceled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would be like, I'm still planning to go and do it in person  because video is again, just it's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like a podcast.  Who wants to tomorrow?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tomorrow, Leo, Leo will be live in St.  Louis. That's right.  I've got it on my on my screen.  He'll be live in St.  Louis at WT, and now they're letting  any non disease ridden  twit fans come watch it because a bunch of people don't want to come  watch it because they're afraid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  However, Leo is is is letting people know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, just don't that don't.  And you can also meet Leo tonight at the train wreck saloon.  Just please don't touch him.  That's right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Please. And thank you.  He says he will not shake your hand, but he will wave at you  from a respectable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Selfies.  How do you think?  What's your etiquette now for taking pictures with people who want to take?  That's pretty close.  You're cheek by cheek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The hover hand is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the hover hand?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When you do the thing where you don't like this, I was like, I need it.  And it's like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, OK.  So he doesn't look like a great picture.  OK, that's actually what I do anyway, because when people want to.  I don't know these people.  They're like, can we take pictures?  And I'm like, sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then I'm like, Howard Stern's rule.  Howard Stern says he feels like just the worst ass anyway,  because he doesn't he's triphobic, so he doesn't want to shake anybody's hand ever.  He doesn't want selfie because he doesn't want he thinks he's ugly.  He doesn't want any pictures of himself on people's phones going around.  So now we can't do anything with people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's actually kind of arrogant.  I don't think I take photos well, but if someone wants a picture with me,  I'm like, well, who am I to stop it?  He's neurotic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you, Kevin. Yes.  So I just saw this tweet from Michael P.  Gibson in 1665, Cambridge University closed because of the plague.  Isaac Newton quarantined himself at his childhood home.  It was the most productive time of his life.  He discovered the calculus and laws of motion stuck a button in his eye  to study optics. How will you spend the next year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well played. Yeah, that's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What what problem which Scott Lucas replied probably stick a button in my eye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  Let's ponder that.  Let's think about all the things that we can solve in our time  and our yearlong staycation that is surely right around the corner  as a result of the coronavirus.  Let's take a break and thank the sponsor and then we'll come back  and we'll reveal what we are going to do with ourselves.  Or we'll talk about other news stories, whichever one you guys want to do.  Both both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're going to do a 24 hour podcast.  We're just going to stay on the air all the time because we have nothing else to do.  We have nowhere to go.  We're just going to be here.  I mean, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, hey, hey, it's not again.  I mean, the beauty is we podcast.  So that's pretty easy to do from home.  A lot of people actually do that from home.  You're here. Some people on this very show.  So, you know, it's not out of the realm of possibility.  This episode of This Week in Google is brought to you by LinkedIn  marketing solutions, time and places, everything,  especially when you're talking about marketing.  But in today's age of a million messages per minute and not enough hours in the day.  How can you really catch people's attention?  It's really not as easy as you might expect.  It's definitely a lot more difficult when you think about it.  There's so many moving pieces, so many people out there.  So fortunately, there is a simple way.  LinkedIn can help you speak to the right professionals at the right time.  With over 62 million decision makers on LinkedIn,  you're able to connect with the right business leaders who are relevant to your company.  And with LinkedIn ads, you can make sure your messages are getting through to  these relevant people.  Rod Strother, the director of Digital and Social Center of Excellence  with Lenovo, said, with LinkedIn, we're seeing a lift of 17 percent  in brand favorability.  We're already looking at how we can extend this into other markets.  Lenovo was actually able to tailor its its content to enhance the engagement  with its audience.  Even small and medium sized businesses are making the most out of LinkedIn ads.  They're using LinkedIn to get their voices heard and their messages  to resonate with the audience.  And of course, awareness is important.  Yes. But it's not just about awareness either.  LinkedIn ads are driving traffic and engagement.  That's visits to a landing page, registrations to an event  or downloads of thought leadership content with precise targeting.  Small and medium sized businesses can speak to the people that matter.  You know, we see all sorts of creativity  coming from from the people who are putting ads through LinkedIn.  At the end of the day, LinkedIn ads are helping small businesses  and smaller businesses get big time results.  Try it for yourself.  You can check it out for yourself.  Go to LinkedIn, where they're offering a free one hundred dollar  LinkedIn ad credit to launch your first campaign.  Simply visit LinkedIn dot com slash twig.  That's LinkedIn dot com slash TWIG.  And check it out for yourself.  See what you think. Terms and conditions apply.  And we thank LinkedIn for their support of this week in Google.  We've got to have other things in here that have nothing to do  with the coronavirus, right?  Maybe, maybe. Yes.  We're going to find the coronavirus angle in every story.  Yes. It probably wouldn't be that difficult, to be honest right now.  It's so top of mind.  How about stadia?  Because there are touch the controller.  There could be germs.  Yes. Just first of all, you want an alcohol wipe  anytime you're picking up the controller and don't touch your face.  Google Stadia, apparently, I mean, you know, this launched.  What was it like five months ago was the soft launch or the launch  to the founders, founders, people who paid extra  to get the founders edition and to be involved in an early stage.  We're five months beyond the launch.  And I know it's pretty quiet on the stadia front.  I feel like we expected that there was going to be some sort of a free tier  that Google has has touted.  That hasn't happened yet.  Not necessarily not for anyone anyways.  I think if you were the founder and your three month  pro subscription ran out, you can opt to move that over to the free tier,  which limits your resolution to 1080p.  So it has some drawbacks, but still, it's a free monthly service at that point.  But that's not available to everyone.  Not yet. And apparently, indie developers  are not satisfied with what they're seeing out of stadia.  They're saying, hey, you know, Google has this this this new platform.  And as indie developers, we don't have unlimited resources.  So we need to know that there's something there for us  if we spend our resources and our development costs.  To create this. And how do companies incentivize that?  Well, they, you know, especially if it's a new platform, they would offer  monetary monetary incentives so that they'd actually create these  these games for their platform.  Indie developers say that's not happening with Google.  They're just not offering that much, not enough to make it worth it.  And they're also worried, by and large,  about the fact that Google has a hard time committing to things.  And we see it time and time again.  They'll create something. They're super excited about something.  I don't believe you. And then a couple of years later,  what examples do you have for this?  I don't believe any. Never heard of this before.  No, the I'm sure if you went to killed by still,  you use alo. Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Alos are great. I'm going to go on Google Plus and give you help for that.  Google Reader installed still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly. There's three great examples for you.  So so I don't know.  Like I think in the gaming world, you know, even people who are really  dialed into video games and really get excited normally about this sort of stuff.  There's a lot of passivity around Cedia and what it offers.  And I think a lot of founders have let their subscriptions lapse.  Like they've decided not to pay for the premium version going forward.  That spells a big I don't know. That's that's you know, that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  potentially not very good for all was founders.  He did the founders thing. I wonder if he led his labs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wonder if I had the wrong  idea about stadium and correct me if I'm wrong,  but I thought this was supposed to be a way of making game online  game and a little more mainstream versus what I thought was for casual people too.  You know, but yet it doesn't seem like any of this is working out  because you got to have the infrastructure and connectivity to get the game.  So then you're going to be paying just as much money  for the game and content.  And then the game and content isn't necessarily up to snuff.  Even casual gamers want to play a nice game and not a average game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think I think a lot of the games that are on the platform  are games that have been available on other platforms for however long.  So the exclusivity is very, very minimal on the platform.  I think they have a couple of exclusive titles, but they're from what I've seen.  It's nothing that you look at it like, oh, that's the killer.  That's the game. That's the one that's going to bring people over.  I think there's I think there's definitely a certain  quality to stadia that they hoped that being that there's this free tier  and it's essentially it's a console that doesn't require a console  because it's just online, that that would appeal to, let's say, new gamers  or gamers who weren't already all in on one console or a platform or another.  But again, like we're five months in and that free tier doesn't really exist  for anyone yet.  And we were talking about this a little bit last night on All About Android.  I think the big risk that Google runs on something like this is when it was launched  and announced and then ultimately launched with the founders edition.  There was a lot of attention being paid to it as far as like,  could this be the future of gaming?  Had a lot of potential, let's say.  But now we're kind of like now it's starting to kind of get really quiet  around stadia. You don't hear a lot of people talking about it.  There's just not of attention being paid to it.  It's like they're missing out on that prime time that they could have capitalized  off of the fact that here we have something new.  Everybody can use it and and jump on while you're still thinking about it,  because now people are stopping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I saw stadia as something that someone like me could potentially try out,  because I'm not a big gamer, but every now and then it would be fun  to just sort of goof off and play something.  And it seemed like it would have been assessable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you're using Carson of goofing off all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that is would be an accurate summation of what I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But even it's true, even when we had it here  and you were testing it out for was it hands on tech, right?  It didn't really perform well.  And I'm thinking if it didn't perform well here on this network,  I don't want to take a chance on my crappy home network.  Yeah, you know.  But then I also saw it's also early.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was that was very early.  You know, and they made they made changes to improve that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Then I also started to think about that.  Is it play pass on Android?  I bought that and it just did nothing for me.  So I let it go to is it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you have a crappy home network?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think I have crappy upload crappy down.  Download is OK, but crappy upload is just there's no fiber to the home stuff there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I'm so sorry.  If you live in in West Petaluma,  you have a lot more access to fiber to the home through Sonic.  But wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I don't live in the West.  Yeah, I know. I'm wrong side of town.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm on the wrong side of the fiber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't have access to that.  I'm actually I've just signed a contract with the devil again.  I'm going back to Comcast  because the speeds that I actually get through Sonic, my my three  or four year experiment with Sonic because I wanted to do the right thing.  Right. It's just time and time again, just running up into barriers  of the fact that because it's not fiber to the home, it's fiber to the node  and it's delivered via AT&T DSL.  It's like, OK, so I'm happy to be with Sonic,  but it really, you know, it kind of sucks at times.  And I'm tired of running into that.  So I signed a contract with the devil again.  Oh, man. Yeah, unfortunately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But anyway, but I just again, I just didn't know if this platform would  would stick if, you know, if someone like me would try it out and say,  that's OK, I'll pass.  You know, it just didn't seem like it was going to give me a reason  to stick around, you know.  And now they're not even marketing.  Yeah, not all the platform.  A lot of marketing.  I mean, I know they have a marketing department at Google, right?  I know. I would imagine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, there's like each every team has a person and everyone hates the marketing  people.  Kevin says he moved from the paid plan to the free plan  so he can play the game city bot, but he doesn't.  Yeah. And that's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Kevin loves Google.  Yes. I mean, in 1080p might just be enough for a lot of  a lot of gamers, right?  But that's not good for Google.  Like Google wants you to find a lot of value so that you're paying them  on a regular basis. Perfect world.  So don't know. Yeah.  And I think the the the thought or the fear that Google might shut this down,  that's not an unfounded fear.  Right. Like I could totally see the future of a year and a half,  two years from now.  Actually didn't quite.  We learned a lot of really good lessons and I'm sure we'll fold this technology  into something coming up in the future.  Heard that before, too.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, we did hear that with like inbox and yeah, we killed it.  But now they're rolling in my features in Gmail.  So some of the features are coming.  Maybe so supposedly there is hope.  In other words, don't get into stadia just yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I don't know that you really can unless you have a job.  That's part of the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, OK, you guys, do you want  should I go back to COVID-19 just because I just got my King County  health recommendations? Oh, OK.  OK, share the guidance.  So the public, the King County Public Health Board issued a thing just now  saying for workplaces of businesses, all employees should work from home  if they are able.  Employers should take steps to make it more feasible for their employees  to work in ways that minimize close contact with large numbers of people.  They should maximize telecommunications options.  Urgent place to stay home when they are sick and maximize flexibility  and sick leave and consider staggering start and end times to reduce  large numbers of people coming together at the same time.  For schools, do not cancel them unless there's been a confirmed case in the school.  And if you are a caregiver of a child with an underlying health condition,  you should consult with your health care provider  whether or not they should stay home. If they stay home, that's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, so that's going to trigger a lot of businesses to, you know,  it's going to not force them, but very seriously encourages them  to take a look at how their business is running to make changes that may or may not.  Oh, and it is saying that for event and community gathering considerations,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  if you could feasibly avoid bringing large groups of people together,  consider postponing events and gatherings.  So that does come at time right there.  If you can't avoid bringing large groups of people together,  if you can't avoid bringing groups of people, urge people who are sick not to attend,  encourage those who are at higher risk for coronavirus not to attend,  try to find ways to give people more physical space so they're not in close contract,  clean surfaces and encourage attendees to wash their hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When is Comic-Con? When does that happen?  It's the 14th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's OK. Everybody's behind a mask. It'll be fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, sorry, it's the 13th. It's the 12th. It starts the 12th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's in Seattle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's in Seattle. It's Emerald City Comic-Con.  I'm so sad.  I'm glad we didn't post play it because my daughter and I were originally going to go  as people from the Dragon Prince.  Sigh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's interesting about that, Stacey, too, is that is that,  you know, like in Japan, they shut down the schools, they didn't do anything.  What about the parents? What do you do?  So in this case, they're kind of saying, well, the parents are sure to be home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's true. I mean, because, yeah, it is. Yeah.  It's hard.  There's a couple of things to think about, right?  Sometimes kids only get lunch and breakfast at school.  So when you shut down the schools, you're shutting down their access to nutrition.  Parents don't necessarily have a way to keep their job and have it.  Keep an eye on their kid.  I mean, these are these are things.  Again, I'm good. I'm not trying to be political, but there is a decided  lack of any sort of safety net in our country that really makes this whole thing  extra fraught for people who start with sick days. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People who are sick will have to show up to work to earn the money. Yep.  And I kind of don't blame them.  They can't be cautious. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, talk about the the restaurant industry just as one example, right?  Like that's an hourly industry.  If you don't show up usually in many of the restaurants  and most of the restaurants that I ever worked in in my restaurant career,  you don't get paid if you don't show up. Nope.  And so then if that's your livelihood and that's how you make your money  and not going there means you don't make a paycheck, then I imagine  a lot of people choose to ultimately go there because they have to.  People still want food.  But they're also serving food.  Oh, man, it's just a messy situation.  Oh, can't blame them. Sorry to bring it back.  I just like breaking news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that is news.  Yeah, it is news. You're ahead of the Seattle Times.  I don't find it there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you're still but you're still on for your presentation, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'm waiting to see.  I mean, this literally came.  This is the email that came in eight minutes ago from King County  Public Health Department.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The way it all changes, it's so rapid right now.  Who the heck knows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Literally subscribing to King County Health Department.  How did you know? Of course I am.  I don't subscribe to my journalist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm a journalist, Jeff.  I subscribe to every public, public body in my area.  No, I mean, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, because I don't cover my town.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But don't you want accurate information?  Like I found like I always listen if I can to the press conferences  and look at things, because sometimes I'm sorry, local journalists,  some of you all are wonderful, but sometimes their headlines are misleading.  Yeah. Or things aren't quite like I'm sorry.  I know they're there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not that the journalists fought a lot of times. That's the editor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know those editors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was damned editors.  Yeah. That's why I blog.  So I got rid of editors.  I'd be very happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you have blog in here?  Anything that you've blogged about recently?  No. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, oh, Kevin did a great blog, everyone.  OK.  What was his blog?  On Stacey on IOT, he blogged about how two weeks ago he was sick with the flu  and how he used his voice assistant to avoid effect,  like infecting everyone in his house.  So he didn't touch light switches.  He just used Google.  They actually moved from they controlled their TV  so that he didn't touch any remotes.  It's basically like how Kevin tried not to kill his family  when he had the flu using smart home stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A flu, not the flu. Right. Right. Well, it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It wasn't the. Well, yeah, I know.  You know what I'm saying? Sorry.  I was like, you know, the flu.  But yeah. And I at the end, he asked for a remote  controlled hand sanitizer thing, so I suggested one for him since I own one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow. Oh, so that he just puts his hand underneath and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I have it because it's in my kitchen dispensing soap  because I don't want chicken like raw chicken juice on my soap dispenser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. OK. You know, I've wondered about that.  So that definitely. No, not because.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you not seen me touching my face?  I'm like not germaphobic at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I saw a couple of times.  I'll admit I've touched my face since we started this show.  I did. What? That's why his eyes are red.  Yeah, I know. My eyes are about my eyeballs are about to fall out of my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But paint on your fingers so we can see the trace. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You only see it in black light. That's the thing.  Yeah, exactly. It's a shine of black light on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. So sorry, we were talking about stadia.  That's OK. We may we may have talked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think we're done talking about stadia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I always recuse myself in game stuff so I can come back now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can come back now.  Let's see here.  The the Google news, I have to say, is pretty light this week.  There was no they're all working from home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What about Android? Yeah, there's their smart fish.  Android is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fish. They're violating the privacy of fish.  The world around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, we'll do fish and then we'll do Android one.  What you were talking about, of course, is Alphabet unveiling title,  which is not a high res audio service,  but a new moonshot that's targeting ocean conservation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's basically geared at argue that Jay-Z's title was a moonshot.  Sorry. True.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sorry. Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's monitoring fish behavior in this case  with cameras and of course, it's Google.  So machine perception tools.  Oh, fish recognition. I see it.  Yes. Oh, no.  We're tracking fish in the sea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think this is cool.  This is where like technology can actually improve our lives.  And by gosh, it's a good use case.  And there is actually a debate.  I think Rose Eveleth had an article in Wired about  should we film animals without their consent?  But we're not going to go there right now with fish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you're kidding me.  You are kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was about apes and.  I think was apes.  Yes, that was an actual thing.  Should we should we film or use AI on animals without their consent?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, not that.  Not the monkey selfie shot.  Well, Rose Eveleth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's a copyright dispute. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The copyright thing is separate. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Animals need digital privacy to Wired.  January 31st, 2020.  Oh, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why do you disagree, Mr. Jarvis?  Read it before you start.  Why do you disagree, Mr. Jarvis?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, in that case, let's really talk about animal rights.  Let's not kill any of them.  Let's not hold them prisoner.  You know, we've got to put animal rights.  Don't start with privacy. Come on.  No, no, I'm feeling like a very old fart right now, but no.  OK, you should go read the article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You disagree?  No, I was just just just jerking the chain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He saw an opportunity.  He's just going for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll bet if we look through your photos, we found you violated the privacy of a few cats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Dogs, my dogs, they're always getting photos.  How dare you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, is there such a thing as as an animal providing consent for a photo?  Oh, it's not. It's basically other than humans.  Yeah, that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The argument is more about our entitlement to animals and access to them.  And we in the argument, it becomes when we see ourselves  or when people see animals as something we should have access to 24 7,  we put both ourselves and them at risk.  And she says it doesn't extend it all the time to all the time.  But it's it's it's just a frame of thought like.  And I think it's it's valid.  It's not it's not as crazy as you might.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, but on the other side of that, why?  Has there been any type of controversy for study and say, well, migration  and any other animals that we have to figure out their patterns  to know what the pattern is for the rest of the wildlife circle and all of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She talks about that.  She says we have to have, you know, because when you start doing that,  you can make them more vulnerable to like being tracked by people  who are maybe malicious, not just researchers, which is a problem.  So you have to weigh the harms.  I mean, it's like an IRB for for animal studies.  Anyway, sorry, we were going to talk about title.  We just got so waylaid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now I'm like, I don't know about title.  And I mean, you saw that video.  It was facial recognition.  I'm telling you, thousands upon thousands of fish.  That's pretty true.  That is tracking these things.  None of them provided consent for this video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tracking their their swimming patterns is tracking their.  What are those called scale patterns?  I was like, their their facial features is not what I was going for.  So you're tracking individual fish.  You're also tracking like their behavior in ways.  And the goal is to make. Yeah.  It's leaving them where they are and making sure they're happy. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And leaving them where they are, being a really nice key, key fact there.  Right. Like still being able to study them without removing them  from the environment in which they live  and in a pretty noninvasive way, as far as I can tell, anyways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it's not like they're shooting a tag into the fish.  Ear like we do with our cattle or anything like that. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought you were going to say with your cat.  And I'm like, whoa, someone's going to pee in your slippers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That goes into the back of the neck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Back. Well, that's too well, the little tracker.  Oh, yeah. It's not a tracker.  It's just the tags or whatever that that they inject into the skin.  Like, I don't know what that's called.  Makes it sound a lot worse than it actually is.  But it allows you to find your lost pet.  They get lost. That's why it's there. OK.  Apparently, they've been building this for the past three years. So.  Yeah. And now part of Alphabet's experimental kind of moonshot division  is about making tools and interesting, creative, new concepts and stuff.  But it's also kind of about making money. Right.  Like we're starting to see them kind of tighten, tighten things down a little bit  as far as moonshots that were launched.  But at some point, they're like, yeah, well, this isn't making any money.  So we got to shut it down. So.  And that's good on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Put that one more useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  With Waymo, they just opened it up for outside investment.  And I think we're going to see more of that. Correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, probably. So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that seems to be Google's M.O. under

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  not such a. Oh, I'd love to get an expert and get a veteran of Bell Labs.  Thank you. And see. Sorry.  Sorry, Jeff.  No, no, sorry.  I didn't know that Stacey was embarrassing herself.  I thought I'd let that go horribly, too. Good Lord.  I'd be curious to get a veteran of Bell Labs and compare  the attitude toward pure research and odd  moonshots at both because it was it was the vaunted.  It was research in the corporation outside the university.  And it started the transistor and all this great stuff.  And Lennox Unix, I wonder.  Google seems to be a little more financially targeted now than Bell Labs was.  Or I wonder. I wonder if things like the fish is OK.  Here's a little bit of pocket change.  You can play with that for a while, but then unless something comes of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Enough. Go play with your fish.  I think that's what they've been.  I mean, the fish are three years old.  I think in two years we'll be able to assess what's changed  since Porat started really killing these things like a year ago.  I shouldn't just blame it on Ruth Porat.  That's that's rude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Suddenly got dark.  And I had missed, by the way, thank you for mentioning the Waymo investment,  because that was something that I completely missed.  I don't know. I don't know.  Two point two five billion.  Right now, but two point two five billion investment round.  No, not bad. OK.  Waymo as a as a division and as a as a project seems like it has a lot of legs  compared to some of the other moon shots that have happened.  So it doesn't surprise me at all.  There's a lot of future there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A lot of do you think that because everyone else is investing in these  in self-driving vehicles or do you like and I'm just curious,  like what about it makes you feel like there's a future where something like title  doesn't feel like it has a future?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, I'm not.  I'm not actually saying that about title.  I don't know enough about about oceanography and all that kind of stuff  to even make that that guess.  I just feel like Waymo.  Yeah, it's it.  I feel like five years from now, my guess is it's going to feel a lot more normal,  a lot more common.  And Google's been doing this for a while.  So it makes sense for them to continue to find investment,  to continue that technology growth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They've been doing it for a while.  And like Miss Stacey said, everybody else seems to be invested in it, too.  Sure, there's a lot of this.  That's like one of the signals that we need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Keep rolling. Right. Right.  Exactly. If Google is going to say this experimental, you know,  offshoot from this division is going to continue on,  it's got to have some sort of some sort of benefit, some sort of  signal that it that actually has the ability to make money for the company  down along, you know, in the long run.  And I feel like Waymo has that potential, has that ability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This in Vegas, right? Am I thinking correctly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Waymo, where it's based? Yes.  I thought it was based in California.  They have their tests in Arizona. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. I think something was in Vegas, like they had tracks in  out near Vegas in the desert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They may. I mean, I could be wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe it was.  They have stuff in Vegas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They have stuff in Arizona and they have stuff in California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK. Yes. Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Uh. Yes, no, maybe Waymo in Phoenix says scooter X in a chat.  Yeah, they're definitely in.  Definitely in Phoenix. Yeah, for sure. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's see here. Android one.  So this is the this is Google's program to kind of bring  bring more, say, lower to to low mid tier phones to different,  you know, different markets that also carry kind of Google's  commitment to updates, commitment to quality, that sort of stuff.  But primarily, it's really about receiving updates and everything.  There was an article posted on Notebook Check.net by Alex Alderson,  who writes about how in his assessment,  the Android one program is a shambles, as his headline says,  that primarily what this revolves around is the fact that the promise was always  two years, two years of guaranteed updates for Android one devices.  Later, they changed the verbiage on the site to at least two years of OS upgrades.  And what what they're what he's trying to figure out is, OK,  so a phone comes out and it immediately gets an OS update.  Let's say it came out two months before an OS update.  Then a year later, it gets the second OS update.  That's still a year and a couple of months from the time that it was actually launched.  But it doesn't end up getting anything beyond that.  Right. I think I think really his argument really seems to be,  what are the definitions here?  And does this show that that the commitment around Android one is actually  not being held to the standard that it needs to be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sounds like yet another project that Google has given up on.  I don't know. Gosh.  Do you think it's given up on it?  I mean, how much how much is Google getting out of this emerging market at this point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, well, man, I mean, it was just a couple of years that they they felt  like the emerging markets was the next, you know, the next billion users.  I mean, it was huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Haven't heard that buzzword in how many years now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I mean, a couple of years, I suppose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So but just what exactly is happening with it, I wonder.  I don't know. Your thoughts, Miss Stacy.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just was starting to count how many times Jason touched his face.  Oh, you know, you notice I'm like holding my laptop just in an effort to not touch my face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, is that how you do it? You touch your you hold onto your laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sitting here holding your laptop is so filthy dirty.  Oh, yeah. Everything everything that you would be putting on your face is on your laptop.  Yeah, but I'm trying to keep my hands off my face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I've been sitting here like this for a while.  So I've been sitting here like this for the last couple of minutes just to see if it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was a picture in The Washington Post of a woman on a train wearing on  Bart wearing a train mask and with rubber gloves typing.  So, you know, she's using the gloves to touch all these surfaces and then just  making her laptop a horrible surface in terms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's like when people at like restaurants, they like are handling money.  So they have gloves on.  They have gloves on to make your sandwich.  And then they handle the money with the gloves.  And I'm like, no, no, that's  not how that works.  Yeah, you're doing it wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So so if you were counting about how like what number was I was I like five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, so you you I was only counting for this one section, but you were at least three in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So it's it's it's a thing that I do.  It's really hard to not do it.  Oh, it's really hard to not do it.  We need we need laptops that I can just look at and scroll and maybe you can like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they'll they'll get inside your brain soon enough.  Yeah. See, and you'll welcome that when it comes.  You will welcome it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If it works right, if it works better than the radar on my Pixel 4, then maybe then.  Oh, hey, we can talk about that.  Oh, yes, this is that's my computer.  But I don't need to show it off the pixel.  I don't even know if this made it in here, the pixel.  We are we all on pixels?  I know you are. Yeah.  Yeah. Did you get the did you get the pixel update?  What happened?  What is the feature drop feature drop as it is?  So basically, they'd say so this is the second time that they've done this.  They did it first last December where they announced  every once in a while, we're going to release a feature drop for the pixel.  We're going to bring new capabilities to your phone.  And it's going to be like you got a big update.  And this time around, I went to do check for my update.  And it came through as like a security update.  So I was like, oh, that's not it.  Maybe I need to get the security update and then I will download the feature update.  But it was baked in with the security update.  And it adds, I mean, a handful of features.  One of the key features, I would say, that I saw a lot of people  tweeting about is like AI generated force touch or what is it?  3D touch. Oh, yeah.  So on about that on iPhones and not the iPhone 11,  I think they stopped doing this on the iPhone 11.  But it used to have this like pressure sensitive display  where you could press hard and get it like a faster contextual message or or something.  Well, Google is doing it with software.  So it totally does work where if you tap lightly, maybe the menu pops up  a certain speed, but if you tap harder, it pops up faster.  And I think the AIs must be detecting like how much of your finger  is pushing into the screen or something.  I'm not really quite sure how they do it exactly.  But it's kind of interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think at the at the verge, they called it how hard you're smushing it.  Yeah, you're pushing it right, because your fingers smush,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the smush back out a little bit when you do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not really doing it for me.  I got the update.  I was telling Mr. Howell before the show, the update came through  and I totally forgot about it.  Yeah. And once you do a screenshot to share with the family  and the screenshot interface was different.  So I was like, well, what the heck just happened?  But that was one of the features in the update  is when you double tap the power button, get these extra cards  and things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They don't do a good job of telling us what's in an update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's true.  I mean, you wouldn't know that there were new features on your phone  if you didn't read the article.  It didn't give like a pop up to say, hey, your pixel just got better.  And Google, that's Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's that lack of marketing department.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yep. Yep.  By the way, we had already been pulled on AT&T.  The update has the update has already been pulled off of AT&T  for some reason or another.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow. Oh, well, I just put my phone down.  So Virgil mentioned in chat asking a question, is call screening automatic now?  I didn't read that anywhere, but I've noticed it ever since the update.  Now, suddenly, when calls come through that it doesn't recognize,  it immediately jumps into call screening.  So I see it working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cool. Because mine still gives me the option of it's like  after I hang up on it, it's like, do you want to turn on call screening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I never got that option.  I was maybe you turn it off manually at some point.  Me? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel like I never had that on.  And now suddenly my phone's doing it all the time.  So I don't know what happened.  It must be a setting that has changed.  But I know I never like I just never really got any much benefit  out of call screening, so I never use it.  I did. Now suddenly it's doing it on all these unknown calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All the robo calls were were really getting stopped for me.  But now the robo calls are getting blocked before they even ring my phone.  I'll just see a missed call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Your robot's fighting with another robot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm pretty much. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Robot wars that you never have to see. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the promise of the Internet.  That is an artificial intelligence. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A dark theme, sunset to sunrise option.  That's for you, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no. Go away.  Leave it alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Car crash detection is now active. That's great.  So if your phone detects that you've been in a car crash,  it will give you the opportunity to tap or use your voice to call 911.  It will share location data and details with first responders  if you happen to be unresponsive.  So that's good news there.  Like you said, Google Pay.  So if you press and hold, let's see here.  Let me unlock. I could.  If you got the overhead, I can show this off from a distance.  If I press and hold my power button.  I get a new interface up here, which is my Google Pay options.  So if I had more than one card, I could swipe to the right card.  And then when I use it on terminal, it would use the card that's showing  instead of having to launch the app, the Google Pay app to select the payment  the payment card. So that's that's handy.  I used that just yesterday, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you still using your bubbles?  Are those the bubbles that tell you how much time you've been spending on things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I am. I am still using that. I never.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you find it helpful?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I find that no matter how much or how little I use my phone,  by the end of the day, it's still always stacked up there.  I think the way I'm guessing the way that it uses it is the amount of time  in between locks creates larger bubbles.  And so the whole screen is like 24 hours.  I'm not really quite sure.  But it seems like on days where I'm not using it nearly as much as other days,  it's still filled all the way up there.  I'm like, well, how is that?  That's not helpful. It's not a good metric.  I mean, I guess if I sat there and counted the number of bubbles,  it'd be like, oh, there's less.  That is your job.  But yes, it is.  It is. But, you know, it's nice to know that sometimes sometimes.  Well, that means you're actually doing your job every day.  Leo should be very proud of you.  I suppose so. Yes.  I don't know how many.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In fact, I think your bubbles are too low right now.  I don't think you've been doing enough.  I think Leo leaves town and see what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See what happens. I slack.  No, that's because I was looking at an actual computer screen instead of my phone.  So that's where I was reading all these stories. Yeah, sure.  Yeah. No, no, no, no.  Don't tell Leo. Seriously, don't tell Leo.  Who are Dr. Android?  You were supposed to remove that widget right now.  Remove that.  That home screen.  Let's let's take a break.  We've got a few more things.  We've got the of course, we have the change log  and a few other things that I'm sure we can touch on and then tips, tricks and all that stuff.  Don't touch whatever it is. Don't touch it.  Before we go there.  I think this sponsor of this week in Google, that is LastPass securing  every access point in your business is critical,  but it's challenging for it to improve security without impacting employee  productivity and LastPass.

Do that and you can find out how they can help you.  That's LastPass.com slash twit.  And we thank LastPass for their support of this week in Google.  All right. Outside of the googly things, what else do we have here?  Any stories?  Twitter under threat. Twitter under threat.  Yeah, that's kind of a big deal.  Jack Dorsey and the crosshairs.  Paul Singer, a major Republican donor, apparently purchased a large stake  in Twitter with the hope of ousting him.  Is this a stated goal of of Singer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the question is, is it a political ousting or a financial ousting? Right.  You know, it's it's it's it's a standard  case of somebody investing in a company to be an activist.  But I'm not sure what kind of activist that is, what the motive is behind it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, shares apparently rose on the news of this.  So Wall Street seems to be saying,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  however, employees, of course, started a hashtag.  That's right. That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We back Jack. Hashtag we back Jack.  So I don't know where where this leads or given how

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  how could this this large investment  influence anything other than saying, hey, I'll just take my money and run.  Kind of thing. Twitter is still going to move on if he decides to  take their money and run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When you get enough of an investment,  activist investment, they can have an impact on the board.  The board can fire the CEO and they can put in somebody  friendly to a different way to run things.  And they can force us all to read Donald Trump's tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So like a lot of times we had crappy board members.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. OK.  Well, you just or do crappy, crappier board members.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, really, it's an activist investor comes in, buys their shares.  They then send out they do usually a letter writing campaign.  And then they also like to all the shareholders,  which can include normal people.  And they also try to bring other board members in because  not just board members, but they bring the other investors around.  And then those investors try to influence the board.  And the idea is that you would profit by doing this usually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. OK. And the board now has some good people on it.  Oman Korda Standi, Patrick Pichette,  who was a former CFO of Google, Martha Lane Fox, who  the House of Lords and started a major  media online media effort in the UK.  Brett Taylor, who I like a lot, who used to be  CTO of Facebook is now chief operating officer at Salesforce.  You know, it's a it's a it's a it's a distinguished board, I would say.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The other thing is Twitter is saying that they're going to introduce.  What is it called? It's fleets.  What is letters?  Fleets. Did you say poison?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I said poison pills.  I thought we were still in the financial thing.  I hadn't seen that. All right.  Oh, no, they have it.  I don't think they've actually had to keep them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry. I was like, back to features out of finance and back to features.  Twitter is testing tweets.  Well, they're not really tweets.  They're stories essentially that disappear after 24 hours.  They're calling them fleets, I think, as in fleeting clever name.  But it is totally basically stories.  You get the very story like row of circular avatars up at the very top.  And you would only really find these if you went to someone's profile  and tapped into them.  If I if I'm reading this right, or maybe it's you go to your own profile  and then you've got all the people that you follow.  There are fleets up there.  I'm not really quite sure.  It's testing in Brazil at the moment.  Videos can be up to two minutes and 20 seconds for everyone,  except whitelisted publishers get up to 10 minutes.  Of course, the influencers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If I have to do quarantine,  I want access to this so I can make fleets of my quarantine life.  OK, I want that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That could be that could be your next rise,  your next career rise.  You could be an early adopter of Twitter's fleets  and really capitalize off of being there from really capitalized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it helped me immensely being early into Google Plus. Yes.  Yes, we see where that got us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Rest may Google Plus forever rest in peace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was thinking of quitting my job and just going to Google Plus. Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, hey, in the early days, I saw it was happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was great.  I mean, it was happening in our in our circles. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know about everybody's circles.  No one was adding anyone to their circles. So I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So today, this morning, Tom Brokaw and Mike Barnicle  were on MSNBC complaining about Twitter is just not representative.  And I think and you two are, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Do not get me started.  Just don't go there. Oh, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so, yeah.  So we use the things we like to use.  And I hope Twitter's thing works really well.  And I hope people find a home there and enjoy it.  But it stays here. I don't want you to do it there because I don't want it to fly away.  I want I want records.  No, no. But if it's fleeted, it dies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, no, that's I think if I'm under quarantine, that's what should happen,  because I'm going to get real punchy.  I like ephemerality. I'm going to be like,  you don't want to record.  Remember when Stacey went nuts when she was stuck in her house for two weeks?  And all we have are stories.  I had that time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, we have our memories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly. That's that's a good.  So any of it, but it was good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Can't prove it now. Yes.  Yeah. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you do about walking the dog, Stacey, if you're in quarantine?  Can you walk the dog?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, there's no I mean, of course you can.  OK, you can. As long as you can't.  You've just got to stay six feet away from people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Your neighbors are all going to run away from you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, if I'm the only person under quarantine because I'm sick,  someone else might have to walk the dog because I'm going to be sick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you're not going to get sick. You're healthy. You're Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the dog's not going to get sick. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The dog is over here snoring. Do you all hear her? No.  OK, good. She's doing those little cute.  Oh, those are great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Love those tiny horse.  Very nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There she is. Can you see her?  She's crawled up in the lower third. Take away the lower third.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Barely. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  It's a cozy down there.  Ball of love. Yeah. Good life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's cozy. What kind of dogs do you have, Ant?  I have a.  Twelve year old, I think he's 12 years old,  Chihuahua, teacup Chihuahua.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wouldn't have guessed that for a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's not really my dog. I'll say.  Oh, OK. It's not really my dog.  My dog is Kylo.  He's a four year old pit bull and Mastiff mix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, that's that's more of a for the speed.  I thought, yeah, I didn't see you as a Chihuahua guy.  Put the little the little I walked them both there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was going to say they probably make a good team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I walk them both.  We get along just fine. They know who feeds them.  Yeah. Right. Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My Chihuahua pug is full of hate.  Full of hate.  Surprise. Surprise. Surprise.  No, she's a.  Yeah, I guess she's a.  One of your like I.  I'm a Chihuahua.  Pihuahua.  Pihuahua.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Chug.  Pugawa. Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, Chug.  Chug makes more sense.  And she.  Libra, the the the dream is fizzling.  They hardly knew you.  Facebook's dream of Libra, the cryptocurrency is.  Wow, it's it's just fading away.  It's apparently they're going to start supporting  existing currencies along with the Libra token.  The Libra token will not be the centerpiece anymore.  And, you know, there's just been so much regulatory interest  and attention that Facebook has been receiving on this.  So they're delaying the launch of the Calibra digital wallet.  And it's hard to even know really what Libra is anymore.  This is saddening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I'm like, oh, good.  No, I feel I feel like this is OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's good. I think it's I think it's just fine.  Lower is the hubris notches.  Yes. A few steps on them and I think that's fine. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Facebook has other things to worry about, like censoring  political ads and stuff.  They don't have time to worry about this currency, cryptocurrency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's true. Until they start Facebook Nation, you know.  Right. I take over.  You know, I figured last night that that  where did Bloomberg win?  Wasn't American Samoa. American Samoa.  I figured he bought it.  That's how we won.  So now we can sell it to Facebook and then we can set up a nation there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's the Facebook. Yeah.  Now you can actually visit Facebook.  You just go there.  Just wash your hands.  There is no coronavirus at Facebook on Facebook.  I don't know about in Facebook, but  anyways, Daily Caller is a Facebook fact checker.  We've we've heard about this, you know, months ago and Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Nazi publication.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Daily Caller. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Different, different Daily Caller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, OK. Different Daily Caller.  No, that's the Daily Stormer.  Daily Stormer. There we go.  OK, I was like, really?  They're they're both named the same thing.  But yeah, you're right.  Daily Stormer, Daily Caller, two different things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry, y'all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good, good, good correction.  Yeah, good.  Send all your apps to Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When did Facebook verify?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which one did Daily Caller to their fact check?  Yes, because they wanted because because there's this constant belief  that there's some kind of neutrality in the world.  And so they had to get fact checkers from the right  because all the right was screaming, all the fact checkers are liberal.  And in fact, they are.  So call that a fact, call that an opinion.  So and then the Daily Caller was the fact checks were,  from what I was told, kind of OK ish.  But then trouble hit.  Yes, this week, indeed.  When Trump said,  use the word hoax in relation to the virus,  the Democrats are saying he was calling the virus a hoax.  Trump was saying, no, I was calling what the Democrats were saying  about it a hoax.  The Daily Caller came in and fact checked and said and did it on Trump's side.  And then people are having a fit about this with Facebook now.  So they're caught in where they're always caught in the ringer.  They're always in the crossfire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The problem here is that we have a president who is willing  to just straight up lie all the time. Right.  I mean, really, that's.  I don't know.  I mean, I know all politicians like twist the truth, but  when someone just outright lies, you can't even, you know,  that's not even lying through statistics where you're like,  oh, just tweak it a little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So explain it this way instead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. Exactly.  Everything. That's the problem.  So Alex Deimos said the other day on Twitter,  the problem with this information is it usually is not untrue.  It uses something that was true or something that was said.  And then puts it on the spin cycle.  And so the whole notion that fact checking is going to kind of solve the world.  They're going to save us, folks.  It's important to have track. Of course it is.  I'm not against fact checking.  No, I'm a journalism teacher.  I'm fine with fact checking.  But it's not the solution to those who would is not alone.  The solution to those who would manipulate fact and disinformation.  So that's what we have to going on here is a fight over.  You know, yes, that's what he meant.  No, he didn't. Right.  I can't. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who has the definitive there really is no definitive in that in that situation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I thought that checking was black and white, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the last four years have seemed to prove that facts aren't really facts.  Like there's which is weird.  That seems to be what a lot how a lot of people feel, though,  is that what what truly is a fact?  What is a fact when you take a headline that says Trump calls coronavirus  Democrats new hoax and you combine that with what Trump actually said.  And, you know, apparently facts are interpretations.  In this regard, in the case of this, that's exactly what it is.  Facts are interpretations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, because within the last 40 seconds, I said I thought facts.  Fact checking was black and white.  That's a fact, right?  That I said that within the last 40 seconds.  You said that. Yes, you did.  We've got recorded history of it.  All right. So what's the difference?  I don't think that happened, actually.  Oh, dick gummit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Producers. I think you called fact checking a cookie.  Black and white.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I mean, but you see what I'm saying?  If this is if especially with with regards to Donald Trump and Twitter,  it's all that's digital, that's black and white ones and zeros.  I don't get why a lot of the stuff that comes out of this person's keyboard  could be an issue as far as it being factual and versus hearsay or interpretation.  Now, if this was something on a TV screen that had recorded tape, recorded film,  what's the difference?  I guess, well, AI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, and I mean, yeah, well, yeah, there's that.  That that poses a whole other issue.  But I mean, there are plenty of examples of even Donald Trump on video  saying something that is factually incorrect.  But still, we end up in the same place.  And I'm just not I'm numb to it now.  I'm like, I'm not even surprised that it happens anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I hate that Dana Boyd, who's a brilliant researcher at data  society in New York, says that we are in an epistemological war.  That is to say that if I don't like Jason, I hate Jason,  then I don't like Jason's facts.  And that's that's kind of where we are right now.  And so true.  So you can you can get a common base of facts and then still  everybody can still fight and yell and kill about them.  Yes. I wish I wish that were the case.  And but, you know, what do you mean?  Right. The Kelly and Conway was right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What do you in the chat room says?  Language is more subtle than black and white.  And yeah, I guess it is language.  But I don't know. Just.  I am wearing a red shirt with black letters on it.  I thought it was kind of orange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe maybe pink.  Maybe I'm not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, a lot of the facts are not as black and white as that.  They're they're interpretations of data.  Right. Or of happenings or of.  Perspectives.  So when you start dealing with politics, it become or like rules,  it's very easy to say, well, this law will make this happen.  And it's possible the law could make that happen.  It's also and it's a willful ignoring of tradeoffs  in a lot of like, especially in the political field, it is a.  This law will kill babies.  It might kill one baby,  but it might also enable a million more toddlers to live.  And so this is a terrible example, but it's it's the kind of thing  that happens a lot.  So the law, both statements can be true.  And that's that's often where our facts have been.  Conflicting now we're basically to I'm wearing a red shirt.  No, it's blue and clearly it's blue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Your red is my blue.  This is killing me.  I mean, I guess I just oversimplified much of everything in life.  And I guess that's probably why I just stay in my corner and keep quiet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, that's Carstens corner.  You don't have a corner.  Carstens has a corner.  No, no, you're right. I don't have a corner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have a layer. We can all have corners.  It's OK. We all have hexagon.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well played. Basically, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Despite creating, we're all going to be quarantined in our quarters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Corner team, of course, got to bring it back to the virus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, which is six feet apart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How about we do some change?  Let's do it.  It's change log time.  All right.  Apparently, I already talked about the first thing, the change log.  Sorry about that. Second thing, although your first is a new Google  search feature that is it's one of those things that's likely imminent  because this ended up online and some support pages.  And then shortly after it was published,  it's no longer there.  So this is probably around the corner, but public profile cards.  And this would replace what used to be, if you remember, with Google Plus.  May it rest in peace.  We had these like public facing profile pages through Google.  I would have whatever information we wanted on there, our email address  or phone number, if you wanted a little bio, that sort of stuff.  So it's kind of from what we gather from these support pages  and some of the screenshots that we saw on.  Let's see here. This is an Android police article similar to that.  Something that we could curate, put up.  It's not going to replace search results.  It's not the sidebar thing that comes up when you do a Google search for someone  and then it shows the little sidebar extra information sort of thing.  It's like its own kind of page with information.  That's the old Google Plus looking profile.  So that's kind of what we used to see, if I'm not mistaken.  It's not that bottom right hand corner thing, as Rita points out on her article.  But if you keep scrolling down just a little bit further, you'll see  kind of a it's mobile only right now, or at least it was when they discovered  these support pages. So so that could be coming sometime in the near future.  Usually when we see these things leak like this, it doesn't take too much longer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you're never going to guess what I'm going to scream about now. What?  So if you're in.  What do you call it?  I always scream about that. My identity is going to messed up on Google.  Google. Oh, sweets.  Sweets, sweets, sweets.  If you're in G Suite, guess what?  I doesn't work with the user.  No, it's worse.  The user. So in companies, wherever users can't change their own profile,  they have to get their administrator.  Oh, that's fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't that ridiculous?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. But I'm but that's a sweet.  So it's fine.  That's that's Google.  Everything about Google Sweets is the worst.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Meanwhile, it's the it's the thing you pay for, right?  All right. I know you pay for it.  It's the worst. Like Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I spend money on this.  Why won't you let it work with my desk or my Google device?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So weird. And this is not a new issue.  It's been this way for years.  And they know. And it drives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They know. I think they keep I think actually they've fixed it in the side.  They just keep it this way to drive me nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's all about pissing you off, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. Yes. That's what you know.  See, Ant lives in a nice world where things are simple.  But my world, my world, everybody's messing with me.  It's all about my face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Take that. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And so we get great opportunities from him every week.  Absolutely. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you happen to have the Firefox edge and Opera browsers or Opera browsers,  use any of those over Chrome.  Congratulations, you finally get to use Google Earth on them.  Apparently, there's been a six month public beta of this happening.  The Google Earth kind of relaunch happened in 2017.  And since the relaunch, it's only worked in Chrome.  So it's been a long time coming.  But now these other browsers can get in on the Google Earth.  It's amazing, as is that transition.  Google Photos is shifting search around.  So there's going to be a new update that's server side switch.  It's happening right now in Google Photos app.  Used to be or still is, if you still have the old version,  the search up at the very top.  Now that's going to move down into a tab in the bottom row,  along with the other things down there.  So you're going to have to go to kind of like a separate page for search.  But there you're going to have a number of suggestions for people, pets, places,  things you might want to search for.  So there's a little bit of UI built around that.  I think that makes sense.  A little bit easier.  It's one more tap that you might have to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But, you know, I guess we'll play around with it and see if.  I think it makes sense because it helps your search results  be a little bit faster, because I use this quite a bit  when it comes to looking for photos and I'm putting in,  say, Clemson.  And of course, it would just pull up everything in Clemson  when I actually meant just the Clemson football game, you know,  give me categories that says university, sporting event, something like that.  Yeah, you know, I think that I think that's a nice little feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I wonder how dynamic those categories might be  or if they're going to have them specifically set for.  No, we've only got these four categories and everything falls into them.  Who knows? But yeah, we'll find out.  Apparently, this one took me a little while to understand here.  Google posted some GIF tools or if it's if the G in Google is Guth and GIF.  So, you know, either way. Thank you. It's GIF.  Based on data from Google's GIF and stickers,  search engine tenor, which they acquired in 2018.  So the tools are actually embedded in a medium post.  And actually, I don't know if the tool on this Verge article is actually interactive.  But the idea being you would tap into that area where shrug is.  Oh, yeah, it is. And basically, they've done all this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Show me creepy, please show me creepy celebrities.  I want to see creepy celebrities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dwight Schrute is creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Dwight Schrute's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. But he's definitely creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But he's definitely creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so they do is not really creepy in the way that they're looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, not the same. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That Mickey Mouse is definitely creepy. Yeah.  And then can you copy it? That's haunting me.  When you put it away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Copying to Jeff. OK, to give. Sorry.  Anyways, they've got a couple of tools.  If you go to the medium article, they've got like three or four different tools  there that are interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Posting this on medium and not on their blogs.  Why do they make it so hard to find information?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't. That's that's what confused me about this.  They're like, OK, here's a bunch of interesting gift tools.  Where's that marketing purpose?  We're going to make it really hard for you to use them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But oh, why? Why?  That will haunt my nightmares. Nice work, Mr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Kid. It's very nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's when you're all riding like traps and locked in your home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're going to see that Mickey Mouse weird Mickey Mouse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Your feverish dreams undulating on the on the curb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sharing it with my children right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Perfect. As yes.  Dan, I'm not surprised.  New assistant features rolling out today.  If you say, hey, G, read it or hey, G, read this page.  When you're on a web page, assistant will read the web page to you.  It can also translate 42 languages into your preferred language.  Pretty neat feature.  First introduced in preview at CES in January before you guessed it.  The coronavirus went on a canceling spree.  Drink, drink, get it into every story today.  So, yeah, assistant will read you a web page.  And that is the Google change log.  Dig it. Dig it.  Any final bits and pieces before we move into the picks?  Did we? Did we do this?  Hold on. And anything, anything that stand out to you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a verge survey of attitudes toward tech companies.  OK, that's right. And someone on Twitter, I discovered someone on Twitter  said that the sense that you need is someone on Twitter.  That's my authority.  That the tech clash is a myth.  Because if you look at what are your opinions about these brands,  true Facebook and Twitter at the bottom.  But a hell of a lot of brands on top of that list are very well liked.  Amazon, 91 percent, Google, 90 percent, YouTube, 90 percent, Netflix, 89 percent.  And so on. Then how do these brands impact society?  Neutral and positive.  Very little on the purely negative side, except Twitter and Facebook again.  Share of people who trust these companies with their information.  Microsoft, 75 percent, Amazon, 73 percent, Netflix, 71 percent, Google, 69 percent.  Then I thought it was a little.  Oh, go on. One more, one more.  I thought it was a little it was telling in terms of how the surveys are done.  As all surveys bring prejudices.  Question is, what are your top reasons for not using Facebook?  I would wish they'd also asked, what are your top reasons for using Facebook?  Since two billion people still do. Right. Right.  So anyway, I thought it was the point here was just that I was drawn to it  because it's not as bad as one would hear in media.  That's the point. Sorry, Stacey. Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, I was just going to say it's a little bit interesting  because, you know, Instagram owned by Facebook.  It'd be interesting to see stuff like Ring, which is owned by Amazon.  Like some of the bands, the brands taking a drubbing are brands,  but they're still owned by some of these companies, which is always like  they had YouTube and Google as separate entities there, which Instagram

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is down to the low end next to Facebook and Twitter on the.  What are your opinions of these brands? It is.  Well, the 72 percent see are favorable about about Instagram.  Twenty eight percent not favorable versus Amazon.  Ninety one percent favorable, nine percent unfavorable.  So it's worse by a major chunk, but it's not disastrous.  Even Twitter, even Facebook.  Seventy one percent have favorable opinions on Facebook.  It's weird that Twitter is really important.  That's really weird.  I think I think I think that's I think that's again, media lately  is people are blaming Twitter for all the nasty things they they they hear  repeated in media. Yeah.  Right.  So anyway, that's that's that story struck me as interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or it shows just how fleeting our our our rage can be.  It feels like rage is very fleeting nowadays.  Leading was that you said fleeting.  Oh, that's right. Oh, man.  Twitter drinking, Twitter.  But you know what I mean?  Like like people get really enraged about something and it doesn't seem to take  very long for that rage to die off.  And no, there's that's the thing that I'm angry about now.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Move on to something else.  Move on to something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So maybe that's part of it, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right. I had an update from a story last week.  What's up?  Where we talked about the weather person that had the filters  pop up on on their news,  weather broadcasts about the snowstorm.  You remember that, Mr. Jarvis?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, right. So to recount for those who weren't here, we

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  in Carolinas, there was a snowstorm.  I put it in air quotes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow. 10 flakes.  Let's do team coverage kind of snowstorm. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the local weather person, he was out, you know, doing his coverage for it,  and he was using Facebook Live, but accidentally turned on the filters  in Facebook Live.  So his face had all of the little googly eyes and a little hats and things like that.  Yeah, that's the one.  And I mentioned last week, I was like, LOS sounds like home.  And it was. So I talked to my mother about it because that's part of the company  that she works with.  And she says, yeah, he was out and he was apologetic about it.  But it's one of those things where the news team, they're pretty much like a one  man or one person team going out to do these things.  So he set up his camera, accidentally hit the filters.  He didn't he didn't know because he's just supposed to go out there in the field  and just put it on a tripod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, the display is showing the other way because you want the best camera  shining on you. Oh, that's great.  So it's so great. He didn't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But he he had fun with it and had a little follow up about it.  So, you know, sorry, my bad, but we'll get over.  Let's just have some fun with it.  But yeah, yeah, I mean, at least he wasn't like he wasn't doing a murder trial

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  or anything like. Yes, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, there are times when you would not want that happening.  But yeah, snowstorm, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, we loosely say, I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Snowstorm. Why does it cycle through?  I don't know, because usually any any time I've ever used these features.  You know, it stays on one.  It stays, I guess, because I still love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know. No idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is interesting.  That's so fantastic, though.  They should all do that.  Really? Well, except for certain scenarios.  Yeah. Probably a bad idea.  Very good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But during all happy talk on local news, they should do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or just the silly.  Yeah. I mean, because like what?  50% of local news is like scare tactics and silliness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely. That's right.  Right. Right. So the city council meetings. Yes.  All right. Let's do the picks.  We are we have arrived to the picks.  So, Jeff, let's start with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, OK. No.  So there was an Amazon thing.  So we can do a coronavirus.  Amazon has removed one million products for virus gout, price gouging in line.  But as I was looking around through that, then I found something  I enjoyed a lot more.  And this is not new.  But a TV station, a CBS station in upstate New York  did a story about how  products are liquidated when you return them. Right.  If it comes within the original packaging, they just resell it.  But anything that's been opened goes to a liquidator.  And then the liquidators try to remarket it.  And there's all kinds of stuff.  So if you go to I have a link in there, direct liquidation.  It's not individual.  You can buy some things individually, but a lot of it is just bulk.  So a pallet filled with decorations and favors, stationary invitations,  disposable tableware,  MSRP of twenty two hundred dollars.  Right now, you could bid on it at one hundred fourteen dollars.  A pallet with 70 pieces of stuffed animals.  Twenty five hundred dollar MSRP.  You can get it bid now for two hundred twenty four dollars.  Just all kinds of weird stuff.  And I can't figure out who would necessarily buy a truckload of 26 pallets.  I know exactly. Four hundred to nine hundred PC's.  General merchandise.  Seventy thousand dollar MSRP.  Buy now for seven thousand dollars.  Yeah. You get 90 percent off this stuff. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And people end up reselling all this stuff.  They channel through it either.  Yeah. Pawn shops, eBay.  I mean, so much of like what you see Amazon third party sellers,  like refurbished items, eBay.  I mean, there are people that this is their this is their job.  Like this. And they get passed off as new.  They get passed off as new or they or they post it as refurbished.  And, you know, they understand when they buy these that not every  every single thing in the lot, it is kind of a gamble.  Not everything in the lot is going to have some sort of like value  that they can resell, but they end up selling a lot of it.  Yeah. I've seen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've seen on certain YouTube channels where you could get  these little pallets full of photography gear, you know,  like little tripods and things like that next to nothing.  You know, as long as you buy a whole pallet, you'll spend,  you know, a thousand bucks on it or something like that.  But what's in there is way worth more than a thousand bucks  because of the so much is in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And there's another one where I was looking.  Oh, shoot, I messed that up.  The other one is liquidation.com. I think it's called. And  so, you know, you can imagine you could you could buy like a hundred iPhones.  And and for a fraction of the price  and make a wall of iPhones or something, right?  Totally. Or sell it for parts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, people looking for a certain part for their broken iPhone and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Isn't that the storage wars?  Isn't that the that company?  Well, is that what it is?  Because storage where you you buy a shed or.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, you buy the contents of what it's similar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's that concept. You buy the unseen your bed.  It's kind of like gambling, but it's not. Mm hmm.  Yeah, they make a whole show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly. You buy the storage and you don't know what's on the inside  until you're confirmed to be the winning bidder.  And then you go in there and you see if you have anything valuable to get rid of.  I found a modell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just a couch. Really? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's better than a dead body.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That way. That's that's the tagline.  Showtime. Yeah.  It's better than a dead body.  Um, let's see.  Rough in Seattle already. Yeah. Yeah.  Stacey, what you got?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, you guys, I'm going to let you all know that I am under embargo  for exciting, better things about this, but keep this in mind for tomorrow morning.  Oh, I'm going to have to try and plug it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Come to me. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, can you see it?  Yeah. I've got to make things up.  This is my helium router, y'all.  This is a three hundred and fifty dollar router  that has a blockchain based token  system that is providing long distance wife, not Wi-Fi coverage,  long distance coverage for things on helium.  They have what's called the long fi network.  Tomorrow, there's going to be exciting news regarding helium  and its network capabilities.  But it is a really fun is not really the right word.  It is a I mean, it's fun for me, but that's not that's a terrible standard.  You basically set this router up and you provide coverage  to devices on the network, and then you get paid for both providing coverage  and then also. Oh, what's the word?  Providing coverage and then also being part of a blockchain  that creates a consensus around other devices on the network.  So did that make any sense?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it did. OK. Not your fault. My fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No. OK.  This is a device that allows other devices that use the same radio  to talk to it.  So if I have a sensor that uses the long fi radio network  and after tomorrow it will be a lot more interesting.  Then my router provides coverage for it,  and then I get paid for providing that coverage.  And by paid, I'm paid in cryptographic tokens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. OK. And who's paying you? Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, in helium, I get paid in helium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Something else. But what's their interest in paying you?  What were they saving?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because the more people have this, the more coverage there is.  It's basically remember phone. It's like phone. It's phone.  Yeah, it's exactly like phone. It's the IoT phone.  It is the IoT phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now Dum Dum gets it. OK, thank you. OK, I got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No problem. I'm sorry.  I'm like so losing everything right now,  but I'm the only one on Bainbridge Island, but I'm not the only one in my area.  There are no no in Seattle.  There are several.  There are three thousand one hundred and twenty two hotspots around.  See, like here's my little tab telling you.  Don't look at that.  Wait. OK, yes, you can.  I'm like I'm like making sure I'm not showing you anything special.  So, yeah, belatedly.  Nice. So this is this is a very fun thing for someone who likes the blockchain  and I'm sorry, who likes who wants to provide,  you know, coverage for something.  And then I also am playing with another blockchain based  low power wide area network, this one from an app called Nodal.  And I downloaded it's called Nodal Cash and ODL.  And I currently have.  Point zero zero zero four two four seven.  Nodal cash is you're racking up the nodal and I'm  I'm a.  I'm basically providing  Bluetooth connectivity to things that are around.  So that's what that network is.  So basically, I'm running a bunch of different little like secret networks  that I'm apparently getting paid in minuscule amounts of cryptocurrency.  But I'm doing it because I'm a good citizen.  And I was going to say, you're giving back, you're giving back the geek.  And because it's my job.  Yes, indeed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I need more about that.  Some.  So they're there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wouldn't.  This is not an investment opportunity.  Let me just put that.  Don't worry. I wasn't.  OK. This is not going to send your boys to college.  I don't think this is.  But it is kind of neat.  So and it sounds like more news to follow tomorrow.  And yes, tomorrow, the helium thing is going to get way more exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Interesting. Right.  Right on helium router.  What what you got?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I have record box loft as my first pick.  This is a company up in I believe it's in Michigan.  I think it was in your Wakefield, Michigan.  But what they did is they offered an opportunity for local photographers  or people that are actually just trying to get started in photography,  a spot to go and practice wedding photos.  So they set up a date and they bring in some models  and they let people sit down and just go through  what it's like to shoot for an engagement, what it's like to shoot for weddings  and things of that nature.  And they give you all this beautiful lighting.  It's a really nice setup.  And it just it's just another way to sort of help grow the photography community.  Personally, I'm not doing it because I don't have to catch the shoot a wedding.  It's just I don't want that pressure.  But I thought it was this was a great idea.  And this was shared to me because one of our  loyal listeners, Mr. Jason Miller, he's a loyal listener of hands on photography.  He shared some of his photos and I was like, wow, where is this done?  He said, yeah, this local company just hooked us up with a spot to to go  shoot and do some trial shots.  And we should see. Yeah, there's this link  showing off the images that he shot because he's trying to get started  in photography and and just get better at it.  So he's been listening to our show.  And just taking the time to get out there and practice his skills.  And it's nice to see that a company like Record Box Loft there in Michigan,  giving these folks an opportunity to just go out there with no pressure,  no strings attached.  And it's a safe place. No judgment.  You know, get out there, go shoot, get better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nice. That's a good shot.  Very nice.  And that is Instagram dot com slash Record Box.  Record Box Loft.  See what that's all about.  I came across an article earlier today  that talked about how you could use a rooted Android phone  to jailbreak an iPhone.  I was like, oh, really?  You can do that now.  I'm here. But yeah, so I actually want to try this just just out of sheer curiosity.  I would love to do this as like an episode for Hands on Android.  But there is a walk through XDA referred to it.  It was initially posted in Reddit and then XDA,  you know, kind of featured it and kind of gave some extra information  as far as how to do it. It's not that difficult.  Like if you already have a rooted Android phone, right,  it's actually really simple for the most part.  Just involves getting the right cable to plug from the iPhone  into the rooted Android phone and then running a couple of, you know,  busy box. Yeah. A couple of terminal commands.  And boom, you've got a rooted iPhone.  And it's all because of CheckRain gaining Linux support  and as such Android support.  CheckRain is compatible with iOS 13.  That's iPhone 5 through 10.  And or it's compatible up to iOS 13 and including iOS 13, if I'm not mistaken.  It is a temporary jailbreak, though.  It doesn't survive a reboot.  So that's yet anyway.  But but relatively easy to do.  And so I just think it looks like a good challenge.  Yes. Understand if you're doing this, understand the potential downsides,  you know, the secure the fact that you're breaking the security layer  on your Android phone in order to root it.  And the fact that you'd be breaking the security layer on your iPhone  in order to jailbreak it.  Yeah. So understand that and know that, you know, the risks involved in doing that.  But kind of a neat little geeky walkthrough that I think I might have to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I look forward to seeing it.  So his face just lit up as he saw that article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. It's been a while since I've done this sort of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it lit up because the germs that he touched his face with are glowing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm awake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Steve Gibson over at Security Now has some has some more information on CheckRain  and how to that's right.  Jailbreak your iPhone.  If you want to check out.  Yeah, he's he's had a couple of focuses,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  focused episodes on CheckRain and what it's all about.  And all of CheckRain is is a temporary jailbreak, right?  Like if I remember correctly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, it doesn't survive a reboot, but it's just it's just fun to.  Yeah. Play with your iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And so if you can just do it with the phone,  the Android phone that you have in your pocket at any time  and swap right over to jailbroken iPhone.  Hey, it's kind of neat.  Neat that you can.  I love that you can.  And it's been a while since I've done anything like that.  So I see it as a challenge.  So maybe I'll do that sometime soon and you can find that at my new show.  Twitter TV, slash H.O.A. hands on Android.  That's it. We've reached the you have a new show.  Yeah. Yeah.  So it's right. You weren't here to hear the emotion.  Yes. Yeah. A couple of weeks ago.  Oh, I'm excited.  I use Android.  Well, there you go.  So tips, tricks, walkthroughs, deep dives.  Last week, I did a kind of like a deep look at the Android  11 developer preview, developer preview one.  There we go. That came out  like a couple of weeks ago.  So I walked through that this week.  I'm doing kind of a focus on permissions and yeah, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm so excited.  I'm going to start sending you make really esoteric, weird questions.  I would love that.  Stacey, yes, that that is a feature that everyone knows about.  I'll be like, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I see the show as a way to kind of dive into things  that more experienced Android users can benefit from,  but also as a way to kind of like explain some.  No, but also for as a way to explain things  that are maybe a little bit less deep in the in the US.  You know, like a lot of people might not know or understand,  like they know they hear about permissions all the time,  but they might not understand what is kind of the reasoning behind it  and why you want to be careful when you're switching your permissions,  that sort of stuff.  So that's my goal with that show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So yes, I'm totally going to watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you. I appreciate that.  But yeah, Twitter TV slash H.O.A. for that.  I usually promote myself last, and this time I promoted myself first.  I'm so sorry. Selfish.  So selfish. No, no, that was really helpful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. Good.  If only one person, it helped me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stacey, what you want to talk about Stacey on IOT.com.  You're working on anything that you want people to know about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I said people to Kevin stuff.  So that's the most useful thing I think we've got right now.  Yeah. Always useful.  Listen to the podcast, the Internet of Things podcast  and sign up for my newsletter if you are interested in the Internet of Things.  It is free and chock full of delightful information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's yeah. And that's about it.  And yeah, definitely check that out.  Also check out Jeff Jarvis, Buzz Machine dot com.  Anything you want to leave people with other than wash your hands,  don't touch your face, all the usual  salivations in this coronavirus era.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pick your nose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pick your nose.  I don't think your nose even with their hamster calf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's right. We forgot about that.  Oh, yeah. OK. What was that real quick?  It's what was already on the run down, but now it's become my German word of the week.  Thank you, Carson.  Here, Carson.  It comes from the German word from the word, the verb to hamster or hamster,  which means to hoard or panic by.  Calf means to buy.  Hamster means to like stick it in your cheeks.  So a hamster is a hamster by is is is hoarding,  which is what people are doing, even with, as Stacey said, toilet paper. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they'll do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I just saw the New York Times just sent out its its coronavirus  email update.  So they leave you with this little bit of factoids and numbers.  A one corona virus, a man around 50 in Westchester County in New Rochelle  was found to be ill with coronavirus.  He's in the hospital now. He's doing well.  However, now nine people have been found so far to be infected,  the man's wife and two children, a friend who drove him to the hospital,  a friend who was in close proximity with man and the friend's wife  and three of their children.  So now a hundred a thousand people in the area have been told to self quarantine,  airborne, including nurses and doctors, the hospital, the man's daughters,  high school and his son's college have canceled classes.  So did New York Law School after a student, they're reporting,  having contact with the man who works at a Manhattan law firm.  That's one case. One case. One case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Holy cow. And then when you're talking about like,  what are they saying that the mortality rate is based on what they know?  Right now, about 3%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who just called it 3.4% is what they said today.  Yeah, the regular flu is below 1%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  However, however, because we are not testing and don't know how many cases,  how many people are really infected.  My hope is that number will come down as the number of cases increases.  Yeah, that makes a lot of sense, actually.  But it is definitely there are more people now have died.  I just saw this headline this morning.  More people have died this season of the coronavirus than of the plane virus.  So those people say, oh, it's doesn't like we're panicking.  Oh, the real virus kills more people. The flu. Thank you. The flu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not true. The coronavirus killed 3000 people.  The flu so far this year. This year. This year. How many?  Flu deaths in 2020. In 2020 or this flu season? 2020. 2020.  All right. 20. Let's see if that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which I guess they both fall in 2020. So that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh. Sorry, I'm just like, sorry, I'm just like that does not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They say you always find.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, because the flu on average kills people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  46,000 people. So 18,000 to 46,000, says the CDC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, but 18,000 people haven't died so far of the coronavirus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. That's true.  Well, that's well, but that's that's for the whole period of the flu.  I don't know. I don't know.  I did. I should have had the actual link.  I apologize. Erase what I just said. Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like, hold up there.  I'm calling you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you're right. You're quite right to do that to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're quite right. I. Although maybe at this point,  from January to now, certain number of flu deaths are less. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm looking. I'm on the CDC's flu website. Key updates.  I'm just trying to see.  I just don't know where it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've been checking the Washington Post, the New York Times  on this a lot. And so I thought that I should have put the link in.  You're right. You're right. You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nonetheless, look, here's a lovely chart

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  of pneumonia and influenza mortality from data for the week for the whole week.  So, oh, but it's percentages.  So I have to get the chart data for the actual number of deaths.  OK, it's going to take a little time.  Yeah, sorry. I'll stop now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Jason was to go wash his face or continue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, I'm so ready to wash my face and my hands and burn my clothes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think having been in proximity is going to go just to the shower.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you're basically already infected.  Whatever it is that you know, allergies are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What do you want people to know about it?  Continue to check out hands on photography here on the network.  That's quick. TV slash hop.  Having a lot of fun sharing a little bit that I know about photography  and given different tips and tricks.  And this week, we're going to dive more into the hardware  and not so much into the software.  But I also enjoy sharing the photos that are sent to me,  whether it's in the community or just sent to our email.  Hop at Tweet TV.  So, yeah, check that out. Thursdays every week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Subscribe, subscribe to TV slash HOP for hands on photography.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff, you might be right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh. I'll take the mic.  She's crunched.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the first the chart has the data for the first seven weeks of 2020.  It's averaging about three hundred and eighty, it looks like,  for those first seven weeks.  Now, 2020, three hundred.  So what we're looking at is.  The flu. So you're looking at.  But we're 10 weeks.  How many weeks are we in now? Ten or 11 weeks in.  So there it's a lagging indicator.  And I don't know by the second week of February.  If we go by the cases at that same amount of time,  I don't think that's an accurate stat.  But based on flu tests, this is just in the United States.  So in the United States.  Yeah. So, OK, you're wrong. You're still wrong. I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you have you.  But we know a little more about how you person.  Can you just edit all of that?  Take me out. I was going to suggest

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you're feeling really good there for a bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Making a clip of Stacey saying, Jeff, you might be right.  But now I'm just going to make a clip of saying no, Jeff, you're wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You might be right. You're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stacey, is your event still on tomorrow?  Oh, what is your event still on tomorrow?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. They haven't sent it out.  It shouldn't be based on this, which is sad because I'm going to lose money.  But it's OK, because I don't want you to live.  Well, I'm going to I'm probably going to live.  I'm not in a high risk area. OK, good.  But who knows?  I shouldn't say that now.  Now I'm definitely going to die. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Please don't.  Let's let's all live for a very, very long time.  And I think go on with our lives and not touch our faces or eyeballs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We'll see about that. All right.  Hold on my dead laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can somebody get Jason a hockey mask, please?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Please. I need a respirator.  I need everything at this point.  Just get him a car.  Twit dot TV slash Twig TWIG.
