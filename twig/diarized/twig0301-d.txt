It's time for our Twig this week in Google.  Hello, everybody.  Leo Laporte here with Mr. Jeffrey Jarvis.  From the CUNY Labs in beautiful downtown New York, New York.  Meatballs make you mellow.  It was a very mellow beginning.  I am mellow.  I've been eating meatballs.  No, you know why I'm mellow?  Well, we'll talk about it in a second.  Let me introduce Kevin.  Kevin Marx is also here.  We love Kevin from his garden.  The chirping birds signal the arrival of spring.  Or of the new tone extension.  For Google Chrome.  Hi, Kevin.  Kevin, a Googler, an Appler, a British telecomer, a Salesforce-er.  And now he's out.  A gardener.  Now Indie.  Now Indie.  IndieWeb.  IndieWeb, yes.  Is a wonderful thing.  We're going to talk a little bit about some IndieWeb stuff.  But the reason I'm a little mellow, it's not merely mellow.  I'm kind of sad because this is Letterman's last night.  And boy, I just remember Carson's last night.  Remember Bette Midler sang, one for my baby, one for the road.  I just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the end of the voice.  Carson was the comic model for my father's generation.  Yes.  Letterman for our generation.  Our generation.  Very much.  And I would argue Jon Stewart for Son of Jake's.  I think you're right.  But Letterman definitely was the voice we tried to emulate in comedy.  Yeah.  And then telling a joke and a story and an attitude.  And he changed.  He just did so much.  He...  I feel bad to this day about the whole Leno thing.  But in the end, I think what tonight, what today disproves right now is that he won in the end.  I think so.  He's much more respected, much more loved, much more of an innovator.  Leno turns out to be a low-hard buffoon, boor, boar, lump of nasty humanity.  I'm kind of with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's funny because Dave's known for being kind of cranky and snarky and sarcastic.  But there was this...  Just as with Johnny, there was an undercurrent of kind of Midwest, good old boy, nice guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the thing about, I think Dave started was...  And this is Howard Stern for me too, is honesty.  Yes.  Leno is just one big fake plastic mob.  He was showbiz.  He was the old showbiz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's what Letterman was an antidote to in the 80s and the 90s.  Absolutely.  Was to that whole showbiz thing.  He always kind of deprecated that and hated it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I just put up two letters that Dave sent me when I was a TV critic.  These are my most prized possessions.  Where'd you put them?  Under the other as a tweet.  They're very minor, but they are my absolute prized possessions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  Find it?  Under other as a tweet.  Okay, there you go.  Oh, you mean on the Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean on...  There's a Twitter tweet.  Yeah, what did he say?  So he said, I just wanted to thank you for saying such nice things about me.  I appreciate the support.  This is when he was going through the Leno fight, losing tonight's show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kind of blows me that that was 22 years ago.  Isn't it amazing?  Blows me away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just was like, what?  That was NBC letterhead.  This is CBS letterhead just thanking me for review of the show.  So I signed your friend, Dave.  He hated critics.  He wouldn't even let us into the show.  I went there once and what we weren't allowed in despised us.  But still, I have such respect for him.  And to have gotten within a mile of him is amazing.  So I'm going to miss you, Dave.  Even though I was too old to stay up late to watch you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Well, that's the sad story is none of us watched it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now who watches Jimmy Jimmy or Colbert?  We're going to watch them all on John Oliver and John Stewart.  We watched...  No, not even Pativo.  We watched the best bits on YouTube.  On YouTube, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I must admit I'm quite here because I barely watched any of these things.  I only have the loosest idea of Letterman and the thing.  I understand the cultural legacy of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Carson really was the kind of show where everybody watched it and then  you kind of wanted to talk about it the next morning.  It was a water cooler conversation.  And so for some reason, it really was must watch even though it was really late at night.  But I think the habit of late night television viewing kind of died out.  Probably thanks to TiVo and VHS and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, Jimmy and Jimmy are both good.  They're both wonderful.  But what young person watches anything scheduled?  Right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Nobody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nobody.  And thank God that saved Saturday Night Live because there was usually only one or two good skits.  And so the fact that you just watch the clip really saves you hours of wasted time every week.  I'm going to miss John Stewart.  I think when's his last show or did he already have it?  No, no, no.  It's coming up.  I think I'll have the same kind of feeling.  Although, I guess for our generation, because Letterman was on for 33 years,  he's really for, I mean, we started watching in our 20s.  Right.  So that's really why it means so much, I think, to our generation in particular.  Yeah.  You young people will know when, yeah, when Conan retires, you guys will understand.  Colbert's taking over.  I think that's going to be interesting.  Is he going to be Colbert or Colbert?  Colbert.  So he will keep the...  But without the Colbert character.  Without the character.  I'm dying to see what he's like without the character.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think he'll be good.  I was talking about this with Jake last night.  He's a little nervous about it.  But I think he's very quick.  I mean, Jake, thanks to Jake, I went to see the show and he does the pre-warm up stuff.  Yeah.  He's quick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's clever.  He's smart.  I love Conan.  He started with Letterman.  He's one of his writers.  And then, of course, John Oliver, who is the dark horse who surprised everybody,  except me because I listened to his Bugle podcast for years.  The funniest podcast ever.  And so I knew that Oliver was a gem, although I was a little disheartened when HBO looked like  so blatantly copied The Daily Show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  I think he's found his niche as a hard hit show.  It's actually different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because it's weekly and it's actually almost a documentary show, which is very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He takes on a big topic, which is risky because most of the topics really work.  His school testing one was great, but not everyone is the gem.  And he's committed to doing a 12-minute gem.  That's hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's hard.  But boy, he's made a big difference in our world.  I think many people give him credit to turning around the net neutrality conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And he did one on software patents and other bad patents recently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's taken on some big sacred cows.  The piece he did on testing a couple of weeks ago,  I hope made people aware of what is going on in education in the United States.  It's not good.  It's not good at all.  I love the birds.  They're really active.  It must be mating season.  That's not chirp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Except that we've had the nests of hatch.  There were nests in our canopy here, but they seem to have hatched already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You need some cats to cut down the population.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, we've got a cat.  Cat's been by.  I've got cats and dogs and birds here.  So it's going to be an entire Tom and Jerry show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Next week, Jeff will be in studio with us because he's coming to town.  Google I.O. starts a week from tomorrow.  And already some rumors.  According to Bloomberg, Google will be unveiling a new photo service  separated from Google+.  This would be just another nail in Google+.  Makes me sad.  I was sad when Buzz closed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When I was at Newsgeist in Helsinki, which is a news thing that Google did to  lube some squeaky wheels in Europe.  Googlers and it's news people.  And I did my standard joke about how I still like Google+.  It always gets a laugh.  It is a constant laugh line now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I like it.  I do too.  And I like it more because there's fewer people there.  Turns out I realized that really this I like social networks when it's just people like me.  And as soon as normal people get in there, I don't it's like, come on,  I don't need any more up worthy posts.  And you start you start to see that in Google+.  You're starting to see that same kind of Facebook re-re-re-sharing of, you know, garbage.  And that that to me is the beginning of the end for any social network.  Such as Twitter has gone post and post that.  Now Twitter is something completely I don't know what Twitter is,  but it's something completely different.  So the new photo tool, which will let users according to this according to Bloomberg,  post images to Facebook and Twitter.  Yay, last.  Finally.  G will greater autonomy photo tool, more freedom to take on rivals.  In other words, because Facebook and Twitter were seen as  competitors to Google+, you couldn't share to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There was some mutual bad blood there as well.  I mean, yeah, that's probably true.  Yeah.  The other thing that's changed was announced was that they're going to Google is indexing  Twitter again, which is another one of these strategy tax things that they think.  I think there was some that was at least partly Google and partly Twitter.  But the fact they couldn't come into agreement on that was it was a big shame.  I suspect that was infighting within Google as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, because Google had the fire hose.  Then they then Twitter turned it off, I think, or they couldn't come to an agreement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they had had Google real time search, which was primarily Twitter,  but was obviously valuable for them as they were ramping up plus and other things as well.  And they wanted signals.  Yeah.  And then they couldn't make a deal on the fire hose.  Twitter asked for too much money.  Google got too grumpy, something.  Or there were some Google Plus strategy taxing.  That's quite possible that was part of it too.  And so that ended up with them getting rid of Google real time search completely,  which was a shame because that was actually a useful thing.  I don't know if you remember using that, but it was something quite helpful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Someone's going to act irrationally these days.  I'm going to bet it's Twitter over Google.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I think we can see some of this as pluses being the emphasize,  that there was definitely some strategy tax coming from there as well.  And certainly with this photos discussion and with the Twitter fire hose thing as well,  there was definitely a we should be using our thing, not their thing from the plus group.  Now, I suspect that wasn't what the search group wanted.  And that ended up being one of those internal infighting things because otherwise,  why would they have got rid of the real time search thing if the goal was to put  Google plus in the real time search?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So how do I get this new thing?  Do I search for, I see on search engine land, the story there was hashtag I.  You have to search on mobile apparently.  Oh, I can't, it doesn't work from desktop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What the, what the, what the report said was that it's mobile only at the moment.  And I wasn't even sure it was everywhere yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, let me try it on my, on my S6.  Hashtag I zombie.  Well, let me do hashtag David Letterman because that's trending right now  on Twitter.  So presumably there'd be a lot of content there.  David Letterman.  I hate having this.  So does it, do you have to use a hashtag if you're going to do this search to get the,  the carousel?  I've only seen examples.  So here we go.  Popular on Twitter.  Here's the carousel.  Yeah.  Okay.  Interesting.  So that's above normal, the normal search results.  Very high placement.  Well, yeah, well, it's the, you don't get much higher than that.  It's number one.  Yeah, but it's also a lot of real estate.  Yeah.  Look at this.  And, and you get a, a follow link.  Can you zoom in a little bit?  I think it's hard to read right now and we don't, my camera's too far away, but you get at the  bottom, you get a follow link that says more tweets for David Letterman.  So it's popular on Twitter and then you get this carousel and these are  tweets.  I mean, this is James and Carla Murray.  It's just somebody on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's weirdly curated.  I'm getting KRQE news 13.  Yeah, I'm getting that too.  Well, it's that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know why.  And here's some guy named Steve.  Who's it?  Who's an ass?  Says good riddance, David Letterman.  Please take, please take Jimmy Kimmel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you, what do you do?  What do you, Steve?  You go to funerals and you say good riddance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't that, that's what's wrong with Twitter.  Unfortunately, is, is everybody, it makes you feel like everything you have, every  little thought that goes through your head is important.  And everybody's, you know, like has to weigh in on everything, however trivial or silly or  irrelevant their thoughts are.  A lot of grown men crying this month, says Sarah.  Yeah, I agree.  Diane says, look what I found.  David Letterman's sponges from NBC Burbank in the eighties.  Oh, geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what?  And Steve's, Steve's, Steve's put Bible verses in his Twitter bio.  Nice and Christian of you, Steve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, good riddance.  You should have been dead a long ago.  Do one to others, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do one to others.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So yeah, I wonder, but I wonder, you know, and then if I do more tweets,  this is a link from Twitter, Google back to Twitter.  So, oh, okay.  So that's not really more Google search results.  And then you get the Google search results and the hashtag turns into the knowledge box  and all of that.  Wow.  Wait a minute.  Holy cow.  So you get CBS.  That's what you should get right, right under the tweets.  David Letterman's knowledge graph with Wikipedia stuff.  And then a link to Twitter, his Twitter account.  Boy, when you change tunes, Google, you go all the way.  Twitter is very important now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If I just search for David Letterman, I don't get the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But look how far down YouTube is.  This will give a lie to all the European, EU folks who say that they favor their own.  I mean, YouTube could have very reasonably been on top there.  Did you put the hashtag in to find this?  I did.  Hashtag David Letterman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just explain David Letterman won't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that's kind of a signal, I guess, that, yeah, I want to see tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Say if you search for the voice, because that was last night.  Last night, right?  Had a lot of Twitter stuff in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll give it a shot by doing the voice one word.  See if we see tweets.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I just did hashtag the voice.  No.  The hashtag didn't even do it, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nope.  Here we go.  Wait a minute.  So if I scroll down far enough, there's NBC, there's the knowledge graph,  here's episodes, YouTube, Facebook, and then tweets about the voice hashtag on Twitter.  But that brings you back to Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I suppose the thing is...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  So that's not a search result.  But they use hashtags for voting, so you'd have to look for whatever it is, save.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's why I used David Letterman, because that was a trending topic.  So I knew that that would...  If anything was going to work, that would work.  So you'd want to use the trending topics, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's interesting.  But it also implies that there is a strong time component,  because I imagine that would be higher last night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I, for one, wasn't crazy about the idea of including tweets and search results,  because tweets are kind of unpredictable.  Well, as we just saw.  Right.  So I feel like, I don't know, is that really what I want when I go searching?  But maybe, I mean...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think that...  I think that's not that prominent.  I think it's kind of like a side one box, maybe.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google researchers create amazing time lapses from public photos.  This is kind of an auto-awesome thing.  But not to photos uploaded to Google.  But, wow.  This is out in the public domain.  A team from Google and the University of Washington  have created...  It's a completely automated way to create time lapse videos.  They scour through Flickr and Picasa and other photo sharing sites.  They sort them by geographic location, looking for widely snapped landmarks.  Oh yeah, this was amazing.  Order the photos by date.  And then obviously you have to then modify the photos so that everything matches up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And...  If you...  Or the video below has a creeping, you know, ice there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Time lapse of mining from internet photos.  This is University of Washington.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's going to go through.  So all these people take pictures of glaciers, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they have to color correct and match.  And then you can actually see the glacier melting.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's an example of a result.  Shining the retreat of the weak sides...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  That's...  That's really neat.  I mean, it's not a good thing, but here's the building we just saw.  And you can see if when you see the timeline, all the images...  They're using.  Holy cow.  What computers can do.  It's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is interesting.  Because it's like the thing Microsoft did, but in time rather than in space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They did photosynths, which made a 360 out of multiple pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  From multiple people.  Whereas this is doing it across time.  That's a very nice piece of work.  I like that.  Thank you, science and math.  Yeah.  Also, was that an annual cycle of the glacier or was that the same time every year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was from 2010 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.  Glaciers like do melt and grow and shrink every year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  But over 10 years, I think that's a little more significant.  Yeah, you can see a bigger trend.  It's definitely a trend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because years ago when I was doing multimedia stuff,  one of the things we did was a thing called Erzisht,  which was an exhibition in a museum where we did time-lapse stuff.  But it was all satellite time-lapse stuff.  And that we had polar ice caps and ozone holes, things like that.  Interesting.  Long time series of those.  But it's great to see ground-based stuff.  Because it's obviously easier if you've got a satellite,  because it stays in the same place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You merge big data, the fact that we now store everything and it's all kind of accessible,  with computation, some pretty sophisticated computation.  It's very interesting what you can get.  It's not just the one.  It's not just having big data.  It's being able to parse it, to massage it, to get something out of it.  Maps was hacked again.  Oh, badly.  By jerky jerks.  I thought Google had fixed this.  Boy, this is shocking.  It's not like exactly peeing on an iPhone.  This happened yesterday.  Which had said we were going to change who we let change maps and so forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We lose the opportunity to get people to contribute to public knowledge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's trolls everywhere.  Geez Louise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But isn't this an indexing thing rather than a labeling thing, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, so it's using a different...  Ah, searching for a particular phrase.  So this is kind of Google bombing.  Yes.  Ah, it's the opposite.  So they aren't using the maps tool.  I misunderstood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because there was a weird thing that people did was search Google Maps for your Twitter handle  and see where it puts you.  Right.  And for mine it puts me with Tantech, apparently.  What a surprise.  Which is kind of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's probably accurate.  So wait a minute.  So you search maps for your Twitter handle.  And since Twitter is...  If you turn it on, and I do...  Telling, yeah, I'm right here.  So yeah, you are quite like to be accurate because you...  I tweet with the location turned on.  So it does.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But a lot of other people were finding very, very, very strange ones.  There was a...  Something...  Somebody was collecting them.  Let's try Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See where...  Where does Jeff live?  I'm just about to do that.  I'll do it for you, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is going to freak people out.  Watch out.  I'm counting down.  I just started the countdown clock to freak out in Germany.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What?  Freak out in Germany?  Why? What's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They pinpointed where I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of course, you tweeted exactly where you are.  Yeah, you already tweeted that.  Let's see where Jason is.  You're here, Jason.  Little off.  So this is the nearest...  Is this the nearest...  The most recent tweet in time or...  Is it based on all your tweets?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not quite sure what it's based on because...  You're not with Tantech now.  ...they were searching things and getting very strange results.  Like they were searching for Ed Miliband MP and getting...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, because you're not with Tantech in San Francisco at the moment.  So it's not your most recent.  But do you have geolocation turned off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I turn it on and off manually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's see where POTUS is.  Oh, he's at the White House.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, so maybe they have iterated this a bit.  You're just messed up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dr. Mom says she's...  Let's see.  Let's see.  Is it Dr. Mom on Twitter?  Dr. Mom?  That should be.  She said, no, that's a company called Dr. Mom Presentations.  That's not you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There an underscore in there somewhere?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I put the underscore.  Dr. Mom, what's your Twitter handle?  There's a little delay between when she hears this and when she could put that in.  Oh, well, she's in our chat room right now.  That's kind of interesting.  Is that related to the Google-Twitter relationship?  It is Dr. Mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not sure.  I think there was a little meme of this too.  We were searching for politicians on strange things, especially UK ones,  where they were turning up in very odd places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  POTUS, of course, is President Clinton's account.  Did you see Bill Clinton tweeting?  So Barack Obama tweets from at POTUS.  Oh, this is great.  Finally, after six years, they've given me my own Twitter account.  Bill Clinton, what does Clinton ask?  He says, so is it yours or does it pass on to the next owner?  To the house.  Does it go with the house?  I got a candidate in mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Obama comes back and says, it's been like, I don't know, but is somebody interested in the POTUS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because, of course, Clinton will be the first gentleman we've learned, by the way.  Oh, is that what it is?  Yeah.  Good question, Bill Clinton, the head of the POTUS.  The handle comes with the house.  No, anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He will be F. Ghotis.  I wonder if they've reserved that yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, how come POTUS was available?  Because Twitter has the ability to keep people off.  So they kept people off of that one, hoping someday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, F. Ghotis has been assigned.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  First guy.  That's the kind of dual purpose.  Could be first gentleman or first guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, among those walking into Letterman's finale, Jerry Seinfeld, Chris Rock, Steve Martin, Tina Fey,  Alec Baldwin, Jim Carrey, Peyton Manning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh my.  Oh my, oh my.  That's a pretty good lineup.  Yeah, it is.  Let's take a break.  When we come back, we got more.  We got Kevin Marks and the Birds.  Oh, good.  We got Jeff Jarvis and the Lettas.  And we got here in the Brickhouse, FreshBooks.  FreshBooks was a lifesaver for me when I was a freelancer still and sending invoices,  or not, truthfully not sending invoices out at the end of the month.  I couldn't bring myself to, oh, it was such a pain.  I had my invoices in Microsoft Word.  I wasn't using Excel.  It wasn't that sophisticated.  It's just a pain.  And every day, every month on the 30th, I'm supposed to make my invoices, send them off.  And the problem was, if you don't make your invoices, you don't get paid.  Fortunately, Amber MacArthur knew about FreshBooks.  This is when I was going to Toronto one week a month to do the show up there.  Had to bill Rogers not only for my visits, but for expenses for hotel and meals and airfare.  And that's just such a pain.  She told me about FreshBooks, what a lifesaver it was.  First of all, I immediately designed a good-looking invoice that could be emailed.  Made it easy for me to fill out.  And it just click, click, click, make an invoice.  It meant I got paid faster.  In fact, on average, FreshBooks users get paid five days faster.  Partly because the invoice has a pay me button, which lets your client use credit cards and  almost all the payment methods online.  And the truth is clients do want to pay you.  It's just a much pain in the butt for them to do the check as it is for you to send the invoice.  So make it easy for them.  Make it easy for you.  Get paid faster.  It's the greatest.  And incidentally, with the FreshBooks apps, you can capture and manage your expenses,  take pictures of the receipts, track your billable hours.  It's so cool.  And if you ever need help, they have the best support ever from their offices in Toronto.  The FreshBooks support rock stars.  Getting started is easy.  It's totally free for your first month.  No obligation.  You're going to love it.  Go to freshbooks.com slash twig.  Stop doing this manually.  Please do yourself a favor and come tax time.  Your accountant will appreciate it too because the reports are great.  Freshbooks.com slash twig.  And where they say, how'd you hear about us?  Just put T-W-I-G.

And thank you for making my life a lot easier for many, many years.  Self-diving cars hit the road.  Let's hope they don't hit pedestrians in Mountain View this summer.  Google said, we're going to put them out there.  The speed will be capped to 25 miles an hour.  And you know, it's going to be those little weird Tonka toy,  rounded little cars that Google showed that are,  that have no steering wheel, no accelerator, no brake, but that's illegal.  So Google is going to put temporary steering wheel,  brake and accelerator in there along with a human.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's like being the monkey on the first Sputnik.  It's very similar.  Looks like it barely fit like of the dog in that thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's no reason for me to be here.  Dum-de-dum-de-dum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dum-de-dum-de-dum.  I don't know.  See, if you were in a self-driving car, would you,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I feel like we talked about this stuff.  No, no, I'm just saying, a Google employee who has passed.  I know, that's a good gig.  You bring this sandwich, something to read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I'm working for Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What are you doing, son?  I'm sitting at a car park.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm working for Google.  What are you doing, son?  I'm sitting in a car all day.  Great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you think they design these because this is the right design for this car  or just to make people feel better?  Like Asimo, the Sony robot that looks like a small human.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's very chroma pixel.  That light bar on the side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you think when it hits somebody, it pulses red?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It looks up your name and...  I am sorry I've hit you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they'll be going through neighborhoods.  This is not going to be on highways.  They've been doing about 10,000 miles a week.  A million autonomous miles on the road.  10,000 autonomous miles a week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's effectively a self-driving golf cart, isn't it?  It looks like that.  I want a real car.  I like that.  But it's about the same speed and power as those.  And it may actually therefore be legal in those terms.  Maybe it is.  Look at it.  Maybe one of the reasons it's that shape.  So cute.  There's no human in that one.  It also looks less resistant to being crashed into by a random passer-by  than the previous Priuses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There have been, since September, four accidents.  But in every case, Google says they were low speed, under 10 miles an hour,  it was the human's fault, not the driver's fault.  Or the car's fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I just put in the rundown, Chris Sacca.  Sacca?  Sacca?  Sacca.  Sacca.  It's a cowboy shirt boy.  Sacca.  Is doing an AMA and periscope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I got lucky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had a friend, James Cham, who at the time was at Heslund.  So bored of this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who kind of referred me to the building.  Shouldn't it be sideways?  I mean, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could turn it sideways, I think.  But we asked Ben Rubin, the founder of Meerkat, why Meerkat, when it first came out,  forced you really to do portrait mode.  And he said, because that's native to the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  If you're watching it on the phone and listening to it, it makes sense.  It's one of those.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It only looks bad on a desktop.  When you go, why am I looking through a, especially with this particular shot where  Sacca is half cut off.  It's a two-shot where you can't get both the faces in.  It's a one and a half shot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They should lean in from opposite sides of the frame.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a four-way thing.  This is the eternal problem of TV, which is what shape should it be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Not that shape.  Somebody said, your eyes, you have two eyes.  It should be, turn that on its side so you can use your two eyes.  I think when you're looking at a phone, that makes perfect sense to me.  I don't have any problem with that.  But it doesn't work for this particular thing.  Or telling people.  Why should we care that Sacca is doing a periscope?  Is there some excitement?  Snakes and funerals.  You know what?  They did periscope the Spotify announcement this morning.  The Spotify announcement was not streamed publicly in New York.  Press were invited and Mashable, I think, or Fast Company, decided to periscope it.  Interesting, huh?  Spotify announced that they are going to do an updated app.  This is, you know what's happening here is everybody,  this is anything happened before the watch came, the Apple watch came out.  Everybody is trying to get their bit of the news cycle before Apple announces  its streaming music service in June at WWDC.  So Spotify is going to do video, which is a big, big deal.  And they are also going to feature podcasts, including ours.  Oh, so this show and all of the Twitch programs will be available,  audio and video on Spotify.  I'll be very interested.  That's really interesting.  So any cost to you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're hosting it?  Oh, yeah, no, no.  Any cost to us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know what the deal is.  We might get revenue.  I don't know.  I don't think so because they're not modifying.  They're not putting ads in it or anything.  They don't do ads, but nor are they taking our ads out, though.  So they also announced a new feature, which I really like.  If you're a runner, they'll automatically make a playlist that  matches your cadence as you run because the phone knows your...  Jesus, I'll get a funeral dirge.  Jeff, you're not running very fast.  He said it's like dancing.  You wouldn't dance to music that didn't match.  You wouldn't dance one way and have the music be different.  So that makes sense.  So yeah, we're thrilled to be part of that.  We knew about it because we had to provide them with content and make sure it worked and all that stuff.  So if you're a Spotify subscriber, good news.  Along with all the great music, you'll be able to listen to Twit or Twig, this show.  Twig, Twig, please Twig.  Russia threatens to ban Google and Twitter and Facebook over extremist content.  There is a move afoot, not just in Russia, look at Great Britain,  to mark some kinds of speech so threatening that it's going to be blocked.  I hope we don't get to that situation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sure too.  I mean, I agree.  But it's also, I think, just the nearest excuse to try to ban these things that threaten tyrants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's really the real reason.  They want to ban, Russia says, over extremist content, illegal activities.  It's that bloggers law that they passed.  The 2014 legislation requires popular bloggers in Russia to register their real identity with  the authorities.  Oy, oy, oy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They did that a while ago, right?  That was last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they're going to use that, though, to also regulate social media.  And of course, David Cameron, we talked about this last week, said in Great Britain,  I know, very depressing.  That, well, if you're, what was, it was actually such a depressing quote because it sounded like 1984.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't believe that he said that.  It was shocking.  He said, I've...  Let me see if I can find it.  Yeah, because I want it.  It's...  Up to now, we've said that as long as you obey the law, we won't bother you,  but that's got to change.  It was literally...  We've been a passively tolerant society for too long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For too long, we've been a passively tolerant society saying to our citizens,  as long as you obey the law, we'll leave you alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is this Putin or Cameron?  It's hard to tell.  This is David Cameron.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's David Cameron, which is shocking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This government will conclusively turn the page on this failed approach.  As the party of one nation, we will govern as one nation and bring our country together.  This sounds like nationalism to the extreme.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, one nation has a different nuance in the UK, but it does sound like...  Oh, it does?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  There's a notion of one nation, Toryism, which as opposed to divisions between rich and poor.  So that's what he's drawing on there.  But yeah, from the outside, it does sound like Einreich, which is...  Yeah, Einreich, Ein Volk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And if you say anything against us, well, that's your problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it is a really bad departure.  And the Open Rights Group in the UK is sort of ramping up,  working out how to deal with this and seeing how they can respond.  Because...  What is the reaction in the UK?  I am not in the UK, so only see what I see through social media.  But it was widely heralded as a shocking thing.  The other half of it is that it is also a shout out to the  Lord and Order wing of his party and the UKIP crowd as well.  That's the other piece of this.  And it is a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, to me it sounds like the UKIP rhetoric, the very highly nationalistic rhetoric.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  UKIP was very, very shocking for the Conservatives because they won the majority,  they won the most seats in the European Parliament last year.  Because the European Parliament is done by...  Then they got one what? One seat in the selection?  Partyless PR, whereas the election is done by First Basterd Post.  But they got one seat, yes, but they got five million votes or something.  They did affect a lot of results by moving votes around,  which is the way things work in the UK.  And it worked out in the Conservatives' favour mostly, I think,  because they managed to persuade some of their UKIP types to swing back to them,  rather than vote Labour.  But it was a shock result.  The Polsors had no idea what was going on because of all these different parties.  And their model of left-right didn't fit anymore.  But it was also this sort of...  UKIP has moved the rhetoric such that there is this very, very strong  anti-immigration tone, anti-immigration policy,  which sounds very un-British to me.  But then I've been away for a while, so it's hard for me to tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Feels like nationalism is growing.  And nationalism in Europe has always been a problem.  There's a history. There's a bad history.  Google wants to put buy buttons on its search result pages in the coming weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a slap at Amazon, isn't it?  Yeah, it's like a one-click.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Google doesn't say anything.  This is from the Wall Street Journal.  But the idea is that the buttons, when you do a search, again, on mobile,  this is mobile, will accompany sponsored search results or paid search results.  You might see, according to this article,  a shop on Google heading at the top of the page.  The button, though, will not drive you to Google,  but drive you to the sponsor, to the advertising retailer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which will still have Europe go berserk, because that's been the essence of the fight.  That is the essence of the antitrust, is Google and shopping.  So it's Google putting a bit of a poke in the eye.  No, I'm fine with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google won't show buy buttons when shoppers search on desktop computers.  Just...  Why not?  On mobile.  I think they figure it doesn't matter on desktop where they're really  facing the battle is in mobile search, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But if it's a user, I don't think that it's still the same user,  and treat me as a user appropriately across all platforms.  Yeah, what's good for the mobile is good for the game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, to some extent.  That's a good point.  And it's kind of an inconsistent user experience that way.  Right.  And I don't mind a buy button.  I mean, it's already an ad.  All it's doing is giving me a way to act upon the ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But here's what'll happen.  Google's promoting its advertisers.  Over.  Neutral listings of shopping services.  Yeah, it is.  It's called capitalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I don't think they're going to complain because this is in paid advertising,  not in search results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was the same problem as that Google's promoting as paid advertisers.  That's the essence of the suit of the investigation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where do you guys come down on?  What?  What?  I'm just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What?  Which suit is this?  I missed the press special lawsuit part there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's not a lawsuit.  There was proposed action by the EU.  Oh, no, wait a minute.  They investigated.  Oh, it was the antitrust.  It was the antitrust.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So yeah, they're going after them.  They'll charge them 6% of their revenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You didn't hear about that one?  That's a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Might help pay off Greece's debt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Probably would.  Internet.org and the EFF.  We talked last week about Zuckerberg.  You're going to Facebook on Tuesday.  You can ask Mark about this.  Internet.org is not just Facebook but others proposing a way to bring the internet  to under- undeveloped nations with the support of Facebook and others.  And it would give them kind of a special version of the internet.  Remember, Mark Zuckerberg addressed this notion that it wasn't net neutral.  EFF now has published an article.  Internet.org is not neutral, not secure.  That's a new argument.  And not the internet.  Internet.org offers people from developing countries free mobile access to selected websites  and has been pitched as a philanthropic initiative to connect two-thirds of the world  who don't yet have internet access.  The EFF says we agree that global digital divide should be closed,  but is this the right way to do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what is the right way to do it?  That's Zuckerberg's point is that you can't give away the whole internet for free.  That's just not going to work.  There are commercial interests here.  They opened it up to more than Facebook.  The original rumor was it was going to be Facebook for free.  Well, it was Facebook and Wikipedia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wikipedia was the fig leaf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wikipedia, that's right.  That's right.  Fig leaf, well done.  Get all that inaccurate Wikipedia stuff.  You see, you got Wikipedia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, if they did the WikiLeaks, then I'd be impressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And so they opened up to more.  And so what do you prefer?  I certainly get the argument.  I'm all in neutrality.  But does the fundamentalism go too far if it prevents something here?  And so I think that this is...  I'm not going to...  Don't worry, I'm not going to do it again.  But this is kind of the argument I had with Matthew Raygram.  Is when you say, well, I just don't like that.  Stop, take a deep breath and say, well, what are the terms that might make you like it?  What are the principles that you would expect Google to...  I mean, Facebook to accede to that would make this acceptable to bring free internet to a lot more people?  Are there any other circumstances in which you could imagine that happening?  That's the conversation we ought to have.  And I think it's something about Facebook being open to other services, which they're doing.  I don't know what the limitations are.  Is it too limited?  Is...  You know, let's get into the arguments.  Or are you just saying that no, Facebook cannot give away free internet access full stop?  Well, but get ready for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can debate that and maybe reasonable people can.  Get this.  But first, unreasonable, so I just want to be...  No, I'm on your side on that one.  But maybe you can make an argument, hey, better that than nothing.  But internet.org prevents encrypted HTTPS connections.  It's a proxy server.  Traffic must pass through.  And some devices like Android phones that have the technical ability to make encrypted  connections through the proxy server will be prevented from doing that.  Internet.org's Android app can automatically bring up the interstitial warning directly  on the phone by using the app to analyze links.  And more importantly, traffic must pass for phones...  Okay, the most inexpensive feature phones that can't run an Android app don't support  phone-based warnings that would say, hey, this is not a safe connection.  It's not encrypted.  For these phones, traffic must pass through internet.org's proxy unencrypted,  which means any information users send or receive from internet.org services  could be read by local police or national intelligence agencies.  What do you imagine the rationale for that is?  It's because these are low-end phones.  I'm not sure of what the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's also because it's very hard to proxy HTTPS because it's a point of HTTPS.  Right.  Yes.  In order to proxy, you have to man in the middle of it, whereas you can proxy HTTP  because it's in plain text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so, Kevin, you have to proxy this because that's the only way to make it free?  Because it's a free connection versus a paid connection?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's a rewriting proxy.  I think that's my understanding of it.  So it's doing...  Here's the deal.  Transforming the pages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, let me read this.  Compliance, blah, blah, blah, with the guide announcement,  will be reviewed by internet.org team, which make the site available.  So there's a compliance standard.  Guidelines.  Any website operator could submit their site for inclusion in internet.org,  provided it meets the guidelines.  Those guidelines are neutralized to subject matter, but do impose technical limitations,  intended to ensure the sites don't overly burden the carrier's network,  and that they'll work on inexpensive feature phones as well as modern smartphones.  So, the site will have to be then routed through the internet.org proxy server,  which allows the sites to be zero rated by, quote,  by participating mobile phone operators,  allows the automatic stripping out of content that violates the guidelines.  That includes images bigger than a megabyte, videos, VoIP calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why it has to go through the proxy so we can do that filtering.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Strip out, flash, Java applets, even JavaScript.  And inserts an interstitial warning if a user attempts to leave  internet.org's zero rated portion of the internet.  In other words, you've got this for free, but if you leave this,  you're going to be billed for data charges.  So you still have access, in some cases, to a broader internet,  but you'll get billed for that, whereas internet.org is free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  I mean, to some extent, do you remember the Google proxy?  Google.com slash TWT slash N.  That was an old one they wrote a few years back for when mobile browsers were really crap.  And it takes your web pages and strips them down into a nice lean version.  And it works.  It does a fairly good job of making sense of the pages,  but it will rewrite the HTML.  It will dump out the styling and the scripts.  It'll make smaller versions of the image, that sort of thing.  So it's a way of getting some kind of rendition of the page on a mobile connection.  And so internet.org is doing something similar to that.  And to some extent, the new Facebook Instant Pages thing is doing something similar to that.  It's reading the HTML and rendering it a different way.  You can argue this in different directions.  So you can say a rerunning proxy can be a useful thing,  because to some extent, readability is that some of the reader-type apps do that.  They would make a more stripped down version of the page that's easier for you to make sense of.  But it's stripping out things that these sending sites put there for a reason.  But in another sense, that is kind of the spirit of the web.  The spirit of the web is you declare a bunch of stuff,  and then the browser makes a choice about which part of it to render to you.  So doing that as an answer is one way of doing it.  But obviously, if you're still downloading the whole thing and then deciding which bits to display,  you're still creating a lot of data transition to do that.  So they're basically doing that in between and sending something different through.  And the question there is, how does that affect the web in between?  So there is some nuance here, because there's obviously value.  You don't want to outlaw sites that transform other sites.  That would be a bad idea.  So it's like this Google proxy or some of the indie web tools  that we have to do feed reading off HTML page, things like that.  But there is a challenge when this is being sold as this is the internet to people  who don't have much of an alternative.  It's like, oh, Facebook works great, but everything else works  in some slightly damaged way is a bit problematic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  EFF concludes, while we applaud Facebook's efforts to encourage more websites to provide  support for low end feature phones by stripping out heavy content,  that would be the right way to do it, by the way, is to put the burden on the site  to offer a special version.  We would like to see internet.org try harder to achieve its very worthy objective of connecting  the remaining two thirds of the world to the internet.  We have confidence it would be possible to provide a limited free internet access service  that is secure.  Oh, OK.  So here's the principles.  Doesn't rely on Facebook and its partners to maintain a central list of approved sites.  That's the set.  You know, there's two things.  It's insecure, but also Facebook's a gatekeeper.  Until then, internet.org will not be living up to its promise or its name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, this is the case where it won't.  What the hell?  Oh, Kevin's been eaten.  Whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And notice the birds have gone quiet as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  My God, there's a predator down there.  Quick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I think that what does internet.org have an independent board?  I don't know.  But that's why it's one of long argued.  We have discussions about Google and cases where, you know, they knock off a shopping site  because they think it's in spam and the shopping site argues there ought to be a jury of peers,  an independent jury.  Same here.  Then fine.  They have a board that makes independent decisions based on principles.  What is it that makes free internet for the world okay and acceptable?  Which, you know, they're starting to answer that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How do you feel good about it?  How do you like dubstep?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apparently no idea.  That was quite a transition.  I mean, these two topics are so close to each other.  I'm just changing the subject.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm changing the subject.  Google.  Kine kind dubstep.  No, I'm just moving on.  But what is that?  What is that dubstep?  So you know who Skrillex is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, because the Skrillex side of me, that's okay.  But yeah, yeah, I was put that into.  It's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love it.  This is this Google, the new Google store, store.google.com where they sell Nexus phones  and Nexus tablets now has a limited edition Skrillex live case.  Ask Jake about it.  Jake will know.  It's got special companion wallpaper.  The view from Skrillex is satellite.  I don't know what the Skrillex has his own satellite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's pretty clear.  It has NFC built into the case.  So the case, the phone knows which case it has on.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then yes, each Skrillex live case is in it.  I got to get this.  I'm not a Skrillex fan.  My son is 40 bucks.  Each Skrillex live case is individually numbered and comes with built in smarts.  A customizable shortcut button on the back there is that's that button gives you one  touch access to your favorite stuff.  It's like a built in pressy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Remember pressy that kickstarter?  Yeah.  You could set it to launch the phone's camera, open any of your apps,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  of course go to Skrillex's site, which I bet you is the default.  When they do a Yo-Yo Ma case, that's when I'm going to buy one.  This is for the Nexus 5, 6, Galaxy S5, Samsung Galaxy S6.  Ah, and Note 4.  I'm going to order it right away.  Okay.  And I'll demonstrate it when it comes in.  Wait a minute.  They're three different companies.  Space Shield, Circuit Bay and Planet.  Or those are the styles.  Yeah.  Those are the styles.  Yeah.  Which one should I...  What's Circuit Bay?  Ooh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I saw it because Google retweeted the Google Store Twitter account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which one, Jaren, which one should I get?  Skrillex Live, Space Shield, Circuit Bay or Planet?  Let's see Planet.  You think my son will have more respect for me if I get one of these cases?  I'm not sure.  I'm leaning towards the Space Shield.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, he'll say Skrillex is so overdone.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Skrillex is like 2010.  Come on, Dad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  He is kind of, isn't he?  Yeah.  Who does he like now?  I can't remember.  All right.  Deadmau5 is also gone.  Yeah, ask Andrew.  Who's the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's in Florence at the moment.  Is he?  How nice for him.  He's responding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, and here's an article from Wired Magazine on how it works.  Google and Skrillex?  I like the question.  I think that's editorial.  Why now?  Oh, man, these takeovers.  Okay, here.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, the new thing they do with takeovers is they move the close button around.  So you have to like really look at the ad to figure out where you get rid of it.  Oh, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's so awful.  They hide it.  Move it around.  We got rid of pop-ups.  We got rid of pop-ups in their back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It keeps you guessing for at least like three seconds so that they can register you as a view, right?  Exactly.  That's exactly what it is.  Where's the X?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a new game.  Oh, Skrillex designed these himself.  What a surprise.  His real name is Sonny Moore.  Phone cases are supposed to be fun, you know.  Baron of Bangarang.  I really like the really crazy phone cases that are out right now.  You see the...  Is he British?  I don't know where he's from.  No, he's from LA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He did like 20 designs.  His favorite was quote,  Like Windows 95.  It was a super vaporware one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's not even speaking...  Making sense.  He is a DJ.  Is he a DJ or what is he?  Yes, he's a DJ and producer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He makes music.  He's a producer and mixer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I had this really crazy dream when I was really young.  I was in my house.  And in my room, this is the dream.  And I wake up in the dream and I look out my window  and this blue light flies into my backyard.  And moments later, these two aliens open the door to my room.  The dumbening of America.  Covering my face under covers and watching them.  And just looking at them like so frightened and so frightened.  It was so real.  And then they just sort of like walked around me  and like stared at me and then left the room.  Why do you think this is a dream?  That's what I'm saying.  It's a real dream though.  It's a real dream.  This is so horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google hopes this is a model for other artists and creators.  More edition partners coming.  Okay.  Okay.  Somebody at Google, probably Larry Page really likes Skrillex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There has been a rumor floating around for a few months now.  And Android police has kind of been all over it  about customizable cases.  So I don't know if this ties into that.  And one of the rumors actually is using Google Maps  to create totally custom cases for Nexus devices and stuff.  So, you know, who knows?  Maybe this is something that we're going to hear more about at I.O.  Kind of a broadening of this.  This is like a little teaser.  And then we get to I.O.  You remember what we just did with Skrillex?  Now you can do it with Google Maps or whatever.  How would you use what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you do?  Put on a you put on different cases based on your mood.  Yes.  I can't figure out how.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Buy more cases.  Apparently.  Yeah, I don't get it.  This is I put I kick started.  I put some money in this one.  I'm a backer.  I pledged 109 bucks for the next pack.  Didn't we talk about this on the show?  The first truly modular smartphone case.  Yeah, we did.  Yeah.  See all the little bits and pieces.  I'll be trailing bits of my phone case as I walk around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Prepare you for Project Aura when you get that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of just a warm up.  Yep.  So what did I get?  One hundred nine bucks.  Oh, here it is.  Special edition magenta next packet, four modules.  So the modules you could have an SD card reader, an amplified speaker, a flashlight, more power.  Temperature and humidity sensor, hot keys, USB flash.  See, this is better than Skrillex.  There's an air quality sensor.  A breathalyzer.  A laser.  There's a backup drive and a dummy slot.  Mind like I'll get two dummy slots.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess they're funded.  Look at this.  They wanted 50,000.  They got a two hundred thousand dollars and still have nine days to go.  Next pack.  Thanks to schmucks like you.  Thanks to schmucks like, you know, I every once in a while like to go back  and look at all the Kickstarter projects.  I know.  That I've backed and never got anything from.  Just a reminder of how what a true sucker I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like, ah, ah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So did you see the nine dollar computer one chip?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Is that a Kickstarter?  That's a Kickstarter.  It's called clip, I think.  Chip.  Chip.  That's it.  I just put the link in the.  Yeah, we tried to get them up, but they were for last week for the new screensavers,  but they were they were busy.  So it's a nine dollar computer.  They've raised one and a half million dollars, nine dollars at a time.  Twenty eight thousand eight hundred forty eight backers.  So it's like a Raspberry Pi, right?  Chip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  First nine dollar computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a cheaper, cheaper Raspberry Pi VGA or HDMI.  Chip does computer things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Save your documents to chips on board storage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Surf the web over Wi-Fi.  Play games.  With a Bluetooth controller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But wait, if a nine dollar computer could do this, what do we need Project Internet.org for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It makes chip portable.  Take chip.  Just take the connectivity.  And you can use chip connectivity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a tough part, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You might have noticed this is kind of weird.  It's like they're going to make the money on the cable, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We built your projects and we're so excited to see what you can do with a nine dollar computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kickstarter, we need your help.  We're going to have them on this week.  This week, they're going to be on this week.  So Jerry, just confirm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Watch Saturday.  Make the nine dollar computer a reality and back chip on Kickstarter today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They still have 16 days to go.  It's not too late.  I doubt there's any nine dollar pledges left.  No, those are gone.  Well, yep, there are.  There's still some.  You get a make your very own nine dollar computer,  includes a chip and a composite cable for maximum bare bones enjoyment.  That's cool.  Yeah, we'll find out what's going on with that.

We thank them so much for their support of this week in Google.  Weird.  We talked about this on security now on yesterday.  Mobile operators in Europe are saying we're going to block online advertising.  Kind of ad block for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Talk about net unneutral.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, it's the examples they give are a little scary of, you know,  free games that are ad supported and they just take the ad right out.  You didn't really want that, did you?  So what's the story here?  This is again, this is Europe has come to stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a report.  It's sources.  Who knows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although the Financial Times says one European wireless carrier has already  installed the blocking software and its data centers and plans to turn it on  before the end of the year.  It comes from an Israeli startup called Shine.  I mean, the details are pretty good here.  Tens of millions of mobile subscribers around the world will be opting into ad block  by the end of the year, said the chief marketing officer of Shine.  If this scales, it could have a devastating impact on the online advertising industry.  And he says that with a smile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And every site supported by advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's what worries me a little bit.  And it wouldn't affect us, but the video that they show, let me see if I can find this  technology, shows them just stripping the ads out of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is like the next toxic version of the Internet of all problem of putting  proxies in the middle.  Right.  Yeah, it is.  It is.  And some of the carriers have done this, did this kind of thing.  I think they've done ad injection rather than ad stripping.  Yeah, they put ads in.  Yeah.  The Canadian, one of the Canadian ones did, didn't they?  As I recall.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, there was one long ago, there was one 10 years ago.  I think I mentioned the show before that we fought it, kind of asked along with other  big publishers and won in the United States.  You couldn't take over our page and do something to it with a browser add-on.  Shine says eliminating intrusive ads is a consumer right, even if it undermines the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  business model of online publishers that rely on advertising.  Online advertising is out of control and it's polluting the user experience.  How ridiculous?  Well, I'm not completely unsympathetic.  It can be annoying, can it?  We were just talking about pop-ups and the Xs and the Xs.  Well, the equivalent would be if your cable system cut out the ads for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You didn't have to fast forward.  Well, that's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We had that, it was called TiVo.  You got to do it though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but they had a version that would actually find the ads and skip them and then they'd  be like, no, you're going to be shut down if you do that.  So then they had the 30 second skip forward button and they took that out too.  Yeah.  Let's see if I can find this.  They actually have to fast forward them.  Website.  They actually have to fast forward them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Website because it's kind of wild.  Well, it also brings down the size.  Look at this.  This is also from Shine.  A five minute session of a gaming app with ads, five megabytes of data downloaded,  50 kilobytes without the ad.  So maybe that's why the carriers-  Oh, that's why they're doing it.  They want to make data.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They'll do lower resolution versions of photos next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ad blocking is a right says the CMO, Roy Carthy.  Why just shows you.  I mean, I can't disagree with them, but at the same time I worry about,  well, there's lots of free games that are ad supported.  Those are going to go away.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, it is a problem.  I mean, but it ties back to the instant articles thing as well,  which I know we talked about at some length last week.  Yeah.  That they're saying, you know, the actual argument is,  wow, you publishers have really made a mess of your websites.  Let us clean that up for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Under American net neutrality-  This is being done by somebody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  Sorry, I lost that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In the U.S. under net neutrality,  you're interfering with bits upon their appointed rounds and it's on neutral.  Interesting.  It depends where you're doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the question.  And the problem is, you know, if I'm doing it client side,  if I'm running an ad blocking thing in my browser,  that basically sits there and gives me nothing every time it fetches  things on the blacklist of advertisers, which is basically how most of them work.  That is not affecting net neutrality directly,  but it is affecting the revenue model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, but if it happens on the proxy side, then it's prejudicial to certain kinds of bits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it depends where you're putting the proxy.  I potentially want to put things through proxy sometimes.  Using that Google GWT proxy that I linked earlier will do that.  It'll take ads out of a lot of things because it's stripping out JavaScript and large images.  And flash.  You know, so if you put like, if I put, you know,  think of some large ad infested site, TechCrunch.  If I put TechCrunch through the Google proxy, oh, all the ads have gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's you doing that.  That's different than a carrier doing it.  And of course, the suspicion is that the carrier may at some point say,  if you would like TechCrunch, if you would like your ads to go through to the viewers,  we could arrange that for a small fee.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But this is a lot of these issues, you know, go around in circles like this.  You know, part of the reason that Instant Articles is attractive  is that it is stripping out a lot of this, like,  cruft that makes these websites take up a gig of RAM in your browser.  Right.  Right.  And so that is, and we go through these cycles in technology as well.  So when we went to mobile websites, the MDOT version of the website was effectively doing that.  You were building a version of the website that didn't bring the browser to its knees  because the mobile phones weren't capable of doing it.  And so that was a way to get out from under the weight of Conway's law that makes your  website turn into a mirror of your org chart and have anybody able to inject, you know,  extra revenue, allegedly revenue generating stuff into it, which is the problem that the  publishers have.  And so Instant Articles is another iteration of that, where Facebook is saying, OK,  we're going to write a special browser that is really fast and responsive because it's ignoring  the cruft that your business department is making you put in, but will give you a little  loophole to put in some certain kinds of ads that fit in with our worldview here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is because, you know, this exists because users hate all the junky ads.  But at the same time, users don't trust what's going on because it's in the long run not in  your interest for a variety of reasons.  Gardner in our chat room is telling me that Shine, the Israeli company, is  financed by three, the UK mobile carrier.  Oh, geez.  So there you have it.  Now we know.  But isn't that the temptation if you're an ISP?  And boy, this one looks good because you can always say to your customers, see what a great  experiencing we're giving you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, it is an issue between, you know, with these sites that have had this sort of  cruft creep, that is a problem.  Yeah.  So the advertisers brought this on themselves and so did sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They brought it on themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the sites that, it's the sites more than the advertisers, but the advertisers, you know,  I've tried very hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Advertisers push.  They keep pushing.  It's up to the sites to say, no, I want to protect my experience, the experience of my readers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I talked to somebody recently on a certain site that's doing membership stuff, and they  said that the conversion rate, going after people who had ad blockers and saying, would  you like to join, actually got a very high conversion rate.  Would you like to join?  You want to support the site.  Oh.  Feeling guilty about blocking the ads.  If you're blocking the ads.  So instead I'll give you money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Give us a buck a month.  It's like Amanda Palmer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's people who came up to her and said, I ripped your CD.  I'm sorry.  Here's 10 bucks.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's the thing is, does, do they give those subscribers of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Catbot!  Get that!  Catbot!

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm a pop-up cat.  That's a cat pop-up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was a cat takeover of Kevin's video feed.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If they're targeting the ad block people, do they then serve a version that doesn't  got ads in, or do they still have to keep running their own ad blocker to keep the ads out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's an interesting question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a quid pro quo that I would be happier with, which is like, oh yeah, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're happy for the first five sites, but how many sites a day do you visit?  Do you want to pay each of them a buck a month?  No.  No.  There's a reason why there's ad-supported media.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a reason there's ad-supported media, but you can amortize it over different numbers of users.  That's the point.  You don't have to get a fraction of a penny for every viewer.  You could get some money from some of the viewers and that would work out.  That's the thing that we have learned from Kickstarter and Patreon.  Also, we should learn from...  You get by with some people paying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We could also learn from Google that plain text ads don't bother people as much.  Right.  Maybe they don't work as well.  And relevant ads don't bother people as much as well.  Oculus has sent out invites.  I think we have one somewhere lying around for a special event, June 11th.  We're trying to decide, should we cover this?  What's it going to be?  Facebook owns the Oculus Rift.  That's a VR helmet.  Is this going to be the announcement of an actual product?  Or what?  Step into the Rift is what the invite says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So at the same time, Google moved the head of search design to Cardboard.  So there's a VR AR war.  It's waking up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you think...  I bet you...  I actually predicted this on Sunday.  We'll see at Google I.O.  We'll see some AR.  I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sure you will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not VR, but AR.  So I'm curious what's going on here.  Maybe you could...  Maybe you can pre-order this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just to be sure here, is Cardboard just AR or is it also VR?  Cardboard's VR only.  Cardboard's VR.  VR.  VR only.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google does have some AR technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We also might see more VR then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I personally am not sold on the VR thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I'm just saying we might see more of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google's going to do VR too.  Sure.  Cardboard.  Yeah, there's investment in Cardboard.  As an OS.  They shipped Cardboard at the last Google I.O.  And of course, I wish we could see sales numbers for the Galaxy Gear VR,  but that's Galaxy...  You know, Samsung's selling cheap.  It's only a couple hundred bucks because it's really just a plastic holder  for your smartphone.  Your Galaxy S5, your Note...  All right, so it's a Note 4 and then there's an S6 one.  Glass is not AR either, I should point out.  A glass has...  It's looked like glass might be an augmented reality,  but it's not.  It's just a little screen over your eyebrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why is that not augmented reality?  It's augmented reality super...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's superimposed.  It's a heads-up display.  It's augmenting reality.  I guess it depends what you mean by AR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah, the direction.  When it gives you the directions and say, turn left up there...  That's no different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's just putting your phone interface over your watch.  I know, but it's still AR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, Kevin, is it AR?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Is which AR?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Glass.  Not really.  I mean, it is, you know, it's AR in the same way that having a phone is AR,  but it's not doing overlays.  But you've seen, we've all seen, maybe we haven't,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but the browser that you can run on your phone where you...  It uses the camera and it superimposes on top of the picture  information about the businesses on the street.  That's to me what I think of as augmented reality,  whereas your...  And glasses would be even better.  You're looking at something and more information is provided  you or a user interface or something like that.  I feel like glasses...  And that was kind of a disappointment for me.  I was hoping it was augmented reality, but as soon as we saw it,  it was just really a little screen over your eyebrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, there are definitional arguments about it,  but that's...  Right.  If the information that's coming up is location aware  and has some sense of what you're looking at,  even if it isn't trying to do an actual realistic overlay,  that's still potentially useful.  That's like the Terminator view where it puts up little captions on things.  You can imagine that as a form of AR that is more practical than  I'm going to replace other people's faces with masks and things  or those kinds of ideas.  But you could do superimposed name tags on people.  I... Yeah.  Which is allegedly something Google built and then backed away from.  Oh, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Facial recognition to identity, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But even more than that, what I'd love to know,  reputation score, email address, whatever, that would be great.  So Google had that and thought, oh crap.  Creepy line.  Creepy line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Creepy line.  What was it, Kevin?  The Creepy and Croft Creepy line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Creepy and Croft is a different problem, but yeah.  That's a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know, I just like the alliteration, that's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Letter to the President from Google, Apple and others.  Dear President Obama, I went out yesterday.  Washington Post obtained the letter.  We, the undersigned, represent a wide variety of civil society organizations  dedicated to protecting civil liberties, human rights,  and innovation online as well as technology companies.  Trade associations and security and policy experts.  We are writing today to respond to recent statements by some administration  officials regarding deployment of strong encryption technology  in the devices and services offered by the U.S. technology industry.  We urge you, it says in bold, to reject any proposal that U.S. companies  deliberately weaken security of their products.  We request the White House instead focus on developing policies that will promote  rather than undermine the wide adoption of strong encryption technology.  Such policies will in turn help to promote and protect cyber security,  economic growth, and human rights both here and abroad.  It's my guess that these signatories have some weight with, particularly Google and Apple,  ACLUs in here, the Bill of Rights Defense Committee,  the Anti-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, the Center for Democracy and Technology.  It's quite a little demand progress.  EFF, of course, Epic, of course, the Free Software Foundation.  They actually got Richard Stallman to sign this, I guess.  The Gnome Foundation, Adobe, Apple, Automatic, that's Matt Mullenweg's WordPress company,  Cisco, Coinbase, Cloudfair, Flare, Dropbox, Evernote,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Facebook.  It's a good list of people who know what they're talking about with software security.  Yeah, I would say so. Google, Hewlett-Packard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I say God bless Edward Snowden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Micros. Yeah, this whole conversation wouldn't even be going on.  Hal Abelson at MIT, Jacob Applebaum from the Tor Project, Steve Belevin, one of the great  security... These are the top security researchers in the world,  Whitfield Diffie of the Diffie-Hellman algorithm.  These are big names. You don't get bigger names than this.  And they all agree. Seems like it's a no-brainer.  It's a heck of a list.  And then on the other side, you have the NSA, Bruce Schneier.  Yeah. Phil Zimmerman, creator of PGP.  So anyway, that letter went to the president yesterday.  See what happens.  Anything else you fellas?  Oh, I know what I wanted to talk about.  I want to talk about Micropub, since we've got Kevin Marks on here.  Kevin's doing the work of the angels, I think, with IndieWeb.  He's one of many, of course. It's not all him.  But IndieWebCamp.com, you can find out more about the IndieWeb.  And he posed a question on his Twitter last week for you, Jeff.  We were talking on the show last week about how medium  incents people like you to put stuff there because of their interface.  Because it's such a pleasure to write.  And Kevin, you were saying, well, if that's all you want,  we can give you that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that was the thing. There was an IndieWebCamp in Dusseldorf last week  because we had been doing them all over different places.  And Aaron Parecki built a medium-alike editor for Micropub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me show, Jeff. What's cool about this is now I'm using Known.  We talked to Ben and Aaron on a show a while, like maybe a year ago now,  with Known.com.  And so because Known supports something called Micropub,  which is a protocol that uses, does it use OAuth? I think it does.  That allows me to authenticate with a Micropub endpoint, in this case IndieWeb.  I can just merely enter in my properly configured website,  and I'm going to do that, at this Quills site.  And once I authenticate, and you see I can authenticate via Twitter, Google+, GitHub,  that's because I've set that up, or by phone.  But let's just do Google+. I usually use the phone. It's really cool.  It'll send me, I can do that right now, it'll send me a text message with a four-digit code.  And when I enter in that four-digit code, it'll authenticate, as it has.  And now I'm in Quill. But this is what Kevin wanted to show you,  is the editor, the Quill editor. Let me launch this.  So you have to click on the editor thing at the bottom.  Yeah, I did. But it's slow. Hold on.  Let's do it again.  Waiting. There we go. This looks a little like Medium, doesn't it, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. It looks a lot like Medium,  because it's based on a JavaScript, a resource clone of the Medium editor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So mark a word. Watch this. You're going to love this.  There it is. Bold, italic. This is a link.  It automatically formats it all. H1, H2.  No, H3. That's it.  I can also do it as code, if I'm doing a code editor.  This is really nice.  Can I drag images into it, too? That's one thing Medium does nicely.  And then, well, here, let me...  Posting. I'll just write a little posting from Quill.  We're demoing this on Twig, and I guess I should really make that a URL, shouldn't I?  So we'll do a little link here, too.  http://twig.tv. Check that, and then publish it.  And clicking publish now will send a request to your MicroPub endpoint.  So I'm doing this from my browser and from Quill.  And it's posted. And now, if I go to my website, wow, magically, this is my known site.  That post is there. Which is really cool.  Aaron has also written a tool called Own Your Gram that will actually take things like this,  which I posted on Instagram, and copy it to my blog.  So the idea of all of this, and the reason I'm strongly encouraging Jeff to consider  other choices is... And I realized that, Jeff, your whole time you've been writing,  your stuff has been in somebody else's hands.  Well, not my blog.  Much of the time.  No, but even if you've been writing for magazines and newspapers,  you're used to the notion that stuff you write goes somewhere else.  And I'm such a... I think Kevin will support me on this idea, that the idea of IndieWeb is that  it'd be great if you had your own website where all your stuff lived, but was syndicated elsewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In addition to distributing it anywhere else. That's the model I want for media.  But Medium doesn't do that.  Put it on Facebook. I'm saying the Facebook brand.  Media in general.  Yeah.  Media. Put it on Facebook, put it on Twitter, put it on Instagram, put it everywhere. Fine.  But have your own home version of it, which is what these guys do, which is wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Quill did a nice job, by the way, of embedding your tweet, Kevin.  I wasn't sure what would happen if I pasted the embed code in it and knew exactly what to do,  which is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no, it's actually... It also does image insertion.  It does?  Okay.  Which it does by data URLs, which is a wonderful bit of HTML voodoo,  which means it can inject images directly into the HTML it's sending over, which is kind of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The other thing that's cool about this is you can comment on somebody else's blog,  if you have the URL, and if its blog is an IndieWeb, you know, Micropub supporting blog,  it will... There's some nice stuff. It's syndication of comments as well as content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the comment stuff that isn't Micropub, that's web mention?  Web mention, okay.  So the point of the IndieWeb stuff is we've been building a lot of very,  very focused, very small protocols for doing these different pieces.  So Micropub uses Indie, which is the authorization thing you saw to say,  to prove that it's your site.  And it lets you post to your site.  Which means we can build a variety of tools that will let us post to the sites, including  this new Quill editor, including own your Gram and so on.  But... And also mobile clients and whatever.  It's a sort of general posting API.  Yes, so I affect...  It's based on your thoughts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I... Because of course I can use Nones' own, you know, mobile bookmark to post to it.  But this is another little IndieWeb project called MobilePub that gives...  So this is an app that's on my Android device that when I post, will post to my blog,  which is kind of wild.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But again, that's using the Micropub API and posting it from an app.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I can even like... This is what I really like.  So you want to do Facebook-style likes.  If I have the URL that I'm liking, I could paste that in here.  And this will actually syndicate to that blog, put a like up there, which is fantastic.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that's... And so that's the sort of...  The point is that we're building enough of these protocols that we can start  plugging them together and have this thing work.  Yeah.  And there was another thing I wanted to show you, which is a new one.  Oh, good.  If you go to silo.pub.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  silo.pub.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the point of this is this is a Micropub bridge that goes to certain hosted sites.  Ah.  So Tumblr, WordPress, and Blogger, a hosted blogging site.  This is WordPress.com, not WordPress.org.  And the problem is you can't necessarily install code on those.  So what this does is it gives you a way to add Micropub to these hosted sites.  Because they have an API.  Because they have an API and you have to do a little bit of work.  There's a little bit of setup work you have to do to put the right headers into the templates.  But it walks you through how to do that as well.  Which means you can then use these Micropub clients with these hosted services as well.  So you can use those editors or Oniogram and so on with those.  So it's another sort of extension of this model.  And again, this was one of these ideas where we were chatting about it in the IOC channel.  And I said, oh, it would be nice if we could do this.  And then Ryan said, well, this is how you could do this.  And then Carl said, oh, I'll go and do that then and build this.  That's nice.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love it.  If you know how to code, the world is your oyster.  Stay up with web technologies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Somebody is asking, how about medium integration for this?  Yeah.  Media doesn't have an API.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But when you cut and paste from text, it's very good.  It picks up all the links.  It picks up everything.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it has, if you click on the thing on the right hand of medium,  there is an import post from URL thing or something like that.  And you can then give it the URL of the indie web post.  It'll do a reasonable job of pulling it in.  Oh, that's good.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's pretty damn impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it would be nice to have a full API as opposed to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It would be nice for us to be able to do it directly.  Yeah.  But that's also be nice.  Medium did announce this week that they're going to start letting you have  medium host on your own domain, which is a step in the right direction.  That's good.  They've only done it for a couple of big publishers so far.  They said they're going to let you do that.  So that's encouraging.  But they're still hosting it and you don't get much control over markup and things.  So that would be a step towards the indie web idea.  And it was good to let people have control of their own domains.  But the challenge is you wouldn't be able to plug in all these pieces  because they haven't got the hooks for us to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is currently, silly, difficult for most people to do this.  You have to do all sorts of little fiddly stuff.  And I guess it always will be a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We've tried to work out ways to make it simpler.  So yeah, the known is obviously one very great simplification because it gives you  a standalone thing you can install or a hosted service that will let you get these indie web  features.  We're also encouraging people to integrate them into other systems.  There's a series of WordPress plugins.  So if you've got self-hosted WordPress, you can install a set of indie web plugins  and get these features.  So I think that might suit you, Jeff.  I think your Buzz Machine is self-hosted, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, I went to a meeting today at the New York Times from Pointer and the Night Foundation  on annotation.  Companies like Genius there.  And annotation is a fascinating structure of wanting to leave comments on top of things  in a way that's open and having multiple conversations around the same thing.  And then I argued too that embedding content is like a reverse annotation because where  was this embedded?  What does that tell you about the content?  A huge new layer of possibilities there that'll be fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  I mean, that's one of the things.  That's another set of bits and pieces we've been doing in the indie website to try and  think about this.  So the idea of web mentions can work for annotations.  There's an example.  See if I can find the link for this.  There's...  Karthik built this thing called Marginalia.  I'll put it in the IRC.  And this does that thing where it uses the frag mention idea, which was the thing I discussed  last time with your annotation, which you put the piece you're linking to in the URL  after the hash.  So it says, I'm linking to this piece of text.  So if you scroll down this post, you'll see little green things at the end of the paragraph.  Little speech bubbles.  They're a little subtle.  And if you click them, it'll pop out the comment in line.  And anybody could post that.  And that is a post that...  Wow.  Did you come on?  I don't see any.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, oh yeah, there's not green bubbles.  There's bubbles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's...  If you go to frag mention, scroll down there.  Just past frag mention, there's one at the bottom of that paragraph.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, you were...  You were...  You were...  I see.  Yeah.  At today's meeting, Kevin, you were quoted frag mention.  People loved the name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, good.  Yeah, so you can see...  So you see he's got this little speech bubble there.  If you click that, it's exposing the comment.  But the comment is actually on somebody else's site that is linking back to this.  Wow, that's amazing.  It's using the frag mention to say, I'm targeting this paragraph.  And it's using a web mention to say, I commented on this paragraph.  Wow.  So we've basically built the components to do this.  So far, Kartik has built this marginalia script to do this on his site.  I'm not sure many other people have deployed this yet.  But again, we have this set of building blocks that says,  I want to refer to a piece of this page.  That's the frag mention part.  I want to let you know when I've mentioned you.  That's the web mention part.  And then by combining those two, he's able to build something like this  that works very nicely.  It's...  So it's like the...  Again, it's like the medium comments that let you comment on the paragraph.  Except that it doesn't all have to be in a daily event on one site.  It's a distributed way of doing that same idea.  More syndication.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  So the point of this is that by spending...  The point of the IndieWeb stuff is to think about how we can do this  so that it doesn't have to be hosted in one database.  But we need to define a protocol that will work between two sites.  And because they're independent implementers,  they try and keep the protocol small and not overcomplicate them.  But then you can start changing together to do these interesting kinds of things.  And that...  Then potentially you can build these bridges that go to the silos  or the silos can start implementing these protocols as well.  There's nothing to stop a medium from adding these...  Adding the markup we need to do this  or making this stuff something that will work across site.  They're quite capable of doing that.  The question is whether they want to give people that power or not.  And that's the trade-off.  But if they've already got a mechanism for accepting comments,  arbitrary comments on paragraphs and people,  it's just another way of them being posted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does this open any security issues?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Your site is in control of what it posts.  So the comments it's posting there,  it has paused the HTML of the commenting page and decided which piece to post.  It's not just injecting an iframe with the whole page in,  it's constructing the piece that is the comment.  Yeah.  So it's...  There's a potential injection issue if that script isn't sanitizing,  but that's no more than any other...  That's up to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and that happens everywhere.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We fairly well know how to deal with taking HTML from one page  and putting it on another page now.  That's something that...  Yes, you can get it wrong, but we know how to sanitize that stuff now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you want to know more about this, indiewebcamp.com  And go to an indiewebcamp if you have an inclination, if you're intrigued.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I should also give a plug for the Homebrew website club,  which is down there at the bottom of that page.  They're held every other Wednesday,  and there's actually Homebrew website clubs today in New York, San Francisco, and Portland.  The New York one is starting soon, I think.  6.30. Click on the New York one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh-oh, rush. I gotta go.  I gotta go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where is the New York one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you click on that one, there's a link to New York somewhere in there.  It says where it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  At Schnipper's Quality Kitchen. Get down.  And 8th and 41st.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right at the corner.  Schnipper's.  Is that near you?  Yes, the New York Times building.  Drop in.  Which is next door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff, drop by. I think when we finish this show, you can drop in.  I think it starts at 7.30, I think, but there may be...  I think there's... Go back a page. There's a time and date on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It says 10.30, but I bet you it's adjusting for my time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no. That's good to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  New York City.  Quiet writing hour, 6.30 to 7.30, and the meeting begins at 7.30.  Quiet writing hour?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Drop in, Jeff. They'd love to see you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just go and write. Open medium, and they'll see what happens.  They're writing.  Well, they're saying, get out of here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the quiet writing hour, this was a thing that Andy thought of, which was,  we set this thing for 6.30 so you could get there after work,  but some people could get there a bit earlier,  and then they could work on something they were working on before we have the public phase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like this.  Schnipper's has good burgers.  Oh, good. You got dinner and IndieWeb.  I really like the idea, and I know it seems kind of counter-cultural.  It's a little counter-cultural.  It's an antidote to the highly corporatized commercial web.  A web. It's made of people. I like the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's also thinking, it's tackling a lot of the same issues we've talked about,  about how do you give access to the web to more people?  How do you make it easy for them to publish?  But with an answer that isn't, oh, everyone should use Facebook,  or everyone should use Google+, or whatever.  It's how can we do this in such a way that means that  you're not required to log into a large company's server?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When you see these $9 computers and Raspberry Pis  that are completely capable of running a good quality web server,  it just seems like we could have a much more human-scaled fragmented web,  and fragmented in the best possible way instead of a monolithic web, a Facebook web.  This is the antidote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You still need to root to the servers, which can be tricky.  But yeah.  Figure out a way.  The other thing is that cloud servers aren't expensive these days either,  so being able to put this up on...  That's probably better, I suppose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Indeed. I think Google just lowered its prices by 30%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Every house should have a DMZ'd Ethernet port in the wall  that you could plug your Raspberry Pi server into.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  You just get V6 working. That would be nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Then gosh, your refrigerator could be your web server.  Everything could be your web server.  When you're on, I always want to give a plug for this.  People glaze over and think, oh, I don't know what this is.  Can I just use Facebook?  That's fine. Go ahead and just use Facebook.  But there are some few proud hippies out there who want to kind of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's also that just because you're using Facebook doesn't mean we can't communicate.  That's the other part of this.  Part of this is that the idea of Pulsey publishing on your own site, Share Elsewhere,  is that we can write it on our site and then send the link over to Facebook,  and then you can see it on Facebook.  But the other subtle thing is the stuff that has been set up with Bridgy,  which translates the Facebook comments into web mentions.  So those can come back to your site as well.  So you're able to move this stuff back and forth between the different silos.  Now that gets harder when the silos change things.  Facebook has just made it a lot harder for us to do that by changing the API recently.  I'm not sure that was necessarily intentional.  I think that's more that they didn't think about this use case  when they think they changed their API.  They're reacting to the perception people have that Facebook is too public,  and they want to give people more control over what happens to it.  But what that ends up doing is making it harder for us to take the bits that actually are public  and make sense of them.  So that's been a bit of a shame.  That was one of the most fascinating things, watching people sign up for Known.  Because part of what Known does is when you sign up for the site,  is it asks you how do you want to connect it to your social media?  What do you want to publish out?  I'll give you buttons on the back of your post to let you share out which ones go where.  And a lot of people are really, really wary of clicking that connect to Facebook button.  Because in their mind, publishing on the web is kind of public,  but publishing on Facebook is really public.  Because it goes straight to the people who actually know you.  So they were much more concerned about connecting to Facebook  than they were with sending a website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's so funny since you have more control over Facebook than you do over the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, this is my site.  But you don't, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Conceptually you don't.  In your head, you don't understand quite what...  This is, you know, when you watch ordinary people use this,  rather than those of us who actually understand ACLs and things.  In their head, if I post something to Facebook,  it's going to go straight to my mom,  and my mom is going to complain about it.  There's a mental model of how that works.  And that's probably true because my mom on Facebook follows me and my sisters,  and that's about it.  So anything I post on there, she will see.  And my sons have a more nuanced attitude to this,  and they understand the stuff.  So I don't see everything they post on Facebook.  But that is the mental model is, Facebook is this place  that is a social performance to a set of people you already know,  whereas the web is a place where you can talk in a less focused way.  And that's a really interesting reversal.  And I think that's part of the trying to adjust that  is what was the thinking behind the new Facebook API changes.  But in practice, we end up with the worst of both worlds.  We have a set of people who don't want to connect to Facebook  because it could be scary,  and then they break the API so we can't do the things  we were doing with it as well.  So it has been a step backwards in that respect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now I understand why Ben and Aaron Joe are slow  to include some of the features we asked for.  They're busy fighting Facebook's API changes every few months.  I'm on my own site.  I hosted it with known.com, but I could host this.  In fact, I was hosting it locally for a while.  I just decided I didn't want to pay for a server.  I can write a post here.  And then because I've already connected Twitter and Facebook  and LinkedIn, I can automatically,  and if it were an image, I could add Flickr and so forth.  And now when I publish this, it goes to all of them,  but stays on my website.  And you could do long articles too.  This is just a short status update.  So I think that's very cool.  And I like it that it's centered on my own site  as opposed to those sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it just showed up in the IndieWeb IRC channel as well.  Why is that?  Because you said IndieWeb.  The hashtag, wow.  And the IRC channel looks for...  That's hysterical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, let's take a break.  Come back.  Tips, numbers, tools.  Let me show you all that stuff at the back of the book.  Let me tell you, this is a great solution for everybody  who's doing a mobile web app, a mobile site or a mobile app  to add payment APIs to that.  Unbelievable.  So simple, just a few lines of code,  and all of a sudden you're accepting Bitcoin or Apple Pay  or PayPal or credit cards securely, easily.  Braintree is amazing.  No wonder Uber uses them, Airbnb uses them,  Lyft uses them, Hotel Tonight uses them,  everybody, Living Social uses them.  GitHub started in the very early days  and continues to use Braintree as their payments API.  Look at the new v.0 SDK.  It works with all your favorite languages.  It works easily, simply.  They've got great customer service, simple integration.  You'll be ready to receive payments instantly.  Try the sandbox if you don't believe me  and you can literally see how it would look with your code.  And Braintree's continuous support plus fast payouts  means you'll be ready.  They'll be with your company from the first dollar  to the billionth dollar.  Braintree, turning companies into unicorns all over the place.  They really are amazing.  I want you to check it out.  It's easy to do.  Just go to braintreepayments.com  I want to say Twig.  Yeah, braintreepayments.com  Twig.  And a little incentive to make it easy for you.  Your first $50,000 in transactions will be fee free.  How do you like that?  braintreepayments.com  slash Twig, PayPal, Apple Pay, Bitcoin, Venmo, credit cards,  all with one simple integration.  It's a great solution.  If you haven't tried it, try it today.  braintreepayments.com slash Twig.  You're watching This Week in Google with Jeff Jarvis  the City University of New York, the author of Geeks Bearing Gifts.  What Would Google Do in Public Parts?  He blogs at buzzmachine.com  Kevin Marks is also here.  He's a legend in the micro formats and standards business.  Nobody better.  KevinMarks.com  Kevin, you've shown us a bunch of stuff.  I think you're off the hook if you don't want to,  if you don't have a tool or a tip or anything.  But if you've got something,  we already showed you.  In fact, I see your links, silo.pub and Quill.  We're done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want your bird sound maker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll show you that.  Yeah, go ahead, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me unmute myself.  There's another little app that a friend of mine has built  and I've helped him build some of it, which is it's called Will Someone.  So it's ask.wilsomeone.com

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  ask.will.someone

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, ask, no second dot, ask.wilsomeone.com

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, got it.  Will someone sign in with Google?  That's the first one.  I better sign in, right?  All right.  Yes, I will sign in with Google.  All right.  Allow.  Yes, this is good.  Here we go.  Now, Will Someone, my name.  What is this?  What am I going to do here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's basically a to-do list,  except that a task manager,  except that you can give the tasks to other people to do for you as well.  So you can ask people to help you.  Love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, wash my windows.  Okay, that's the task.  I'm going to add that.  So I didn't have any tasks.  So now I have one.  Okay.  I can add details.  I can add a due date.  And now I can ask somebody to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So if you hit the ask button,  you can share it out publicly,  or you can click on the Will Someone,  and it becomes a global task that appears on the front page of the site.  That's hysterical.  So it's a really simple idea,  but this is Chris Hewer who's had this idea  that the challenges with task managers,  everyone has their own,  but it's nice sometimes to ask for help too.  That's the thinking behind.  So this is fairly new.  It's been out a couple of weeks,  but try it out.  Let me know what you think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Will.  Ask.wilsomeone.com  Right?  Ask.wilsomeone.com  That's cool.  Is this another IndieWebby kind of thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I helped build it so it has some IndieWeb features in it.  So it does have the markup so that you can subscribe to it  with IndieWeb feed readers and things.  But it's not directly IndieWeb.  It's more of a...  Oh, that's cool.  It's a silo app, but it's IndieWeb friendly.  That's the phrase we use.  I get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That first picture page I was looking at,  now I understand that's my profile.  Yes, that's your profile.  Yeah, so I have to customize that a little bit with pictures and so forth.  Yeah.  Jeff, you got a number for me?  Jeff, you got a number for us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, I do.  I found it interesting.  There was a DNAindia.com said there was a survey of 12,000 Indian students in grades 8 to 12.  90% of them use Facebook.  No surprise.  Coming in at number two, Google Plus was 65%.  Number three, Twitter at 44%.  So just, you know, maybe Google Plus is popular in ways  that people make fun of us for it.  Maybe it's a little more popular elsewhere in the world.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just like Orkut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think that was they did migrate the Orkut users to Google Plus, didn't they?  Ah, there you go.  So that may be where that is.  Is that it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I don't think there's anything wrong with Google Plus functionality-wise.  It's fantastic.  Not at all.  It's wonderful.  It's wonderful.  I wish it would...  I don't know.  It could be more IndieWeb friendly.  I see Michael Hogan there.  It's a naked one.  Yeah, make it more...  You know what?  Do you think that was a mistake that they never gave us a right API?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they gave us one, but it was weird.  You could write to it, but it was like uploading photos from your phone.  They would disappear in a place that only you could see.  And then they were very strict about not giving access to it.  So I think that was a reaction to what happened with Buzz,  which people used it as a place to syndicate to.  So they were trying to avoid that and make it more native.  But I'm not sure that was completely successful.  And it would be nice if there was a way of doing it more generally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This article just came in.  No, it didn't just come in.  This is an old article.  Never mind.  It is not a new article.  Let me show you Google Tone.  We didn't use it once.  I should have used it.  Let me use it real quickly for Ask Someone.  So if anybody has Tone installed,  will...  I mean, ask.wilsomeone.com.  I'm on the page now.  I'm going to press the Tone button,  and you will hear a sound.  A rather pleasant sound that if you have  this Google Tone extension installed in Chrome,  and the speakers turned up and your microphone turned on,  will bring you...  I know, it's funny, isn't it?  Bring you to ask.wilsomeone.com.  Your browser just goes there.  They say this was something just cobbled together  in an hour or two as a joke,  kind of as a lark, as a laugh.  Kevin, what do you think that Tone...  How is that Tone...  It doesn't seem like it would have enough  in there to communicate like a full URL.  How's that working?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it sounds like it might do.  I mean, the question is,  is there more than one Tone going there?  But it's probably URL shortening equivalent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, they do a URL shortening.  Of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My guess is they're sending something  that is like a lookup in their database.  Right.  It sounded like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you give them a URL as I just did,  ask.wilsomeone.com.  It shortens it to, you know, g-o-o-dot-t-o-slash-13419,  and then modulates it somehow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Then it sends 13419 or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that would be easy, wouldn't it?  Do you think these will get longer  as more and more people use Tone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It'll be like the Twitter URL shortens as well.  They're now often longer than some URLs.  24 characters after the T.co now.  The Tone will go on for hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hours.  It's nice and short right now.  That is funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is like I've got j.mp slash k goes to my blog  because I cut it on the first day they set up the URL shortening.  Perfect.  But now the URLs are very long,  so you can't do that anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Perfect.  We have our own shortener,  twt.to so we can use nice short ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you can pick your own namespace out of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the use case that Google gives,  there really isn't any use case.  Actually, we're the best use case.  You're listening to a podcast and you turn it up.  That's actually a good use case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's actually a good use case.  Well, it's kind of a horrible way to do it, but yeah.  It'll be nicer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a good use case for people who actually want to use it.  For everyone else.  It's just annoying.  It's annoying.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We used something a few years ago called chirp.io  that did the same thing for one show.  But the use case Google gives is you're in a...  This is a terrible use case.  You're in an office situation  and you want to hand off some websites to your colleagues.  Just what you want.  Somebody in the office playing out loud, holding up a speaker.  That's not a good idea.  Anyway.  My friends, we have come to the end.  The conclusion of this silly little thing.  I'm so glad you could be here, Kevin.  Always a pleasure and always fun.  Always a pleasure, sir.  Always.  And I...  We'll get to you guys.  He's fighting the good fight for Indie Web.  Now you got Quill in your quiver.  Mr. Jeff Jarvis, you don't have to use that medium anymore.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, you will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was sitting next to two medium people this morning.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because that's the other thing medium brings to the table is  a community.  Yes.  What you really want is a way to syndicate from your posse.  You're with known blog to medium.  And for that, medium has to cooperate by giving us an API.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think we're going to embed stuff around the web  more and more and more.  And the architecture Kevin is working on  enables you to write once and embed multiple times.  That's going to be beneficial.  I like that idea.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's...  Part of the challenge is what do you embed?  How do you just decide what the preview is?  If I write a tweet length post that there's a comment on yours,  then it's straightforward to work out what to embed.  But if I write a full blog post that happens to cite you,  then you've got to work out how you construct a preview for that.  So that's something that we're experimenting with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. I'm pissed.  What?  I'm pissed.  What?  I just see the story on Buzzfeed.  Oh, now I'm pissed. My light's off.  I'm double pissed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what? We went an entire hour and 51 minutes without a Jeff Jarvis rant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't get invited to.  Buzzfeed reports that the camp, Google Sicilian Davos, returns for a second year.  The secretive conference known as the camp.  Oh, sounds good.  Held as a luxurious golf resort in Sicily.  And we were not invited.  Who gets invited to that?  Not us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. Look at that beautiful, beautiful bay there.  Business leaders, tech luminaries, and celebrities.  That's who gets invited.  We are none of the above.  It's the Illuminati or the Digerati.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Elon Musk, Travis Kalanick,  Evan Spiegel, John Doerr, Lloyd Blankfein.  Yeah, all the usual subjects.  I guess we're not up there.  I don't want to talk to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't want to be with them.  I would never join a club that would have me as a member.  No, I'd rather be at IOWN.  Well, you're going to be.  Next week, we will be back doing Twig at its usual time,  which is 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern Time,  2000 UTC on Wednesdays at live.twit.tv.  Jeff will be in studio because the following day is Google IOWN.  And you're going to go back and go to the keynote,  but we'll broadcast the keynote.  Google does plan to stream it.  You, of course, can watch Google stream.  But if you want our commentary on top of Google stream,  and Gina Trippani and I, and Aaron Newcomb,  and from all about Android, Ron, what's his name?  Richard's.  We'll just call him Ron.  Just Ronnie will join us.  And Jason Howell, you're going to go.  Mike Elgin's going to go.  They're both going down to the IOWN.  Good.  So special coverage begins 930 a.m. Pacific.  1230 p.m. Eastern Time, 1630 UTC at live.twit.tv.  That is a week from tomorrow.  So that's May 28th for our special Google IOWN coverage.  I think it's going to be a good Google IOWN.  I'm excited.  I think it is, too.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's interesting that we don't really know a whole lot about it this time.  I feel like at about this point of the year leading into Google IOWN week,  we feel like we are pretty confident that we know a lot of what Google's going to talk about.  We really don't this time around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So here's the question.  Next week, will we say, wow, that was a big surprise?  Or will we say, oh, it was an OK IOWN?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think there's some risk because last year was kind of an OK IOWN.  There's nothing really exciting.  I think it's going to be kind of like that.  But you never know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We know we're going to get a new version of Android, but we don't know what it'll be.  We got a new one last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everybody gets a Google refrigerator to take home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I imagine there will be some more VR-ish stuff.  I think that is quite a likely thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  VR and I hope to see some AR, too, because I prefer.  I'm more excited about AR.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, gentlemen.  Thank you all for being here.  We'll see you next week on This Week in Google.
