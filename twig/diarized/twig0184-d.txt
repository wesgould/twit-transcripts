Starting left to right with Gina Trippani of SmarterWear.org,  the author of Think Up, and the recipient soon of a gold-plated Mac Mini.  I'm so excited.  Gold-plating awesome.  Thank you, Leo.  Yeah, we decided because Gina, you know, we want to see the perfection that is Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My CPU. It's too busy on this machine.  We've decided that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And we did this with Ani Anaco.  If we give you a dedicated Mac Mini that's got nothing else going on,  you can't use it for anything else.  It's just a Skype machine.  That seems to be better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I believe you.  And I look forward to testing that theory with my brand new Mac Mini.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Were you just doing the Skype hesitation with your voice or did that actually happen?  I believe.  Also with us, Jeff Jarvis at home because son Jake has his 21st coming up.  That's right.  That's exciting.  Big deal.  Yeah.  I see behind you a whiteboard easel.  Do you generate ideas on that thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I love whiteboards.  I adore whiteboards.  When I worked at Cotty Nast, I insisted that they do whiteboard wallpaper on the whole wall.  It was a new thing.  I absolutely love it.  That's how I take notes and that's how I work with my students.  I have the world's worst handwriting, so I don't recognize it five minutes later, but that's how I do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They have paint now, whiteboard paint.  We were actually thinking of painting the offices that way.  It's great.  It's actually kind of expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's expensive, but make sure the wall is super smooth.  If you get the good whiteboard paint, yeah.  It's a neat idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Check how you paint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got to do three or four layers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You want to take a recovery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's Kevin.  This week in home decorating.  Kevin Burdey, also an expert.  No, no, no, it's good.  We kind of got the life hacker, how to make my life better crew in here.  The Perd Man is the author of what's the latest Android?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The complete Android guide and I also blog at IT world quite often.  Oh cool.  Both those things.  Or go to theperdman.com.  Yeah, he could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Where you can read his year 2012 in review.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm one of those reticent personal bloggers, but you know, I'm already professionally everywhere  else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I hate it.  But we got two former life hackers here.  I think that's good.  The first thing we go to is the ins and outs of whiteboard paint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Getting things done on your wall.  I think just having done the post-it test, we're so excited.  Yeah.  Can you do blackboard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there's blackboard paint as well.  That's interesting.  Yeah, a friend of mine painted an entire wall with a calendar and uses chalk to kind of  do it once.  Yeah, it's really nice.  That's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here's the sad thing for me.  Let's see if I do this right.  Actually, I have, there we go, a stack of whiteboards.  Oh, look at that.  With an easel.  Years ago when I started EW, IKEA had the best wool whiteboards and I loved them.  I had them on an easel and would use them all the time.  I love whiteboards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now you make me want to buy 10 or 11.  Just put them everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff prefers to buy new whiteboards to erasing them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, there always comes a day somebody uses a magic marker.  And then you've got to get a new one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the ghosting is the issue.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's talk about the news.  Should we talk antitrust?  Is that exciting?  Google stock?  That's exciting if you hold any.  French people.  French people.  Always fun.  Always exciting.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Always exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know what excites me the most.  And I'm sure you talked about it on all about Android yesterday.  But now it sounds like March 15th will be the day that Samsung will announce the Galaxy  S4.  That is exciting.  5-inch, 4.99-inch screen, an octo processor, 8-way processor, although all 8 processors  are never engaged at once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Surely they have to get OctoMom to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And she might do a better commercial than Paul Rudd and that other guy.  Oh yeah, okay.  Let's talk about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because the Super Bowl had a very strange long ad for Samsung that didn't actually  really...  They had LeBron James.  They had Paul Rudd.  They had the other guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jonah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jonah Hill.  Jonah Hill.  I was confused with Zach Galifianakis.  Jonah Hill.  And who was the guy, the ad agency guy?  Because he looked really familiar too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's in Breaking Bad?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think.  Was he?  I can't...  Oh yeah, he was the lawyer in Breaking Bad.  That's where I saw him before.  And did they ever even show...  They showed a Galaxy Note.  Briefly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can draw on someone's face.  Peripherally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That was the feature.  Yeah.  Better call Saul.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we talked about this on All About Android last night.  It was a weird commercial.  The whole commercial was like these guys sitting around a table trying to come up with a concept  for a commercial, which just seemed sort of lazy to me.  I would have liked to have seen more about what the device could do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was only bested by, or worsted by, the Blackberry ad, which said, the new Blackberry  does so many things, we couldn't show you what it can do, so we're just going to show  you what it can't do.  It was a terrible ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Poor Blackberry.  The pride of Canada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Samsung, it is a little bit more surprising because Samsung has done such good ads up  to now.  I guess I could play this.  We won't get yanked from YouTube for playing an ad for an Android device.  How about those?  Oh, this is last year's Super Bowl.  Actually, you know what?  I should show you last year's Super Bowl ad, which was even just as incomprehensible.  Maybe this is a Samsung tradition.  Remember the one they said, the thing called love?  Remember that ad?  At least this was fun.  You're not getting my audio, are you?  I'm getting that dang.  I have this year's ad, if you want to see.  Let's see.  Watch a little bit of it.  Okay.  It was long.  It seemed longer than long.  It was long.  Four million dollars for half a minute, so that's like an eight million or 12 million  dollar ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I started it 55 seconds in.  Good.  If it will play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, Paul Rudd and the other guy, Jonah Hill, show up on a bench and they say, you're both,  they were both called for this ad and then they fight with each other.  Then they go in and talk to Saul.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we just use Seth in a diaper.  I don't wear a diaper.  You would wear a diaper for Samsung though, right?  I would wear a diaper for Samsung.  What else she got?  Crowdsourcing.  Huh?  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Put out on the internet that you want people to send you ideas, then you don't have to  think of an idea.  That might be good for this spot.  Seth Rogen, not Jonah Hill.  We can send them into the galaxy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're all the same to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The galaxy.  You know what this is?  This is the problem of actors and women.  Oh, let us add a little bit.  We're funny.  I bet that's what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I thought this was funny, but I don't know if it was an ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have LeBron James.  Hi, Bron.  You in on Samsung?  Yeah, totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe I do a cameo on the tablet or something.  That's awesome.  I work with LeBron James.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, that's incredible.  You get LeBron James.  You got the next big thing.  You don't even need anybody else.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We don't.  We don't.  Don't need anyone else.  I got it.  I'm having breakfast with LeBron's kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't get it.  So that was the whole ad, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It never was.  There was nothing more.  There was not like, hey, we make a great phone.  Hey, I guess that's cocky.  That's when you know, hey, we got it made.  We don't have to tell anybody what we do.  We just have to say Samsung and they go, yeah, love it, Paul Rudd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The main thing they want to get across is that marketing is soulless.  Well, they succeeded.  Right.  And also buy a phone.  Well, you know, there's a piece up on the rundown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Arguing that Apple is the iPhone is the is the model T.  And it was the first one.  Everybody loved having it.  We're all standardized.  Any color you want, as long as it's black or white.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly. All of that.  Right.  So you will do what Mr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Ford wants you to do.  And the reason that Samsung is doing so well is because it in the ecosystem of Android is offering lots of choices.  And we like choices.  I agree with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's not even I don't even know if that's a insightful observation.  Insightful observation.  It's yes, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, the argument further is the model T faded away.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And Ford continued on with great success by eventually offering choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, from from an Android point of view, it's kind of interesting that the Galaxy brand is probably the most popular Android handset brand right now.  At this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's not even that.  At this point, when you talk about smartphones, number one is Apple.  Number two is Samsung, not not Android.  Samsung, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Samsung or Samsung Galaxy.  Yeah.  Benedict Evans did a blog post just looking at Google Trends during the Super Bowl.  And the word Samsung and Samsung Galaxy were about had about the same kind of traffic.  Oh, interesting.  Each other and more than Android.  I mean, I don't even know that they said the word Android.  They don't say the word Android in any of these commercials.  A couple of them will say, you know, with Google built in, right, which kind of implies Android.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is actually an issue for Google.  I mean, I think on the one hand, Google says we don't care because we don't make money on Android.  We want everybody just to get use Google stuff and we make money on that, including on the issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like, do they want to build an Android brand?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was a necessarily there's a meme or a thought piece going around a little while ago that Samsung was somehow strategizing to actually  step away from Android and pull an Amazon and do Tyson or do Tyson.  Yeah.  Or do Tyson or fork away from Android and do their own build.  And I think the thought at the time was, well, what's stopping them?  You know, they've got the they've got the kind of I'd never buy one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, it just keeps on occurring to me that I want the official build because I get the latest version.  I don't get the bloatware.  I don't get the junk mail of mobile.  Right.  And that's why I have this thing.  And if they went farther away, I'd never get one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. But they're hitting different retail channels than than you're going.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's true. I'm weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Chris, Chris, Chris, John in the chat room does point out Samsung, in fact, does sell a Windows phone, the achieve.  Mm hmm.  Which we conveniently forget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, I was thinking back today with Dell going private and some might say I have a role in that story.  Oh, you do.  Oh, I want to hear about that.  Well, no, no. Back in the days of Dell.  Hell, hell. Oh, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That was the beginning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But, you know, I wish that Dell were in a position now to make really great Chromebooks and really great Android devices.  Right.  And as somebody pointed out, they had what I forget the name of it again.  What was the what was their five inch?  What was their nose streak streak, which, you know, I liked in form.  But and somebody else pointed out, Android wasn't ready yet.  It wasn't tablet ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And the streak was clunky, thick and heavy.  It was not anywhere near.  But the whole point of it was it was the biggest screen.  It was like an unbelievable size.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So they were they were ahead on the idea, but they were too far ahead.  And it was five inch.  It's funny. It seems so big at the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let me look it up.  Streak seven is a seven inch tablet.  Two officially.  And then they had the streak five, which is five inches.  And this is five and a half.  The note to five and a half.  Yeah, I think it was five.  The Dell streak was five and they had a seven inch tablet, both of which nobody cared about.  And they're now gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was a story last week that more than 60 percent of Dell employees were using BlackBerry's and implying that therefore none of them ever used their own Dell's own phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I remember seeing one at South by Southwest two years ago and thinking that thing's huge.  Yeah, I like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Did you use a streak?  No, I never used it, but I said, well, I think I want this.  Yeah.  Well, what you wanted was Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What you wanted was a mature Android that could compete with the iPhone and a big screen was what you like.  And I think there's no question now with looking at the success of the note that people do want bigger screens.  There's even a lot of rumor that Apple is going to do a bigger screen.  iPhone plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Plus sized iPhone.  Plus sized iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, after like switching to the Galaxy Nexus, which isn't even one of the bigger phones.  I mean, I pick up the iPhone now.  It just seems tiny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It seems antiquated a little bit, too, does it not?  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It feels like a toy.  It feels small and and and toyish.  I don't know why.  It's just something about just the interface to it.  It's so interesting, like that it changed your perspective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or toyish.  Toyish, really?  No, but it just shows it's not toyish, obviously.  And a lot of people use it.  It's still the number one phone.  But I think what it shows, though, is how quickly styles change.  And you can't rest on your laurels in this business by any means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I don't mean to put it down.  I developed for iOS.  I love iOS.  Whatever.  I just like the rounded corners and the bright icons and the grid of icons.  It's just a different feeling.  It's when you look back at it after you're on a big Android phone with widgets and live  wallpapers and all those things.  It just feels really different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're going to take a break.  Let's come back and do the change log.  Gina, you can get your costume on.  OK.  And we can prepare the trumpets.  The change log coming up in just a moment.  But first, I want to tell you about something new from Citrix.  Our friends at Citrix are always adding new products, new capabilities that tie in, which  is nice to tie in with the old.  And this is something I'm very excited about.  I first saw before Citrix acquired them and then started playing with it and fell in love  with it.  It's called Podio, P-O-D-I-O dot com.  The hardest thing about Podio is to explain what it does.  Right now, if you're in business, the way you work together, you collaborate with both  your colleagues and your clients is via email and sharing documents maybe on Google Docs.  It gets very complicated to manage products, very complicated to keep track of what people  are up to.  The solution, which by the way does not eliminate all the ways you're doing this stuff, is called  Podio.  It unifies it all together so you can escape email overload and document chaos.  It's a collaborative work platform.  But the key here is it's free to try.  And I want you to get in there and try it right.  I'll even go through this process for you.  By the way, notice you can log in with Google or Facebook or Microsoft Live or go to a meeting  or just enter your work email.  So I'm on leo at twit.tv.  I think I already have an account at that address.  So it's going to say, oh, hi, Leo.  Welcome back.  But what I want you to do is see now what happens here is it says, OK, you're a Google user.  What do you want to connect?  Google Docs, Google Calendar, Google Contacts?  Yeah.  Let's connect all that stuff.  That's good.  So it's now connected all my Google stuff into this.  I can set up things like project management.  Now, here's my I set up a whole workflow in here.  There's an activity streams kind of like an in-house Twitter.  It's like the ultimate social network that combines.  In fact, Jeff and Gina, you're you're you're in here.  Yeah, look at that.  I would hope so.  Yeah.  So so so this is really a cool way.  And you saw how quickly that all kind of got set up.  We've got in fact, we're going to start using an editorial advisor board here on a podium  that we will advise you of so that people in our chat room who are regulars is by invitation  are going to be able to come in here and we can talk about ideas we have going forward.  I want you to go in, sign up for free and set up your first workspace.  The workspace kind of will guide you.  It's so free form that will guide you in a in a form so that you can start using it right away.  My contact list is in here.  Don't show this, though, because I want to make sure you know, we'll just you could just assume that my contact list is in here.  It's mostly just emails.  I don't think it's going to my calendar is in here.  It's just fantastic.  I want you to try Podio.  If you work with a team, whether that's a company, a nonprofit, a a theater group, a club, whatever it is,  this is the new way to do it.  And it is better than anything I've seen before.  So complete.  And of course, it works with your Google Docs.  You don't have to abandon your current way of working.  It just enhances it.  We have an employee network that we use it for so we can communicate.  It's just fantastic.  Sarah Lane has already posted in here saying everybody's going to get a raise.  So that's good news.  P.O.T.I.O.Podio.com.  Get in there.  Set up your first workspace right now.  It's absolutely free to do so.  Lisa's using it.  Lisa really liked it when she saw it.  She said, we can definitely use this.  We've been looking for a workflow solution that lets us manage all the big projects we've got going on.  It's a really great solution.  All right.  We're getting Gina back.  She had to she had to step out to get on her glittery costume for the big change log.  Can you not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you're not getting my video.  Here's the reveal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're not going to see it.  Oh, no.  Go ahead. Start the video.  This is why we're getting you a new gold plated computer, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here we go.  Here we go.  That should help.  Oh, that's the wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're on the wrong camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Camera.  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't worry.  That's a good camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just face us.  Just look over here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As we get the trumpets ready.  That should be better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right.  Sorry about that.  There we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, there we go.  By the way, what is this sweatshirt?  What does that say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pratt Pratt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did you go to Pratt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't go to Pratt, but my wife worked at Pratt.  Great design school.  It's an art institute in Brooklyn.  Really one of the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ladies and gentlemen, break out the trumpets.  It's time for the Google change log.  Especially like the tapping at the end there.  It never gets old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The trumpets never get old.  I just love them.  So Google straps on one of those crazy backpack 360 degree cameras on a bunch of Googlers  and sent them down into the Grand Canyon.  So the result is street view within the Grand Canyon.  There is some amazing imagery here.  You can just go to maps.google.com slash Grand Canyon.  And it's just it's incredible.  It's incredible.  This really made me want to get off my butt and actually go tour the Grand Canyon myself.  So check that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's all new.  An anxiety.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  It made me say, oh, good.  I don't have to ride a donkey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess it depends where you're coming from.  You don't have to go to the Grand Canyon or you really want to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We each have our own point of view on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, these are some beautiful images.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's really I've been there and I've actually walked down some of these trails and it actually  is a better way to go.  Just do it in the browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Make Googlers do all that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let them do the work.  So cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Also new in Google Maps ski resorts, new run and lift maps, 38 new run and lift maps for  some of the most popular mountains in the U.S.  In Canada, including Squaw Valley, Big Sky, O'Kimo.  So you can check those out as well.  There's some images there and Google Plus showing some of the route, the run map.  So you can kind of see that the best way to get down the hill is right there in Google Maps.  Google Play Music for Android has updated a couple of nice little features.  New features, instant mixes continue playing beyond 25 songs.  You can shuffle an album, artist or playlist.  And the previous button got added to the widget, which sounds like a really small, simple thing,  but much, much needed.  So that's Google Play Music on Android.  Google Flight Search has a new useful little feature that that's skip dot com picked up.  You can search for regions, not just airports.  So if you want to fly from Petaluma and you want to go to Hawaii, you don't care what island.  You can just type in Hawaii and Google Flight Search will show you flights to all the different islands.  You can do the same to say for the Caribbean if you're planning a vacation.  So it's just regions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What's that works for even just Europe?  If you say I got away, what's the price?  So I found I tried this out and I found that it was cheapest to fly to Moscow versus Western European places.  Five hundred thirty one dollars.  And what the hell?  Let's go. Let's all go to Moscow.  Try to get a damn visa is another question.  But we'll put that aside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And last thing, this is kind of a new to me that I'm not sure how long this has been in place,  but Lifehacker wrote this up.  You know, when sometimes your friend's email account gets gets it's hacked basically and you get spam from your friends  and you want to mark those messages as spam, but you don't want Gmail to know.  You don't want Gmail to think that all of your friends messages are spam.  Well, when you do mark a contact message of spam now, Gmail pops a box that says,  is just this one message suspicious or all, you know, should you should you mark this person's messages as spam in general?  Messages look suspicious versus messages just spam.  It's kind of a way of letting Gmail know, hey, something something went wrong here.  Somebody may have hacked a friend's account.  So that's that's a nice thing that Adam Lifehacker noticed.  And that's all I got today for the change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thank you, Gina, for the Google change law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's that's that's really handy because you never want to be you always want to be the only person to write your friend and let them know that they've been infected.  But you don't want to be the thirty fourth person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's kind of you also may not want to be the first person.  Right. It's really nice to let Gmail handle it.  I'd like to be the second person that sells that.  So I was at a big game on Sunday and everywhere you look, including the scoreboards everywhere hashtags  and the implication, of course, you want to tweet hashtag SB forty seven.  They did a little count at marketing land dot com at McGee said Twitter was mentioned in twenty six of fifty two commercials.  You know, half of the commercials, I'm surprised it was only half Facebook mentioned only in four.  How many times do you think Google Plus was mentioned?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, the plus are arguing that they support hashtags, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's not what they were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then they wrote and then they wrote an update to that post saying, oh, no, we searched none of these hashtags are on Google Plus.  They really did. You can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I'll try it this way.  I'll try the fanboy with his way. Google Plus is not a place to get bombarded with marketers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a place to have conversations with people like I really don't want to see a lot of people hashtagging the kiss for go daddy.  For instance, I watched that again because I had I was I didn't see the game because I was at the game, but I saw the last night.  I watched the TV broadcast.  It's very different, by the way.  It's kind of interesting experience, almost a totally different experience.  It's like how you feel about the game is different.  Well, one thing you have lights and power.  Yeah, well, that's for one thing.  Yeah, actually, you didn't you didn't because in the middle of the game, when the power goes out, the announcers just disappear in the mids mid sentence.  And it takes them a while to say anything.  And then they get a sideline guy who's clearly ill prepared and has never been on camera before, I think, because he's like he doesn't.  A local reporter could have done a better job setting the scene.  He was like, Flumford.  Anyway, I watched it again.  Yeah, I could I could have filled an hour.  You actually did.  I tweeted about 80 times during the like because I figured I figured you know what?  I bet you people don't know what's going on.  I bet you the broadcast isn't isn't going to tell you because they're they're dead in the water.  So I thought I maybe they were waiting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go ahead.  They were waiting on a statement from the NFL about what happened.  Yeah, like they needed the NFL to tell them we don't know what happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  NFL.  What happened?  So I tweeted a bunch, but but I did not use hashtag the kiss.  And now that I saw the commercial, I'm glad they were they that was definitely sweetened with slurping sounds.  It sweetens the right word.  Was there was there Wi Fi?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was not Wi Fi, right?  There was excellent Wi Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In fact, they made a big deal about the fact that they had a lot of Wi Fi.  Seventy one thousand people in that Superdome.  It's huge.  And that they had a ton of Wi Fi.  It worked very, very well.  They had some interesting security things that they did.  Apparently, they looked at every device coming through the perimeter and and checked its MAC address and what it was and would block it if it was a rogue device.  So all sorts of interesting stuff that we do.  The Wi Fi was excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I heard some sort of crazy statistic like 38 gigabytes of data was uploaded from the Superdome.  Eight hundred thirty three gigabytes of.  Oh, eight hundred thirty three.  That's insane.  And good goodly amount was mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I uploaded video audio.  We even made a Skype call to tweet.  And and it worked.  OK, I mean, it was choppy.  It was choppy.  I mean, I was doing it on a smartphone for once on an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was this like board during the blackout kind of time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, before the game, they were doing the show and Chad texted me.  So you want to try it?  Because the Wi Fi was part of the store was a new story.  And but for surfing and uploading video and Instagram pictures and tweeting, everything was great.  Except and it lasted into the power blackout for about 15 minutes and then it died too.  But I had three G.  I was able to use three G.  So I continued to tweet.  Yeah, there were hashtags everywhere.  These are the top hashtags.  Better with M.M.'s.  Bravery wins.  That was Audi.  Pick your team for Hyundai.  There were some social attempts that I think were particularly stupid, like the Coca-Cola race.  Who's going to win?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You get to choose.  I don't care.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, really, seriously, do people care whether the showgirls, the cowboys or the bikers win?  I mean, who cares?  Doritos has in the past done more crowdsourcing.  Remember, they would like a couple of years ago had fan made ads.  Right.  Contest for that too.  I don't think they do that this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They had some weird kind of goat attack goat.  Attack goat.  It was an attack goat.  It was a very strange.  It was terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The ads were not that this is a show that we can comment on ads.  We do everything else.  The ads were terrible.  There were only a couple of good ads.  The Clydesdale ad literally made me cry.  But you know, it's interesting.  The web version made me cry.  The long web version.  When I saw it on TV, dry eyed.  You need a little more time to develop that story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If I could comment on that one, it was like when you were in a room full of your friends, you don't want to be like.  So there was like there was this moment of like that was really touching, but I'm going to make fun of it because I don't want to be the guy in the party being like, wow, what a lame friends do you have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They don't support man tears.  Come on.  God, you need better friends, Chad.  My friends would say, go ahead, cry it out.  Do you want a tissue?  Do you want a tissue?  We were all crying.  We were all crying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was a God made a Farmer ad where you were like, oh, you wish you could scroll your TV down to see the angry comments.  But there was none because it was a TV ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The ad 10 million views on YouTube.  And I have to say it was much more touching on YouTube.  I guess it's longer.  It's a minute 13 on YouTube.  It was, of course, only 30 seconds.  You got to develop a relationship.  The horse, the man, they bonded.  They got to know each other.  They really care.  And then, of course, the big Budweiser truck pulls up.  I thought the choice of the goat girl Fleetwood Max landslide landslide was a little odd.  And he goes to Chicago to see his horse that he gave up three years ago.  The horse drives by without even a look.  But wait, they've unharnessed the horse.  And now somehow unaccountably, they took the blinders off.  And unaccountably, the horse gets away and runs down the empty streets of Chicago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You've heard of war horse.  This is beer.  This is beer horse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love war horse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This made me I swear to God, I was I was.  My friends did mock me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In some ways, it almost seems like as well they should have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then what did you see the end?  Because at the end, it says tweet your name because that's a real baby horse.  Big, you know, a Clydesdale colt.  And we haven't named it yet.  So tweet your name.  Now, we haven't heard anything from Budweiser about what name they want to give that horse.  Tweet us her names using the vorac crying.  The vorac was crying for other.  We were crying because of the Niners, not because of any old horse.  Name the baby Clydesdale seen in this commercial.  Tweet us your names.  I don't know if they ever did name that horse.  That's the problem with a lot of this stuff because Twitter is so evanescent.  The biggest the biggest winner, according to everybody I read, was was Oreo.  And not because of their ad or because of their hashtags, but because when the lights went out.  Oreo fought fast.  Somebody thought very fast.  The Oreo ad was about was a fight, I guess, about how to I don't know what it was.  There was a library and there was a fight, blah, blah, blah.  And that didn't really get anybody excited about Oreos.  But boy, when the lights went out at the Super Bowl and Oreo, how fast did they tweet that?  It was really soon.  They tweeted out a picture and they said you could still dunk in the dark.  Which, in fact, had nothing to do with the ad.  It didn't matter.  Didn't matter. And they added a hashtag dunk in the dark.  Got retweeted more than 14,000 times.  That's an ad. Cost them nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you ever see the 30 Rock where they came up with telethons for every possible emergency that could happen?  That's what it like.  Does Oreo have a whole contingency of like Ray Lewis leaves the stadium and flies to Hawaii?  Like they have a whole.  There's no way they had somebody planning for a power outage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That could well, they had someone who was good with Photoshop and had a pipeline to someone at Twitter promoted ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. And more importantly, had permission from Oreo to act on his or her own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. Because that's the big thing.  Normally, you've got to get that ad passed 20 people.  Three weeks from now, you can tweet.  Sure.  That's the thing.  That's the one.  Yeah.  20,000 likes on Facebook.  Oreo went from 2,000 Instagram followers pregame to 36,000 after the game.  It was a huge success.  And it wasn't the library where they're fighting over cookie or cream.  That was stupid.  It was dunking in the dark.  It was a huge success.  And it wasn't the library where they're fighting over cookie or cream.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That was stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was dunking in the dark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was appropriate to the medium.  It was having a conversation.  It was that and something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The VP of cookies, honestly, that's her title.  Lisa Mann.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the title I aspire to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She has led marketing efforts for Oreo for the last two years and the Super Bowl ad.  She explained it was the result of a carefully architected social media strategy.  This is from Forbes.  That made the brand ready to respond to whatever the big game threw its way.  So you're right, Kevin Purdy.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Here's the quote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The way this all came about is because of the Super Bowl spot.  And we were coming off the 100th birthday.  We chose the Super Bowl to kick off this campaign of which part of the cookie do you love more?  But because we picked such a big stage, we decided to have a social media command center so that we could respond.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's the hot thing ever since Dell started one.  Everybody goes down to see Dell's.  Everybody wants a command center.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And Old Spice 2 really showed that you can use Twitter very effectively to market.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a response to what's going on live versus plan something months ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Of course, we couldn't have anticipated the blackout.  But in that command center, we had brand people, agency people.  So you had the people who could say yes.  It was within the agency's 360 eyes, Tribeca's office representation from all of Oreo's agencies.  Oreo doesn't have just one agency.  They've got they've got Wieden and Kennedy, which, of course, is the creators of the Old Spice ad, one of the best in terms of managing social media media vest and Weber Shandwick 360.  So four agencies are there.  She's sitting there.  She's dialed in.  What's happening?  Several members of the brand team from Oreo were in the room as well.  They're all emailing each other because everyone was together.  She said they had everyone in place to jump on a real time marketing opportunity, which was how would Oreo see the blackout?  You could they got to make a movie.  This is an HBO movie.  The blackout cookie crisis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How would Oreo see that?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the team.  And you can just see Aaron Sorkin's got to write this dialogue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is so much better than the Samsung crap because it kind of is probably very similar, but it was real.  Yeah.  And Oreo saw the blackout, she says, as an opportunity to dunk in the dark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dozens of interns getting ads ready for like marauding alligators.  Yeah. Earthquake.  Yeah. Hurricane.  OK, Oreo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The best thing in a national crisis.  No, Oreo terrorist attack.  No, it's a cookie.  No, Oreo dunk in the dark.  Yes, dunk in the dark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got to make sure you fire off the right ad, though.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And again, and now it's not a really tough Photoshop job.  You got a cookie and you got a gradient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's pretty simple.  And honestly, even the tagline, I mean, it's not that, you know, what was interesting about is that it responded to the event real time.  I mean, it wasn't, you know, the most clever.  But it didn't need to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Although dunk in the dark, you can still dunk in the dark is pretty good.  That's a good slogan.  Yeah, it worked.  It was fun.  Much better than cookie or cream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no doubt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Anyway, this week in cookies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, you know, I think this just shows that, yeah, you do need a social media command center.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, what you know, what you need is people you trust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they didn't do that because they had about a thousand people in that room.  Yeah, because it's.  Amen to that stuff.  But I think that's the best way to do it.  But no, no big no Bisco is not going to trust anybody to say, OK, yeah, here's the Twitter password.  Just go ahead and tweet there.  Whatever you say, I'm sure it'll be good.  I don't even do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Actually, I do.  I heard Donald Trump on Howard Stern today talking about how he has four people who have his password for Twitter.  And one of them, he said he fired an assistant because he he doesn't does he write the tweets?  Well, I dictate them, he said.  I tweet Twitter person, come here and take my tweet.  And and so before the game, he said something about congratulating Bill Belichick and the person got it to be Bob Belichick.  He was all mad and had a fit.  Well, I would, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's that's why you don't.  Yeah.  I did. By the way.  I was at Regis and Kelly two years ago or a year ago.  And the exact thing happened.  Regis said, get our Twitter person.  And there's a full time person probably underpaid college into a box.  Yeah.  And he says, hey, tweet this.  And that's exactly what they did.  I mean, they did.  And I imagine that's what a lot of people do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What Trump needs to know is that he should let his Twitter people just off into his account that way he could revoke access if he wanted to.  But of course, sharing his password or use hootsweet or hootsweet or something.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Don't give from any tips.  Good tips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's true. I won't give him any advice.  That guy let him give his password away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Meanwhile, there's Applebee's.  And this is from Tali in our chat room.  Applebee's overnight social media meltdown.  Oh, yes.  This is a good one.  So I don't I'm seeing this for the first time.  Jeff, what happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Waitress put up a minister crossed out the 18 percent tip and said, I give to God 10 percent to God.  Why should I give to you?  Waitress said, oh, my God, it's ridiculous.  Waitress is friend.  The waitress who got it didn't do anything.  The waitress, the other waitress did it and posted it online.  Applebee's fired that waitress for doing that for violating policies.  Da da da da.  And of course, the world goes nuts because they're siding with the waitress.  Yeah, she got stiffed.  She said her personal Twitter account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  OK, not the Applebee's.  Waitress did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was another waitress who put it up and just showed the picture of the of the bill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Chelsea Welch, a colleague of the stiffed server.  Sounds like a Perry Mason episode.  The case of the stiffed server took a picture of it could mean many things.  Took a picture of the receipt and uploaded it to Reddit, not to Twitter, to Reddit.  Yes, sorry.  She lost her job.  Smoking Gun, though, preserved the image.  She lost her job for violating a customer's privacy, which I think actually is probably you can't mock your customers on Reddit.  Yeah, there is issue there.  But but of course, as a result, there were numerous boycott Applebee's groups on Facebook, along with rehire Chelsea Welch and other similar groups.  Applebee's website has a What's the Buzz widget that shows what people are saying on Twitter about the company.  It's all nonstop attacks right on their own home page.  People can't help talk about Applebee's every day.  See what they have to say.  Applebee, it's been one day.  This controversy hasn't gone away and won't go away until you hire back Chelsea Welch.  That's hysterical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They need a war room.  Yeah, they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff, didn't there just come down a case or at least some kind of ruling about what you can and cannot say that is protected about your employer on social media?  Oh, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, it was on the media this last weekend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I assume you listen to it every week.  I do, but I didn't run this last weekend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I don't know what to do this weekend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, unfortunately, Applebee's seems to have put somebody editing the Applebee's What's the Buzz widget because it's now all nice stuff about Applebee's.  Oh, wait a minute.  Here's a really great run on the biggest social media PR fail I've seen in a while.  Applebee's overnight social media meltdown, a photo essay.  Okay, so maybe they're maybe they're not editing this.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Good for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Actually, if you're going to put a buzz, what's the buzz?  You probably should just do it on edited, right?  Or not?  What's your advice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, do it on added.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  At least it's authentic then, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is the National Labor Relations Board weighed in recently about what you can and cannot say about your employer.  And basically what they said before, whatever applies to the water cooler applies at Facebook and Twitter.  But I don't know if this waitress kind of overstepped the bounds of maybe by singling out a customer who was then immediately in Reddit style identified through a series of investigative reporter techniques.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but you know, let's take it further.  So what if what if the customer had said something racist?  Probably say, well, they deserve it.  Right.  So, you know, you do what you do.  It's kind of in public.  You know, the waitress could have just told a friend it could have been repeated at some point.  Yeah, I think your point, Leo, that you don't want as a policy your employees mocking your customers.  But at some point, the customer did something boneheaded and probably deserved mockery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's the article from The New York Times, Stephen Greenhouse, as Facebook and Twitter become central to workplace conversation, federal regulators are ordering employers employers to scale back policies that limit what workers can say online.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Which could even affect news organizations, news organizations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And LRB says workers have a right to discuss work conditions freely and without fear of retribution, whether the discussion takes place at the office or on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the the case that they affirmed was actually from Buffalo is Hispanics United.  It was a bunch of employees talking about how they had too much to do at work and were being told to do something else.  The one they didn't the one that they said this was a legal firing was a bartender unhappy about not getting a raise for five years.  And he posted about how the customers were rednecks and he hoped they choked on glasses.  They drove home drunk.  So don't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  On the other hand, there's the Arizona Daily Star reporter who got fired for tweeting because of the lack of news.  What? No overnight homicide. You're slacking, Tucson.  And you stay homicidal, Tucson.  Newspaper fired the reporter and LRB found the dismissal legal saying the posts were offensive and not about working conditions.  Had he said it's about working conditions, he could have said it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One of the first reporters fired for failing to get a hashtag going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Interesting. So if it's legal.  And it's the kind of thing you might say, well, the water cooler, the NLRB will defend you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Theoretically, theoretically, you're unemployed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is very narrow to discussing the workplace.  This is an NLRB thing. So this is this goes to organizing unions and complaints and so on.  What if what about the free speech issue?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Every employer's nightmare. Employees create a group on Facebook to compare salaries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, there are sometimes you sign a policy, you sign a contract saying you will not reveal your salary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, a lot of employees actually, their salaries are public anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, mine's mine's public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But a lot of private industry, it's not.  And people are worried that if employees knew there would be a competitive workplace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, the other the other dream of mine is that you go onto a plane and you immediately see what everybody else paid for the seat.  Oh, I'd love that. Oh, yeah, that would be interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I'd love that. I'm actually totally for people discussing their salaries.  I think that things like gender pay gaps and, you know, various things get revealed.  I think when people know what their what their coworkers are making.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Interesting article about the Applebee social media meltdown R.L. Stoller dot wordpress dot com.  Social media. Fascinating.  So so so back to Google for a minute.  Oh, Google. Yeah, what the hell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Google. We should probably go back.  I'll tell you what, let's take a break.  We'll come back to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I want to tell you about this is actually kind of apropos.  Legal zoom dot com.  Actually, Legal Zoom is not a law firm.  It's not going to offer you legal representation.  What it does is is make it possible for you to do a lot of the documents, a lot of the business stuff that you'd want to do.  But you don't want to spend a lot of money on a lawyer for trademarks.  Trademark. Chad's trademarking his blog name.  Right.  OMG. Yeah.  You should trademark that.  Yeah.  You don't want some other OMG Chad to come along.  We certainly trademarked tweet right away.  Forming an LLC.  That's something I did all by myself.  I couldn't when I when we started to it, I didn't have it was just me.  I didn't have money for a lawyer.  But the beauty is you walk through this questionnaire.  It's very simple.  It was ninety nine bucks.  That's incorporating or forming an LLC at legal zoom dot com.  Trademarks, copyrights, patents and data.  Very affordable.  You could do a will.  Do you have a will?  You should have a will.  You really should.  And I'm sure that you have a will now, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you want, we'll set you up.  Unfortunately, much more than that.  You went to a lawyer.  Yeah.  I know.  But but a lot of this stuff is very straightforward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's very simple.  It's very simple.  It's very simple.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But but a lot of this stuff is very straightforward.  It's really just a simple questionnaire step by step.  If you do get to the point where you go, you know, I really think I should get some legal  advice.  You don't even have to stop using legal zoom.  They have an extensive network of attorneys.  They have a legal plan.  They've been vetted.  They have fixed rates.  But also you can read right on the legal zoom site reviews and comments from from users  on edited customer reviews.

All right, Jeff Jarvis, some Google talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, there was just all kinds of interesting stuff on Google, especially this afternoon.  So we give you a catalog and see where we want to go.  One is that Google changed AdSense considerably.  What happened?  So that you can now combine a campaign across multiple platforms and target to those platforms and times and such.  So I think this is huge in a few ways.  So if you want to just target people who are within 10 miles of your place only in the afternoon to push your, you know, your your your tea time muffins, you can do that.  And you can do that across platforms so you can go to just people who are mobile on their phones.  So they're going to treat tablets like PCs as if you're sitting on a couch.  They're going to treat mobile phones differently.  And you can target based on these factors.  To me, that means a few things.  One, it starts to get monetization to mobile looking more plausible because now the fact that your mobile becomes valuable to it has a big impact on local advertising because mobile is local.  And so it's a big change to to to AdSense that I think could have some real impact.  Meanwhile, as we as we know, Facebook announced a huge amount of their traffic is mobile and the war to try to figure out how to finally monetize mobile starts.  So I found that one interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what this strikes me as is is a response to Facebook.  You know, we're going to compete.  We've got to compete with Facebook mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, but it's also just just I've been arguing for some time that this is the power of mobile is we know where you are and where you're going and what you want.  And and they've got to make that you've got to open that up to the advertisers to be able to monetize that and give that value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Greed and the and the and the competition is doing it.  So they better. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. I wonder when Google now is going to pop up a card when I'm nearby my favorite bubble tea place and they've got a special you like bubble tea too.  I love bubble tea.  It's mine.  It's my new thing.  It's a bad thing.  It's just tapioca.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's good for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But, you know, I wonder, like, I think about things like, I mean, I want these companies to crack the monetization around mobile, right?  Because that's where it's going.  And I and I love these services and I would like for them to be around.  Right. So they have to be able to monetize somehow.  We talked about the four square MX specials, which I really liked as someone who's generally sort of ignores advertising as a rule.  I was really mad.  So, yeah, so this is this is interesting.  But I wonder how things like Google now, you know, which is that kind of on demand ham in a location.  I have information for you that might be useful will be, you know, an ad and say, hey, you know, get bubble tea half off, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I think when Google now gives you value that you respond to, that's what it works.  Right. And we know what's going to happen.  It's creepy.  But Google now is in a context where you know what's happening.  And so adding advertising to that, if there's value in it, if it works for both both sides of the transaction, I think makes some sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't hear the word creepy anymore without sort of channeling someone on Twitter told me that it was their birthday and they went to the Google dot com home page.  And the Google Doodle was a birthday cake and it said like, happy birthday, Phil.  What? Yeah.  Which is which I thought was a new thing.  It turns out it's not.  This is they've been doing this for a while.  If you went to your birthday on your Google profile, the doodle will wish you happy birthday.  And then someone said, yeah, I got this on my birthday and it was creepy.  It was cool, but a little creepy.  And I totally channel Jarvis being my creepy exactly like let's use more specific language.  So you ruined me, Jeff.  I used to go inside your head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You are inside my head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the other what's the harm?  That's the other question.  It's like Jarvis.  No, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's creepy because you ascribe to Google attributes of a human.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think that's when it's well, but that's there's another interesting story in the rundown.  The argument is that Google is getting more empathetic and then empathetic design is what we need.  And I think that's true that even even inhuman Google is now becoming human.  And we don't expect it perhaps of Google.  But but that's what's going to be necessary for it to understand us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Drew, Drew, all enough writing on TechCrunch.  Yes.  Yeah.  And then if you do say that, then you have to really deal with this creepy thing.  I think the creepy thing is is more of a societal adjustment to technology that is particularly about Google.  It's about not understanding because we're human.  So we we look at everything like another human, but machines are not humans.  And if a machine knows it's your birthday and computationally puts a greeting up, there's no human involved.  Nobody knows anything about you.  You haven't said it's all automatic.  And I think as we get used to machines doing, you know, we're going to have to robots, autonomous vehicles.  It's all creepy because it's a machine doing something and we ascribe human attributes to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're really right.  And I ran a session in Davos, pardon me, for place dropping on on new social norms.  And I tell my story about about fiendish Kodakers lying and wait in the 1890s and talk about about how norms or adjustments we make.  So that what you're saying right then is really interesting is that we're used to it.  And technology comes in.  We're used to figuring out our human norms around it.  Right. If you have a camera, is it right to do this or that with a camera?  Right. But it's the human norm.  What you just said is that we have to have norms for machines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's also the uncanny uncanny valley. Right.  So when you do animation, you want it to be really not human.  You want to be clearly a cartoon because you make it too close to a human, but not perfect.  And it's almost impossible to make it perfect.  It's uncanny. It's weird.  It's it's like a corpse.  And I think this is built into us, by the way, as a way to protect us from corpses, zombies, aliens.  I don't know. No, I think it's I think it's in the monkey mind that there's something wrong about this thing and it could be diseased.  But we got to stay away from it.  And so what looks human but isn't quite human to us is dangerous in our monkey mind.  And so we have to back off.  I really think it's at that level.  I don't know how you train people around that, but I think that's where it comes from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like we just have to train users that if you have entered your birthday on Google, that there's nothing there should be nothing surprising about your birthday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Your logical mind is clearly fine.  It's no different than Facebook.  It's no different than opening your user profile settings and seeing your birthday there.  It's exactly the same thing.  You put it there. Yeah.  It's technically from a technical and you are a programmer.  So you understand that from a technical point of view, it's the same database is the same field you filled in the field so that the program goes.  And but to the human, we don't it's not a rational thing.  It's monkey mind. But there's a difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like, so when I enter my birthday on my Google profile, I assume that they're asking me because they have to make sure that I'm not a child.  Right. Like, I assume that they're just asserting that I'm an adult.  I'm not thinking, well, in September, I'm going to get a birthday cake on my home page.  You know, like it stretches a little bit.  And now I'm getting used to that idea.  You know, just just the way that I was surprised the first time that my Facebook wall was covered in happy birthday wishes from my friends.  Right. Right.  On my birthday, because I didn't realize that Facebook was telling all my friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But you made it. You made an incorrect, unsupported assumption about why they wanted the birthday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, right. Yeah, no, it's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They could have wanted it just to be nice to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And maybe that's maybe it's something as simple as saying when you ask for a birthday, hey, so that we can wish you happy birthday and your birthday.  Would you enter your birthday?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but the reality is they want to know that I'm a 30 something female so that they can, you know, advertise to me more efficiently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We didn't know that till now.  No, very high in the 30 something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  More higher than I'm comfortable.  Upper 30.  So there was that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's also that I found interesting that Eric Schmidt, what's his name?  We forget him so soon said that Google is giving precedence to content from known authors and that this has really interesting implications on identity online.  And, you know, I think we're all part of the authors program at Google.  That's good for us.  They know who we are.  It has more precedence.  People think that anonymity leads to more crap.  It may be the case.  But but interesting there that the argument with the argument can be that anonymous content in a revolution or something will get less precedence in search.  Today, it is Google say this or somebody just kind of figure it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Schmidt said it.  And did he say that the signal was being in their program, the author program?  No, I don't think that was it.  But I think that's clearly the easiest signal they have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Could be the PageRank does it automatically just because that's what that's kind of what he's saying.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And the more the more whether you're recognized author or not, but that's how PageRank works.  It's not democratic.  Yeah.  The more people link to you.  It needs signals.  And, you know, we constantly have said this.  We need signals of of authority and originality and authenticity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  So signal.  So the other one is just last one.  The last one of the last one.  And then the last one is the last one.  Yeah.  So it's signal.  So the other one is just last one.  The last one of the Google section, a supposedly leaked video of the chromium of the Chromebook Pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I saw this in our in our community on the Google+.  Yeah, this is cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What is the Chromebook Pixel?  It is a design machine.  The videos at the bottom where it's kind of a high end Chromebook and touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And they mentioned that they were going to do a touch OS.  We we had kind of we kind of question.  What do you mean?  Isn't Android the touch OS?  But no, it's Chrome OS.  Let's see it.  Yeah.  Is the video worth watching?  It's a speed through loads.  This is from Android Authority.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not pulled from I think it did YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then it and then I think they were where they have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're OK.  You should do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But first, this word from a sponsor, virtually every YouTube video we go to now has pre roll ad.  This is a daily motion video.  Except ours.  Do we not flip that?  Do we not flip that?  You may monetize me button.  Here we are.  You get paid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, like this is a pixel.  The smallest bit of a picture made from tiny red, green and blue lights.  OK, OK.  Now, by itself, the pixel isn't much.  But together, pixels create entire worlds.  You could say like an atom, a pixel is a building block.  And the more pixels we add, the more wonderful the world.  And from four million pixels, we created something new.  The Chromebook Pixel.  This is a new kind of computer.  Kind of top logic.  Entirely by Google.  It's got pixels.  And we asked ourselves, could this pixel create a new world of possibilities?  Hey, are you shooting a spot for the big game?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Totally.  Is that me?  What's that sound?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Totally.  What's that sound?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Totally.  You?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's that sound?  Quick.  What did I do?  Close every tab.  That must be you, Chad.  Yeah, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Turn it off.  It's a tab.  I'm pretty positive that it is an ad on this Dailymotion page.  You're kidding.  No.  I'm pretty positive that there's some plural thing.  Crap, Ola.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, anyway, that is the worst ad for a computer.  The only thing it told us is something I just mentioned.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I do think that that is my hoping here.  I think that Google has pushed the low end of the Chromebook by getting to 249.  And by the way, a very nice man named Roger Shelton, I think, has fixed my problem with  the Chromebook.  The one thing that was driving me crazy about the Chromebook was that it dumped pages all  the time.  It's going to run out of memory.  And he got me to enable something Zram swap.  So it now uses the memory of the machine better so it can hold on to pages.  And I think this is going to work.  So I'm happy with the machine.  I'm full time on that machine, basically.  I told somebody because we were talking about the Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't remember where it was.  I was maybe at a football game or something.  And I said, yeah, Jeff Jarvis is using a Chromebook full time.  And they said, no.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You are.  I'm like, well, I use Chrome or Chromebook.  I've got a Mac at the office where I just use Chrome there.  I do not use Microsoft and so on and so forth.  But I also want to see them push the high end of the Chromebook.  So HP came out this week with an announcement of a new Chromebook for 330 by 20.  $130, I think.  But less battery power.  Each one is compromising at the low end.  I wonder what a really good $600 Chromebook will look like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  With a high resolution picture screen, it's going to be amazing how many pixels you can't run Photoshop on now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What do you need a retina display for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love Chromebooks.  It's just like I just get this kind of anticipation.  Every time a new model is announced, just like maybe I'll get an operating system.  No, I just I understand the Chrome idea.  It's just that, you know, it's going to put it out there.  It's going to be really it's got a really nice screen.  It's going to be a good price point.  People are going to go camera on Word.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Et cetera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are they wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Long essay to follow here.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Kevin's a big you love Chrome OS.  Right.  So you really live in in Chrome and Chrome OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do.  And it's just, you know, when you get to a certain point, people are the argument about what you can and can't do just goes on and on endlessly until people eventually say things like, oh, well, but then I have to do something that requires expending calories, which means buying more food.  And you're like, well, I can't help you there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here's a question for you guys.  The other Google announcement, the what is it called where the where the word Chrome and Mozilla could talk and video.  What was that?  What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I saw this.  I saw Web RTC Web RTC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's down under the other real time conversation.  Right.  So it enables just with the browser itself, video and audio.  Does that start to replace Skype for us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, that's the idea.  Right.  It's just it's just built into the browser.  Yeah.  And I think we knew that they were that Web RTC was being heavily used by some Google teams.  Yep.  That that in fact, who was it that said they were distributed all over and they said that that's how that's basically how we work together with through RTC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Knocking down Skype is a huge target, you know, especially for Chrome and Chromebook.  Like besides Photoshop, maybe Skype is the number one thing that people feel like they can't get out.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  You do have the Google talk, but it's true.  I mean, we're we're a Google show.  We're still using Skype.  I mean, Skype, I think it's so just ingrained.  Well, I'll use Web RTC if we can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just it's early still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's in the it's in the beta.  You have to enable it and the special flags.  Hey, we're geeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We can do it.  We can do it.  Well, let's see how the let's see.  Now, remember, they're at the Googleplex, so they're probably using gigabit Ethernet to do this conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Plus, I look at the guy at Mozilla and I look at the guy at Google and one's poor, one's rich.  Same job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Interesting.  So here's this is the video.  RTC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Firefox asked me for permission to use the camera and microphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's Todd Simpson from Mozilla.  The rich guy.  No, poor guy.  Poor guy.  Oh, the Google guy's rich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A nonprofit.  Great.  How about yourself?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Great.  It's good to be making the call.  But OK.  Chrome and Firefox using Web RTC.  I think for the folks at home, I should start by introducing myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You should start by moving the mouse off your forehead.  Maybe that's a hat.  A very small hat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Excellent.  Yeah, and I'm Todd.  Fabulio Amilica.  Chief of Innovation over at Mozilla and I love this type of hat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, this looks like Skype.  I mean, if we could use this, I'd use this.  I don't have a problem with it.  It's using Opus and VP8.  Those are the video codecs.  Opus for audio, VP8 for video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'd worry about it being full screen and us being able to get rid of the preview.  It's so funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The little things that we care about are like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and you can't do that in this in the moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, can you or can't you?  I don't even understand what I'm looking at.  Is this looks like a...  Have they edited these two pictures together or is this what it looks like on your screen when you're seeing it?  I don't think so.  It does look like you've got the little box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They edited it together because you see a box in a box.  Yeah.  Gina's just being cautious because she doesn't want you to send her a Chromebook instead of a Mac Mini.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We could send you a Chromebook.  We could do that.  So it was added to Mozilla Firefox 18, which came out last month.  They say do use the nightly because they're still working out bugs.  Chrome 25 beta if you want to do it or later if you want to do it in Chrome.  On the beta channel for Chrome.  Are you on the beta channel for Chrome on your Chromebook?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Not the dev channel, but the beta channel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I should see which version of Chrome I have here.  It might be kind of interesting to try it.  Maybe for next week.  I know we've been trying to get this working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The problem I had was I don't know how to control the camera and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing. You have to sacrifice so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Maybe I can.  Nice people like Roger Shelton come in and he wrote this incredibly long email telling me how to do it.  It was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this isn't peer to peer.  There's a service in the middle that routes these calls to one another.  It's not like my Chrome browser is calling your Firefox.  There's something in the middle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's a good question, Gina. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There'd have to be.  If you don't have, it'd have to be.  You'd have to do port forwarding and stuff.  You've got to have a NAT traversal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Probably just a link you hand to someone, right, though?  It just comes right to your computer and Chrome knows what to do with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Barry in the chat room is saying it is peer to peer.  RTC peer connection interoperability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All you need is signaling to be managed by a server.  You could have the call be peer to peer once it's signaled.  Gotcha.  Once the SIP is happening.  Chrome beta channel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google's just handing out server space everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they can afford it.  Nice shot.  Oh, sorry.  Hello.  Fingers slipped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that is why we can't have nice things.  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Anything else in your hopper?  I just thought there was Google stuff up there that was good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I want you to do that because I haven't really had a chance to go through the stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't think this is...  Google and Disney did a Mondo Chrome thing for the upcoming Oz movie,  which is kind of interesting.  If you're into seeing stretches of HTML and what all it can do, it's kind of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  HBO takes down HBO?  Yeah, that's funny.  So it's just one more wonderful DCMA story after another.  The request filed on behalf of HBO by a company it uses, Mark Monitor.  It asked Google to remove links to the eastbound and down section of HBO's own online store  because it violated HBO's copyright.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It has to be eastbound and down too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  DCMA, S&M.  S&M, DCMA.  That's because all of this is automated.  It's automated.  Yeah.  That's fine.  We never did get taken down by NBC for showing a video of me on NBC, did we?  So I guess NBC must be smarter than we thought.  Or maybe it'll come later.  A lot of times these takedowns happen for a show that's a year later.  They just can't keep up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I'll go ahead and give up one of my numbers.  No, no, no.  Save it.  RIAA takedown requests have now added up to 10 million.  Geez, Louise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's either a statement about how much piracy is going on or how aggressive the RIAA is.  Well, how the RIAA needs life.  Yeah.  Meanwhile, San Francisco's not happy.  Here's my San Francisco story.  About Google buses.  Geez.  They're ruining quality.  What is going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're complaining that the Google buses mean that people from Google in the Valley can work in San Francisco.  Ergo, it creates more demand for real estate.  Ergo, real estate prices go up, and they're ruining it.  Well, it's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's very expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, welcome to a market economy, folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But if you're a renter, I mean, if you're a landlord, this is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is typical of the city of San Francisco.  Who exactly's side are they on?  Exactly.  This is why I don't miss the place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  Somebody's going to complain about everything.  Everything.  Yeah.  Geez.  And so somebody went for me on Twitter and said, well, what do I do?  I said, fine, would you prefer a city filled with joblessness and deteriorating real estate?  You know, move to Detroit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not, by the way, it's not just Google.  Apple does the same thing.  Most Silicon Valley does it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And by the way, the buses mean that you reduce the traffic, and that's good, too.  If somebody else complained, well, they're too good to take public transit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But this looks like an article in the London Review of Books.  It doesn't look like the city of San Francisco complaining about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, it's San Francisco.  It's a San Francisco.  You can always find one to complain about something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and she's not even writing in a San Francisco or even a US journal.  She's writing the London Review of Books.  How I Met Your Mother.  Did you see the Canadian?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is it.  This is the spinoff from that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So and how I met I have never seen this show in my life.  It was on the plane.  But I'm laughing because it has the longest bit of Canadian humor I've ever seen on American television.  The clip is on that link.  If you don't know what Tim Hortons is, it's not going to mean a thing to you.  It's these donuts look amazing, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they are.  So they're a Canadian donut company named for an expired hockey player, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Expired. Yes, we might point out the late Tim Horton.  So they have all these Canadians, Alan Thicke and Schaefer from...  J.D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Famous singer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Geddy Lee from Rush.  It's pretty funny.  So they talk to all these Canadians and it's about a fictional.  I don't know if she's a character on the show, but she's a sweet singer.  And then she goes wrong.  She kind of turns into Avra Levine, another Canadian.  And not really.  And then they're interviewing Paul Schaefer and Geddy Lee and all these people.  And then they say every Canadian knows exactly which Tim Hortons they were in and what donut they were biting into when they heard the news.  Everybody was really very funny.  Geddy Lee says, Tim Hortons in, I don't know, in Brunswick.  Here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gordy Belavo.  Thanks again for the free donuts, eh?  So, you up here visiting family?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I'm not Canadian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not even a quarter Canadian on my father's side.  Shut up.  We're not talking about me.  About me.  How long did you and Robin date?  Well, it wasn't really dating.  We'd take a six-hour...  This is a long clip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know if you have the time.  Robin is his fiance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If you go fast forward, you'll see Jason Priestley suggesting a donut, which Tim Hortons then tweaked.  They made the Priestley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He said they named a donut after me.  And they did.  It's a Tim bit in a donut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  A Tim bit to Americans translates as a munchkin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or a donut hole, basically.  Oh, donut hole. Right. Okay.  I only know this because I spent a considerable amount of time in the wastelands of the Great White North eating at Tim Hortons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like the mullet. I thought that that was a hockey thing.  I didn't realize it was a Canadian thing.  Or is it the same thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, Gina, the things you don't know about Canada.  Or the things you don't know about fictional American Canada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I wonder if Canadians would be offended.  I think probably Canadians would enjoy it.  It's pretty funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Canadians, that's what I love about Canada.  Canadians have a sense of humor about Canadians.  But here's the interesting thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're very kind up there in America's hat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Believe it or not, Tim Hortons paid for this.  Our appearance on the How I Met Your Mother episode came as a result of product placement efforts by Tim Hortons.  Oh, I didn't see that. I missed that line.  Isn't that interesting?  This is all more social media marketing.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So then afterwards they go out on Twitter and they announce that they've started the Priestley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's really amazing.  And all of this is because of the...  I feel so used.  Well, you know what this is?  It reflects the failure of generic advertising to drive traffic, to drive sales.  They've got to find other ways.  And everybody knew this day would come where they'd start embedding this stuff in the content, creating phony campaigns, complaints.  For all we know, Applebee's made the whole thing up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's the new advertising model is to pay a show to have its writers come up with crazy, self-effacing versions of your product.  And then you have to make them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Then you tweet and you make it happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Didn't GE kind of thank 30 Rock on their final episode?  You know, like, thanks for making us laugh.  Because GE was kind of always...  Oh my God, they were...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And Comcast, Cable Town, making fun of them right and left.  I think the people have learned, they learned from Letterman that it's OK to have your talent mock you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Did you ever see the first Letterman episode of the GE handshake?  No.  So Letterman, when the takeover of NBC arrives with GE, of course, now they've since sold it to Comcast.  But when they took it over, Letterman goes to the GE building headquarters and tries to give them a basket of fruit.  And of course, there's a camera crew behind.  And in those days, that was really unusual and difficult.  So the poor security guard starts to shake Letterman's hand and then decides not to.  And the hand goes like this.  So this was the GE handshake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hang a left.  Wow. Wow, wow, wow.  Our last story.  And I mention it more for our own historical reasons than anything else.  Stickam, which was the first service that we used to stream to it way back when is calling it quits.  Stickam was much like Ustream.  They were a live free live streaming service.  Justin TV followed.  Now YouTube's offering some streaming.  And Stickam has decided all of a sudden that the site's going to be closing down immediately.  And you have till the end of the month to log in and download any videos you want to save.  I should probably do that because I bet you some early twits are on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Like Johnny Carson losing all his tapes.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Kind of sad.  I wonder, though, if this has anything to do with YouTube coming in.  I wonder if, you know, I guess you stream and Justin doing all right.  We still stream on a lot of other services.  We were exclusively on Stickam for a while.  Anyway, sad to hear that.  Obviously, nobody really cares.  I'm on locator six.  Well, we're going to wrap it up now.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  How about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm bored.  I'm done.  We could go for an hour and a half.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One quick Chromium story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, Chromium, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A new notification center just got committed to Chromium, which is the open source project that eventually gets productized  and released as Chrome.  And they're basically like these notifications look like Google Now cards.  That's where it gets Google Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You guys know I'm a little bit of a Google Now fanatic these days.  I think it's really, really interesting.  I think it's kind of the future of the way that Google is going to push information out to you.  So like I said, it's just got committed into Chromium.  You're not going to see it in Chrome for a while, but it looks a lot like a Google Now card.  There's a screenshot on the story in the next web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I'm interested to see how does that get used, Gina?  How does that get used?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, you think about so right before Twig, I have Twig on my Google calendar.  I get a little kind of pop up notification that's like it's kind of in line.  It's yellow.  It just says like Twig starting in a minute or Twig starting at 1 p.m.  You imagine that that's a really obvious use of this kind of thing.  This kind of notification card of like calendar notifications or chats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But you could see somebody wants to call you on RTC.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I want to call you on RTC.  Exactly.  And then you can get into things like, hey, you know, you're nearby the bubble tea shop.  You can do all kind of the Google Now stuff, but kind of just based on, you know, what's going on.  Well, it's the same as the as the way you call it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The notifications bar on your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, it's really why shouldn't that be on the browser?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, there's a lot of innovation around notifications.  I mean, I ran Growl for years because I wanted better notifications.  And, you know, an OS 10 did a lot of sort of with their new notification bar, which matches iOS.  And Android has always been kind of, in my opinion, kind of superior when it came to notifications, rich notifications.  And so, you know, you kind of see this trickle down into the into the browser.  So I'm I'm excited about this.  I want to see this in my in my Chrome browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It almost is. How did we live without notifications?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Without like good rich notifications that you could say, show me this, don't show me that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How did we know anything was happening in our lives?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it goes it goes to another angle on this.  I can't remember who wrote the story last week, but the idea that the web was the metaphor of a library.  It was, you know, books in place.  And now the web is a metaphor of a stream of a river.  And if it's a constant flow of information, how do you pluck things out of that that you need to know?  Yep. And there's there's value to be had there.  Mm hmm. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. So Web apps have an opportunity to push out push out a notification, you know, in a standard way.  That's that's kind of that's that's really nice.  And you think I mean, a lot of the web apps that you use already have the little notification bar.  Hey, you've got a new message. Hey, new activity. You should know.  So you can see them all kind of using this this new notification scheme.  I hope this becomes kind of a standard thing, not just a good thing about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It goes back to the problem of of email that Bob Wyman taught me years ago, which was which was the problem with emails, the center controls in notifications, the recipient controls.  Ah, you're deciding who may notify you about what.  And in fact, I wish Google now would notify me about more things. Right.  But but I'm choosing that and I get really, really important to to this this interruption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mm hmm. Right.  Right. Controlling your own interruptions.  I'm actually kind of anti notifications. I turn off most notifications on my phone.  What's that, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm just fixing your sound.  Doesn't seem to help.  Something happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It sounds like you're under water.  It's a service.  You may need to unplug and replug your.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, you think it's that or just bandwidth issue.  It's just bandwidth.  No, I need to come over there and hit whatever it is you're using.  So do I unplug and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm glad I fixed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Video conferencing and printing is like still 2013.  We have not figured this out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So how could I use Web M?  I mean, Web RTC to call you.  I'd love to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Chad and I never even have done, you know, just the Google talk.  I just I have chromium.  We beat it.  I have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I agree. I updated it.  I'll have to figure that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a demo site from there's a link in that in that article and the next Web article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe if I Googled Web RTC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Web RTC demo.  It's Web RTC dot org slash demo.  It didn't load for me, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It makes me think about new ways to do it.  I don't know if you build it, you got to build it into an app.  But if you build it into an app, let's have a talk wall.  You could imagine doing some neat things with it.  Oh, I see.  Is are those the standards that Google Hangouts are built on to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is it compatible? Yes, actually, it is.  It's VP eight. Right.  And Opus. Yes, I believe it is.  Chrome and Firefox can have talk.  Do I need to install a plug in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's an API to have version 25 of.  Yeah, I've got that.  Hmm. Then I think there's a flag you have to run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have a couple of flags.  All right. Where's my Niners flag?  I don't know what.  OK, well, I'll have to read this.  We'll do this. Maybe next week we could do it, though.  Be cool. Web RTC is now live in Chrome 23.  No flag needed. No special Chrome build required.  That was in November.  I am confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it was a while ago. I'm running 25.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, there's an API.  I'll be see freeware free speech codec for robust.  He always makes me nervous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's a chat room.  People are app RTC dot ask bot dot com.  Ah, so it is an app.  Well, I guess it's an app that would take advantage of this, but it's a function.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  App RTC.  OK, I'm there now.  Oh, it wants to use my camera on my microphone.  Oh, allow that.  I would allow to now, Jeff.  OK, here's what you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, you know what? No, it's failed to get access because my camera is already in use.  I don't want to mess it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, there's Chad.  How'd you get there, Chad? Are you doing it?  Same thing. Waiting for someone to join.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I can send you a link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll give this to the chat room.  OK.  This what could possibly go wrong?  Nothing.  I'll just I'll just paste this link to the chat room.  Now you have to be using chromium.  There's my link.  I see other people in here, too.  You have to be on twenty five beta.  There's my link.  Let's see how long before somebody calls me.  How exciting is this?  I'm going to post mine in the chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What's your address to call?  Two six zero two six five five one sixty.  Yeah, I got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you'll be able to get you'll have a number.  See somebody's calling.  Chad, show the screen.  OK. Whoa.  Hey, hey there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're the lucky winner.  You get a 49ers used ticket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This looks now we got to figure out how to get this out of here.  It's lower.  But this is this is a reference app.  It's an API, Chad.  So all we have to do is write our own.  Oh, that's it.  Software. Yeah.  OK.  I can't hear you.  But I think that's probably my problem because we're having audio issues.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I I did a link in the doc chat, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK.  Should I call you?  Yeah, I'm going to hang up.  Thank you, caller.  Appreciate it.  We never found out who you were.  First time caller, first time app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  First time and goodbye.  First time.  Last time.  OK, I can't hang up the hang up.  There we go.  I've left the call now.  Yes, it's just a link.  That's so neat.  So it's just a link.  So it's just a link.  So it's just a link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's just a link.  So it's just a link.  So it's just a link.  So it's just a link.  Yes, it's just a link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's so neat.  So or you could even give out the number because a link is has a standard form.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So in the doc chat, the highlighted pink highlight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I see it.  I see it.  All right.  Let me click this link in my Chrome.  Bleeding edge.  Yes, this is exciting.  App RTC that appspot.com.  So what we need to do is write a little app of our very own.  Hello, Chad.  Hey, I'm going to have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, show my screen.  So there's your screen.  There's my there's your screen.  Oh, wow.  He's getting fancy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's a screen within screens that you just show the full screen because that confuses  him.  Yeah, sorry.  Bam.  Yeah, this is my way.  This is my laptop screen right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  This is one full screen.  Wow.  Yeah, there's my full screen.  How did you do that?  I double clicked it.  Oh, so if I double click you, you did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, so now it's not quite what we want because we still want to get rid of that.  The picture.  Yeah, you can write that on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sure we get rid of that.  And we're both in four by three, which is no, that's all right.  It looks pretty good.  Yeah, that's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This would have saved me carrying a 10 pound machine to Davos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly, because this well, I don't know if Chrome OS has the requisite version 25.  Yeah, it has version 25.  Yeah, it has the beta channel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not on beta too.  You're not?  No, that's the thing is if it was in Chrome 23.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Can you turn my mic off?  Yeah.  And turn the audio on from your computer.  Let's just hear what the audio sounds like because the things we care a lot about is  It's OK.  It's not great.  Now I'm talking to my laptop, so I have to talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the problem.  You got to plug in the mic.  I got a headset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, so you know what?  I don't think that's horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, but this should be able to pull whatever we plug into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Huh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now I don't have to send Gina a new Mac Mini.  See, there we go.  No, it's a you know, this is the problem with.  Open source codecs often don't they prioritize for bandwidth, not for quality.  One of the things we like to call my Chromebook started using Skype so early on.  Yeah, let's try it.  You're going to call.  I call Jeffrey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it's one six four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, wait, wait.  Maybe you should just put it in Doc chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Isn't it only good to just be once?  All right, hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I just think a lot of people would try to call it.  Oh, I see.  Oh, God.  OK, I got it.  Got it.  So you should be able to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's exactly why.  And this is why the show ran three hours.  Yeah, my wife's going to kill me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But we got 10 minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You got 10 minutes to the birthday party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  OK, I'll send it to you, Chad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK, while they're working on this, I'll tell you what, Chad, let me do a hover commercial  while they're working on this and and I'll let you guys continue on.  Just show show my screen and I'll show you hover dot com.  Actually it's what is there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here we are.  Sorry, Rob.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hover dot com slash twig.  So what is hover?  Hover is the alternative to bar.  Raffaele kissing a nerd making loud slurping sounds.  It is the better way to register your domain and register your disgust.  Isn't that nice?  You can register a domain and your disgust at the same time with hover dot com.  I think the folks at two cows who are nice Canadians, by the way, and love their Tim  They said there's got to be a better way than the way some of these other registrars are  doing.  You know, you've had the experience.  You go you register domain name and then 50 clicks later you finally got it because you  have to say, no, I know I don't want that service.  No, I don't want that service.  No, I don't want that.  Not with hover.  Very simple.  You give them the domain name within two clicks.  You own it.  It's affordable.  They've got all the TLDs, you know, the top level domains you'd want like dot com dot  net dot org dot tv dot pro dot mobi dot biz country codes as well dot us dot ca dot uk  dot Asia.  And by the way, because a lot of the dot com addresses people want are not available, they  will also suggest dot net addresses to you.  A lot of times the dot net is really a great alternative to dot com.  Everybody recognizes it.  You don't have to explain it.  Even with twit dot tv.  We often have to say, no, it's not twit dot tv dot com.  It's twit dot tv.  You don't have a problem with dot net.  Great documentation, tutorials, forums.  It is great for email.  They don't do hosting and they're not going to upsell you on the hosting, but it's very  easy to use it for a website and set it up.  They have a great, by the way, support policy when you call their toll free number 866-731-6556.  That's right on the web page.  You don't have to remember that for support.  You will get a support representative live 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern, Monday through Friday,  and they will not put you on hold.  They're empowered to fix your problem and get it done.  Let me talk to somebody.  No, they'll do it all.  I am a big fan of Hover.  All my domains are now registered at Hover.  I moved them all over there.  They have a great concierge service to make that possible.  Very nice domain management console.  And by the way, one of the reasons they don't have to upsell you so much is because they  have built in who is privacy.  So they just include it.  I wish you would try this.  You can let those other companies know.  There's a better way.  Hover.com slash twig.  By the way, you'll get 10% off your domain name registration when you use that URL.  Hover.com slash twig.  All right.  Can we see Jeff now on his Chrome?  We can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We can.  So here it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, it looks just exactly.  Actually, wait a minute.  That looks better than Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it better?  Am I less pink?  Am I less?  It's better than Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The stupid Chromebook camera is better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's no worse.  The frame rate is a little slower, but it's not nearly as pixelated.  Yeah.  The sound is the same.  I think we can start.  Ah, would the EM audio work?  I guess it would.  I bet you the Chromebook supports USB audio.  I've got to play with that.  I don't know where I would know that yet.  It does.  You can plug a USB headset into your Chromebook.  Okay.  So Kevin Purdy says it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, see, there is no way for me to talk to the browser to say only use this audio  interface.  And at the moment, this app doesn't, or this web app doesn't have any integration for me  to say choose this one over a different one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, this is, again, this app is just an example.  Right.  It's a demo.  On AppSpot.  They have an API, and the point is I think that they would encourage you to write your  own.  Right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  We just need a programmer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't even know how to just use my headset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You should be able to just plug it in, right, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, most USB headsets into most Chromebooks, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The question is, would the WebRTC use it?  I guess it would.  And, you know, the good news is Google dogfoods this.  I mean, they've been using RTC to get work done for a long time.  Try again.  No, I don't think so.  We might have to start a new call for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you guys are 0.1 alpha testing live on the air.  So, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, this is working.  So, the air tells me in the chat room that when you allow camera audio use, there is  an options dropdown.  Ah.  You can choose with device selection, and it is in the API.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, the first time, ah, so we really, what we should do is use this API to write our  own tool.  And among other things, what it could do is local recording.  So if there were audio issues, we could get the local audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It might be an open source option.  I will email you about this, Kevett, and Leo, so you won't have to hire a programmer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is cool.  This is really interesting to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And Gina, what would you, what is it in?  Is it, would you write it in C, C or Python?  I mean, it's just an API.  I guess you could write it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just an API.  You can write it in whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I hate to do it in Java.  It's not Java.  It's HTML5.  It's JavaScript.  It's HTML5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I got a whole bunch of command before I can't get back.  I don't remember how I got it.  Don't worry about it.  All right.  Okay.  Enough.  This is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is good.  This is a good thing.  This is a good thing.  And the fact that you were able to do both at the same time is a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah!

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  For those listening on audio, just be glad.  And now it's time for our tool, our tip, and our number of the week, starting with a tip  from Gina Trapani.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a cool little Google Drive feature that I was unaware of.  I guess it's been around for a while and Kevin actually has written this up in Fast Company,  so I'm hoping he's going to back me up.  You can host web pages publicly on Google Drive.  So what you do is you upload a folder.  What?  I didn't know that.  I was excited by this.  Certain kind of web pages.  So you upload a folder and it's got to have, say, an index.html file and you can include  CSS and JavaScript, whatever you need.  And then you can share that folder and in the share options, there is an option to share  publicly on the web and then you will get a URL that's something like googledrive.com  slash host and then some long folder name and your site.  So Kevin, you wrote this up on Fast Company and in fact you put together a little Bootstrap  based site.  Bootstrap is Twitter's HTML framework for making nice looking websites pretty quickly.  This looks really nice.  This is pretty simple.  It's a matter of uploading the folder to Drive and then sending it to the public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So any site that basically is just text, images, CSS, and JavaScript can run off of Drive.  Now to get it published, you have to...  There's a complicated way of doing it through the API and there's just a hacker way of modifying  the URL.  So you have to kind of know how to create a folder in Google Drive and modify the URL  to give out the right one.  But yeah, it's pretty great for testing, just testing sites and seeing how it looks to people  and it's pretty neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One interesting use of this.  So you can't upload PHP scripts or Python scripts or anything like that, right?  I don't think so, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No PHP, I know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They have to be just kind of flat HTML files.  But I heard one person said that they downloaded their Twitter archive, which actually comes  as a package of HTML files that you can search through and things and just upload it to Drive.  Oh, that's neat.  So they can kind of make their Twitter archive public and anybody can search through it.  It's got that nice search and stuff.  So I think Facebook also offers a download and export, which is just all HTML.  Basically anything that's like a package, a folder full of HTML files that you want  to quickly share, you can put this on Drive and make public on the web.  Dropbox does offer something similar, but I just I didn't know the drive did it.  So that was one of my fun little discoveries on Drive.  And I guess this has been around for a couple of months.  I just didn't know about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Very cool.  Is there is there somewhere we can go to figure out how to do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, my hacker had a good post that explained how to do it and include the URL hack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I love the idea of downloading my hosting my own Twitter account on Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think it's I don't think it's a hack anymore.  I think when you just share your folder, you share a folder and the visibility options  are private, anyone with a link or public on the web and you just public on the web.  And then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So wow.  And it supports JavaScript, CSS, HTML.  So it sounds like almost any web page would work fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you're right, Kevin, that you do have to do have to kind of to get the URL to get  the public URL, which kind of involves a long custom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but there's a commenter on the Lifehacker page is just titled host web pages on Google  Drive.  And one of the commenters is like, just, you know, share the folder, remove all the nonsense  from the URL and pretend this.  So still a little hacky, but not too bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  So Google host web pages on Google Drive and Lifehacker and the full instructions are there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then you just modify your hover domain registration to point to that page.  Yep, yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  As you go.  Way for the DNS to propagate.  Talked about product placement.  You're so good.  You could work at Tim Hortons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did you, Kevin Purdy, find anything you wanted to tell us about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, sure.  So I play Ingress.  I'm sorry to admit that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I should have played it in New Orleans.  I didn't even think of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to apologize to post office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's much better if you're in a big metropolitan area.  Buffalo is a is an Ingress hotbed, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We are fighting the Enlightenment every day.  So we're going to downtown got taken over and all the blue folks move out to the suburbs.  It's like weird kind of blue flight.  Don't let's not even talk about it.  So there's a really good blog post called the demographic, the demographics of Ingress.  It was based on a survey, very unscientific, that someone just posted to Google Plus, Twitter,  IRC, Reddit.  So a little bit of self-selection in a self-selecting game.  But Ingress, the Google game that is kind of geo-based and everything, it's a really,  really great post that talks about not only just kind of some things you'd assume like  the breakup of gender, which is I believe mostly male.  Anglophile males are kind of the main players of the game.  And, you know, let's see, 13% libertarian, which kind of breaks normal population stats.  It's 7% anarchist.  But then it gets really interesting as you go through, because you find out like how  many more people say that they're walking more because of Ingress, how many more people  are seeing public places they wouldn't have seen before.  24% lots of post offices.  Yeah, 24% have gone cycling to find a new spot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Cycling is a good way to do Ingress.  You need to get around fast.  You need mobility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But then it points out how many people have said they've driven somewhere to play Ingress,  which I'm sure is not Google's idea of a great blah, blah, blah.  It's a really cool post.  It talks all, it gives you a great idea, a look at what is happening in Ingress, who's  playing it, how they're playing it, how often.  It opens up a very kind of quietly developing game.  So the demographics of Ingress, and that was on space druid dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I saw someone playing in Petaluma when I walked outside of the studio and it was crazy.  You look like you're really insane.  Because they were walking by and their phone was talking to them going, oh my, I don't  know, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you turn off sounds, the thing you do when you get to game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh really?  Oh, because I haven't done that yet.  You should.  It's kind of embarrassing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Chad, you shouldn't talk about your boss that way.  No, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  In fact, you really pretty much sound like a terrorist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it sounds like you're getting instructions from the office.  Yeah, yeah.  Go to the node and hack it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  You're just trying to find a certain point on a school property.  Whatever.  What's the big deal?  What's the big deal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's an interesting game.  There's a very good Ingress community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Acquiring position.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Lock on established.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That doesn't sound at all bad.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's been a long time since your last login.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  I've been busy.  So now I'm not anywhere near.  Petaluma is so small, there's really no point in playing the game.  There's only like, it's a triangle.  There's three points.  Are you and Chad in the same?  They all work in your office.  Yeah.  Well, it doesn't use our office.  It uses the post office, the fire station.  Right Chad?  It's like, yeah, it tends to be like public places.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you and Chad in the same faction?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I am in the resistance.  Yeah, so yeah, we are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're blue.  What?  You're Enlightenment?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  Enlightened baby.  What?  No, you're not enlightened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's just a misnomer.  You actually are the man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How could you say you're enlightened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the idea was to make either side seem like it could be the good guys or the bad  guys, but it's very vague.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a free game, but you have to get an invite and apparently they're still not public.  So good luck.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nice to see new greens down near Petaluma.  Gives my boys something to look forward to.  Oh boy.  I think the war is on.  So you turn off the sound right away.  I should have done that.  It's just weird.  And by the way, another point from this article, the average amount of money people spent playing  Ingress is $80.  I don't know if what that's all about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you count driving costs, going to coffee shops they wouldn't have gone to and things  like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a number.  But let's get the real number of the week for Mr. Jeff Travis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, because I have to go on a birthday due with my son, I won't go into the launch into  a long screed about how the French blackmailed Google into giving them 60 million euros to  develop the future of newspapers.  I won't go into that.  Instead, how could I not on this show of all shows have as the number of weeks the largest  prime number yet discovered 17,425 170 digits is two times itself times 500 5000.  I'm sorry to multiply by itself.  Fifty seven thousand eight hundred eighty five.  Sorry.  I will have to multiply by itself.  Fifty seven million eight hundred eighty five thousand one hundred sixty one times minus  one.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  To the power of that minus one of that.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it's the largest prime number yet discovered.  Your number of the week is actually 21.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's Jake Jarvis's birthday.  Happy birthday, Jake.  We'll see you later, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are the notifications better?  I'm so tired of getting new interactions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
