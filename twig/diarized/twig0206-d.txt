Gina Trapani, founding editor of Lifehacker.  She's a SmarterWear.org.  And what's the name of your podcast at 5x5.tv?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hello, it's called In Beta.  In Beta.  It's on Wednesday mornings.  Yep, yep, check it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gina is not in beta.  She is full release.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh no, no, I'm like pre-alpha.  I got a lot of work to do.  I got a lot of work to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, do I know that feeling.  Also with us, Mr. Jeff Jarvis.  Hey, we're glad to have you.  We thought you'd be on a plane,  but I guess you came home early.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I just came home on time, which Newark is amazing.  Congratulations.  Thank you, yes.  I went to Brussels, I went to Rome for a day,  then back to Brussels, then London, and now I'm here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow, wow, wow.  And you saw Vint Cerf speaking in Rome, it looked like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I saw him speaking in Rome, and then I interviewed him  in London at the Guardian Act debate, which was a ball.  I can't wait for the video to be up,  and I'll send it to you all.  It was just great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It'll be on The Guardian?  It's amazing, yeah.  He is the sweetest guy.  I love Vint Cerf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll give you the punchline of the whole thing.  So we finished, we talked about lots of fascinating things,  the NSA, security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow, I'd love to hear what he thinks about NSA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah, we can talk about that in a second.  Yeah, but the punchline was at the end, I said,  oh, and Vint just moved to London.  And I figured he would just, I said, Vint, why London?  Figuring he would just heap praise on the audience,  he said, have you heard of Downton Abbey?  He said, my wife has Downton Abbeitis.  And we had to visit every darn huge house there is,  and now we're living in London for six months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't that neat?  He's very devoted to his wife, by the way.  It's really sweet, the two of them.  And she's deaf, but had a cochlear implant.  And he was, or was it him?  No, it was her, I think.  He's also hard of hearing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's very hard of hearing.  And there was a moment, I like to go out when I do events,  and I play Oprah, or Phil, depending upon your metaphor,  and I go into the room with the microphone,  and I keep conversation going, and so on and so forth.  And when I went out, Vint very nicely said,  I could have a problem with this.  I may need you up here, Jeff, to help me with questions.  And so I ran back up, and so then somebody said something,  well, I'll speak louder, and he said, no, no, no,  that's not the problem.  He said, Jeff speaks American.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  More specifically, East Coast, more specifically, New York.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Vint was just charming as could be,  both Rome and London, he's just the greatest.  Oh, that's neat.  What a thrill and honor to be able to talk to Vint Cerf,  someone who has changed the world this much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's not improper to call him the father.  He would demure, but it's not improper  to call him the father of the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not at all, he's joke, I'm sure it's the standard joke  he uses often, and has for years.  He said the question is, who's the mother?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He has been using that for years.  I will vouch for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, he also said that his son was basically born  the same year as the net.  And so his son used to ask him,  dad, is the internet my brother?  Wow, if you're the father.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And of course, Aaron Newcomb's here from NetApp.  Yeah, good to be here.  But you've been on every show,  you were on All About Android last night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, All About Android last night,  so I just pulled up the cot,  and then got out this morning.  Regular on Floss?  Yeah, they didn't have to move the cameras or anything.  It was all dialed in.  Were you on Floss this morning?  No, Floss was on hiatus, I think, this morning.  A little break.  Yeah, it was on last week, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, lots to talk about.  We're gonna get our change log in just a bit.  I hardly know where to begin.  There's so much going on.  Somebody in the chat room said,  what, I just got an email, Google's killing Latitude.  Oh no, I actually, I and a few others used it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a story in the rundown  toward the end of the Google part.  I put it in there.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  August 9th.  August 9th, so we've got one month.  Latitude, for those who don't know,  was kind of Google's four square, right?  Right, yep.  Very patriotic, by the way.  Thank you, Chad, for that transition.  Left over from the 4th of July, apparently.  So, how are they gonna do this, Google Plus location sharing?  Because right now, when I travel around,  Latitude automatically follows me, keeps track of it,  checks me into places that I enter  that I've given permission to do so automatically,  and publishes it to the, I keep it public,  you have a choice, obviously,  but publishes it to my Google Plus page.  What happens now?  What's the new thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I understand that the new thing is just location  in Google Plus, that you can add location  to your Google Plus post.  What, it's manual?  Yeah, and yeah, I guess it will be manual.  I forgot about that automatic checking in.  That is crazy, Leo.  You may be the only person who had that enabled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Go on, stalk me, see if I care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Crazy, automatically check me in.  You got nothing to hide, I like that.  I just think it's cool.  I don't think that automatic feature  is going to happen, but they're just moving into,  I mean, so Google, it's not like Google  doesn't have location app anymore.  It's just all gonna be Google Plus.  Do you think?  And honestly, I would be surprised  if at some point they set it up so that at Google Plus,  can you imagine Google Now popping up and being like,  hey, it looks like you're at your favorite tea shop.  Wanna check in?  Yes, you know?  But that obviously doesn't do that now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is just another effort on Google's part  of trying to draw people into Google Plus, though, right?  Because on Latitude, I could share,  I had it, like with my family, could see where I was.  I wasn't as brave as Leo,  but my family could see where I was.  It didn't matter what email system they were on or what,  they just had to be a Latitude user  signed up for that service and they could see where I was  and I could see where they were, whatever.  Now, I think the difference is gonna be,  you have to go to Google Plus or interface with Google Plus.  And so it's drawing the eyeballs  towards Google Plus that they're after.  And I think that's smart on their,  some people might not like it,  but I think it's smart on their part.  It's more Google Pluses everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and it's probably also,  see, this is the point, they know this information,  but they don't wanna let everybody know they know, right?  So look, and this is very useful.  This is my Latitude location history.  Notice it doesn't say Latitude,  so maybe they'll still offer this.  This is in your dashboard, this is not public.  But how much time I spent at work, that's the green part.  How much time at home, that's the yellow part.  Time spent out, that's the blue part.  Places I went, times I spent at my house,  133 hours last week, 39 hours a week on average.  I have traveled 128,000 miles.  This stuff is great.  I mean, I think this is-  That's great data.  That's great data.  You know, you're a data nerd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I tell you, when you showed that to us,  I actually considered turning on Latitude,  and I decided not to.  You shouldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You shouldn't, because you're a woman.  Seriously, I hate to say that,  but don't you think that's true, that that's the risk?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, can't you turn it on just for yourself?  I mean, couldn't you just turn it on just for yourself?  I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you got the data, you just didn't share.  So it just keeps track of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, without sharing it, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, what do you get  when you go to your location history dashboard?  Do you get this, you don't get this stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Where is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's in the dashboard, google.com slash dashboard,  and then scroll down to location history.  So I'm playing back a video of my location  over the last 30 days.  It's actually gonna show me going around,  it even shows me going to Colorado with my son.  I mean, it's pretty cool.  You can export this to KML,  it's gonna show the timestamps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we're misinterpreting this.  Is this a case like Reader, where Google just says people,  they're cool, but people weren't using it, or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's interesting that this wasn't  a spring cleaning post, right?  I mean, normally the way that Google shuts things down  is they do a spring cleaning post,  and then there's a list of products you've never heard of,  or you forgot about, that are getting shut down.  This latitude announcement came  in the Google Maps update announcement,  because they removed the ability to check in the latitude  from the Maps mobile app, which is new,  which I'll talk about in the changelog.  So it was kind of like,  hey, we've got this whole new Maps thing.  Oh, by the way, that old feature,  that's not there anymore,  because we're sunsetting latitude,  and you can just check in on Google Plus from here on in.  So it was a weird, they didn't make any comment  about how there just weren't enough people using latitude.  But let's be honest, how many people do you know?  I mean, Leo is the only person I knew who used latitude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Aaron's looking at his dashboard, and you have to opt in.  You have to manually enable location settings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right, so there is location settings in Google Plus,  in your Google Plus settings.  If you click on that little home thing,  and then go down to settings,  which is always confusing to me,  because I'm used to the Google settings  being on the upper right-hand side.  Once you find that, you can scroll all the way down,  and you'll see location settings.  So you can enable location sharing,  and you can enable it only for certain circles.  Including just you.  Including just you.  So you can enable it for only you,  you can enable it for public,  you can enable it for certain circles.  It's the whole Google Plus selection thing  like you would normally see on a post.  So that is in there.  I don't know how long it's been there.  Maybe it's always been there, but I just saw it today.  I think it's always been there,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because I remember turning it on.  I like it.  I like having that all information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I turned this on for a trip to New York,  so I actually do have data here.  But then I guess I turned it off,  when I got back home to San Diego.  Because honestly, I work at home,  so I really don't go a lot of places.  Yeah, yeah, most of mine is not that interesting.  It's not that interesting.  It's just like, here's where I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think it's interesting, though,  to see how much you go out.  Maybe you should go out more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true.  That's true.  I actually had Google Now ask me  if I worked at the coffee shop,  because that's the one place I go.  Do you work here?  Why do you keep going there?  Is this work?  Do you want to accept this as work?  That's really funny.  Because I'm normally just home, otherwise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now this is tied into, and maybe this is the reason,  a new Google Maps app for Android phones and tablets  coming soon to iPad and iPhone.  And you guys are just downloading it now.  Well, by the way, there's Jeff.  We got him back, so we had a little trouble with Jeff.  So I haven't played with it at all.  I don't have it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I got it yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what's new?  This is Jason's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's a lot of new features in here.  For one, it looks a lot more.  If you've been using the Google Maps preview  in Chrome or for your desktop, then you'll recognize,  it looks a lot similar to that interface.  Very clean interface right now.  Some of the things that they finally-  Ooh, I like this.  Yeah.  So one of the things is you can see,  it has a lot better integration with places  and what's near you and what's around you.  They enabled cards for what's around you.  So apparently if you touch on the map,  and then you should be able to get a choice  of what's there or what's around your location,  and you can actually pull up cards.  There's some pretty good video of it  on the link in the rundown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is a very different UI.  And they've gone to this new,  I think this is a new UI you're seeing a lot on mobile.  This tab that slides over.  Facebook was the first place I saw it.  A lot of apps are starting to use this.  Instead of the overflow menu  that we used to see a lot in Android,  there's a little, you know,  ton of tab in the lower left-hand corner  that opens up a sidebar with a lot of other things.  Traffic, public transit, bicycling,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  satellite, Google Earth. That's a new  Android UI element.  It's called a navigation drawer.  Yeah. I like it.  I think it's- Yeah, I just added it  to the do text.  And in fact, like for apps that have an action bar  across the top, which Maps does not,  you'll see the hamburger icon, the three dashes.  Is that what that's called?  Yeah, the hamburger, right?  Because it's the two buns and the meat.  In Gmail, you see that in Gmail.  Like if you launch Gmail, you see the little hamburger  and you can tap on it and expand the navigation drawer.  But I agree. I really love the navigation drawer.  And what's nice about the nav drawer too,  is that when you go landscape or you're on a tablet,  often it can auto expand,  which we also just put in none to do text.  Anyway, sorry, I didn't mean to hijack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm glad.  No, that's why we love having a developer on here  to explain why this appears in some apps and not in all.  So this is something that Google's probably pushing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a fairly modern new UI,  but it is a part of the standard Android UI elements now.  So you'll see it more and more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They've also added-  The  glass and all that is going to use a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  You also, you see there,  they've actually expanded the public transit  or the transportation mode offerings.  You're not seeing it right there,  but there in certain screens,  like when you do navigation or directions,  it'll offer you a choice and it'll say,  I want to minimize my time to like minimize  the amount of walking I have to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I can have-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They've always had, for a long time,  they've had public transit or driving.  When I was in Europe,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it was just the greatest thing  to be able to use the public transit.  Yeah, and so they've expanded that,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  that ability to really drill down  on exactly what type of transportation modes you want to do.  The other thing they've added is a more detailed  traffic information and the ability to reroute around traffic.  I think they mentioned that at Google I.O.  Oh, interesting.  So they've added that,  Waze style.  We thought they might kill latitude

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  once they acquired Waze,  but this is well before that,  and this map update is well before that.  Apparently Places has been updated as well.  And then-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it will alert you real time while you're driving  if there's been an accident or an event and reroute you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yep, and it'll tell you how much longer it is,  or there's a new route, do you want to take it?  Yeah, it's really, really nice.  I really think Waze was a defensive buy for them, right?  Because they've had to have this ability  in the works for a while.  So they bought Waze because they didn't want  anybody else to buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but Aaron, it's not just the defense.  I think that Waze does have critical mass  of reporting users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, yes, that too.  Yep, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cool, I don't want to scoop the change log, but-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, that's okay, that was a big release.  It's huge.  I'm glad we demoed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You do it to me all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know, I know.  It's a time we did.  Okay, this is probably also in the change log,  but I've been holding off on putting Hangouts in my Gmail  because I still use Gmail to make phone calls.  Finally, they've put phone calls into Gmail.  I mean, they put phone calls into Hangouts,  and now I can use it in my Gmail.  And I like the interface better.  And they even said very specifically,  this is a step in replacing Google Voice with Hangouts.  So another, I got to think another service  that is on the block is Google Voice, and now I'm afraid.  Right.  So I use that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm just hoping that all of Google Voice's functionality  will get ported over into Hangouts,  and it just means that they'll be the same product,  integrated with other Hangout stuff under the same name.  That's what I'm hoping for,  because Voice is my primary number.  Because like you, Leo, I've got a bunch of phones,  I've got a bunch of test devices,  and I just like that whatever phone I have rings, right?  Because everybody has that one Google Voice number.  You know, Voice still has this problem,  doesn't support things like MMS,  and that's something that Hangouts is really good at.  I have to say, I'm totally Hangouts at this point.  I install the Chrome extension, I have it on my phones.  My co-founder and I use Hangouts.  Kevin and I use Hangouts.  I love it.  Because it's kind of rich chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can I use Hangouts on my phone to make...  It's that was not in the announcement.  To make calls is not, is it in there now?  I don't think it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just desktop, just desktop right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just desktop users.  So you can do it from Gmail,  or they said you could also do it from HTML.  I'm not sure exactly what that means.  WebRTC.  HTML.  WebRTC, is that not, no?  But they did not say Android, iPhone,  or mobile in the announcement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and I don't see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it's got a couple of different features.  I'm totally scooping the changelog, but I don't care.  You can do like...  Play the changelog theme,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and then we'll just make this the changelog.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Google changelog.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  Now we're safe.  Anything goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're officially in the changelog.  I haven't had a chance to try this yet,  but this new calling from Hangouts and the desktop,  you can add, let's see.  Oh, where did I see this?  You can add multiple calls.  Multiple phone numbers, video participants,  in the same call.  You can play sound effects, like applause or laughter.  Is that, yeah, I saw that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if that's an improvement.  I'm a little nervous about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But kind of fun, kind of funny,  especially if it's a conference call situation,  or if you're working, you know.  And so it'd make call from Hangouts.  You can either actually look for the new phone icon  in Gmail.  I actually haven't seen it to show up for me,  because that's because I'm normally in my app's Gmail.  Or from the new call a phone menu item in Google+,  and the Chrome extension.  The Chrome extension actually made my Hangouts experience  way, way better.  So I highly recommend that if you're using Hangouts.  So this is good.  Free calls within the US,  and international rates are pretty low.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Question.  Young people, of whom I know a few,  don't use, don't make phone calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, period.  Are they using video conferencing a lot?  And then what does the phone motif do to that for them,  I wonder?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So my totally subjective observation is that  the youngins really like video conferencing.  I sort of missed it.  I'm actually too old.  I'm in the space where I hate making phone calls,  but I also don't love video calls either.  But I think one of the more interesting things  about Hangouts and Google,  the Googlers we talked about, Vic and other Googlers,  we talked to said, you know, that the young people,  particularly at Google, were on Hangouts all night,  kind of just, you know, messing around and joking around,  and would just sort of leave it on all the time  while they were working and like, and talk to their friends.  I have also heard that other younger people  do that same thing.  I don't, but I can see that that's, you know,  how that's sort of interesting.  I think that Hangouts has a very,  has a lot of use from a certain kind of,  a certain demographic.  And I do think it's the younger generation.  I wonder why they've,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know my kids were on I Am all the time.  Why not have video?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why feel the need to bring phone calls in?  That's what I'm just trying to, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I see what you mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For us people over 20.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, if you want to call someone over 25.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When your friends are out camping  and they don't have an internet connection,  and that's literally happened to me a few times.  God, how do they survive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think the real story here is ubiquity, right?  I mean, did you guys cover the fact that you can,  from Google Voice, you can call into Hangouts now?  No.  Like you can get a, you can get,  if you have Hangouts running,  you can actually set an option in Google Voice,  say, call my phone first and then call Hangouts.  And I've actually taken a few inbound calls  from outside on telephone systems and Hangouts.  And it's worked brilliantly.  People can hear me.  They don't know that I'm on,  talking through a webcam speaker.  I mean, maybe they do and they just,  they're just too polite to say anything.  But I've taken a few calls like that  and it works really well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Boy, does this sound like the death of voice.  This is the death of voice then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So wait, this is in your Google Voice settings?  Yeah.  There's an option to say, send this to,  so okay, so I'm looking forward calls to,  so I can forward calls to my cell phones.  There's a forward calls to Google Chat.  I don't see the Hangouts.  Maybe I just have a copy yet.  Maybe it's Google Chat and it just,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  maybe it's Google Chat and it just came in over Hangouts  because I'm using Hangouts in Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because you're using Hangouts now.  That must be it.  So if you forward call to Google Chat, interesting,  interesting.  Yeah, I really hope that they don't,  that they don't kill Google Voice  or there isn't a time when Google Voice  doesn't have its full functionality  while they forward it over to Hangouts.  But it seems pretty clear that Hangouts  is gonna be it from here on in.  Just as long as it supports old school text messaging  and MMS would be also be really nice.  All integrated into Hangouts.  I might actually forgive them for the whole accident.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it needs a phone number.  That's what you want.  Yeah, it needs a phone number.  And that's the main thing we wanna keep  is that there's numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the main thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, that single number.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It has to to compete with Skype, doesn't it?  Yeah, Skype gives,  well, Skype you have to pay for a number, but yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's what I'm saying.  But I think Google can't go without phone numbers.  I don't think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are they trying to compete with Skype?  What are they doing?  This is Babel, right?  This is their unified messaging platform slowly emerging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, yep.  It has to be interoperable with the phone system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the issue.  It needs to be interoperable with the phone system  both in terms of calls and texts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's the problem with voice right now.  Voice is weird because if you use voice on your phone,  it calls you, right?  Right, right.  And so it's not VoIP.  It's a phone call using Google's servers.  If you call out,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  if you have Google Voice on your phone and you call out,  Google Voice basically dials the number for you.  It doesn't call you back.  If you have the app.  It used to call you back.  It used to call you back before there was an app.  But now it's a setting in the app  and it'll actually place the call for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they can now turn it into a true VoIP solution  and eliminate that weird callback thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But there is, there's a,  like they're using a landline number  to call a server that then translates.  Like if you look the way it works,  it like they assign weird numbers to your friends  that are local somewhere in Nevada or something.  For a while there, this is all sort of black box now.  You don't see it in the new app.  But in the beginning when it was Grand Central  and kind of early when Google had it,  there was all sorts of weirdness about calling out  and calling you back.  But now it's a pretty seamless experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're, Aaron's making the call right now.  Did it?  But what phone number was that call coming  into your recipient from?  Your phone number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's supposed to.  Your Google Voice number?  Yeah, it's supposed to do some tricky caller ID settings  so that it comes in through your number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As long as it looks like your number, that's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It usually does.  But I noticed that sometimes,  depending on where it calls out from,  like Gina was saying,  sometimes you get a weird Nevada number  or you get a weird, some weird number comes up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I still get that when people,  when I use Google Voice for text messaging  and I always, it's weird numbers.  The text messages are coming from some strange number.  Yeah, that's true too.  That's not good.  I mean, my mom, this is, there's no,  she's not at 313.  But there's, but this conversation we're having  is with a 313 number.  So that's all gotta get out of the way.  That's like HTTPS, it's all going slash slash.  We don't need to know the details.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It should be, it should look like VoIP  even if it's not VoIP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It should, I've definitely had a few of the like,  no, wait, really, what is your real number?  Like conversation with my family a couple of times.  And it's like, no, this is my real number.  It's a little bit of a weird number, but it works.  Yeah, so they just need to make that totally seamless.  And I hope that that, I hope that all of that  gets into Hangouts, you know, plus some.  It doesn't look like they're doing,  there's not a lot of movement on Voice.  Even if you look at the Android app for Voice,  it's kind of, it's looking a little aged.  It's looking old.  They're not working on that.  My optimistic self is thinking that there's a whole team  of little hamster engineers at Google  making it work perfectly with Hangouts right now.  That's what I'm hoping.  So I should finish up the change log.  Yes.  What else do we have?  Chrome 28 comes with rich notifications  for apps and extensions.  This is only on Windows.  I haven't had a chance to see it yet.  It's coming from Mac and Linux soon.  Chrome 28 also has Blink.  This is the first release of Chrome that has Blink,  which if you remember is Google's fork of WebKit,  the super fast fork of WebKit.  And you can check the Blink ID yourself.  You go to chrome colon slash slash version,  and I'll show you that Blink is there  in your installation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is Chrome OS 28 the same as Chrome  in terms of the feature set?  Yeah, I think so.  Because I'm on 28.  Beta on Chromebook is 28 now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Beta on Chromebook, right.  But I think this is Windows only has the rich notifications  in Blink.  I think that, I think, well, let's see.  Next web is saying Mac and Linux coming soon.  Didn't say anything about the Chromebook.  Sorry, you're not seeing Blink  in your Chrome version there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I haven't looked yet.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not sure why they released this for Windows first,  but you can see the network.  On the next web, Blink,  they have a couple of nice screenshots  of what the rich toast looks like.  Looks like a good one.  What's rich toast?  Well, you know when you call a notification  on Windows toast, you know the toaster?  No, come on, come on.  Like the notification comes out like a slice of toast.  What does rich toast look like?  And rich, because they're-  Is there chocolate, Nutella, Vegemite?  There are bottles on it where you can interact with it.  Come on.  Come on, get with the program.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Rich toast and hamburgers.  I'm waiting for the scone interface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So toast is notifications.  Yeah, the toast is like the notification  that pops up out of your status bar, like a slice of toast.  That goes back to early days of Microsoft.  So I called it a rich toast because it has,  it's the toast, it's the slice of bread that kind of pops up.  But then there's also, you can see there's buttons there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you're coining that,  I think you should call it buttered toast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Buttered toast, no, no.  This is not-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's rich toast, I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is what happens when a developer learns  too many UX terms.  It just keeps going around, name dropping UX.  You've got hamburgers and rich toast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The word chrome itself is a UI term, a UX term.  It was what the Firefox folks called the user interface  on top of the Gecko engine was the chrome.  Was the chrome.  Was the chrome.  And Google picked that up as the name of their browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So one of the chat rooms says  you should call it a cronut, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A cronut, that's a New York thing.  I have to get someone to try one of those.  Oh, you don't know this one, Leo?  This is a pretty, this is a New York-centric thing, Jeff.  Explain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, there is one bakery that does this very special thing.  It uses croissant dough to make a doughnut  with some kind of creamy thing.  Oh my God.  They can only make so many a day.  So there's a long line.  You can only get two at a time.  It's like the super Nazi.  And then when you leave.  Look at how meaty that looks.  You can, what do you do with tickets?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, that looks so good.  You can sell them for like 40 bucks each.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can scalp a cronut?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  Cronut scalping is the shame of the New York City.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm so disappointed.  Here's my tip, Google image search cronut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's called the man repeller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know why.  There's the line.  It starts like five in the morning.  Is this one place?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One place. Dominic's Ansel Bakery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So have you had one, Jeff?  Is it worth the line?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, look at the cinnamon.  I have no idea.  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are you a doughnut guy?  You're a croissant guy or a doughnut guy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't tell my wife or my cardiologist.  Quite absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Fair enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, that looks good.  These look amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When I was in Paris, I had to have a croissant.  Yeah, but I normally had to have a croissant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So New York invented the cupcake craze.  Is the cronut next?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, but evidently it's so special now.  But I don't know if, why haven't others done this?  Is there a patent involved?  Is there, I don't know.  It's probably very tricky.  It's very, very tricky.  Evidently it's extremely tricky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How tricky could it be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You just dip the round croissant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm following Dominic Ansell on Twitter  because apparently he's tweeting about cronut.  He says, one woman legitimately cried.  We felt so bad.  We looked everywhere to find her the last remaining cronut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Holy cow.  This is where we drive our audience nuts.  I don't know.  From Chipotle to cronut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  From Chrome 28, rich toast to cronut people.  Come on, you don't get this anywhere else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This has got to be in San Francisco somewhere.  Why do we not have cronuts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, hey, hey, what is that?  What is that?  What?  We've got to be in San Francisco.  No, this is the center of the universe fella.  Not anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's, that's Manhattan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You have a boutique.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a city.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's true, he's right.  Sorry Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I prefer my sleepy little fishing village.  But if it doesn't get cronut soon,  I might have to move.  Sleepy little fishing village.  It is a sleepy little fishing village.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is, it is.  Okay, I'm going to get through the change log.  Let's keep going.  We talked about the Google, the new Google Maps app.  Thank you, Aaron, for doing that excellent demo.  That is rolling out of the Play Store over the next few days.  I got it on my phone.  So you should be getting it as well.  And then last bit of change in Google+.  This is kind of interesting.  And I found myself wishing that Twitter would do it.  Google plus is now going to start showing you posts  that your friends have plus wand.  So we'll occasionally highlight posts  that were plus one by people in your circles.  And if you plus one a post, Google writes,  we may highlight it to your friends as well.  So there's lots of settings.  You can visit your settings and you can turn on the volume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is mind blowing.  Because this was always our puzzle,  was why plus one something if no one sees it.  Exactly, exactly.  And for two years, that's been the default behavior.  Yep, and I still plus one things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But then I kind of realized, well, that was pointless.  Nobody's going to notice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you plus one in the forest and nobody's there, does it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the author, the original post author sees it.  So I plus one as a way to say thank you, acknowledged,  as a thumbs up.  So as a pat on the back, not a boy or not a girl.  But this is nice.  I really like this.  I wish the Twitter would show me posts that maybe,  I want to see posts.  Maybe I don't want to see all of my friends retweets.  But I want to see the posts that three or four  of my friends have retweeted.  Yeah, you know what I wish I could do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're right, Gina.  My plus one reflex is now established enough  that I often start to want to plus one a tweet.  And of course I can't.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, but do you favorite?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, because favoritism is different to me.  Favoring it means that I'm saving it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, interesting.  Interesting.  I think that people do, yes, like consider favorites  as read it later.  I kind of look at favorites as a kind of attaboy,  I think I like that a girl as well.  So I think that's why sometimes I see it's odd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think why would somebody save that?  OK, I got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, no.  It's them just saying, hey, because the mobile app  will say, hey, if you favorite one of my tweets,  and because we're friends, on the mobile app,  I'll get a notification that says Jeff Jarvis  favorited your tweet.  And it gives me a warm and fuzzy.  So it's kind of a nice way to say, hey, nice job.  Although you can also use it as read it later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But now not all will be seen just select.  This is like what Facebook does with the selective news feed.  Is there algorithm published?  Do we know how this works?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We don't.  We don't.  But you can turn down the volume.  You can go into your settings.  If you're seeing too many posts that you don't want to see,  you can say, don't show me highlighted plus ones.  You can go in and say, don't highlight the things that I  plus one to my friends.  You have a lot of control here, which is really, really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And where would that, obviously in the Google Plus settings?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, in Google Plus settings.  I'm looking at that post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who can interact?  Who can send you notifications?  Who can comment?  Who can hang out?  Notification delivery.  Wow, there's just so many checks here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See all the content you've created.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google Plus one, plus one on non-Google sites.  No, Google Plus pages.  Automatically add a Google Plus page to my circle.  This is the absurdity of what people post.  This is ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is about controlling your own data.  You get a settings panel that is completely insane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Viewers, upload my photo.  It's just a frigging plus one.  Profile.  Oh, here we go.  Show your, no.  I don't really see it either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It might not have been rolled out to everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's possible it didn't roll out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, now after I go through 100 pages of settings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I did get a little pop up, though, this morning  when I was on Google Plus and I hovered over the plus.  It popped up and told me basically what you just  read, Gina, about how it's going to work.  It said, OK, this may be shared to your friends,  extended circles, if enough people like it.  They'll get a little notification.  I kind of like it and I kind of don't because I've kind of  got my Google Plus locked down the way I want to see it.  And I don't like things flying at me that I didn't explicitly  say I wanted to see.  So when communities first came out, I was like, they were,  you know, I say spamming.  I guess to other people it was helpful.  But they were putting a lot of posts in my timeline  that I didn't want to see.  And so luckily, finally, they came back and corrected that.  So I hope this doesn't add a lot of things that I would  consider spam.  Really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Aaron, I think that every time they've added something,  think of the earliest days of Google Plus, the Scobel days.  Oh.  We got people update and we all complain about it.  And then they fixed it.  We kind of forgot that we were complaining.  Yeah.  Same with the communities things.  And every time they've introduced something new,  it tends to have a little bit of an overdose period.  And then they find the right level.  They're good at that.  And then you just forget the pain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yep.  Unlike Facebook and other sites.  Yes.  Yep.  I agree.  That's why I like Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love Google Plus more and more.  I mean, I think communities, they have the photos  and the communities put me over the top.  Now it's just where I want to live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Photos amazing.  Yep.  I'm going nuts with photos.  And I went nuts on this trip.  My favorite, my favorite auto awesome I've done yet  was a Fish and Chips flickering neon sign.  Cool.  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tell us how you did that, Jeff.  You consciously did that by doing a burst?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just turned the camera to shoot the mini.  OK.  And then uploaded them and I made it.  It was that.  That's it.  If you look at my feed, you should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  I got stuck on you wearing the newspaper hat.  Come on, Andy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He won.  I have a caption for that.  For those who can't see, the Sun newspaper in London  did a hat you could make for Andy Murray and a sun hat.  And I said, finally, there was a good reason to publish the Sun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's it.  Oh, this is a great auto awesome.  I really like this.  That is really neat.  Because it doesn't look like an animated picture.  It's just the sign going off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's also, I did two of them.  There's that one and there's a bigger one.  There's that one too.  Love this.  OK, so say how you did that again.  Just simple.  My camera, my Nikon 1, you just turn it from single shot  to multiple shots, right?  Where we call that.  And hit it down.  Just try to hold still as I can.  Hit it down.  And then when I upload all the photos in the Google+,  wait about two, three minutes.  And then you'll see that it'll catch it.  And do it.  I did one too for a flag waving atop the Union Jack waving  atop Parliament.  So I like those.  Now I'm playing with those where I  can take something where everything is static,  but there is one thing moving in.  Love that.  You auto awesome around that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And most camera phones, I think, have a burst mode.  So presumably, you can also do that with your camera phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have not been able to do it on my camera phone.  My Nexus 4 doesn't seem to have a burst mode,  so unless I'm wrong, maybe it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's an app that actually Jason featured on All About  Android a few weeks ago called Fast Burst Camera that  does a really nice job.  Takes a ton of pictures really, really fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the problem with it is, though,  is that even though I have this huge, humongous amount  of storage now, I'll stick to it.  And I am using this.  What I do now is I sign out of my Chromebook.  I sign into my other account, my Google Plus account,  put in the SD card in the Chromebook,  and it all just goes up.  Bing.  It just syncs my photos completely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's why I like to do it on the camera phone,  because I don't even have to do that step.  But yeah, that's nice.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, this way I could do fancier things with a camera.  But the problem is, suddenly, I'm uploading 268 photos.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm already using over a third of my storage,  and I really don't even upload them.  You need a pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  You're using a third of a terabyte?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, mine, it says 15 gig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you didn't register your pixel.  Register your pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what I got to do.  You got a terabyte.  That's the best reason to get that pixel.  OK, OK.  I got to get on that.  I was like, 15 gig?  What the fuck?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's other reasons, Leon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sure there are.  I wouldn't know that.  But I do know that one.  And I had already bought a lot of storage,  because I think this is great.  I mean, I never have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's getting me into photography in a way that I never have been.  So now, and I'm using all the time three things.  I'm using my camera, phone, my camera, and also my glass.  I took a picture of Vint Cerf with Google Glass in Rome.  What more perfect could you have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you wore your glass in Rome.  How nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah, in Rome, I was at a Google event,  and nobody there had glass.  So I said to the Google people, OK, if I wear it on stage,  I said, yeah, whatever.  You probably don't care.  So I wore it on stage and did a little demo.  And I did it again at Guardian Activate.  And I hammed it up.  I'm doing the, what's the word?  Peacock.  Peacock.  They wouldn't have gotten it in Europe.  But I'm doing that and screaming, OK, glass.  And it gets great laughs.  It works well.  And then I bring somebody on stage, and they get to try it on.  It's a shtick.  Oh, that's a good shtick.  It is a shtick.  And then somebody in Activate, when Vint was on,  Guardian Activate, somebody did the standard shtick about,  well, everybody's following us in the NSA,  and now with this Google Glass.  Oh, god.  I said, whoa, if you got nothing else out of my demo,  what you should have gotten is that it is impossible  to subtly take a picture of Google Glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK, glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, glass.  Take a picture.  Right, yeah.  Forget it.  Let's finish the change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, change what?  It's the world's longest change.  No, wait a minute.  She had more.  I didn't even play the.  Are you done?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, I'm sorry.  Go ahead, play the timpanis.  Good to go.  We have to rewind the tape.  Hold on.  Rewind the cart.  Cart is rewound.  That was the Google change log.  That is Gina Tripani.  Lots more news coming up in just a second,  but first a word from hover.com.  It is the best way to register domains,  to manage your domains.  They've made it simple.  They've made it clean.  There's not a lot of upsell.  If you want to register a domain name, please do me a favor.  Go to hover.com slash twig and check it out.  It's clean.  It's easy.  They just announced something new.  Add Google Apps for your business.  So this is just was announced today,  so I'm not completely up on this.  But when you go to hover.com and register a domain,  you can also use that domain with Google Apps,  and they'll make it very simple for you to do so.  Integrates in.  We do that here.  Mail.twit.tv is a Google Gmail and all of that.  So this is a really great new feature at hover.  If you've got domains registered with other registrars,  you can transfer them to hover very easily.  They have a concierge transfer service.  You'll pay $10 each, but you get an extra year on the domain.  So you extend the domain another year over and above what you  already have left on your domain.  They will do the transfer for you.  You get the great domain management tools.  And as with everything at hover, there  is just no wait telephone support.  If you'd call during regular business hours, which  are very extensive.  Let me give you the business hours.  From 8 PM to 8 PM Eastern time, Monday through Friday,  you'll get a representative who is empowered to help you,  is empowered to fix it.  Because this is what hover was created for.  To do it right.  Domain name registration done right.  I want you to try it.  I use hover for all my domains now, and I'm so happy.  They have great online help, support documentation,  tutorials.  They're part of Two Cows.  And I know you know Two Cows.  They've been around since 1994.  We love them.  They've gone into these businesses  because they knew they needed to be reinvented.  And hover is just great.  They have all the top level domains.com and everything.  I might note that they do offer you the .net address.  Because so many of the .coms, almost all of them are gone.  But they will always tell you what the .net is.  And I think .net is not bad.  I mean hover has all of the .tv, .pro, .mobi, .biz, .ca,  .asia, .us, all of those.  But I think .net is the one to take a look at.  I think it's a, you know, for a lot of people  it's just as popular and common as .com.  It doesn't confuse them.  I still often I'll say twit.tv and they say,  you mean twit.tv.com?  I say no.  Twit.tv.  You don't have that problem with .net so much.  Hover.com slash twig.  You'll get 10% off when you use our offer code twig  on your domain registrations.  10% off standard domain names  when you use the offer code twig.  So go to hover.com slash twig.  Take a look.  And now I love this Google Apps integration.  It makes it so much easier.  $60 per user per year, $6 per user per month.  You'll save 20% and they have a 30 day free trial  so you can see what it's like to add it to your domain.  You can use one you already know or you already own  or you could start fresh.  Hover.com, thank you for your support of this week in Google.  Well, some exciting news from T-Mobile.  They said they were gonna really blow things  out of the water.  They have just announced that you can dump  your smartphone twice a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, so it's okay, it's split that.  Okay, but you pay an extra fee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You pay $10 a month, which is an insurance fee.  And you can be part of JUMP, which stands for,  what is it? How high?  How high?  No, JUMP stands for Just Upgrade My Phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It should be just upgrade my damned phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think for most people, this is like what?  But for people who watch this show,  for everybody at this table, this is good.  Yeah, really good.  Yeah, this is awesome.  You can trade in your T-Mobile smartphone  for a new device subsidized  after a six month waiting period.  They're trying to be the uncarrier, right?  After the initial six months,  the carrier will waive the rest  of what is owed on the device.  I guess you probably have to turn it in, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it says you have to turn it,  to get started, you have to turn your phone.  I think that's what you do.  I think that's probably how they make it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's kind of like rotating phones.  Well, what if you break your phone or something?  It's part of the insurance.  So if the device is broken or has water damage,  you're paying $10 insurance.  There's a deductible,  but in effect you're also getting insurance.  That's what most carriers charge  just for the handset insurance anyway.  So this is just kind of an additional feature.  That's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is good.  Good for T-Mobile.  This is much needed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is why you want competition.  You want a number four carrier.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Definitely.  Because they try harder.  I wish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm on a business plan,  and so they only support the major three.  They don't support T-Mobile.  So I had to go with one of the,  I went with AT&T,  but if they had T-Mobile,  this is exactly the reason I would have chosen T-Mobile  right away if that was an option for me.  And if I was not on a business plan,  if I was on a personal plan,  it would absolutely be either T-Mobile  or one of the second tier ones like Ting or Virgin Mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's, I'm now understanding,  this is part of the EIP program.  So remember T-Mobile eliminated subsidies,  but they do have,  which is basically a subsidy,  an installment plan, right?  They call that the equipment installment program or EIP.  So you go to T-Mobile,  you buy a phone using the EIP,  six months later, you can say,  okay, take this phone back,  I want the Galaxy S5.  They say, okay, you no longer have to pay the EIP  for the old phone.  We're gonna start you on a new one,  and you get the new phone,  but you just have to bring this in.  No contract, right?  There's no contract.  Right.  Right.  The EIP is, I guess, kind of a contract  because you owe them.  It's a charge.  It's a charge.  But there's no annual service contract.  Very interesting.  And this is how my Galaxy S4 is a T-Mobile.  And I have to say,  you gotta check to see if T-Mobile works  in your neck of the woods,  but here T-Mobile's great  because nobody uses it.  So I'm using their HSPA+.  They don't have LTE here,  but it's the 42 megabit HSPA+,  and I'm pretty typically getting 20 megabits down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yep.  You can argue all you want.  Some of the carriers will argue  that they have a faster network, right?  But that's in ideal conditions.  Right.  So like you're saying,  I mean, if you're on T-Mobile and no one else,  like if you go to a baseball game  or if you go to any event,  like I was at the fireworks for 4th of July,  I couldn't get hardly any download  because everybody around me also had AT&T service  and the pipes were clogged.  So you got a good point there.  I mean, T-Mobile should have,  in certain circumstances, better throughput,  even if the other guy's network is faster  under ideal conditions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As long as they have a nearby tower,  which apparently they do in Petaluma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but if you bring your own,  if you bring a Nexus 4 or a phone like that  that you bought full price elsewhere.  That's different.  That doesn't do anything for you than the plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you're month to month then anyway,  so there'd be no benefit to you.  You can trade in anytime you want.  You can trade, that's true.  That's true.  I mean, you don't have to wait six months.  Nah.  Speaking of which, Gina, have you gotten your phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not yet.  Which one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The HTC One Google Experience, right?  Give us the update, Gina.  We knew last night it was in Kansas City.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was in Kansas City last night.  I actually have been busy enough today  that I don't know where it's located.  I'm opening Slice right now to check to see where it's at.  But yeah, Kansas City, it should be here on Friday.  I'm very excited because my poor Galaxy Nexus  is totally cracked.  And I'm tired of people saying,  oh, your poor phone whenever they see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So T-Mobile is adding a couple of phones July 17th,  using this plan, the Xperia Z, which is waterproof.  It's that really thin Sony phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which really is, that's interesting,  because Sony, they also introduced the separate  little tiny handsets.  Right, we were talking about that, yeah.  Right, so I think that's really an interesting path  where they're going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the idea of the handset is you keep the phone  in the pocket and you just go, hello,  to this little thing.  And that's your phone now.  It's not exactly a Bluetooth headset  because you're holding it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, you can also,  no, it also has little ear things.  You can mount it.  You can use it as Bluetooth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  The Lumia 925, ooh, that's a nice,  if you wanted Windows Phone,  that would probably be the one to get.  That will be available July 17th as well,  using this jump pricing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The, well, I also interviewed the CEO of Ericsson  at Guardian Activate.  All these videos, I hope, will be up in a week.  And they're out of the device business.  They sold that because they were in it with Sony.  But he said, fascinating stat,  I should use it for my number, but I won't.  He said that for every $10 drop in the price of handsets,  it adds 100 million users.  Wow.  Right?  That's the argument for the cheap iPhone.  Yeah. Yep, yep.  And we also saw, I don't know if we talked about the show,  the Firefox phone.  Right.  That's in Spain, right?  Right.  And try these ways that reduce the handset cost  have a huge impact then  on increasing the connected population.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's, yeah, is the way people are getting computing,  basically, in many areas.  Apple has lost its,  well, at least for the time being,  in the ebook case, a judgment came down this morning.  Remember, most of the publishers settled,  I'm curious what you think about this, Jeff Jarvis.  Most of the publishers settled out of court,  but Apple said no and fought it in court.  The publishers were,  I gotta get this right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who was suing whom?  Yeah, it's complicated.  That's the problem is I don't wanna say it's complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was hoping you guys would explain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, part of the reason is  I don't like to follow court stuff  because even this, it sounds so final.  Apple's gonna appeal.  They said we didn't do anything wrong.  There will be a whole, another trial on damages.  So really nothing, so little has been decided.  And yet it sounds like the decision has been made.  So the judge ruled that Apple conspired  with the five major publishers to raise book prices.  Remember, when Apple came into the market with iBooks,  the standard process was Amazon would set the price  for a book.  They'd say no, you know, on best sellers,  remember this, remember Amazon.com, 9.99, best sellers.  And the publishers didn't much like that  because they wanted to set the price themselves.  Apple brought in this agency model.  Well, Apple said you set the price, we'll take 30%  or whatever, I don't know what the cut is.  And thus they got the publishers in.  And they got the publishers in.  I'm not sure why that's wrong.  It seems like it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, there's various arguments about this.  And one is that the publishers would say  this is better for publishers and better for authors  and so on and so forth.  But I also read an article last week that Amazon,  now that it basically has a lock on the market  and Barnes and Noble is teetering near death,  the head just left,  but God knows what's gonna happen there.  So Amazon's getting hegemony in the book business  and it's very highly raising prices.  And it's raising prices.  So the irony here is that Amazon is going in  and raising prices anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple says when we introduced the iBook store in 2010,  we gave customers more choice,  injecting much needed innovation and competition  into the market, breaking Amazon's monopolistic grip  on the publishing industry.  We've done nothing wrong.  We will appeal to judge's decision.  I actually, on the one hand, as a consumer,  oh, 9.99, that's great.  I'm gonna get this book for much less  than it would cost me in a bookstore.  But that's to me classic dumping  where you set an arbitrarily low, below cost price  until you own the market.  And courts have historically punished people for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  On the other hand, you could argue that  books have been overpriced  and equated the distribution chain.  Look what's happened with Kindle singles and such.  And that Amazon, there's a hell of a lot more books  right now than there ever have been  because Amazon came in and created the structure.  So I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, the costs are certainly lower, right?  I mean, there's no shipping.  There's no printing fees.  No, these aren't e-books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  These are real books.  These are fizzid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's actually a minor,  that's a fairly minor part of the cost, is the truth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You gotta hire people to hawk the books.  I mean, I have friends that go around and do this, right?  You gotta hire people to go around and say,  buy this book to the bookstore.  To the bookstore.  I see what you're saying.  There's a whole ecosystem around that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is costly.  So the publishers, of course, wanted Apple  to break this 999 forced pricing.  So that's the conspiracy.  They all settled out of court.  Apple continued to defend.  And one of the things Apple did  that might have gotten them into trouble,  they also said to the publishers,  oh, and you can't charge less at any other bookstore  than you're charging on our bookstore.  And I think that was probably something  the publishers wanted,  but that allowed them to go to Amazon and said,  hey, I am sorry.  I do not wish to break our trust relationship here,  but I gotta charge 1299 because Apple is insisting upon that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apple played his price fixing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's probably why they're getting in trouble.  Apple played, this is what the judge wrote,  Apple played a central role in facilitating  and executing that conspiracy.  They seized the moment and brilliantly played its hand  through the vehicle of the Apple agency agreements.  The prices in the nascent ebook industry shifted upward.  In some cases, 50% or more for an individual title.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stay on this for a second with Barnes & Noble.  Barnes & Noble CEO this week, as I said, quit.  They're basically quitting the tablet business  and just gonna do the reader business  because their tablets weren't competitive  and they were too restrained and limited.  So let's imagine that Barnes & Noble folds,  God forbid, but it ain't looking good.  Huge amount of retail space unnecessary,  charging higher prices to consumers  than they can get even from bn.com.  What if Barnes & Noble physical bookstores disappear?  The number of independent bookstores  is de minimis in this country now.  What happens to the whole notion of the market for books?  We're going ebook anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Aren't we just eliminating physical media anyway?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well I guess it's not so revolutionary.  There are no record stores, there are no video stores.  Welcome to the 21st century.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like books, I will still buy books  and I think there'll be a premium market for physical books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Used bookstores will still be around, right?  They just probably won't carry as many obscure new books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The idea of a library changes dramatically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My wife rents on her Nexus 7 all the time.  She just goes onto the library site,  she's digital thing and it goes through Amazon  and she gets it for seven days or whatever it is  and she's a fast reader so that works for her.  But yeah, she does that all the time.  I think people are gonna trend more towards doing this  and libraries included.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'll see what happens.  Now, okay, so part of this lawsuit,  publishers and ebook stores will have to end  the agency pricing model for two years.  So if this appeal fails, and this could take a long time,  but if this appeal fails, then all of a sudden,  we go back to 999?  No, because there's nothing in the agreement  about what the price should be.  Amazon's gonna say, yeah, yeah,  we're gonna charge 29.99 now, and you take it or leave it.  And I think that this is exactly what you don't want.  I don't know.  I think competition is good,  but I don't pretend to understand it.  And you make a good point, which is,  electronic books don't have a,  there's a considerable number of costs that are out of that.  I mean, for 99 cents for your Gutenberg the geek,  you made some money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly, and by the way, by the way,  it's well announced, two announcements.  The first is that as of since the last show,  Gutenberg the geek in translation  is now available in German.  For 99 cents.  Gutenberg, no, 299.  Gutenberg, they set the price, they set the price.  I didn't.  Gutenberg, Gutenberg, they're nerd.  No.  There's no geek in German, it's nerd.  Don't you understand the alliteration?  Gutenberg geek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They don't have a word geek.  Gutenberg, they're nerd.  They're nerd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's a nice, you know,  assonance with the er sound.  Yeah, er, er.  Yeah, that's true, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gutenberg, they're nerd.  And then it's also going to be,  I've got to go record this.  It's also going to be an audible single.  Yeah, oh, nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Very nice, Jeff, good for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you going to read it?  Yeah, I'm going to read it.  Awesome.  It's also separately been translated  into Chinese and Italian.  That's happening now.  Very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Congratulations.  I wonder what they'll call it in Chinese or Italian.  Gutenberg, they're nerd.  That's terrible, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's very strange when your book gets translated  and your name is on a thing that you are unable to read.  When they translated the Lifehacker book into Japanese,  I was like, you know what?  This book could be insulting your mother on the cover.  And I have no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No idea.  No idea, that's why you don't get Chinese tattoos,  I'm just saying.  Yep.  Yeah, I remember seeing my first book in Chinese.  It was very odd, very odd.

Melody Macfessel.  This is a great piece.  I never heard of her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was a fluff piece, I'll admit it.  And I've never heard of her either.  And in fact, she must have asked not to be photographed,  straight on, because all the photos of her  are either sort of side or they're a little blurry.  But this is a great piece in Wired about Melody Macfessel,  who's in charge of Google's internal engineering tools.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, great, great piece about how she leads the team  that builds the tools that Google engineers use.  So nothing that's consumer facing or user facing.  The plugins, the IDEs, the coding, the testing tools,  the push architecture that they use.  And in fact, Wired couldn't write a whole lot  about what these tools actually are.  Couldn't even use the names of the tools, which amazed me.  Yeah, they couldn't use the names of the tools,  because this is Google's business value, right?  Like this is part of the secret sauce  that makes Google run the way that it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I understand that, because we have internal tools  that really are our secret sauce.  That's some of the value of the company.  They probably have silly names.  They're all named after Jetson's characters.  Right.  Oh, that's a good-  Rosie, Elroy, what are some of the, Jane.  They're all acronyms, they're all retro-names.  We come up with a name,  and then we have to come up with an acronym.  What is, Rosie, it was the first one,  it was kind of a Wiki that's the repository of,  I can't remember, do you remember, Chad?  Get an engineer in here.  And only the engineers know.  Anyway, so what's cool about this is,  I guess that she's a woman, right?  She's a very important part.  She says, if these systems don't work,  then Google doesn't work.  There would be no Kirk without Scotty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Love that.  She's Scotty.  Yeah, she's Scotty, exactly.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The other great thing in that story, go ahead, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I was gonna say,  the part of that story that kind of spoke to me  in the first couple of graphs,  that she said that she, you know,  she's been working in startups and technology  for a long time, and that she had two separate wardrobes.  She had her work wardrobe,  and then her at-home regular life wardrobe.  And her at-work wardrobe was jeans and T-shirts and hoodies,  because she kind of like made herself  into like one of the guys,  because she was surrounded by male engineers all day.  And then she'd go home, and she'd put on skirts and dresses  and things that she kind of liked to wear in her own life.  And that she had gotten to this point in her career  where she's like, you know what?  I'm just gonna be myself everywhere that I am.  And that entailed her wearing dresses to work,  because that's what she likes to wear.  And she kind of consciously kind of had to made that decision,  which was so interesting to me.  But yeah, it's a good piece.  And I really liked that.  There's another part of the piece where it said,  a friend of her, close friend of hers,  and colleague at Google said,  that she doesn't feel passionately  about getting other women into the place that she is.  She just knows that she deserves to be in that place,  which I really liked.  But I really like, I guess she kind of came in  and looked at the developer tools  and the internal engineering tools,  and her edict to the team was,  we have to build these  as if they were a consumer-facing product.  We have to make them fun to use,  good-looking, easy to use,  because if engineers are happy  and they have tools that they like to use,  then they're more productive.  And I just think that's so important.  I've worked at so many startups.  Gawker, the CMS was a nightmare.  I've worked even on ThinkUp.  We have a couple of our internal tools,  and it's so easy to just build something  that's just far enough for it to work,  and it's kind of ugly,  and you ask your people to just do this little workaround  to do this, that, and the other thing.  But if you take the time to make really good products,  internal products, I think that sets up a tone.  People enjoy using tools that are beautiful and easy to use.  So, yeah, it's a good experience.  I would imagine, too,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that there's a little tool macho that internally,  we don't make this too easy,  because if we have to make it too easy,  you're an idiot, right?  Because there's a test there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I wonder, I wonder.  I bet, I bet.  I really like that.  Apparently, Google has a system.  All their tools, all their internal engineering tools,  the code is available, open,  open and so far within the company,  that it's available, made available by the system,  the web-based system, whose own source code  is also available through this system.  So it's this recursive openness.  So anybody can inspect the code and contribute to the code.  But man, I don't often feel this way,  but I read this piece, and I was like,  I really want to wish I want to work at Google.  I just want to see this stuff.  I know, they celebrate code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So our tools, Patrick Delahanty,  who's doing a lot of the coding for it.  By the way, we finally got an in-house programmer, Patrick,  because we realized exactly what you said,  the internal tools are so important to our workflow.  And as we grow and make more shows,  we want to make sure that we can do it efficiently.  So Rosie was the first,  that was the repository of standardized  informational explication.  I don't think I had another acronym for it, but that-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That tells me a lot about what that does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a Wiki.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jane, what does Jane do?  Jane is just another number enhancer.  I don't know what Jane does.  Astro, which is our ticket system,  is a system to restore order.  That makes sense, right?  Astro.  And then the most recent one is Elroy.  Have we decided what Elroy does?  Pretty positive we came up with one.  I came up, we had a contest.  Yeah.  I came up with the retro-nim.  You got 50 bucks internally.  Where's my 50 bucks?  Which is really strange,  because it'd be like taking out my wallet,  taking out 50 bucks and giving it to myself.  But that's okay.  Winning's winning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like those tax implications, Leo.  I want to see you name some tool, this crazy thing.  This crazy thing?  What does this crazy thing do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As in Jane, stop this crazy thing.  Stop this crazy thing.  Oh, the conveyor belt.  Right.  That's next on the list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mr. What was the boss's name?  Mr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Elroy's, yeah, Mr. Spacely.  We don't have a Spacely yet.  Who would that be a tough one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Elroy is a great name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Elroy is, yeah, that's the most important tool.  It's replacing MTIG.  Right?  I remember what MTIGs did.  What's MTIG stand for?  Multi-transcode internet go.  So Elroy has to be encoded.  That was, yeah, that's the workflow  where you put in a show and it comes out  the other end on YouTube and all the other places.  Right, right, yeah, exactly.  Yeah, encoding, I came up with a name,  but I can't remember what it is.  Easily lose royalties over at YouTube.  Thanks.  That's actually the name.  I believe that, I think we have a winner.  Quirt Anonymous, I owe you $50.  This tool lets us easily lose royalties over at YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Accurate and memorable.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That might be a good show title.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, it's a sad thing that we have to write articles  about, look, here's an important woman in engineering.  Yes, yes.  I wish we didn't, but I'm glad Cade Metz  did write this article and I'm glad Melody Metz  is doing it. The founder of Indiegogo

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  was at Guardian Activate where I presided only yesterday.  And she said, she had a, no, it wasn't her.  It was, I think the head of the Nike,  I forget who it was now.  Somebody, somebody had said that,  whereas I think Indiegogo and companies like that  have support 40 some percent women ventures,  VCs support, only 3% of VCs companies have women executives.  BC supported company.  Yeah.  I don't know what the source for that was,  but it was just shocking.  I don't understand it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yep.  And in my limited experience with VCs,  you can tell pretty much from the get go,  whether or not they're interested in funding  a woman founded company, you know?  It's interesting.  It's interesting.  It's actually a really good filter for me.  But anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You saw the hysterical cartoon video of the VC process  that somebody made.  Oh, I wish I could.  Oh no.  Oh, it was hysterical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, if I could just find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why don't I bookmark this?  Wish there were some way I could keep track of this.  Is there a place you could save it?  I wish there were somewhere.  Seek it somehow, send it to me.  I don't know.  Get track of it.  I'm sure, actually, it's called the chat room.  Looking at them right now.  Okay, I'll earn your key.  The chat room.  You know what I'm talking about?  It was a cartoon.  There you go, there you go.  I wonder if that's it though.  There was a cartoon.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're like our Googling minions.  I imagine you all as little yellow guys.  Yeah, this is it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.  You win again.  Sorry about the explosion.  This is what it would have looked like  had Nikolai Tesla had to go to venture capital  and pitch them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I've seen this.  This is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If it was only play.  And of course, we need a name for the internet.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thanks for coming in, Nick.  My partners are really excited.  Hi, Nick.  Can't wait to see what you got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thanks for having.  Oops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you're watching me.  I thought that was you.  Oh, I'm so sorry.  I'll start over.  Start over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I thought it was him.  Thanks for coming in, Nick.  My partners are really excited.  Hi, Nick.  Can't wait to see what you got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thanks for having.  You're not going to show a deck, are you?  Well, I am.  I would like to see a deck.  I will begin by showing you my inventions  for transmitting electricity wirelessly.  Sounds great.  Hey, do you mind if Josh sits in?  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Who's Josh?  Nice to meet you.  Josh is an EIR.  He's thinking of starting a company in your space.  That does not sound great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just leave out the parts  you're not comfortable sharing.  Or we can reschedule.  Since it took a while to schedule.  Fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Before you proceed,  can you tell us a bit about the market?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My inventions allow the wireless transfer of energy  to power any device.  So this is a wireless play or an energy play?  Technically, it would be both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hard to do two things at once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The inventions send energy wirelessly to any device,  even mobile devices.  So this is a mobile play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If this guy thinks he can go after three markets at once,  he's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe not three markets,  but three big intersecting opportunities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nick, I think you're sounding a bit defensive.  If you had to pick one market,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  which one would you pick?  Energy is the simplest way to think about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Energy is not as hot as it used to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can always pivot back to energy if it gets hot again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe you can keep things simple.  What about some kind of tie-in to Facebook, Josh?  Totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or a Kickstarter campaign, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, did you do a Kickstarter?  No, I did not think a Kickstarter was the right avenue  for this business, given the product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The product is supposed to be amazing.  I don't see it on Kickstarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sounds like you might be a bit ahead of the market.  I have licenses for the technology with Samsung,  Apple, and Intel.  Intel is in trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wonder how Apple stocked it today.  The main point is our business model

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  is to license to these kinds of companies.  It's funny because it's true.  That's what's sad about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wonder what the market is.  It's amazing how spot on this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Apparently, the Fed might do something with interest rates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, we'll stop.  But go watch it.  It's on YouTube.  Just search for Nikola Tesla pitching Silicon Valley VCs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just so crazy.  This whole industry is made up of jerks with money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  But you know, what's new, right?  It's always been that way.  Yeah, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We have a few interesting things here, Leo.  We have, you could go high market or low market.  You could go with Google interns terrorizing neighbors,  or you could go with Google live streaming  from the Grand Mosque in Mecca.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow, there really is, that is a broad gulf.  Let's start with the terrorizing interns,  and then we'll go to Mecca.  I thought you would.  It is Ramadan.  It is.  I don't know if that's related,  but go ahead, terrorizing interns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, just so New York Magazine has a story  that neighbors complained,  they started a Facebook group about all the interns.  Evidently, there's a big apartment complex  where the interns live.  You can imagine what this is like.  You don't ever want to live next to it.  Your watches were rich, we're running the world.  Yeah.  You know, I'm waiting for, what was the great, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like a college dorm.  It's basically you're living in a college dorm.  You don't want to be.  But swimming pools, tennis courts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know what I'm waiting for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  These guys are the next masters of the universe, right?  Right, and they know it.  There's going to be that kind of, yeah,  there's going to be that kind of behavior.  Of course there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, it was in college anyway.  I lived in my 20s.  I lived in Silicon Valley, an apartment.  I worked in a radio station in San Jose.  And it was really, this was when Atari was big,  and it was really interesting to see the snotty attitude.  By the way, if you worked for Atari,  you were like, at the time, king of the world,  and so snotty, so rude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I argued in what would Google do  that we should disaggregate the functions of college.  There's education and research, and there's socialization.  The socialization is just Melrose Place.  Yeah.  You should just live in an apartment building like this,  and you figure out how to get along with people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff and I are the parents of college kids.  And we're paying, God, on untold amounts of money  for this socialization thing.  Working well, too, isn't it?  Oh, they're socialized.  Oh, party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My favorite line from this article is,  "'At first I thought it was a summer camp,  but then I noticed that the kids were too old,'  said Rochelle Fisher, 46-year-old resident of the building.  They dart out in the middle of the street,  they jaywalk all the time, there's loud parties.  I have to be very careful when I'm driving.'"

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you imagine the people who lived next door  to the Facebook house in the early days?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, God, talk about frat house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that a true scene in the movie  where they pull the chimney off the house  because they're making a zip line?  If it's not true, it's true to...  It's the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought that was based on an incident,  but I don't know, that movie was so fraught with issues.  I think it was. I seem to remember that, yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, I look forward to the future  when all of our technology is not created by...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Teenage boys?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, to put it frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, adolescent boys, let's put it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would like adults designing my social networks.  Thank you very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're too old and tired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, the irony is the people that were at Atari  and other places like that back then  are now the ones complaining.  Right.  Because they're over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Get off of my lawn, you...  The curmudgeon, it's coming.  Kids, it's coming full circle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, and Ramadan, a live stream of Mecca for Ramadan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is important because it's a place that,  unless you're Islamic, you can't go.  Really?  This is Mecca, we ain't allowed to go to Mecca.  Interesting.  Unless one of you is Muslim and I don't know it.  But we're allowed to watch the live stream.  But we watch the live stream.  So, yeah, this is kind of a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Mecca is where you go on pilgrimage,  you hope, at least once in your life.  Let me see if I can pull up the live stream.  I've got it, yeah.  You have to get to it.  It's your internet so much, but oh,  I'm on an Apple MacBook, that's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm on a Lenovo, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the new MacBook Air and I really do think  it has trouble.  Can you hear it?  I hear the muezzin.  Oh, there it is.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'm kind of amazed that they were allowed to stream this.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Isn't it the same, wouldn't it be the same restrictions?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One would think.  Well, they've got to be Muslim, the camera operators  and the technicians, I presume, but.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, this is kind of amazing.  This is an amazing bit of access to something really.  Well, they're not inside though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But these are the pilgrims arriving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know what they're going to do with it.  There's that amazing cycle of people that happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right, they go around in the circle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I always enjoyed the calls of the muezzin.  When we were in Egypt, we went to a mosque  and stood next to the guy as he did his call.  Wow.  It was just, their voices are gorgeous.  Usually they're up in the minarets, they're in the towers  and you hear it loud on distorted loudspeakers.  It's not very good, but when you hear somebody singing  right next to you, just beautiful.  And he was actually reading.  So the wall of the mosque had the Quran,  the words of the Quran written on it.  And he was reading it as he was singing it.  So he was turning it.  Oh wow.  Yeah, I recorded it.  Somewhere I have a recording of that.  Google has, we talked about this on security now.  I don't know who's the evil actor here.  I think it's ad blocks.  They're paying ad blocks plus not to block their ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, ad blocks does this as a policy.  And I just think it's, and I've tweeted about this  and they come after with their PR  and I really kind of don't care.  It's ransom, it's ridiculous.  So you can pay to be white pushed  into ad blocks. If you're running ad blocks

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  on your computer, you're running it  so that you don't see ads on webpages.  Now we could argue about whether that's a good thing or not.  I mean, as an ad supported medium,  I feel like that's kind of cheating.  I don't use an ad blocker.  Even as you notice, when we pull up pages,  we don't block the ads on the pages.  But just because I feel like that's the price  you're paying for the content.  Exactly.  But that's an argument, separate argument.  I think it's completely reprehensible  that the company that makes this product ad block plus  to block ads is then going to advertisers saying,  but for a small amount, we don't block you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's the default setting.  So they have an acceptable ads list,  which is on by default.  And so Google's being paid to be on that list.  Users can turn that off.  Google's paying to be on that list.  Google's paying to be on the acceptable ads list,  which is there's this acceptable ad white list,  which is on by default,  it leaves power to the default setting.  That's powerful.  And Google's paying on that list.  So it's interesting because this is,  yeah, Google's paying for the default setting  to be that they're not blocked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't blame them if I were Google, I would too.  By the way, they block ad block from the Play Store.  You can't-  From the Play Store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So ad blocks plus, by the way, to be clear,  this is not ad blocks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they'll come after us.  Their PR people will come after us after this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I actually, I switched from ad block plus back to ad block  because of the Google ads that I didn't want to see.  And it was more because I was upset with Google  because they were hiding the ads,  because they make it that really light yellow color,  that top block.  And if you're not looking at it just right,  you can't even see.  That's not right.  That's not right either.  It's deceptive, I think.  If it's an ad, it should be clear

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that it's not in the search results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's right, that's right.  And there was no way to fix that.  And so I said, you know what?  Ad block plus isn't taking care of this anymore.  So I went back to ad block.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Aaron, let me go up here for a second here.  What's the harm of seeing ads, number one.  Number two, for those of us who cover all these things,  the ads often have content value that is of interest.  I find things in ads that we talk about and that matter.  Number three, this supports the like of your pal  right next to you, Leo.  You wanna buy that soupy slurp before,  by at least looking at it as ads,  and you listen to him in the podcast.  I don't understand the ethical decision

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  of blocking ads. For me, it's more of a,  it's less that I don't like ads  and more of a layout decision.  It's what ads do to crap up the page.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so content, I have to say content creators  are responsible for this,  because one of the reasons we do the ads the way we do them  is we try to choose advertisers that are appropriate.  I mean, we spend a lot of time thinking about  how we do the ads and choosing the right advertisers.  And I think it is the responsibility  of the content creator not to have takeovers.  Where you go to a page and the whole page  is taken over by an advertiser,  that's, it slows you down, it's unesthetically,  and it's unappealing.  And I just, I feel like content creators  are somewhat to blame for this.  And so I don't blame people who use AdBlock,  because that's a very good reason to use it, Aaron.  On the other hand, I think it's really important  for people to understand that when you're reading content  on websites, you know, like Salon,  that content's paid for by ads.  And it's good content,  I think they have the right to display the ads,  so I think blocking them is kind of cheating.  Yeah.  Saying I want to consume the content,  but I don't want to see the ad, well, that's cheating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If I ran a site, I would block AdBlock users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is what AdBlocks Plus says,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  White listing is free for all small websites and blogs.  However, managing this list requires  significant effort on our side,  and this task cannot be completely taken over  by volunteers as it happens with common filter lists.  This is why we are being paid by some larger properties  that serve non-intrusive advertisements  that want to participate in the Acceptable Ads Initiative.  I think that to me says AdBlocks Plus  is playing both sides of the fence.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, absolutely, absolutely, it's blackmail.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's interesting, this Acceptable Ads Initiative,  hmm, I mean, it seems like AdBlock Plus is in the position  to be able to say, you know what,  your ads are so onerous that they degrade  the user experience of your site so much  that they're just not good ads anymore, right?  Maybe we need something like that.  Like, I'm gonna try to see a slideshow  or some clearly totally unnecessary,  like a takeover, a flyover, a thing that rolls down  and starts playing sound without my permission.  Like, that upsets me, right?  Because I feel like that's a user experience.  That says to me this site does not care  about my experience at all and just cares  about serving crazy, insane ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and I never go back to that site, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  Well, it wasn't that role, though,  in the early days of advertising the web,  that was the role where the browsers took it over, right?  So pop-ups were killed by the browsers.  Pop-unders, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Pop-unders haven't died yet.  No, they still live.  But pop-ups, pop-overs were killed by the browsers.  The browser manufacturers determined  what was acceptable.  You're right, Gene, there is a role for that, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I agree with that. There is, there is.  And so I feel like there's an opportunity to say,  these are the things that, you know,  this is the good way to serve ads.  These are the ads that improve the user experience  and these are the kind of ads  that degrade the user experience.  And it'd be really cool to see an organization,  maybe it can't be an ad block.  Plus, at this point.  I think that's the issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what they argue they're doing.  And I think you're right.  And I think that that is decent.  But they are in a definite conflict of interest  and it makes it look odd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree, I agree.  I would love to see, I would totally install an extension  that if I did a Google search  or if I found a link on Twitter or whatever  and I clicked on it and it popped up and said,  hey, you know what?  This site has a history  of serving user hostile advertisements.  Do you want to stay here or not?  And I could say, no.  I mean, think about it.  That's what Chrome does for sites  that serve spam.  Right?  I feel like this is one way that we could make.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This developer, I think you could make that in a weekend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just don't then go to companies and say,  and by the way, I could keep you off of that list  if you give me a little bit of.  That's the key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's channel conflict.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it'd have to be like the webmaster guidelines thing.  Like, hey, you know what?  You'll get off this list if you show us  that you've changed your ways.  I don't know.  Kind of an idea.  But I agree that this is weird.  This whole pay for getting on the wait list.  I'm surprised that Adblock didn't say,  put us back in the Play Store.  We'll put you on the wait list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Google wouldn't have done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That would have been really bad.  That would be wrong.  So many ways.  That's really bad for Google.  Yeah, yeah.  This already looks bad for Google.  So Jeff, whose PR people are going to come after us?  Google's?  Adblock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When I tweeted that I was surprised at this,  they came kind of after me and,  oh no, we have to talk to you.  And I still said, I just don't like it.  Sorry, it's channel conflict.  My students, entrepreneurial students,  go through this almost universally.  Are we a B2B company or a B2C company?  And I say to them all the time, you cannot be both.  You'll end up in conflict.  You can't compete with your customers.  If you're B2C, you serve them.  They serve the end customers and you make them happy.  If you're B2B, I mean, if you're B2C,  then you can't serve others competing with you.  You pretty much have to be it.  And it's a classic channel conflict.  And that's the problem for Adblock.  And I'm not saying that they're illegitimate  in their argument.  It does cost money to maintain the list.  They need money for it.  I'm not questioning all that.  But I am saying it.  Yeah, because it's a free service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it's not, the plugin is free.  But it's a conflict of interest.  Yeah, I think it is.  That's the issue for them.  And we should say this is Adblock Plus we're talking about.  That's not the same thing as Adblock.  And it's at adblockplus.org.  And I'm not, I don't use it, so I don't know  which is what the best is or whatever.  Hey, a little props to Twitter from the EFF.  They say Twitter shows the way forward with Do Not Track.  Twitter will honor your browsers.  Do not track setting by treating as a do not collect signal  when Do Not Track is enabled in the browser.  They will not collect your browsing information  to show targeted ads on Twitter.  This is a little disingenuous too.  Yeah, because they have this new way  of targeting advertisements.  Right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So as they put it in, what the heck?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think this is the right thing to do.  Look, if Twitter wants to monetize with targeted ads,  that's fine.  Just, and do make sure that you give people a way to opt out.  And that's fine.  Google does that, sort of, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can use Incognito, you can use lots of it.  But again there, if I ran a site,  because my argument immediately-  You'd block Incognito browsers.  Well, no, I mean, go a more positive way.  I have an, what I argue now to media people,  I just did talks like this in Europe  where I say, damn it, you're not in the content business.  We've had this discussion, right?  You're in the relationship business.  You're in the service business.  And as a service, Google understands who I am  and so can serve me with relevance and thus greater value.  And we in media don't know how to do that.  And god damn it, you gotta get past that.  You gotta learn how to know people as individuals  and serve them relevance.  Well, the only way you're going to do that  is if you collect data on them.  Right.  You know?  And Google does that and gets value out of it  because it knows where I am.  And media companies should be doing the same thing.  Well, now if you turn on the do not track-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Setting.  Religion.  Religion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not a setting.  I think it's a religion.  In some cases it is.  And then I think you threaten to greatly devalue  where media ought to be going to get higher value  to support the content you like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, here's a question Steve Gibson poses.  And Steve and I have this kind of debate as well.  And he's very much adamantly,  he was mad at Firefox for changing the way,  or was it Apache?  Anyway, he was mad at somebody.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Um.  Um.  Um.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it the case that ad companies say  we need to be able to track,  we need targeted ads,  or we're just not going to raise the revenue,  we get the results we need?  Is that the case?  Do we actually need to target advertising?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, because otherwise it's noise.  Otherwise it's extremely low value,  and it's no end, then you're in a volume game.  And the volume game is that there's no end of competitors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Targeting means you're going to get better,  in theory, not in practice,  but in theory means you're going to get more,  apropos, better ads,  ads that are of great interest to you.  Yes.  And I've never understood why that bothers people,  but it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, because, because, and this is what I also say,  because we messed it up royally  in the media advertising technology businesses.  This strange thing called a cookie  was setting a machine and people were tracking you,  and we enabled the Wall Street journals of the world  to demonize this and make it sound all spooky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It isn't creepy, it's just saying,  look, we want to know what your preferences are.  Right, and-  Well, by the way, and we don't use that,  the way we do it is we,  we sell ads, and then we do periodically,  in fact we're about to do it,  a survey of our viewers, completely voluntary,  we say, hey, if you would like to tell us something  about yourself, and that information we can use,  with advertisers do want to know, well, who am I reaching?  Am I reaching 12 year old girls?  Am I reaching 50 year old men?  What is, what am I getting?  So we do, they do want to know that,  and so we do this periodic survey every year or so,  and we can then say, well, in general,  this is who, you know, we reach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, so you do that as a sampling.  If you do that on an individual level-  It's not as effective, probably.  Which is what Google, no.  Which is what, this medium you have to.  Right.  But what Google does here is, as Eric Schmidt said,  activate in Big Tent in New Delhi, or New Delhi,  this would be more valuable than the web in Google's hands,  because in mobile we know who you are,  we know something about you.  And that has a lot of power,  and that's where both the content side  and the advertising side should both be going, I think.  I strongly believe that.  But if we demonize the cookie and demonize all this,  then it causes a real problem.  What's happening now in the UK, and I'm sorry, the EU,  is every site you go to in the EU,  first time you've got to constantly say,  oh yeah, it's okay, you got cookies, I know, I know, I know.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it just becomes an irritant.  I'm starting to see that a lot on sites  here in the States, too.  All Things D does that.  First time you visit allthingsd.com.  Here's our tracking policy, here's our cookie policy,  just so you know.  And actually we've been debating whether to do that  on our site, even though we don't use tracking cookies.  We do have analytics, and so we've been debating  whether to do that, I think we probably are gonna do that.  Well, and here's the second half of this.  That's annoying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a transaction we go through.  I think that the way that companies should,  they should see Amazon as a model for this,  because Amazon, you know what they're tracking,  you know why they are, you know what they're giving  is result, and they give you the opportunity  to see it and to fix it.  That should be the standard for all of this.  And it will only, every time I fix it on Amazon,  I'm more valuable to Amazon.  That's a transaction I go through.  If it's a transparent transaction,  which I feel I have some control, I think that works,  and that's where we gotta go.  Let's remember people, the transaction we do,  that we have no control over is the NSA.  And that's, if you wanna get creeped out  about your privacy, if you wanna get scared  and scream about your privacy, now is the time  to scream bloody murder about it,  because your government is tracking everybody in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although, I'm gonna make the opposite argument.  The NSA is doing that to protect us,  advertising's, advertisers are doing it  just to get money out of us.  They're trying to protect us, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The advertisers are doing it,  media properties are doing it to make money  to support the media we get, A.  And the NSA's doing it to protect us from terrorism.  Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Under the law, under the law, they, yes,  they can go after certain specifics.  They can't listen to the entirety of net traffic.  That's just not right, and it's not the damned American way,  it's the Stasi way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I kinda threw him a softball on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, Leo's so, clearly, he's just rolling.  I had to play into it.  Jeff, but this is what I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was, like, this is how you play cricket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's this thing I've heard people talk about  called the Constitution, what is that?  I don't understand that.  Would you explain that to me?  Twitter has banned auto-following and bulk following  in the new developer updates, thank you, Twitter.  That's a real. That's good for them, too.  That's smart both ways, right?  It's smart in every way,  just makes it a better environment.  Yep.  So, no more, presumably, they were apps  that actually did that.  They have turned on trans, pardon me, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was gonna say, apps, there's apps that are like,  blatantly trying to follow a bunch of people.  Of course, we've got rogue apps,  but then there are apps which seem good and nice,  but what they'll do is, when you sign up for them,  in the background, have you automatically follow,  so say the apps Twitter handle by default,  without letting you know, that kind of thing.  So, Twitter's made it really clear  that that's a reason to get banned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Twitter is also another great thing,  enabled translation on tweets  from high-profile users in Egypt.  So, if you're English.  I'm seeing translation all the time now.  So cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it is great,  because I get a lot of German tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if they're using Google Translate,  but they're using some sort of automated translation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, Bing, they're using Bing.  Oh, wow.  I'm not a Twitter user,  so you guys have to explain this to me.  When you get the tweet in your feed,  it shows up both the original language and the translated.  Or there's a translate button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's also a translate button,  that lets you translate the...  Oh, interesting.  Isn't that neat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is there not a translate button  on anything that's not in your native language?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  On mine, pretty much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what happens.  Really?  In what, on the webpage?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm using the Twitter app on...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or in the Twitter app, okay.  Well, that makes sense.  I don't follow non-English speakers typically, so I don't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, me neither.  I realize that I have to vary  among the people who I follow,  as I don't see non-English speakers a lot.  Well, I supposedly should understand the German ones,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but I cheat a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do they get rid of...  They used to be, I guess there's no reason to have it,  but it was fun.  The global button where you'd see everything?  They don't have that anymore.  Remember?  Remember?  That's a long time ago.  Back in 2007, there was a button on Twitter.  You'd see everything everybody was posting.  Don't have that anymore.  The fire hose.  It'd be going...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  I remember the fire hose.  The fire hose.  But then they got, they turned it,  or they limited it, they got rid of it finally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why it's app.net, they still have a fire hose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It got to be like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because there's nobody posting.  Do you use app.net?  You said you don't use Twitter, is that what you use?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  App.net?  I don't use Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, I post to Twitter, but I don't follow Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But do you use app.net?  What do you use instead?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google+, I use Facebook, sometimes,  to follow what my family's doing.  I don't follow people on Twitter.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so anyway, who cares?  Moving on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's cool, I wish they would implement that in...  Why doesn't Google do this?  They do on web pages.  You'll see when you go to a web page all the time.  Why don't they do it on Google+.  I mean, they're the king of translate, right?  Or I consider them a king of translation.  I mean, that should be like a standard feature.  And you would think Facebook, with the number of users,  would do that as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, Google+, did have a translate button on posts,  and I think they took it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  All right, let's take a break when we come back.  Tool, tip, number of the week.  But first, a word from Shutterstock.com,  with over 26 million high quality stock photos,  illustrations, vectors, and video clips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tip of the week, if you have not seen  Facebook's graph search yet, you probably will this week.  Facebook is rolling out to hundreds of millions  of users this week, I think it's starting Monday, actually.  If you haven't tried out graph search, it's pretty cool.  You can do things like say, show me all the restaurants  in New York City that my friends like,  or kind of a fun search, photos of my friends before 1996.  Yeah, that's a good one.  There's a lot of really actually cool searches  you can do in the graph search, I have to say.  It's a pretty great function.  So check it out, I know a lot of our listeners,  watchers, viewers are not big Facebook users,  but graph search is definitely, if you're interested  in the search, graph search is definitely worth a try.  Of course you have to have a pretty good social graph  set up there on Facebook in order to get anything good.  But give it a try.  Look at these are all photos of my friends before 1980.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is so cool.  I think you should just do a search of the graph search  of the week, this is hysterical.  Yeah, yeah, that's pretty great.  Who is that?  Oh my God, that's me.  What is that I'm holding?  Oh, nevermind.  That was 1974.  So it was a different time.  That's right.  Different era.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm impressed many of your friends uploaded photos  before Facebook existed.  I have a lot of old friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You gotta understand, my friends are old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They just sit in their basements  going through their old photos.  Cause all we have are memories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here we are when we were freshmen in college.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you had to actually scan that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, see that picture on the right?  That's me in the pipe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Whoa, Leo, I was like, it took me.  I just ran the picture.  You're a handsome devil.  Look at you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, if you like guys with pipes, I guess.  Like 18 year olds pretending to be sophisticated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm completely out of the running,  but has nothing to do with you Leo, but very handsome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can I tell you, you wouldn't wanna have been  our neighbor in those days.  Holy cow.  We had a water balloon catapult.  This guy here in the top hat made it  with a surgical tubing that could fire  from one end of the old campus to the others,  about 300 yards.  So we'd put water balloons in it.  We'd be at one end, we'd fire them like 10 seconds later,  it would land on somebody and they'd look around  and they wouldn't realize,  yeah, we're way the hell over here.  It was great fun.  You would not wanna be our neighbors.  I truly understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Worse than the Google interns.  The devastation.  How bad could it be?  They're at Google all the time coding them.  Or they should be, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In theory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, no, it wasn't 300 yards.  It was probably 150 yards.  It was more than a football field.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Water balloons are heavy.  To get a good lift on a water balloon from a catapult,  it's gotta be a pretty powerful catapult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This guy was an engineer, I tell you.  Double surgical tubing, a bucket.  It took four people to shoot it,  because you have two people in front  and two people to pull it back.  And it pulled back like 15, 20 feet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Was it like more a slingshot or a catapult?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was a catapult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hybrid, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and you'd fire it.  And that thing, anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If only there was streaming web video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh man, it would have been amazing.  Then there's that time we put the dry ice  in the fire extinguisher, nevermind.  Another day.  Your number of the week, Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  NDP Group says that in just eight months,  Chromebooks have snagged 20 to 25%  of the under $300 market.  Now yes, straight line here, that's a shrinking market.  PC shipments are predicted to go down 7.8% this year.  But still.  That's interesting.  For something that the people thought  was just this crazy little thing, nobody's gonna use it.  I was in a store in London,  and I heard the Google sales guy pitch in the moment.  And she said, you mean, I don't have to buy any software?  I don't do this, I don't do that.  I think I've heard a lot of grandmas  getting them from grandsons,  because there's nothing to install grandma.  School shipments like crazy.  So it's really pretty impressive  that this odd thing nobody thought was,  who wants a browser and machine, that it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder how many notebooks there are  in the under $300 laptop market though.  Oh, there are numbers.  I think because, well, aren't there?  I think because of the failure of netbooks.  I guess 299.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, you can get 299, but they're, you know,  pretty junky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If that's your budget, get a Chromebook.  I would agree with that, or maybe a tablet.  Do you wanna do a tool?  I can do a tip if you want me to do a tip.  Okay, let's do a tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So this is something I shared on Google+, not too long ago.  And, you know, this is something that  you definitely wanna check,  make sure that you're willing to do something like this.  I usually bring up the rooting things, you know,  root your phone and do something cool, right?  So this is something, this is wifi tethering  on your Android phone, and it's supported by most phones,  but not all, and you don't have to be root for this one.  This is actually a feature of a program  called ES File Explorer,  pretty popular file explorer that people have.  And it's a little known feature,  but you can actually go into your settings,  which I'll do here.  And if you-  So this requires root.  It does not require root.  Does not require root.  It sometimes works better with root,  but it does not require root.  You can go into ES File Explorer, go into tools,  go into Net Manager,  and you'll see there that there is,  it brings up kind of your network settings.  It says join a network or create a hotspot network.  And this is the part that was new to me  with their latest releases,  this create a hotspot network,  because a lot of times you can't do that on your phone.  So this is why I say, you know, be careful with this,  make sure you're abiding by all of your agreements  with your carriers and everything.  But I can actually exit my current network right now,  and I can hit create a hotspot network.  And now I have a hotspot wifi tethering network created  that I can join my laptop to get work done in the airport  or for whatever reason.  And it's a really nice little feature.  And I was pleasantly surprised  to see it actually work on my phone.  I've had reports that it works on some phones,  it doesn't work on other phones.  Some phones you need to be rooted.  Most of the time I've heard you do not need to be rooted.  If it works on your phone, it works unrooted.  So this is ES File Explorer.  It's a tip.  It's a little known feature in ES File Explorer.  You can actually go in and name the network  and create your own password if you want to,  or it will automatically assign  an SSID for you and a random password.  Aaron, can I ask a question?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, go ahead.  So I have on my, I have an SSID four,  so it's a little more open that way,  but I have Fox, Fi, Key,  and I have something called Portable Wifi Hotspot,  and I have PDAnet.  And I am able to open a hotspot.  What I'm paranoid about is that I have  an AT&T unlimited account,  and that they'll send the NSA after me.  Right.  And it matters with glass.  Sure.  How, any of you, does the phone company know  when you're using a hotspot when you're covering  in a way like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They do have ways to track it,  and I think if you were a super huge user,  at least from what I've read online  and the people I've talked to,  if you're on there all the time  and you're watching Netflix from your laptop  through your wifi tether device that you aren't legally,  or you don't have a contract to use wifi tethering on,  eventually they will catch you,  and usually what they do is they turn this picket off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or they charge you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or they'll charge you on your bill.  Or they kill your unlimited plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I haven't heard of them like, you know,  or they'll kill your unlimited plan, exactly.  And what I haven't heard of them doing  is shutting off service completely or anything like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  On the rare occasion when you need to do it  in kind of an emergency,  or you're demonstrating glass or something,  are you going to get guillotined, do you think?  That's what I use it for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's exactly what I use it for,  is when there's no other way to get online  and I need to show something to somebody,  or I need to get that email sent, right?  You know, I go ahead and turn this on,  get my email sent to whatever I need to do,  and then I usually just go back in and turn it off.  That's kind of de minimis.  I haven't heard of anyone having any problems with that.  So like I say, use it at your own risk.  Really, really simple tool.  And if it works for you, great.  If it doesn't, then there are other tools,  like you said, Jeff, that you use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that ES File Explorer is a good thing to have anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a good thing to have anyway.  I like that.  They just updated the interface for it,  so it looks really, really nice.  And lots of options, lots of settings.  You can go in and if you do have Root,  it's a great utility to have,  because then you can go in  and change the settings on your phone, browse things.  It has a built-in ability to connect to network devices  over FTP or SMB.  So if you've got a network share  and you want to connect to it to transfer files,  it's a great way to do that.  So a lot of really cool features.  So, and that was one that just popped up recently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to go see a man about a phone or a tablet or something.  Or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's right.  And then you have to come home and email us about it.  Privately, right?  I would, but it would be wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  No, it wouldn't be wrong.  No, it wouldn't be wrong.  Okay, you're a journalism professor.  I'm going to go with whatever journalism professor says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're telling your colleagues  so that we can plan for the next show.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, good.  We have to do a lot of deep thinking  about this amazing thing you're producing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kara Swisher was so adamant that it's not a phone  that I can only think, what else does Motorola make?  They make the tablets.  Right.  It's got to be a tablet, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.  I got to prepare for all about Android, Leo.  I got to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  I'll let you know.  But you, at home, you're just going to have to wait  till whenever.  Hey, I do thank you so much for being here.  And I thank you, Aaron Newcomb, for coming by.  Really appreciate it.  Thanks for having me.  NetApp.com.  Always great, Aaron.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And thanks to NetApp for letting me come.  Thank you, NetApp.  What is NetApp?  So NetApp does enterprise storage.  Enterprise storage vendor.  And they do a lot of really cool things.  So if you work for a large enterprise,  you need some storage, go check out NetApp.  Do some really great things.  And they're very, very flexible.  It's one of the top,  it's always one of the top places to work  in every country where they're at.  I think in the US right now,  they're number six on the list of best places to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And do you code?  What do you do for them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I do marketing for specific solutions.  Ironically enough, Oracle solutions.  So that worked out pretty well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, you have to be technical  to do marketing in these companies.  You cannot just be some guy saying,  yeah, you really need this thing because it's great.  Right.  That doesn't work.  Does not work.  Thank you, Gina Trapani, smarterware.org.  And of course, thinkup.com, todotext.com, TXT.  And enter beta, alpha numeric.  In beta.  In alpha beta.  In beta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm delighted I made it.  I was a little delayed with your brother.  What time zone do you think you're in right now?  Oh, God knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
