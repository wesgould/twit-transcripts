Father of the fastest high school track star in Northern California.  That's right.  Did I say that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You did.  You did.  Is that Isaiah?  Fastest high school kid in Northern California.  That's pretty good.  It is my son.  How fast is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How fast do you have to be to be that fast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you have to beat an 11 one in the 100 meters if you want to be fast.  That's fast.  Wow.  He was he was moving.  That's moving.  He was moving, but it was a good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Were you chasing him?  Really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was not.  You get back here.  I was yelling like I bet you were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We always know when your kids have sporting events because you come in horse the next day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So true.  So true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Also with us, my friends, the great Jeff Jarvis.  Frank Sinatra once called him a bum.  I'm a TV guide critic and the Leonard Tao professor for journalistic innovation at the  Great New Mark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.  Someday I have a fantasy that we will get somebody great in here.  Maybe I don't know the guided Hamilton to sing that.  Wouldn't that be fun?  Lin-Manuel Miranda.  Lin-Manuel Miranda to come in.  That'd be fun.  That's why I love John Krasinski's show.  Of course, he's a little more famous, but John Krasinski, you know, is I say, oh, let  me ask my friend Lin-Manuel Miranda to sing a song and he just pop in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can you ask Steve Martin to do it on the mandolin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I could.  That's not a bad idea.  We might get a banjo rendition of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He could probably.  When you're in New York, we can go down and visit Craig and do it live for him.  We can do it for Craig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We can, we can serenade him outside his door.  Serenade him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Get, get thrown in jail for no good reason.  Also with us from Stacy on IOT and the IOT podcast, Stacy Higginbotham.  The eponymous, hey Stacy.  That's the one.  Nothing to say.  That's me.  You've been typing for the last 15 minutes and you have no words.  She's like, yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you want me to keep typing?  No.  Nope.  No, Stacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So much to say to your keyboard and so little to say to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I've got opinions about all kinds of things.  Let's see if any of them will work with what we're talking about on the show.  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm eager to hear your opinion about the kerfuffle unto furor about Amazon and.  Sidewalk.  Tell everyone where you are.  Is it, is it, is it techno panic or isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm never going to say the word is techno panic.  It's just, it's not.  But they are upset about this for all the wrong reasons.  I will give you three reasons you can be upset when it's time to talk about this.  If we want to talk about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now let's do it now.  I was a little upset because Dan Gooden, who is a very good security guy in ours  technica, um, I think got it wrong.  And, uh, and it's kind of spread a little bit of FUD about it.  He says, this is the headline.  Amazon devices will soon automatically share your internet with neighbors.  Amazon Amazon's experimental wireless mesh networking turns users into guinea pigs.  And, uh, you know, and his only complaint is, well, other wireless technologies have  had, have had security flaws.  This might too.  Um, that's not good enough.  Uh, Mr.  Gooden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here are the three reasons you should opt out in my humble opinion.  Oh, so you're saying you should opt out.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I think you should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, if you wish to, if you wish to, here's why, but you're not, you're not  recommending, let's be clear.  You're not recommending that's your up down.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think you should, but here's the way that here's how you should be  thinking about this.  You should not be worried about the security things, especially if you're not  worried about the security of wifi.  Basically his argument is like, Hey, people break into wireless  protocols all the time and they do.  He's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So stop using wifi.  Right.  Is that what he's advocating?  No.  Yeah.  I mean, web flaws.  I mean, he's saying wireless technologies like wifi and Bluetooth  have a history of being insecure.  Okay.  So we'll stop using wifi and Bluetooth.  Well, and furthermore, Amazon's taken great pains, I think, to avoid these problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They have done a good job on the security protocols.  Here's why you should, if you want to opt out, here's some good reasons that  you might want to opt out.  One, you're in a rural network that charges you per megabyte or per gigabyte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cause this is going to Amazon says that it will use up to 500 megabytes per month.  So that's half a gig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I suspect it won't be anywhere close to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think it will, but it's 80 kilobits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's very slow.  It's dial-up modem speed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But if you're worried about that and that's a big issue for you, then this,  that would be a good reason to opt out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you're metered, that's a good reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's an if-then clause then.  If worried, then.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Two, if you are like, you know what?  I think it's pretty dickish of Amazon to opt into something.  And I have real issues about that.  Yes.  I have been, you know, if you want to make a point of like, say in all the other  services that force you to opt in and you stop using them and all that, you're,  you know, that's a big issue.  Then yes.  Three, you think, Hey, you are asking to share my network, Amazon.  You're going to benefit from this.  Why aren't you paying me something?  You are Amazon.  And I actually think Amazon should be saying, Hey, we'll give you a digital  download if you opted to this.  I actually think to, you know, could have done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Similar to like, yeah, helium's got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's got an incentive for you to join.  Right.  I don't think they have to do like a whole token network.  That's crazy talk, but, but basically saying, Hey, we have the resources we  want, we see the benefit of having this big ad hoc distributed network that  everyone can use as Amazon, then Jesus give people a discount on something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me play Amazon here.  We'll do a little role play.  Sure.  So, cause I think I understand why they, what they're doing is first of all, I'll  be Mr. Amazon, but not as rich.  Where's your monocle?  We're not doing this for us.  We're doing this for the community.  Everybody can benefit from this.  For instance, tile is going to use this.  I imagine others will use it for lost dogs or lost parents or lost children.  There will be lots of ways you can use this.  And in fact, we're not really using this for anything that we don't really need it.  For instance, we already know where our trucks are.  They're loaded with GPS.  We already know where your packages are.  We scan them every step of the way.  So when it's not a benefit to us, we're doing this because it's a good thing.  It's creating a new low speed mesh network in places where there's no  connectivity at all and there's lots of uses.  So what, you know, maybe we'll benefit down the road, but we're not going to give  you something because it's not for us.  You're doing this.  You're doing this for your community.  So now laugh like Jeff Bezos.  And then number two, the reason we, yeah, admittedly, as Dan Gooden says, it's  kind of a dick move to make it opt out.  But if we made it opt in, nobody would turn it on.  Right.  That's why you've got to incentivize people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I feel like if Amazon, so Amazon could benefit from this, they will  eventually provide devices that work on this network.  They could eventually use it for, but others could too, right?  It does.  Yes.  Yes.  Other people can use it.  They've already put up the code.  You can actually build a sidewalk compatible device today.  You don't have to license it from them or anything like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I have talked to people who are building sidewalk compatible.  They're actually really excited about this network.  You had a fourth, Stacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want you to forget you had a fourth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  We'll get there.  Hold on.  Okay.  But let me finish this point.  So sorry about that.  Amazon could benefit from it, but if you really believe in the power of  IOT and you want to make the pie bigger for others, and Amazon  historically has done this, they've actually invested in things that were  a little dicey convincing someone, because you could kill two birds  with one stone, you could say, you could get people to opt in by promising  them a digital download or something that's not, that's not, I mean,  a lot for Amazon.  It's not intangible.  Well, or intangible as it were.  I mean, a digital download isn't even a movie.  You don't get to keep it.  Amazon owns the rights to that.  Yeah, true.  I'm just saying.  So, so yeah, I feel like put your money where your mouth is.  You've got a lot of it.  And this network, while today may not exactly benefit you, it is designed to  benefit you, ring devices will eventually work on this network and it will help  them expand their devices that they can sell to people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's not fast enough to send video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.  It's only 80 kilobits per second, but it's fast enough to send.  Yeah, like turn on the light.  Right.  Think.  Here is your dog GPS.  Think.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here is your soil temperature is 80 degrees.  Think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Phoenix Warp in our chat room is saying, people aren't yelling at  Elon Musk for creating Starlink.  This is kind of like that without blocking blocking a view of the sky and  charging $99 a month.  This is, this is, I think it's a great public standard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, and look at, okay, let's talk about Apple's air tags where they're creating  a Bluetooth network on the backs of your cell phone data.  It's again, it's not, I have no problem with creating the air tags network, but  you know, anytime you're sending location and pinging someone about where you saw  a tag, you're actually using your data plan, your cellular data plan on your  Apple phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, is it safe to say it's just most important to make sure that consumers  are educated in all of this and understand what the potential risks are,  just like they are with regular.  Yeah.  And Bluetooth.  That's appropriate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're not going to read any, but don't spread the, don't, don't do the link

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  baby thing saying, Oh my God, Amazon's you've got to run over to your, all your  Amazon devices and turn this off immediately because I don't think that's  fair.  I'm really frustrated by that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not fair.  And I also, and I get this people who don't trust Amazon, the reactions I've  been getting when I'm like, Hey, I don't actually think you should turn it off.  And I get some very, a lot of vitriol and it's, it's not rational.  It's, it's very much hatred of Amazon and it's the Amazon should never benefit  from anything I do because they're the evil company.  Oh, and that's the last point.  If you think Amazon is a fundamentally evil company and you want nothing to do  with them and, but I would also argue, cause a lot of people like I turn it off  because they're evil.  Then you shouldn't own any Amazon device.  Yeah.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I feel like, so if I may, I just headlines, just the top three headlines on  Amazon and search for Amazon news, the guardian Amazon, U S customers have one  week dropped out of mass wireless sharing PC mag.  What is Amazon sidewalk and how do you disable it?  KHOU Amazon will soon share your internet with others near your home.  Here's how to opt out.  Media have taken this, this, this, the, the, the, the, an attitude that isn't  just, we're going to complain about it.  We're going to, we're going to make a moral judgment that you should stop it.  And, and, and then we're going to tell you what you should turn off and not  really make your own judgment, not say, well, if you want to know more, here's  what it is and make your own, no, the headlines are all that kind of click.  Baby.  The headlines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I will say, if you want to turn it off, I've done this.  I will tell you, here's how you do it.  So listen up y'all.  If you're like, so let me, before I tell you that, let me just make the case.  We are in desperate need of a low power wide area network to fill the gap between  our home wifi network and something like cellular networks, cellular networks are  expensive.  They use a lot of batteries.  But they are awesome because they let you have data pretty much wherever  their cell coverage.  The idea with Amazon sidewalk and with Laura Wann networks by like a Senate  makes one, helium has one.  The idea there is that you will have devices that just send a little bit of  data, just to share state or a temperature or location or anything easily and cheaply.  So that's, that's what this is.  It gets you a network that's provides coverage outside of your home area and  it's mesh and it's distributed.  Apple's building something similar.  Phone companies.  Everybody.  Oh yeah.  And that's the thing.  You can build internet connected devices that don't, that have a different  business model.  Cause the cellular business model is way too much for like simple devices, like  easy, like, like low power trackers for your water bottle.  So right now you only track high value stuff cause that's all that makes sense.  Or, it'll also let you have like, I could stick like, I don't know, as a weather  station, a tiny weather station at a park near me, just in, in share that data with  everybody.  If I wanted to, it'd be much easier to build some sort of community air pollution  network or all kinds of cool stuff or track temperature readings for the  environment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Point.  A lot of us have weather stations.  I have a purple air sensor that I share back to the purple network using my wifi.  Probably using more bandwidth than, than's used by the sidewall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, wifi's a battery hog and you have to have a network.  Yeah.  So, so there's a lot of really cool things that could happen from having this.  So, and the only way to build something like this cheaply is to, to get, you can't  put up cellular towers.  That CapEx model doesn't work for the type of price you want to offer these.  And so what Amazon's done is basically turned, imagine it turned your Echo  devices, some of your ring devices and Eero routers into little mini cell towers  and created this network.  So I think you should turn it on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  Good.  Okay.  That's, and that's by the way, that's the lead, right?  That's the lead.  Now, if you have concerns, I'm going to explain it to you, look at them.  A journalist says Stacey, but the lead is recommendation question.  Um, so the earlier attempt to do this, tell me if I'm wrong here was phone.  To an extent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, it's exactly like phone.  And you know, a lot of people actually share their Comcast.  If you have a Comcast network, you probably are sharing your wifi already with the  Comcast.  Oh, good point.  By the way, when you say phone, you're talking about FON.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  Uh, there was also Meraki.  Both of these were attempts to create public mesh networks.  And how much color is the device speaker?  Well, Meraki is now, but what Meraki started doing what phone did, uh, same idea.  Which would you buy in Meraki?  I didn't realize that.  Yeah.  Now they're Cisco.  Then they pivoted to enterprise.  Yeah.  Okay.  It wasn't a good business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did the phone ever get, which is part of the point too, about Amazon is Amazon has  tremendous reach and it puts it to good use now.  Whereas phone spent years and years and years trying to build a reach, which I  don't think was ever, if you're, if you weren't in a densely populated area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's still around, believe it or not.  It's still around.  I know.  They have more than 23 million hotspots around the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Meraki was founded and based on founded by MIT and based on roof net, which was a  mesh network developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  Same idea.  Same idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How many hotspots will Amazon have if, if people don't opt out because we're all

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  lazy, we know what's great is, is this is so low bandwidth and you know, I think  500, I actually 500 megabytes a month is a significant amount.  I bet it's a considerably smaller amount than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the max they said they will take.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It'll, it'll type out.  That's the up to.  They'll never, they'll never ask for more than that.  But I do think this is a good example.  I hate to admit it, Jeff, but I do think this is a good example of how this kind  of general fear of technology could actually make it hard for us to have nice things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's media bias.  Put it another way.  It's a prejudice now against the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's so, but it's a, it's a legitimate prejudice.  I will say a lot of people covering technology probably don't read the  white paper about Amazon sidewalk security efforts.  They also are not.  I mean, it's hard to agree with a behemoth, especially behemoth that has  behaved so badly in the past.  It really is.  I mean, this is, this is once bitten, twice shy.  And this is actually why I think I feel I don't feel bad for Amazon, but I feel  frustrated with Amazon because to me, the IOT we're entering this era where you're  asking so much of people and trying to provide some very real benefits, but you  need a lot of information about them.  And if people don't trust you, that relationship isn't going to work.  And Amazon has abused that trust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  I think your suggestion is so important is that if you, if you are sitting in a  boardroom with your one page email for Jeff, right, your one page report or  whatever it is you're allowed to be able to say, Whoa, let's, let's, let's talk  about how people are going to react to us and what we're trying to do here and  how we can do it better.  What if we gave everybody who did this reward just, just to gimme, right?  I think that's a really smart way to do it.  It's not even, not even to opt in.  You're already opted in, but if you're opted in after end days, here's a reward,  a thank you, because you're doing something we're going to tell you how.  I'm going to channel the Amazon executive again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The problem with that is if we do that, there is an implication that you, there  is a tit for tat that we're asking something of you and I don't want to give  that impression truthfully, if we make it opt out, it's on by default on all  Amazon devices that were sold in the last couple of years.  That means pretty much, and it's got a half mile radius.  That means it's going to be pretty much everywhere.  99% of people, they'll see these articles.  This look, it's going to Jeff, don't worry.  It's going to go away in a couple of weeks.  Nobody will even remember this.  And they're all, and 99% of people are going to leave it on  anyway, because it's too hard.  So don't worry about it.  No, we don't need to give anything away.  In fact, the best thing we could do is to say nothing, let this blow over  because the thing is going to happen because we made it opt out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So when we get to, but at a larger level, when we get to Google, which we will,  because it is this week in Google.  Um, and I was thinking before the show, you know, similar for the problem,  Facebook was getting everybody's problems.  They were the ones that got everyone, everyone, everything wrong.  Right.  Google was, was better, but now after the AI thing, after other things, they're  seeing the weak underbelly, they're going after Google now too.  And maybe for good reason.  And so I wonder too, how, what would you, what would you advise Sundar?  What would you advise Bezos?  What would you advise any of these companies to start to fix this?  I think that's the question that Stacey's asking.  That's the right question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, wait, I promise people I would tell them how to opt out.  Can I do that for them though?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And while you're doing that, I will show, I will show Dan, Dan  Gooden's article, which has the step-by-step so you can, uh, you  can follow along everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All you do is you go into your Madam A app, um, and you open more select  settings, get into your account settings, select Amazon sidewalk, and then there's  a little toggle switch, turn Amazon sidewalk off and that will do it for all your devices.  That will do it for all your devices, but every single person  associated with your account.  So my husband has his own Amazon account.  He actually needs to go into his Amazon Echo app and do it.  Right.  So that is, that is like, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I believe so.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's, that's what I'm saying.  So there's your caveat.  You got to get your whole family together and then poof.  I wish Amazon didn't do it that way, but I understand why they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's so, and we're trying to get in before.  Sorry.  Yeah.  Go on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wanted to ask the demographics of the, the, the people reading the different  articles, whether it's Ars Technica or CNET or tech Republic or whatever, because  of how things are being presented in the headlines.  I'll think back to when I used to write for tech Republic.  Um, things were totally different on that property versus CNET, which, you know,  were they at the time were the same people under the same umbrella, but the  readers were totally different from those of CNET because CNET side was a  little bit more consumer based and stuff on tech Republic was a little more, uh,  enterprise based.  So it was a different mindset, if you will, when people were reading  those articles, uh, I thought Ars Technica was a little more so leaning  towards like the nerdy enterprisey people that already know this stuff about tech.  That already know that this is an opt out and this, this is the ins and outs.  So it surprises me to see that such a click bait article even went up, but  well, here's our, the demographics changing nowadays from the people that are  reading their text sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, because it's not just tech sites.  USA Today's headline, Amazon sidewalk feature will share your internet  connection here's that opt out.  USA Today is a regular person.  But that's right.  So it's both, it's PC magazine.  What is Amazon sidewalk and how do you disable it?  It's, it's universal.  It's universal.  The same thing.  This is the one person I'm going to give credit to is Dan Patterson, your good  friend and mine, my buddy, my man writing for CBS.  So this is a very big mainstream and it, and his headline is completely neutral.  This is in money watch Amazon devices to start sharing connections with neighbors.  And he, I think does a fairly good job of talking about the pros and cons.  He does mistakenly say Amazon did not provide security details.  That's not true.  In fact, Steve Gibson has twice now reviewed though, that white paper once  in December and just yesterday.  And in both cases, Steve has says he was impressed with the attention that they  gave to this, even if for instance, the, the, the key password keys are broken as  as has happened with wifi and Bluetooth.  The data itself is, is properly encrypted.  So it would be a fairly big challenge for somebody and encrypted and anonymized.  There is no information in that data about you at all.  Not where it's originating from, not where who you are, not whose  account it is or anything.  So even if it is cracked, there is very little harm that can occur.  And there's still some work to be done to try to crack it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I was just talking to the CTO of level lock.  Um, he's actually my guest this week on the podcast.  And we talk a little bit cause levels actually participating in sidewalk.  Uh, they announced it with tile and he, he was excited about this opportunity.  He's like, this allows us, he's like for him, it lets them put Bluetooth and  Zigbee in a lock, but they don't have to worry about wifi.  And what happens is if you are out of Bluetooth range, you could piggyback  on this network to communicate back to your Bluetooth lock, which means you  have a lock on your door without a huge battery and using like battery sucking  wifi and he value, I asked him about security cause he's a luck maker.  He's like, you know, Amazon historically has done things like ask their  partners for data.  This network doesn't do any of that.  He's comfortable sharing, using it because it's not sharing state  data about the lock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that's, I mean, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I was just going to say developers, at least some want to use it because  they've evaluated it and they're like, yeah, this actually offers something for

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  us and for the, for the people.  So mad, I always go to Maznic for, for sensible and sane takes.  Um, and his, his Amazon's idea.  Well, YouTube, you're already here.  Amazon's idea for a mesh network is cool.  It's method of rolling it out is not.  That's a headline.  That's fair.  That's what Stacey says.  That's the, that's the lead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Um, but I understand why Amazon did it that way.  Any other way it would not have gained critical mass.  And that's, you know, if that's your goal, sometimes you have to do things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It has to be your goal when you're building a network.  Like mesh doesn't work without everybody doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, not just that.  No one will build devices if your network doesn't have coverage and no one provides  coverage unless your network has devices.  I mean, it's a bear to do a double-sided market or a network.  It just is.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's all.  He says,  Did I ask another question Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mike says the real issue is then is forcing everyone onto the network.  Obviously it's no surprise why this was done.  Just as we just said, a mesh network only works if you have enough nodes in the  network to make it useful while it's possible Amazon is betting that the  concerns over this will blow over and having so many nodes in the network will  make it worthwhile to take the short-term heat.  It still surprises me that the big internet companies don't take more steps  to alleviate these kinds of concerns upfront, taking a more cautious approach.  So he's, he's agreeing with exactly what we said, but I do feel like what I don't  know how you would do this if you're Amazon.  Anything you say is going to, the problem Amazon has is the problem all these big  tech companies have is that people don't like them because they're big and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  powerful, but they hate their phone companies more.  And I think that there was a, there was a PR way.  Well, maybe you could have done that.  Yes.  We can all share our internet together.  We can all have a benefit.  It gives you another option.  It's a generous thing to do to your neighbors.  We've worked on all the security and all the everything.  We're not sharing this or this or this or this.  It's a way that you can all help each other on those times when, when you're  somewhere and you just be able to get to the internet because we know how valuable  it is to you.  And we have these devices all over, which leads to my question.  I'm going to ask in a second.  And so we wanted to put them to good use.  Now here's my question.  Where was the point in the design chain of these devices?  Was there a point three years ago when they said, Hmm, if we add this little  guy, you guys, someday we can do this.  So when did they, when did they realize that they could do this?  And should they have been started talking about it then maybe someday?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no.  Amazon has been talking about this.  So Amazon launched this.  They soft launched this concept of a shared low power network in 2019 at their  device day with reporters.  Like, and probably not that many people, but I wrote a long article, how this was  Amazon getting into the network services business.  Yeah, you talked about it here.  Big deal.  Yeah, sure.  Yeah.  So, and then in 2020, they said, here's how, or so September of 2020, they  actually started talking about how they were going to do it and they put their  people out on a huge press tour.  They went to every major media mountain outlet.  They explained the limitations, the data limitations.  They explained the security protocol.  They did not hide any of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How long ago, what's the oldest device that works with this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The oldest device is the, I think the, well, actually they say all Echo  shows that are currently sold.  I don't know if the first generation one is, but it's the third generation  Echoes, those came out in 2019.  Probably devices coming out in like 2019 would have this.  They probably started building it beforehand.  I mean, this is, this hole in the network has been around for a while.  And it's been very obvious to anybody that NBIOT was not the solution because  the cell phone companies, they just took their stupid cell phone attitude and  was like, how much you going to give me per gig?  And, you know, they, they just didn't make it tenable for less expensive  devices and Amazon needed that.  So they were like, they saw a hole and they started filling it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are Google devices similarly situated?  Could they do this?  And could anybody else do the same thing that Amazon just did?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could do it with Bluetooth.  So to be clear, the Sidewalk network can work with Bluetooth as it will with  Tile and it can work with LoRaWAN, which is what I expect to see devices coming  out that will be LoRaWAN devices that will work with Sidewalk, which is a  much longer range, so Bluetooth, short range, LoRaWAN goes up to half a mile.  So, so what was the question?  I forgot.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who else could do this?  Who else?  Oh yeah.  So you're going to have to have scale.  Who else technically could do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are LoRaWAN networks out there today.  They have undergone a shift in the last year to build these  sorts of business models.  So Helium is one.  That's the company I talk about because they're doing that  token to insight coverage.  So that's one option.  Senate, which is a formal LoRaWAN network for enterprises, has also started telling  their customers that have set up their networks, that if they share their network,  they don't have to pay as much for coverage.  So Google doesn't have any long range chips that I know of in their devices.  I mean, again, this was very smart of Amazon.  I thought it was smart back in 2019.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's when I started talking about them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, so Bluetooth, Tile started this in 2014 with Bluetooth.  Right.  I mean, if you want to think about ad hoc.  Right.  But that was the idea.  They were like, if everybody has Tile on their phones, there's enough phones around  in a lot of places that this will work.  So the ad hoc mesh network kind of concept is not new.  It's the getting those underlying chips in like what Jeff is getting at.  And yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to take a break and I want to then talk about cookies because everything is  about to change once again.  And this is another example of how fear of technology is leading to an unintended  consequence, I think is probably the best way to describe that.  But first I want to ask you, have you all purchased your Father's Day gifts?  Are you ready, Stacey?  Is Andrew going to be so happy?  I am ready.  Is he going to get socks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I haven't purchased my Father's Day gift yet, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you have a father, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, my dad is gone.  But more than my Father's Day, I tend to buy my own stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because you know best.  Father knows best.  I just want to make a suggestion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if you noticed this lovely chemise that I'm wearing.  It's actually a beautiful shirt from a very unpretentious company called Untuck It.  And in fact, I love this shirt because I don't have to tuck it in.  I can.  But it's just the right length so that you can wear it untucked and it  doesn't look sloppy, it looks great.  Who wants to tuck in shirts anyway?  If you're struggling to find the perfect Father's Day gift, I have a gift for the  dad you love, a shirt from Untuck It.  I have now, half my wardrobe is now Untuck It.  Once I found these guys, first of all, they're wonderfully made.  That's their very high quality.  And the length is just right, about halfway down your zipper, which means it doesn't  look sloppy, it doesn't look like you're wearing a muumuu, it just looks  cash and relaxed.  Untuck It makes shirts designed to be worn this way.  They designed Untuck It, frankly, because this untucked shirt style is a tough  style to get right.  This is just perfect.  Fits all shapes and sizes.  In fact, that's one of the things I love about this.  Size is up to triple XL, but even within each size, you also have slim, relaxed  and tall fits.  So I was able to find a fit that worked perfectly.  And now I've just got a lot of Untuck It shirts.  I also love it that they have a huge variety of styles and fabrics.  They have performance shirts that wicks sweat.  I have a number of those.  Short sleeve button downs.  They have polos.  They also have linen.  Now I'm a big fan of linen and I bought short sleeve linen.  This is my new linen checked shirt.  It's stylish.  It looks good.  It feels good.  And it's great for hot weather.  Nothing breathes better than linen.  It's just great.  And their wrinkle free styles are fantastic.  You just wash them, tumble dry, hang them up.  They look ready to go.  They Untuck It tests every batch of fabric to make sure.  And I could tell too, I'm a little bit of a fabric snob.  They're getting the best quality and consistency.  That way all their button downs, their polos, their tees, their henleys,  have more than that just right fit and length.  They have the highest quality as well.  Every aspect of the shirt is checked five times to ensure they retain their shape,  their color, their strength.  And if ever there's a problem, nobody has better customer service than Untuck It.  If you're looking for shirts for going back to work, if you're looking for shirts for  dad, if you're looking for shirts for your upcoming vacation, I bought a bunch of them  for our trip to Hawaii next month.  Untuck It has you covered.  Check out that wrinkle free collection.  I'm a big fan, whether it's short or long sleeves, you're ready to get back to work  and look sharp.  Now you can't go to the store.  They have 85 Untuck It stores nationwide now, but they also can be ordered online.  And as always, they offer free returns and exchanges.  There's no reason not to try.  And now you can't take my Untuck It away from me.  I'm just, I'm just such a fan.  Get an Untuck It shirt for the father in your life.  Or if like you're the father in your life, get it for yourself.  And by the way, save to use the code TWIT for 20% off your first purchase at untuckit.com.  That's untuckit.com.  Use the code TWIT.  I'm actually sending this to my family so that I don't get socks or ties.  I want Untuck It.  Untuckit.com.  Do use the offer code TWIT so they know you saw it here.  Untuck It.  Shirts designed to be worn untucked.  But they have great dress shirts too.  I just, I'm a huge fan.  I'm really loving this.  Linnard feels so.  It looks good on you.  Does it look good?  No.  I love these shirts.  You look relaxed.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's it.  That's the Untuck It look.  And I am resisting writing the limerick for this.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  So get ready.  This is, this is actually a really interesting example of the  tyranny of the default.  And, and how companies use dark patterns to get you to accept something.  We've all seen the cookie banners that are all over the place.  Now the UK body responsible for policing these laws has published new guidelines  and it's going to change those cookie banners.  Right now, the cookie banner basically on anywhere you go says, we use cookies.  You okay with that?  And that's about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  They don't even ask if you're okay.  They just let you know.  We're using cookies to pass.  That is no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Click some, some websites actually let you adjust them.  They actually say it's a hard thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We don't do that because it's a hard thing to do.  Now suddenly we have to write a lot of JavaScript.  Plus there's a problem because if you reject cookies, then you're going to get  the same request every time you visit.  Cause guess how a site knows what your cookie preferences are.  They save them as cookies.  So if you don't do business in the UK and you never care if anybody from  the UK visits your site, you can ignore this, but almost everybody.  Is going to have to do this.  Get ready.  Those cookie banners are going to get a lot bigger and a lot more complicated.  First of all, no non-essential cookies, unless you ask first, Google analytics,  Facebook buttons, comment boxes, social plugins, tracking pixels.  You have to have this box that says analytics cookies.  And Oh, by the way, it has to be off by default.  It has to be off by default.  Or is this, this has just been approved by the UK.  What body?  The UK, uh, I'll show you the guidelines.  It's ICO, the information commissioner's office, by the way, as soon as I go  there, look at the size of this cookie banner.  Uh, there are fines.  They are, this is not a, a guidance in the sense that you can ignore it.  These, uh, this is, this is real.  No non-essential cookies.  You have to give people the ability to turn it, uh, turn them off.  And actually people will have to turn them on if they want them, which means  no one will have, you will never again be able to use analytics of any kind.  We use Google analytics all the time to know if somebody's visited our site.  You cannot emphasize accept over reject.  No big green accept button with a little reject button.  They have to be equal.  That's non-compliant.  If they're not, you cannot deny access.  If somebody says, no, I don't want any cookies.  Many websites block access until a user except their cookies under the new  guidance, that's expressly forbidden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've seen a lot of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh, I don't think that's terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I tell you what it means analytics are gone because who's  going to get the same thing as Apple.  Who's going to say who's going to turn it on.  It's off by default.  So let me go back to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what they're, they're going to, they're  But it's not just the technology companies.  They're going to hurt the media business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look, and by the way, here I am on this ICO site.  Look at the size of this cookie banner.  That's, that's, look at what I have to read.  Look what they just did.  I can't click through this.  I have to eat.  I have to do all these settings.  Now, if I say except all cookies, which I do every time.  Yeah.  It's analytics.  I think analytic cookies is still off.  So basically, wasn't all mean all.  I don't know.  That's a good question.  That's a good question.  I think it should mean all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Um, yeah, I was about to say, I think.  Did you accept necessary or did you accept all cookies?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I have to kill my cookies so that I can reload this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, no, no.  Remember last time you killed your cookies?  And that was, that was not a plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cookies aren't bad folks.  Cookies are not a problem.  Period.  Cookies are a tool.  They're a way a website can save information about what you want.  What your preferences are, where you go.  It's useful for websites, for analytics.  Um, if you don't want a website to know you've been there.  Okay.  I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's great, but it can also annoy people, especially when it comes to like  the Amazon ads, when they go to look at some news stories somewhere else and  something that they were looking for, looking at on Amazon, just, you know,  browsing around, not necessarily interested in buying it is now popping up in their  face and that's a bit intrusive to some people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The UK ICO also says analytic cookies are under no circumstances necessary.  So you can't say, accepting necessary cookies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So try to run a media and then they turn around and they say, Oh, the technology  companies are ruining the media business.  They just put a nail in the coffin of the media businesses with this.  It's just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the media businesses have to adapt.  I mean, come on y'all.  We, we understand that what's happening here is we've developed a technology that  works to track, that saves your information so you can be tracked around the internet.  Okay.  This is good for the following reasons.  This is bad for the other following reasons, but we don't talk about cookies  like that.  We talk about cookies like they are a demon and people like cookies bad and  regulators said, Oh, cookies are bad.  Well, okay.  Let's ban the, that form of tracking people around the internet.  So now we have to come up with new business models.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just ask Andrew what your new business model is going to be.  Cause I'd be curious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For instance, model doesn't involve that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, it does.  How else do you know somebody's a subscriber?  You're going to make a login every single time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you've been to my site.  You're going to, you're going to have to make a long, we would basically turn off  that banner.  Actually, we probably wouldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  But seriously, the only way you would know when I come to your site that you are,  that I am a subscriber is by a cookie.  Otherwise you're going to have to ask me every single time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We don't ask people if they're a subscriber when they come to the site.  Do you have ads on your site?  We do, but our ads don't ask that.  We don't, if we only track if you click on the ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  So you have, you have an ad set up tracking links where if you click the ad, it,  it, it, you charges somebody, but the ad impression, you don't charge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We don't charge for that.  We don't.  You're unusual by the way.  I, I know we're unusual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Almost everybody would prefer to charge for the ad impression because you're  getting the ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wanted to build a site that wasn't based on that.  So I built my media business one because I could, but my goal was to build  something that didn't involve tracking.  So that's the point I'm trying to make is yes, this kills today's media business,  but people are smart.  We can figure out other ways to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The only way I can make money on advertising, if I know how many people  download the ads, that's how we charge.  We don't charge a flat rate.  There's no click through on an ad in a podcast.  How would you suggest I monetize?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have a different business.  I mean, you have a more challenging model.  Cause say goodbye to all ad supported podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stay try being the Cleveland plane dealer.  Try being a local news at the time.  We're declaring local news.  Oh my God, it's such trouble.  This kind of crap happens.  I know it comes, it comes out of, it comes from the wall street journal and  Rupert Murdoch with the what they know, scary series years ago where Murdoch  had been given up on the ad model, tries to pull like Apple tries to pull the  rug out from everybody else who's still trying to figure out the ad model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is why we had to start club Twitter because, uh, but I have to say,  I despair for podcasts.  It's not going to, and you know what?  You're going to really hate what happens because the podcast industry is going to  be dominated by companies like Spotify that force you to use their app.  Yep.  In order to listen to a podcast, you're going to hate it.  Uh, but that's what people like the IC would say actions have consequences

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and this has consequences.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think business models like club Twitter have a lot of promise.  I think that well, it's not enough money for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It might be at some point enough money for us to operate.  I don't think it will ever be enough money for us to operate at  the level we operate now.  So this show will be canceled almost certainly.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's one of the first shows that will be canceled.  Do people hate us that much?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's just that without ads, I can't afford to pay you guys, pay the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  engineers, pay the light bill and pay the rent.  We will only do stuff that is either paid for by club Twitter members.  And that's a right now there's 3000 members.  It's $15,000 a month.  And that's my salary period.  Right.  Can you find your advertisers and find advertisers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are no advertisers who will buy an ad if you don't tell them how

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  many people heard that nobody in the world will buy an ad from somebody.  I have advertisers who do that.  Well, you're very lucky.  You're BDB, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's very different.  You're very lucky.  Cause if I say to an advertiser, yeah, maybe one person will listen to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the show or maybe a thousand or maybe a hundred thousand, I don't know.  And I'm not going to tell you.  They will not buy the ad.  I tell them, I give them my stuff.  I give them my stuff.  They will not buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I tell them, I give them my stats, but where do you get those stats?  I get my stats from WordPress.  I don't give them, I don't get, I don't get website stacks.  I give them downloads.  So they get my stats.  All of that's analytics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All of that is forbidden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now what do you do?  Tracking my podcast downloads are not done via cookie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's an interesting question because you're right.  We don't set cookies.  It's done by IP address and which is, is a personal information under GDPR.  One of the stupidest things about GDPR.  They have yet to enforce that.  If they do.  That basically breaks the internet.  It breaks any, any, any monetization model that makes sense on the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  You don't like big companies.  Only the big companies are left because only Google has its first party data.  They'll figure this out.  They don't need the cookies.  They got flock.  They'll figure out something else.  Amazon is selling you stuff.  They're figuring it out.  You'll only, this, this is the takeover of the big companies.  And again, I'm sorry, I'm going to say it.  I'm not going to use the MP words, but I am going to use another M word.  Murdoch.  This starts with Murdoch.  And I think Apple too, highly cynical acts to declare all advertising  models to be evil and surveillance.  Yeah.  Unless it's a first party model.  This kind of regulatory political move as the, as the unpopular UK  government is taking right now.  And as a media person who cares about news, I'm pissed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't care about news, but I do care about my business.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Your news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I care about you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, I, you know, I, so the ICO has enforcement power.  Um, we have listeners in the UK.  I don't, I'm not sure what's going to happen.  We'll see.  What would happen if you didn't do it?  Well, that's right.  You, uh, no, I'm not sure.  Uh, no, they find me.  They get a fine, but they can't, well, how do they collect?  I don't know.  It's, it's a constant question mark for us since GDPR.  We just really don't know what we're, we just recently put a cookie banner on our  side.  I, I was either pinning, we didn't need one, but we were informed.  We absolutely had to have one.  So I, I just really don't know.  I honestly don't know.  Um, I hope we're just being, I'm just being, uh, uh, oversensitive to it.  Maybe nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're trying to manage your business.  I just went into club quit and thanked them for being here.  Thank you guys.  Thank you.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, let's talk about Google.  They, uh, hired a guy, uh, as a head of diversity, uh, head of diversity strategy,  guy named Kamau Bob.  Uh, in 2007, he wrote a blog post, uh, when he was a research associate at, uh,  Georgia tech in which he wrote Jews have an insatiable appetite for war and killing  and an insensitivity to people's suffering.  Oops.  Now he has the right to say that, but he probably shouldn't be the head of  diversity at Google.  Maybe a different job would be helpful.  Yeah.  Um, anyway, he's old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is he?  So this was 2007.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And we're now we have a discussion about the Associated Press firing a young  starting reporter without saying why.  And that's a whole mess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The problem is your posts from 14 years ago live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not saying like, I mean, I will say back in college, you know, when I was  young and stupid, I did not have horrifying takes about Jewish people  because that was not something that probably said, well, I just, it's again,  I grew up with Jewish people.  They're my friends.  I, it's not a way I think.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you didn't know anybody who's Jewish, you might say, you know what?  I think they have really big noses.  I don't know because I've never met one, but I've seemed to remember that.  And that would be a very dumb thing to say, but it wouldn't necessarily be a  bias thing to say if three years later, you said, gee, I'm really sorry.  I said that that was stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I used to say things were retarded and now I would say, I used to say things  were lame and I tried never to do it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We, we've all in our language had things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Again, I'm not, I'm not saying that, that it's a great idea, but I  also, to, I mean, I can't condone someone saying that, but I do think.  We're, we're old enough on the internet and we have enough history of people  growing up being on the internet that we need to start talking, a to our kids  about what they put on, and I think they're getting better, but B we need to  talk about what to look for in remorse in learning and taking accountability for  our mistakes and saying, Hey, like, you know what, if that guy was like, yeah,  I was 19 and I was pissed off at the world and I said this and I'm really upset  and that's an upsetting thing to have said to people and that hurt people.  And I know that now and I've done this research to understand why that's such a  sh sorry, terrible thing to say.  What you were about to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Shame.  I said, John, John was near the dump button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, sorry.  But I don't know if that's, I mean, you probably shouldn't be head of diversity,  but I don't know if that's, that shouldn't haunt you for the rest of your life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We live in such a sensitive times that sometimes things people say in good faith  are, can be taken the wrong way.  I don't think that too, but I think people say things in bad faith when they,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, like, God, when I was 19, I was so, I had such a dark and bitter sense of  humor.  I was horribly offensive.  Yeah, I know.  She was, you were a goth chick, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  You had dark eyeliner and black, black hair and, oh, you still do.  I mean, I have brown hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm just teasing you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, I just thought I'd throw in a Google story just, just for grins.  Just cause yeah, what the heck.  What the heck.  It is after all our last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is after all our last show.  So we might as well live it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Might as well, don't start that.  Just, just cause I said, just cause I said that don't start it.  We've got three good ads today.  Of course they'll all be gone as soon as we have to tell, stop tracking people.  And by tracking, I merely mean, make a note of your IP address.  Yeah.  So that's how we know that you downloaded the show.  Yeah.  I mean, I don't think your IP personally, I don't think your IP address really says  much about you and every single website you go to knows that IP address.  Otherwise it can't send you the thing back to you.  They can't respond.  They need your return address.  Otherwise it can't respond.  They probably should throw it out.  And in fact, I think we now do throw out our logs pretty quickly because of GDPR,  but we still, how dare Amazon have my address?  We still have to, we still have to note your IP address, make a note in a little  black book and then if you've, you know, see if you downloaded it again and stuff  like that, but apparently they did have analytics on the blog from the desk of  Donald J.  Trump and the numbers were so bad that the president said, I'm not doing this  anymore.  They have actually, remember we announced the, he was saying, well, I can't be on  Twitter and Facebook.  I tell you what, I'll write tweets on a blog.  Nobody read them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My wife's theory is that actually he doesn't know.  And that they just tell him that he's still tweeting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they're patting him on top of his head too.  Right?  Yeah.  Right.  Exactly.  Tweets are still going out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  NBC news.  Careful of the hair there, Ant.  Careful of the hair.  Very expensive this hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sure that the, the blog from the desk of Donald J.  Trump has actual analytics, but NBC used data compiled with a company called Buzz  Sumo to estimate it.  And his engagement on the blog was a quote fraction of that on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which by the way, what interests me about this right now is that he's utterly  silent.  Everybody thinks he's in Florida.  He's actually five miles away from me right now.  Nobody even knows that.  Is he at Bedminster?  He's not out there.  Yeah, he is.  And he's saying nothing and people are acting as if the entire half of the  country is quaking in fear of him.  He's not saying anything.  He's not doing anything.  How is he still in charge?  It's, it's, he's more of an idea than a reality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's interesting.  Yeah.  He's, he's kind of a, a chimera haunting the Republican party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was going to say, yes, negative spirit haunting the party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are websites that difficult to, to access if you're following a celebrity that you  just love and they happen to say, you know what, I'm done with social media.  I'm just going to keep putting things on my own space because I own my own space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I tried that.  I got a fraction of the engagement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's what I wanted to, is it just that hard for consumers to even get to a  website?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I honestly think most people don't use Twitter, so I'm not sure really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But Twitter goes into mainstream media.  That's where you get the engagement.  Yeah, that's where you see it happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The engagement comes from the news covering your tweet.  And the news apparently decided they wasn't worth covering the blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  News also covers things that people are talking about.  That's why you were getting all these negative headlines about like Sidewalk, for  example, because people are talking about it and you want to get on those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but it's chicken and egg, isn't it?  I mean, which came first?  People talk about it because it was covered or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because I think a lot of people talking about it.  I mean, you don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you didn't put your finger to your ear to the railroad tracks and figure out  what people want to know about and then write it.  You would write your nose, your ear, your nose, your ear, whatever body part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I I talk to my sort.  No, I talk to my sources like I figure out what I want to write based on what  people I know and trust are talking about.  That's no different than the mainstream media.  I mean, sure, every now and then you're going to find a story where there are  three ways to get stories.  You're saying you wouldn't just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why so many people follow certain people?  OK, if this man had millions of people, he had tens of millions of followers,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but that's a fraction of the number of people even that voted for him.  So it's not it's not even a majority of the 75 million votes.  He only had 10 million followers.  It's not so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, well, let's say he were to get just 10 percent of those followers  going to his website. Why?  Why couldn't he get? He didn't.  He didn't even get 10 percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, right. Why would that not?  Because because well, this is the debate we're having.  Stacey says that news covers stuff because people are talking about it.  It's my opinion.  That Stacey, you would just look at a story, you know, you get a press release,  or you see something, go, I should write about this  because I know people will be interested in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but don't like what I do.  What I'm saying is that there's not like a super fans, right?  People are super fans. They love this person.  They love whatever celebrity that they follow or what have you.  And I would assume that they're going to go wherever they're going to go  because there are super fans that exist out there.  And it just seems I don't know, it just seems weird that people  can't seem to just go to websites.  I'm hearing that from, you know, just like you said a minute ago,  it's not just Trump's, it's everybody's website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you ever tried to go to a website on your phone?  Yeah, I do.  And it's a big pain in the ass, isn't it?  Yeah. Yeah.  Nobody wants to enter in.  You like type in an address.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was like, I was like, we go to websites on our phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Only because there was a link coming in from somewhere else.  Yeah. But I'm not going to.  How often do you launch your browser and type in from the.  Oh, I already screwed it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I do that on occasion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm the weirdo that has six tabs right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's what's changed.  That's what's changed.  When it was on the desktop, it was easy.  It was commonplace.  But I'm of the opinion.  In fact, it's interesting because I've been thinking about this lately.  The web's the web pages are almost dying out.  They're dead. Seems like they are.  And that's thanks to mobile, in my opinion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mm hmm. Don't get me wrong.  I'm going to continue to put things on my website  just because I like the signal.  But I know that there's a lot more engagement elsewhere for me and my brand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's why mobile web apps matter, too, is that it would make it.  And when I go to the Washington Post, I'm basically going to a web version.  But I think it's the app and I can get to it because the app and I have the app.  And people didn't download their Donald Trump, you know, hairball  to go there all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They didn't know they didn't know how to get there.  They were going to use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just use my bookmarks on because I use.  Well, when I was using Duck Duck Go, it was a little harder to go to a website.  I guess I only go to a few websites.  I don't have any. I don't download the apps on the desktop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We go to websites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I would say on my phone, I don't because I don't download the.  So does anybody have Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Any of you have Facebook? Yes.  Has Donald Trump's Facebook account been reinstated?  I believe it has. No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They haven't announced anything yet.  Would you check it just to see? OK, hold on.  Because I don't have Facebook.  I love that nobody on the show has Facebook, so I have to be the one to go in.  Mike, Mikey will go.  Let Mikey go. Mikey likes everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was one of my tabs right now in my mobile. What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't read it. What is it?  Twitter community. Oh, yeah, I go there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I go I go to I go to my mobile browser and certain websites  all the time, but again, I guess I'm you know, you know, I did on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're on probably on Android, because what I did on that is on on the iPhone.  I just made it an icon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I just hit the I could do that, too, if I wanted to.  Yeah, that way I don't have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The last post was January 6th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. But is the account active?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that has been there.  Yeah, he can't post it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm just looking at a tweet.  This is the last post, which is that on Trump's now reinstated  Facebook account, I don't think it was ever taken down fully in that sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, this was didn't they punt?  I thought the oversight committee punted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yes, they did.  But the question is, when Facebook took it down, what do they take down?  Now, I'm not sure.  I thought they left it up and he couldn't post. He couldn't post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, but today is the day that Facebook is making the announcement.  I'm just that's why I'm curious.  Or is it today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they have six months to the oversight board.  There was a rumor that they were going to make an announcement, but I haven't.  And I tend to get press releases from them about things on their list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just curious. I wouldn't want to miss that huge story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the kind of thing we do at 731 is Jeff made us leave at 730.  Then the story happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, I have no idea what he's talking about, folks.  Let's take a really quick break so that Jeff can leave at 731, I guess.  730, actually.  730. OK, so that means I have one hour and 19 minutes left of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then you're going to follow me, but you can go on and marry them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I don't want to touch the rest of them.  Just to not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Click.  You could torture Stacey and keep her around for an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stacey. No, he can't.  No dinner. Let's talk some more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  IOT. Stacey won't stick around there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, Microsoft.  I'm going to ask you when we come back about Microsoft's big IOT security announcement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, ReFirm. OK, I was like, shh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  ReFirm. Because Mary Jo said, who is?  Do you know anything about ReFirm?  I said, I don't, but I know somebody who might.  So I will ask you about that in just a little bit.  Big acquisition for Microsoft in the world of IOT security.  Our show today brought to you by Melissa, a very nice lady.  No, Melissa are there.  They're a company. They're the address experts.  They've been in this business for over 35 years, helping people in business  keep their address lists, their supplier list, their customer list clean and fresh.  It turns out about 30 percent of your customer data goes bad every year.  People move.  Names change.  Email addresses change.  And it makes it hard to reach out to your customers.  It makes it hard to send bills.  It makes it hard to find suppliers.  Well, you can verify addresses, emails, phone numbers and names with Melissa.  In fact, you can do it in real time with Melissa.  Melissa has a variety of very flexible ways to use it on prem web service.  They have secure FTP processing.  So you can upload a contact list and download the refreshed one.  You can use SAS. There's an API.  Melissa's global address verification service verifies addresses  in 240 plus countries and territories, and they can do it,  which is really cool at the point of entry.  You know, as a customer, sometimes I always very frequently flip  the numbers on my on my address, which makes that address useless.  Packages are going to go somewhere else.  But with Melissa, you can validate the address, make it right.  And it happens instantly.  Same thing with a customer service rep.  They're entering an address.  You could say, I can auto complete this because I know that information.  If you have duplicate customer information in your database, Melissa can help there.  Their data matching can eliminate clutter and duplicates,  increase the accuracy of the database,  ultimately reduce postage and mailing costs.  Plus, you'll get the information that completes your customer profiles better  You can add demographic information like property data,  marital status and social media handles.  Melissa also has a new lookups app that's on iOS or Google.  This is really cool that will do all of that for you for names, addresses and more.  And it's right at your fingertips.

We thank Melissa so much for their support of this week in Google.  Microsoft, actually, they spent almost two billion dollars, I think,  for this company, so must be good.  Refirm. They're an IOT security company.  And what their firmware security company.  That's what's interesting.  They have a software that scans firmware for flaws.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. So Microsoft, big picture.  Microsoft has been very much focused on IOT security  because they have a lot of customers in the industrial manufacturing  and enterprise world who are getting into IOT and are like,  oh, we need to do this, but we really need to do this right.  So earlier this year, they bought a company called Cyber X  and that company does OT security.  So the security for the actual devices.  And this is the next in part of like what I think of as Microsoft's  beefing up of both the I.T. and the OT security side. So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They think they were former NSA hackers who founded this company,  which is kind of interesting.  They grew out of the bin walk open source project in 2010  that helped security analysts extract firmware images from devices.  And now you can extract it and I guess scan it to look for  vulnerability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, because what happens is Microsoft has this cool  IOT security project called Project Azure Sphere.  But that is for new stuff.  So when it bought Cyber X, what it does is that does analysis  for industrial networks.  And that's what I think that that helps secure older stuff.  Same with this. This is both new and old,  because like Microsoft, you know, when you're putting more stuff online,  you're not going to take your old stuff offline. Right.  So this allows you to check for vulnerabilities,  weaknesses, and I believe it also has updating. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Interesting. OK. I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know if it has the Azure Defender for IOT

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  platform that Microsoft's been putting together.  So you can upload your firmware to Azure Defender and have it scanned.  You can also fix vulnerabilities and update the firmware,  which will help you ship more secure devices and then  continue to update them through the Azure device update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's actually a bunch of startups out there in the firmware space for IOT  because these are long lived and you've got to always be thinking about security.  So there's companies like Foundries.io.  There's one that actually just launched today called Goliath.  That's not exactly firmware security, but some of the things they're solving  help with that. And the whole idea is instead of having, I mean,  because if you've got 20,000 different types of devices on your network,  you can't manage or map 20,000 different firmware images.  And this helps make that a scalable process.  And so that's what this is really important because  just one weak link in your chain and boom, you're out.  So we're coming after and we'll see lots of  corporate IT shops buy things that are much more appropriate for like these  industrial and kind of deeper recesses  of the gear that it needs to secure, physical recesses of the gear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So just a quick follow up.  It looks like Facebook has reinstated both the Trump Facebook account and the  Instagram account. They have both been...  silently reinstated. So notice I can follow him now.  And I think somebody needs to tell the man from Mar-a-Lago  because he's got to get posted again. But those are bad guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I'm so disappointed. I'm angry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's interesting. They were told by,  what were they told by the oversight committee?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That they had to come back in six months with a decision and the decision  couldn't be just indefinite. It had to be that there's a term that he's off  forever, that he's back, whatever, but that indefinite was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to guess that's why the blog suddenly asked as they must've been  informed. Yeah, you, you're, we're bringing you back on Facebook. Not a,  I don't think ever on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's not a single story I can find anywhere on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know where I'm seeing it? Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Imagine that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Okay. Okay.  Now here is something from Andy Stone who is Facebook's communications.  He is saying nothing about the status of Trump's presence on our platform has  changed. He remains indefinitely suspended. So this,  this must be one of them Twitter stories that got a life of its own.  I don't, you know, I guess all that means is the accounts are still there.  You could still follow them. You can still comment, right?  But he can't post. Nobody can post on that.  Cause on both accounts, it's January 6th is the last post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm asking somebody who works with the oversight board on the,  on the Facebook side. I'll see if I can get an answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google is getting enthusiastic,  according to CNBC enthusiastic green light to build a new  multi-billion dollar mega campus in San Jose.  It's been in the works for the last four years.  Construction may begin as soon as next year. It will take 10 years to build.  It is a mixed use.  In 10 years. Well,  you might be living in Googleville because it's,  it's called the downtown West project, 80 acres of land in downtown San Jose.  It includes 7.3 million square feet of office space for 20,000 workers,  but it also has thousands of housing units.  It's Google's first mixed use campus. It's really a town within a town.  I heard a rumor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think of those as company towns. Yeah. Coming to Nevada.  Really? I don't know. Google's everywhere.  I believe it was the, was it the Birkenstock facility?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google's going to come move in there. Oh yeah. That's the old Birkenst.  It was, but it's now I think McGraw Hill Book Depot.  And then a Birkenstock was in there for a while.  It's a big old building just down the road. It's a big building.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I for some reason I've heard a couple times that Google has been kind of on the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  market for a while. Something with that. Interesting. That'd be fun.  Downtown West will include 300 hotel rooms,  800 residences for short-term lodging for corporate guests.  Google will own all 80 acres,  but more than half of the project will be allocated for residential and public  space, parks, restaurants, retail space, and entertainment space,  ecological viewing stations.  It's going to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Best children is a tree we used to have until we killed everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Come everybody. Let's go look at the grass.  That is actually could,  the other saying could take between 10 and 30 years to fully build it out.  Geez. I want to live in Google land.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  San Jose has changed already thanks to Google so much when I lived in the Bay  area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you have you downloaded the new Chrome 91?  OS or browser?  Not OS browser, but you'll get it in your Chrome OS. Of course.  It is now 23% faster with JavaScript.  And here's a fun stat.  Yeah. 91. Yeah. Here's a fun stat. Only Google can deliver.  It's so much faster.  It will save 17 years of user CPU time a day.  Every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How many tabs do these people have open?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's a new even faster.  We were talking about yesterday with Steve Gibson because they've been optimizing  JavaScript again and again and again and again.  And it really tells you how much of the web now is JavaScript.  So they've, they've beefed up the JavaScript compiler.  It's even faster.  It's called spark plug spark plug.  Yay. Replaces ignition and turbo fan. What's this fan belt?  It seems like camshaft. They're all engines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what I just got? I'm so happy about this. I just got this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is that? It's beautiful. It says the linotype manual.  Is that a republished manual? So it's not the original though.  It looks like somebody reprinted it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no. This was later. This was, this was from some bread. This is how,  this is how the justification occurred. Wow. So this is, this is,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  was it would actually have been read by a linotype operator? Well, it's, it's,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it's impressed from a JR Jones in Bushley hurts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I love Bushley. Have you ever been there? Fabulous. Don't,  don't know cookies though. No cookies. Not allowed.  Google is about to, I hear somebody eating cookies.  I may be wrong, but I think somebody just took a bite of  cookies. Stacy. No, I have no cookies. Where, who is crunching?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. Wasn't me. You heard the plastic wrap on the,  you may have heard. Yeah, you may have heard. No, no, it sounded like them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No cookies. I was contemplating it though. I like, I was like,  when you were like, who has the cookies? I was like, I was just thinking about,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I should have cookies. I do have popcorn here, but I haven't been eating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why do you put popcorn in a trash can like that? Star Wars trash.  This is not a trash can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that your popcorn bucket? Yeah, it's my popcorn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just got the official answer from Facebook.  No change in status.  We think someone may have just realized that they can still see his old posts.  We know that. Yeah, that's still locked.  None of the violating content is backup. Okay. Okay. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's interesting. It just, it just stops January 6th. Boom.  Both Instagram and Facebook. Boom.  Google is about to settle with the French.  Google is, it's an antitrust case.  A French investigation alleged that Google's ad server favored ad exchange.  This is, this is,  there've been a lot of people investigating this kind of self-dealing that goes on  in the, in the Google cause Google both sells the ads and buys the hands from  itself. And it's a very odd thing.  France's competition authority, or as they say, competition,  authority,  alleged that the company's advertising server double click for publishers gave  Google's online action auction ad house,  ADX and advantage over other auction operators.  Me, if I'm a business guy and I'm selling to myself,  I'm going to give myself a deal. It just seems reasonable,  but it's apparently a violation of antitrust as part of the settlement.  Google has neither accepted nor denied culpability or as they say,  coupability.  The people,  the proposed changes would be binding only in La France,  but it could be adopted more broadly by the company publishers and ad tech  companies elsewhere in the world,  including the U S have raised similar concerns about the workings of Google's  products. They didn't say how much money the settlement involved.  I'm just trying, I'm trying to get Google news in here. Just trying to,  it's called this week in Google for a reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google.  You can do a change log.  I could. All right.  I mean, I'm not, you don't have, Oh, Oh, Oh,  I didn't see this quick.  Yes. UDPs protocol to replace TCP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's been published as a standard by the IETF.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ready? Ready? Is it cause we can't do handshakes after COVID?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know what you're talking about. This is,  that was a very nerdy joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How geeky can you get?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So quick is a protocol for transmitting data between computers.  If they have to do a little handshaking to work and improve speed and security  and the internet, it replaces TCP, which has been around for a long time,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  which, which also requires handshakes.  And UDP doesn't. That's the joke for the non networking nerds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And TCP was vidsurf, right? And team. Yes. Right. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Quick has been in public development for eight years since Google first  announced it as an experimental edition of the Chrome browser.  But the IETF says, I like quick.  It is the new internet standard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So is it actually going to be a news story? So excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I need to talk to someone right now. Talk to me, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Quick is designed to do the same things. TCP does, but better.  TCP, as you know, is a resilient and has a whole ACK,  NAC process that requires a conversation between servers.  UDP does not. And it looks like quick is going to use UDP.  But the problem, of course, with UDP is it can't recover lost packets.  Doesn't even know those packets are lost. It just goes on.  Quick does have a recovery mechanism outside of UDP.  It's supposedly faster than TCP.  In fact, that's what quick stands for is quick UDP internet connection.  But the IETF says quick is not an acronym.  So anyway, this is good. This will be faster.  This gets the benefits of UDP, which is widely used for streaming,  because if you drop a packet, you drop a packet.  You're not going to resend into all of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But TCP is a lot in robotics, too, believe it or not,  because it's faster and your robots, you're just like,  do this, do this, do this.  And then eventually you see it do it and you're like, it's done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All that acknowledgement takes time, all that resend and all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I still don't understand who has to agree to make this work.  So if Google Chrome can do it.  Well, companies have to start implementing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you have to see how's that going to work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you have to have a backup of TCP and quick.  Because what if this is why I want to talk to people quick?  Oh, like we're not the similar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Would it be like Nats for IPv4 versus IPv6?  I don't know, but I want to know.  And I can find all of this out and I'm really excited to.  Oh, my gosh. Basically, here's the deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's the deal.  It does have to be implemented by internet communications devices.  But now that it's an IETF standard, it's been approved.  That's the green light to go ahead, implement it, make it work.  Pretty much everybody's been playing with it, I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, oh, this says Cloudflare is going to be able to offer it to people.  Lots of people fastly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Lots of people are going to be doing this.  So you'll see you'll see the benefits right away of a faster internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, OK. And there are still a problem.  Yes. People are still using and hoarding IPv4 addresses, and we still have.  Grrr. My dog is even pissed about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of less of a problem than we thought it would be because of NAT,  and especially because of a carrier NAT.  But I guess, you know, we still would like to go to IPv6.  It's amazing how many companies internet providers don't support it.  It's kind of remarkable. It really is.  It's frustrating. It's like, I mean, by now anyway,  YouTube says it paid out four billion dollars  to the music industry over the past year in royalties to artists,  songwriters and rights holders.  These numbers, you know, I remember Spotify had a similar number  and people point out and I'm sure they'll point out  a lot of that doesn't actually go to artists.  It goes to, you know, the labels who've made these rotten deals for artists.  And so it's it's good.  It's good. But but it's all you're saying is they did their part.  We did our part. You got to make better deals. That's right.  But to Facebook, just looking through if there's anything of interest.  No, they did not reinstate Donald Trump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't say 630, I said 730. You can play anytime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm rushing. I'm moving along here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't need to rush. You don't need to rush.  This is what happens when you tell him there's an out,  then he thinks it's like two minutes from now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you see, we talked about it on Sunday, Amazon's solution.  First of all, a couple of Amazon stories.  One, the injury rate among warehouse workers at Amazon  is twice that of the industry average.  It's a dangerous job. But Amazon...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it warehouse industry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, warehouse industry.  Or is it retail?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, warehousing, comparable jobs.  OK. Two, Amazon's on it.  They've introduced tiny Zen booths for stressed out warehouse workers.  If you get stressed here, let's just take a look at...  Amazon.  I wanted to provide a place that's quiet.  She's made a little phone booth.  And focused on their mental health.  Where you wear...  It's a coffin sized booth in the middle of the warehouse.  Where you can go and view mental health and mindful practices  in a basically a padded booth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Plants sit on a shelf.  There is a fan, but there is no urinal.  The skyline on top is tinted blue.  The computer waits for the employee to load up a guided meditation video.  The employee who invented it...  I think she's a warehouse employee, so good for her.  She's trying to do something.  Calls it Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When you talked about it Sunday, I didn't quite know how to feel about it  because of it being so small and sort of like right there in the middle of everything.  But yet there's a lot of therapy out there.  Like this sensory deprivation.  Yeah, maybe it's good. It might help.  People do. Sure. I'm not saying...  It may work.  I just don't like the fact that it's right there in the middle of everything.  Drawing attention to it.  Sometimes that's the last thing people want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, well, and I'd like to announce...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When are you allowed to go in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The new twit booths that we're going to spread around the studio.  And if at any time you feel stressed or upset, just go on in.  There's a hat in every one you could try on.  Oh, gosh. Oh, goodness.  What I almost thought was...  And some whiskey.  And some whiskey.  There is brown liquor in every one of our twit booths.  Motherboard reached out to Amazon to find out when exactly its overworked staff  is supposed to use the Amazon booth during their breaks.  Lunch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the important thing now is you can go in there and smoke something new  and not get in trouble for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's another Amazon story.  Right. They're not going to test anybody for weed anymore.  Go ahead, smoke them if you got them.  And by the way, cannabis stocks rallied after Amazon said this.  They're going to treat the same as alcohol.  They don't test you for alcohol use, but they will, of course,  you know, if you if you have a problem, they're going to  send you to the booth.  But other than that, you don't get tested.  It will no longer screen perspective employees for marijuana, for any positions.  Now, obviously, drivers, that's different.  So any position is not regulated by the Department of Transportation.  This is just the way the country is going.  I'm not sure I like it.  I'm not a big fan, frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. I'm fairly conservative as well as fairly liberal.  But I've always thought it was odd to see these drug tests at different corporations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Like, who cares if you get high at night and you're working in a warehouse.  All right. But they would go out boozing after work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. And like and there was no problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or when I worked at Time Inc. during work.  Yeah, sure. The three.  I've had some of those myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. We we we have our lunch meeting, if you will,  which lasted half of the day, the second half of the day.  But, you know, there was never any testing for how much alcohol we may have consumed.  But there was that test for other drugs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Amazon has also changed its contracts with employees that used to, as many companies do,  in fact, ours does, require in the contract that you resolve disputes  outside the traditional court system using arbitration.  Arbitration, right?  Saves money, saves time.  It's fair, I think.  But it turns out this is backfired on Amazon.  There are seventy five thousand outstanding arbitration demands.  So they're saying, oh, screw it, just sue us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It didn't it didn't really cost you more.  Yeah, fine. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Afforded plaintiff's lawyers  flooded Amazon with more than seventy five thousand individual arbitration demands  on behalf of Echo users.  I think Amazon decided a class action lawsuit might be a lot easier.  The move, by the way, cost them tens of millions of dollars in filing fees  payable by Amazon under its own policies.  So they're they're just going to drop the arbitration.  You know, I think it's widely used, although the state of California  briefly considered making it illegal  to require a binding arbitration in employee contracts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, this is an employee. Of course, this is customer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Customers. Yeah. Different.  Yeah, that's actually interesting.  Do most companies do that?  They said you can't sue us, but we'll go to somewhere in the T.O.s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, in terms of service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I never read those. I should probably. Exactly. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can I just mention real quickly, I just found this fascinating.  It was a coincidence of four stories this week  that go back to my days when I was running local sites.  The biggest pain in the butt for us, the most subpoenas we got  were about fights in police departments between officers and chiefs.  And cops get themselves in trouble on social media.  Constantly, there's four stories here.  One, a Pennsylvania police chief is charged after threatening a citizen  over a critical Facebook post to a Fall River police officer  was suspended for his Facebook post after the Derek Chauvin verdict.  Three, however, a Philly police officer fired over a Facebook post, got reinstated.  And four, an Orange County deputy was suspended over TikTok videos  dancing while wearing too little.  What is it about police are guardians of public.  They're just like everybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the story of everybody else.  Now, I have to say, if you're the teenage girl  who took on a mama bear, then you deserve a commendation.  There's the mama bear and her two baby cubs walking on along the wall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Little memorial. So pissed if I were the mom of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here comes the dog.  The bear is defending the babies against the dog.  But the owner's apparently not happy. What?  Don't know. Don't you just push the bear off the wall?  A mother bear. The bear is like, I'm going out of here.  I don't know. They use crazy.  It's crazy, lady.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  These TikTok people are nuts. It's crazy.  That was my first time seeing that video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Would you be mad if your kid like did that?  You'd be like, do you know the dog have the bear or let the bear have the dog?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, look, the bear and the dog. Yeah, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But yeah, teenagers are so dumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Lisa came running into my office this morning as I'm playing Valheim,  something very important, and said, did you see this video?  Said, honey, I'm busy mining.  Just I'll watch the bear video on Twig.  Oh, you know, I just I don't I just want to say  this is all about encroachment of human beings on wild animals territory.  It's theirs, not ours. Try to live with the bears.  She's crazy.  Maybe it's crazy. Jesus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know what's worse, the bear or all the turkey and deer  that's in our yard every day in the neighborhood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Turkeys can be deadly. Don't mess with turkeys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't mess with them.  They are quite annoying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am so used to the turkeys because they're all they're wild turkeys all over.  We have many of them and they make the goblin all the time.  And I don't know if you noticed, but I did that review of the my new car,  the Mach 3, and I wasn't paying attention.  And I'm talking along and I'm holding the camera because we don't have  you know, because of Covid.  And there's and I'm watching the review.  There's a turkey gobbling madly in the background.  I don't know. You can't see it.  So I'm wondering if people think nobody said anything.  Like, did Leo stick a turkey gobble in that?  Is he making a what does that mean editorial comment?  No, it was just a turkey. I'm so used to it.  I didn't even notice it.  All right, let's do the play that little thing there.  We're going to do the Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the bump bump more Chrome 91 news, there's a nearby share feature.  This I'm sorry, Chrome OS 91.  This is for you, Jeff.  There's a nearby share feature.  Google's rolling that out to Android as well.  App notification badges and more nearby share.  With a appears look under in your settings under connected devices.  You can you can enable visibility for five minutes.  It shows you other.  Only other Chrome OS and Android devices.  You could send images, text, URLs and other files over Bluetooth,  Bluetooth, low energy, Web RTC or peer to peer Wi-Fi.  They announced this last August when they launched it on phones.  But it finally has come now to Chrome OS.  There's also a circular notification badge on app icons.  I don't care.  The files app is making it easier to save content offline.  That's a big deal.  I mean, Chrome OS is really designed for online document storage.  But there is a new available offline toggle in the top bar.  And then content when saved offline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why share stuff offline all the time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And now you see it has this checkbox.  So that and there's a dedicated offline folder in the sidebar.  So that's rolling out later this month, the pinning feature.  There's a new imaginary wallpaper collection.  I don't know why it's imaginary, but that's what they're calling it.  It's from artist Leo Natsumi or as I call him, Leo Don'tsumi.  He created these fun digitally sculpted designs.  The bright, cheerful scenes are great for kids or adults.  Check them out.  Go to quick settings and personalization.  And they don't have opera blobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't care. No, it's close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It looks blobby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All blobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a few other features, but that's that's basically it.  Chrome for Android is adding a built in screenshot tool  and editor in the share menu.  So when you go to the share menu, now you can share the picture of the page,  which is, I think, a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The screenshot app in Chrome now is very good.  Much better. Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Your entire screen, including the Omni box, you know, the address bar  is captured with the bottom bar featuring tools to crop, add text and draw.  So you can even annotate it.  The text UI.  In the current field features corner shortcuts to crop, expand, tilt and delete,  and then you can doodle in 18 colors and six stroke sizes.  Undo and redo also available when you're done.  Tap next and then you can share it, save it or delete it.  So that's good. That should be.  That's cool. That's built into Chrome.  On Android, Apple TV is now available on all Android TV devices,  including the Nvidia Shield.  I have to say, I've used Apple TV on non-Apple devices.  It never seems to run quite as well as it does on on Apple devices.  But still, why would that be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I wonder why. Is that planned?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've only used Apple TV on non-Apple devices.  So I'm like, now what? What is the experience I'm missing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's fine. I won't tell you.  So if you watch Ted Lasso, you can watch it now on your shield  or your Google Chrome device, your Android TV device.  Sony Sony Bravia TVs.  Actually, it's been on Chromecast with Google TV, the new Chromecast for some time.  Google search is adding a Pride Month Easter egg.  So go search. Let's do it. Google.com.  Search for Pride or Pride Month  and see what happens.  Confetti.  Woo. It's a party.  Woo. Woo.  Very nice. And the heart in the in the knowledge box is a beating rainbow.  It's that pretty. Kudos, Google. Yay.  Google is rolling out a weather frog.  If you've got a Nest Hub or Hub Max, which I do,  you will now have a new clock, the weather frog clock.  I guess it you could say, you know, hey, you know who change photo frame?  You can do it in the app as well.  The weather frog, I guess, tells you, oh, it's the same frog that's on the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  if you go to the in your Android phone, if you click on the weather,  it's that frog. Yeah, it's that frog.  Same guy. My frog today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Same frog. Yeah. Oh, he's enjoying a sunny day.  Let me see what my frog's doing. I'm just curious.  I don't even know. I've been outside.  He could be picnicking in an open field while gray clouds hang above.  He could be splashing in puddles while wearing a yellow raincoat as it pours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't get a lot of time with this frog.  I want to I want to know like a lot about the frogs.  Oh, you got the frog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've got a frog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's wearing a mask below its mouth as a chin.  But it's outside.  Well, it's eating.  I don't care whether that's not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's been masked normally.  I think he's within CDC.  Basically, the frog listens to the CDC.  It still pisses me off.  OK. Outside and eating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How do I get the frog?  Yeah, like I'm tapping the temperature at the top of the screen, right?  That's that's pretty good.  Yeah. And then I get this stupid thing.  There's no frog.  Swipe up. Oh, swipe up for frog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you not get the frog at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, I get I get the frog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, there's a frog.  I swipe down and he's sorry.  He's he's he's picnicking in the picture.  Yeah, here I got the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, oh, I always thought the frog was via temperature,  but we all have different temperatures.  So maybe the frog is just via the day and the weather.  It's really I want to know when the frogs like,  is there a rhyme or reason to what frog people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Anything less than a monsoon is sunny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's based on the weather.  So froggy could be hiding under a pot, splashing in puddles,  sunbathing while putting on sunscreen.  He could be reading napping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh. But like today, if it were raining here,  I would obviously have a different frog than you all.  But we all have the same frog.  But my temperature is 81 and yours is 71.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So my difference, by the way, my frog also is wearing his mask

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  improperly. You want your frog to be sweating?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, but like sometimes I feel like the frog is doing things that are not like  it'll be it's like 53 and the frogs out like sun tanning.  And I'm like, no, 53 is too cold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's too cold to be doing that.  I'm on my deathbed.  I don't know. Google Meet Web Design.  The Google Meet Web Design is rolling out now full availability  for everyone by this month.  I haven't noticed it yet, but streamlined bottom bar controls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Honestly, what do you do?  You're sick of seeing Google Meet and Zoom and stuff.  Because we use Meet for our staff meetings.  When you get on Meet, you go, oh, I love the new redesign.  No, you don't. No, no, you don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You go, hey, did you turn your mic on?  Yes. You're muted. You're muted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can notice there.  I think we're starting to get to the new the new share features  that Google announced at Google I.O.  You can now present Google Docs, Sheets and Slides  and to ongoing meet calls very easily.  Oh, boy.  This is, I guess, part of that new smart canvas stuff.  Cool. OK.  Woohoo. And that's.  The Google change.  But you can now buy a Dogecoin on a coin base.  You excited?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the price price was going up as a result.  Sure. Everybody wants it late to buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the meme coin. Yep.  Substack.  No, not substack stack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know I thought the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stack exchange exchange got sold stack exchange.  Thank you.  This is the site that everybody uses.  Every programmer, it used to be you'd you'd you'd,  you know, you'd research, you'd study,  you'd you'd very carefully craft your code.  Now you just cut and paste from stack exchange.  Did they just get bought?  Is that what happened?  I thought they did.  Maybe I miss miss.  Well, I saw I thought I thought I saw that, but I can't find it now.  Oh, well, never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Spreading fake news again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This week in speculation.  Oh, I saw that. No, I did.  I know I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Was sold for one point eight billion.  That's what I saw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, stack overflow overflow, which is by stack exchange.  There's the is it? Yes.  Oh, OK. So what is stack overflow?  That was the dev site, right?  Yeah, that's where that's.  Stack overflow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I remember seeing a lot of  if you mostly free and active directory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I guess Stack Exchange continues.  But the stack overflow is being divested out of it by it,  bought by process process process.  P.R.O.S. U.S.  They are buying.  No, they're buying stack overflow for one point eight billion dollars. OK.  You know, I'm just I'm rummy.  I'm getting rummy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or does that mean is that R.H.E.U.M.Y.  That's roomy. That's roomy.  Oh, OK. That's why that's how I thought it was pronounced, but I was like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  no, I'm rummy. Have you ever heard that?  I'm rummy.  I don't know. I know.  Does that mean you drunk rum?  It's like punchy.  Oh, maybe I drank rum punch.  I don't know. Got it.  Just rummy.  Any other stories here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The NFG market bubble has popped.  Has it? Yeah, that's what the story says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's probably true.  That's what the story says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They say we've got the charts to prove it.  That doesn't look like a chart that looks like an illustration.  Let's see.  Here's the chart.  Well, that's not great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you can probably correlate that to just the crypto market anyway, in general.  That's a good point, Ant. Good point.  Yeah, it just goes up.  Because I know if you own the Ethereum side of things,  the gas fees tend to cost more than the actual art.  Somebody hit me up for one of mine and there's like,  you might want to raise the price because the gas fees cost more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It might be slowing down, but they say that $3 million worth of crypto art was sold last week.  That sounds like it's still a thing.  Yeah, somebody's doing all right.  Somebody's buying. I think that is the end of this fabulous show.  I think what we should do is you should prepare your picks of the week.

We also used to say that.  Now it's podcasts because I realized no one knew what the hell I was talking about.  What's this netcast?  It's like websites and social media, right?  Yeah.  I try to get people to call them netcams, not webcams.  That was a failure as well.  They're not webcams.  They're netcams.  They're on the net, not the web.  Pointage is hard, man.  It is.  Well, and you know what?  I've realized you just got to go with what people know.  If they understand it, that's all that matters.  It's language.  Stacey, what do you got for us this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have beach reading for y'all.  Beach reading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, I forgot to ask you what you want to do for your science fiction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Science fiction, I realized because I was trying to figure this out, right?  Science fiction is hard because everything is part of a series.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I was like, do I launch like the latest Murderbot book is a series, but it's short.  Hail Mary is not a series, but it's long.  Not a series, but it is long.  So I'm trying to think, do y'all want shorter, but part of a series?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why don't you go into our Discord?  There's a science fiction.  Actually, there's two sections.  There's a books section.  I saw there's a science fiction section.  There's a books section and there's a science fiction section.  So you could pick whichever one you want.  I think books maybe because it's books because science fiction could also be movies and  TV shows and things like that.  So maybe go to the books section and just ask.  You can even do polls in there.  I'll do a poll.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, because I was picking like books and I'm like, well, we just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ah, Stacey wants to do a kind of informal book club in the, you can set up a stage and  like we have a stage open right now for the show, but you can, and this is for a Club  Twit members.  So you have to be a member of Club Twit, but you know, that's just one more thing you  get for seven bucks a month at twit.tv slash club twit.  There, I snuck a plug in.  So your book could be an appropriate one for the club, except it's a series.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, this particular book, so this is a book called A Memory Called Empire.  And y'all, I really enjoyed this.  There it's book one of, I don't know how many, there's only two books out.  Yeah, but it's probably not done.  This is probably hardcore science fiction.  Looks good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hugo Award winner, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a really good world building.  It's basically, it's mostly political intrigue and drama.  I feel like if you liked the expanse, you would like this.  The science fiction part of it is less like it's not, there are some space opera aspects,  but that's downplayed a lot by the politics of it.  So, and there is a chunk about like, one of the cultures involved is really all about  like epic poetry.  So there's some weird digressions about epic poetry, but you could just ignore that.  Or you can read it and enjoy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tell me how you liked my poems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's, yeah, it's a weird, it's kind of a little weird, but it fits with the world  and it doesn't really bother you.  Are you reading it as a book or listening as an audiobook?  So I listened to the first one as an audiobook and it was good.  And then I read the second one.  Which would you recommend?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which did you like better?  I like reading.  Yeah, I want to do more Kindle books because I want to do more annotation and notation.  It's easier.  It's hard with an audiobook to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I read so much.  I mean, like I read this book in like eight hours and an audiobook was like, I mean,  the audiobook was 18 hours.  Right.  Even if you speed that up, it's still a commitment.  So I mean, it's your call.  The audiobook is nice.  The reader, reader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I can play a little bit so you can hear her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's going between a handy sun and its nearest useful planet.  The largest of a string of mining stations that make up this small region of space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does sound like the expanse.  Wow. Mining stations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's very different than the expanse.  So it's not, you know, but yes, but I really enjoyed it.  So I'm going to recommend that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm just trying to decide if it should be audio or Kindle.  I think I'm going to do the Kindle.  It's nice to have something on my Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I will say the names as in all science fiction, maybe not all, but many science fiction books.  I appreciated the audio simply because I was like, yeah, how do you pronounce this series?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is not what I thought that was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They call it Texcalon.  Texcalon.  They say Texcalon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  T-E-I-X-C-A-L-A-A-N.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sometimes though in sci-fi with the audiobooks, when they drop you right in, you're like,  what's going on?  Because there's so many made up words and things and you're like, oh, I got to orient.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway.  Yeah. I know what you mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's, you know, both of these books, I enjoyed tremendously.  Just bought it.  They stand alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love sci-fi and it sounds like something I'd really enjoy.  So thank you.  A Memory Called Empire by Arkady Martine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's a Byzantine.  She's a professor of like Byzantine history.  Oh, even better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love that about her.  It is the first of two.  The second is A Desolation Called Peace.  So I like where we're going with this.  She's a speculative fiction writer and as Dr.  Anna Lyndon Weller, a historian of the Byzantine Empire and city planner.  Oh, this isn't her real name.  Under both names, she writes about border politics, rhetoric, propaganda,  and the edges of the world.  She grew up in New York City.  Turkey, Canada, Sweden.  She lives in Baltimore with her wife, Vivian Shaw.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, hey.  Yeah. And for Pride Month, if this is important, this is a writer who is prideful.  L-G-B-T-Q-I-A.  She's full of pride.  And the characters are two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So just in case you're worried.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I think it's important to read more diverse authors.  So if that's like an agenda level of yours, this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't wait.  I like her pseudonym, Arkady Martine.  That's good.  Mr. Jeff Jarvis, your number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I'm going to do a quick number then we'll do one other real quick thing.  So New York Times story said that the rural urban broadband divide isn't what you think of it.  Wow.  86% of urban.  Hey, that's kind of higher than I thought.  But what it also says in raw numbers, 4.6 million rural households are not connected,  but 13.6 urban households are not connected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's really about a poverty gap, not a geographic difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  I think in that case, and it's fixable.  It must be fixed after the pandemic.  How can we not have everyone connected?  I want to mention just one other thing because and often to his great credit talks about  brings up issues of mental health on the show after the Naomi Osaka pulling out of the French  Open and the media result that New York Times and the Telegraph go after her.  But I think smart media like the Guardian realized that media have a role here.  So a friend of mine online, I've never met him in person, but I've known him for years online,  Thomas Bechdal.  His Twitter is BAEKDAL.  He's a Danish media expert.  A really generous thread.  It's the same word I would use for Ant when he talks about these things.  I think there's a generosity and sharing where he explains what it's like to have  this kind of debilitating social anxiety.  And I don't think we should call it a mental illness.  I don't think we should call it a matter necessarily of mental health.  We should recognize that people are different.  And for some people, some people aren't like us coming out here talking to the whole world  every day and having fun and doing that.  And that's not nor that you know, to call this normal and to call that abnormal,  to call Naomi Osaka abnormal is wrong here.  And she's trying to teach a lesson to a personal, a considerable personal sacrifice.  So Thomas talks here about going through where he was told you've got to be an extrovert.  He forced himself to be an extrovert and it nearly tears him apart bodily.  And when he has to give a presentation, he puts up a video presentation says,  you know, I look normal.  Don't you think?  But he puts up his heart rate is going at 151 during that.  You know, it's made him collapse.  Sometimes it has real effect on him.  And I thought it was a really generous thread to explain.  I've got members of my family who have social anxiety, who aren't like me,  who's out here all the time.  And I think it's important to recognize that people are different  and they have different expectations of what they do and why they do it.  And to force Naomi Osaka, who is brilliant and talented,  to say that you must do this or else you're abnormal is she's not the one who's wrong.  Everybody who says that is wrong.  So thank you for that little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you know what?  There is a kind of through line.  We need to celebrate our differences.  Exactly.  That's what makes the world interesting.  You wouldn't want the world to be filled with people like you.  Well, maybe some people would, but not me.  Like me.  That's different.  If they were all like Jeff Jarvis.  Yeah, no, you don't want that.  No, we want the differences.  That would be exhausting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff, I love you, but man, by the end of the show, I'm like, oh God,  I've got to be on my toes at Betty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Pruitt, what do you got for us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have two series.  First one is called High on the Hog.  I got a glimpse of it on during my vacation time.  And it really just it, it opened my eyes, but it also sort of pissed me off  because this is a series by Netflix and it's dealing with the American cuisine  and how a lot of it is started based on African cuisine and why things are so popular today  and going beyond saying that Southern food is just fried chicken and collard greens.  There's other things out there, but it dove into in one episode, George Washington's  chef named Hercules.  Never heard of the guy.  Why hadn't I heard of this?  But supposedly he was just an amazing chef, world renowned, everybody loved them,  but yet he was still just another black slave in the country here and just doing what he needed to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Another slave who invented macaroni and cheese, I got to point out.  Where is the statue?  The single greatest food of all time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, and speaking of macaroni and cheese, it's funny you bring it up because I watched  that episode Sunday, but Saturday afternoon I was on Twitter and our friend Matteo Donny,  Matteo is over in Scotland.  He sent me a picture of macaroni pie and I saw it and I said, you know, that's all I've ever known  it as in my life was macaroni pie.  Later on it came out as mac and cheese and when this show came on Sunday,  they talked about it being macaroni pie.  That's what he called it.  It wasn't called mac and cheese because it was in a casserole dish and sometimes had a crust.  This is what my mom made.  Macaroni pie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, she didn't call it macaroni pie, but that's exactly what she made and it has that  delicious crust because of it.  It's so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When I make macaroni, that's what I make here.  But it was just little stuff like that that I wish I had known back when I was in school,  but nobody ever taught it.  You know, nobody ever brought this stuff up.  But I appreciate Netflix doing this.  And then the other series is Halston.  Shout out to the month of June.  I loved Halston.  LGBTQ+.  Oh my God.  Halston, that was a great series.  I've always been interested in designers, whether it's fashion or artists.  I love the relationship that he had with Elsa Peretti.  I love Elsa Peretti and her jewelry and what she did with Tiffany.  But if you watch that show, it is really well done.  You are a man of many, many talents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had never heard of Elsa Peretti until I watched this.  Then I became very interested in her.  Oh, she designed you.  I have an Elsa Peretti necklace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was like, that's why I married my husband because he gave me one.  I get them from my wife.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All of the curves, most jewelry was sort of edgy and sort of blocked off.  She focused a lot on nature and how things in nature are curvy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She created the famous Halston perfume bottle.  That's a great moment in the show.  I had Halston Z14 as a high schooler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.  Did you slather it all over?  Yeah, it didn't matter.  The girls still didn't like me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I'm wearing Z14.  Halston Z14.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Those are my two picks.  But I definitely have to shout out the champ here in the household once again.  Last week was just super proud for me and the family with our senior graduate in high school.  My mom flew over to the graduation and was able to see her grandson graduate.  And then the track meet the next day was that boy right there in the red.  Oh, look at him go.  Oh, is he fast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look at him go.  Yeah, baby.  Wow.  Listen to Aunt in the background, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  100 meter dash.  He had a PR of 11.1.  He had an unofficial PR of 10.9, but his unofficial.  But the 11.1 was, I'm quite proud of him.  But he also won the 200 meters, which is the next link, and got a PR in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Aunt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're shouting get him, but who is it exactly you're getting in an event like that?  Hey, you.  All of the opposition, baby.  Get him.  Eat him up.  And this is the 200 meter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and he got stuck in a bad lane.  He got stuck in lane eight, which is the worst.  The outside lane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We got to get you some new slogans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want Aunt shouting that for me when I'm working.  I'm like, get him.  I'm going to pretend like, OK, Stacey, you got this.  You can do it.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Given 200 meters, he's just leading the pack.  He's just going up, way down.  Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And he also won the.  I love the proud Jad in the background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just love it.  That's really great.  He really took off, man.  That's awesome.  He also won the long jump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He had a personal best of 20 feet, eight inches.  Oh, look at that.  Look at that.  Another parent was there to take photos and got this photo.  I wanted to share it, but I didn't want to say his name.  And he also took pictures of the 100 meter dash.  They're really, really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
