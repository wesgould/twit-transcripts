Hello, Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What you're hearing right now is my mind my screen  Why what's the matter?  So the hotel Wi-Fi was beyond belief that you know, you know, I have been the pioneer of bad Wi-Fi  Yeah, you're the king Wi-Fi I've ever seen. I am the king of bad Wi-Fi. So then  You were speaking tomorrow. So I'll use that this at all. I'm going to try  So then I tried Starbucks. No, so then I tried  my five  That didn't work. So then I bought a my five which in two languages is majorly challenging  I worked okay in the store. I get back to the hotel. It wouldn't even hit one  Oh, it wouldn't hit a quarter of one. Oh, yeah, so then I just went through four hours for turning it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sorry. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Still don't have my money back but this this real report. This is what I do. I like to wait. I appreciate it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thank you very much  So you're joining us via your Google Fi cell phone right now  And when you get back to the hotel in a few minutes, we'll we'll get you on the hotel landline

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so I'm delighted to be here even if I have a primal scream going on

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, my daughter is in Mexico for this semester as well. She'll be there through the end of the year  She's in Puebla, which is a smaller city in Mexico City, but similar issues. It's very crazy  Because it was a monopoly system, right?  When you when you change from a government run  Monopoly to a to a kind of half and half or color of slim  It really is the same thing in Australia that's Stacy Higginbotham who knows all tells all from the IOT podcast and  Parts south she's in Austin. Hey Stacy. Hello. Nice to have you. Yeah, I think the same thing happened in Australia  Where they have it they have now it's it was government run and now it's like half and half

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a we Telstra's kind of yeah when I was in Australia. I also bought a my5 there so I could come the show. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stop stop buying my5. Yeah, really don't you ever go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This issue is they have one they they used to have one  Cable coming in for data for the right for that old. Is it Eastern seaboard Western seaboard?  I can't I guess it's Western seaboard is the big population area where Sydney and everything. Oh, okay Eastern side  and so  Telstra had access and controlled that basically so  Rod band was crazy. You thought our caps were bad. I was Jay's were way worse. They have gotten better

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think also joining us Aaron Newcomb great to see you Aaron. Hey Leo glad to be here as always

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We don't usually get to see your your lab. I like it. I know well, yeah, actually all you can see is my wife's half  That's her desk or messy desk all her books. She was a philosophy major. So there's tons of books back there  On my side, there's like, you know stuff all around here is a raspberry pies arrow  Here's that actually here  Interestingly enough if I can get to it as an original the original raspberry pie and all kinds of other stuff and  Just as a in as way of a teaser  I brought a project as always so if you want to know what this is and what it does you got to  Stick around till the end of the show America keypad attached to something

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, did you get your nine dollar computer yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, you know what I left them down at the makerspace last night I got two of them I got the  HDMI  Add on that you can just pop on that was kind of an adventure getting that working  But so far I'm very very impressed. Maybe next time I'm on I'll do a little a lot that'll make that my project  because  It's it's at least I was telling people last night at our meetup  It's similar to in performance the raspberry the first generation raspberry pi 1 which is actually saying a lot  It performs really well got the GUI running. I got a browser running with ice weasel  It worked really really well  So I would encourage people and it has built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth for nine bucks it is the chip computer

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This was so exciting. It is okay. Yeah, we had them on the new screensavers when they were doing the Kickstarter  They raised two million dollars, and they've just started shipping

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's I think that's one of the most innovative things coming out well

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know  Why nine dollars versus thirty five dollars for the raspberry pie that doesn't seem like a big difference

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is if you're a school district or if you're poor you're buying a hundred of them. I guess yeah  I mean even and the idea so when I talk to the next thing guys and Aaron if you know this I will shut up  But when I talk to the guys who are making it they were like look you know for nine bucks  That's something a kid might have in their allowance  And if they're interested in this they can just go out and get it and it's good point  Less for them, so this isn't this isn't for necessarily us. It's for people right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Dollars is a lot. I ordered it. I pledged 74 bucks for the pocket chip plus HDMI adapter  And then I got a regular chip  So I don't it's I haven't gotten mine yet, so I'll have to look at  See maybe that maybe they need my address or something. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's actually that was my mistake as well  I didn't see the email that they said yeah  Make sure you keep this website and verify your address once I did that I got it like in a week  So I must have hit it at just the right time. I don't know why

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That happens a lot with Kickstarter like they have everything  Yeah, they had to I signed up a kid. I mean they I guess kickstarter doesn't give them the information kickstarter knows or something  Maybe I'm very mobile like that. Yeah, it's kind of strange since I gave them money  Well, I have money but yeah, I'll have to search through my email cuz a lot I think everybody's gotten their chip  And I haven't so but it but it's a cool idea. So you're right  I mean, that's that's a third as much

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Less than a third almost a great thing about it is it's it's completely open source open hardware  You can go download all the stuff  All the processor  It's a it's an all-winner a8

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is that it's an arm arm processor arm processor and it runs, you know full stack debian  So just like the raspberry pi does so if you're familiar with debian or familiar already familiar with the raspberry pi  Most things will work. You'll need different libraries to control  GPIO and those kind of things because they're dependent on the chip set  But otherwise if you know debian if you know how to use Linux on the raspberry pi you should be able to do things like update  Software and use the gooey and use the terminal emulator and all that kind of good stuff cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it has a has a full x gooey and everything. That's really cool. That's amazing for nine dollars  It is it is it's also good for project makers because if you want to make a you know  I was at the Harry Potter ride in  Universal Studios last week and  You know they have on the wall they have the Harry Potter style talking paintings  You know paintings in Harry Potter don't just sit there the people move around they wink at you  And I always had this dream  In fact, maybe we'll do this in the new studio of having all our hosts on the wall in what looks like still pictures  But every once in a while they go  Yeah  Or wander off and come back and of course the way to do that  It wouldn't be that hard to do with a screen and a simple computer in that case  And this and a simple computer in the background this this would be all you need really  Yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If the if you could get an old style monitor or something that had a composite input, I mean this comes with a composite  Breakout on it. So it's got one of the combined audio and  Composite and video composite jacks on it  So it comes with the plug you plug it in and you get your video left and right channels  So if you can find an old monitor mount that in a picture frame on the wall really all you would need is this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  $9 computer they did a really interesting thing in the one and I'm sure that's exactly how they do it at the Harry Potter ride  But they've kind of crack alert on top of it. So it looks like  It was it's an old aging oil painting. They must have just you know painted a  Varnish on top of the screen. So doesn't look like a screen  It looks like you're looking at an oil painting and it's even more dramatic as a result when the thing suddenly moves  It's like whoa  Whoa, I could have sworn that was an oil painting. Maybe you could help me with that era and we could be a fun project  We could do that. I don't know how or the most savers. Yeah, you bet  Jeff you still there. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just got to the hotel room. So I aren't if you want I mean  Carson if you want to call me we'll check picture boy. All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We'll hang up on the cell phone as we walked  Okay, okay, it was fun we got a little walking tour of Mexico City, how's the air  Is it really hot though

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no decent good

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good good. Good. All right

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Got a little distracted but we can move on there's been a lot of speculation when they talked about it yesterday and all about Android about  What's gonna happen to the Nexus phones? There's you know, it's all rumor at this point  But the the impression some people are getting and this comes from an article in the Telegraph of the UK  Is that Google is gonna stop doing?  What these Nexus phones are which is essentially dev developer editions and start doing  premium  smartphones to compete with Apple and Samsung  Credible what do you think Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  um, I  Have been I actually have a Nexus phone I  Would love for Google to actually do this and now that they have Rick over there Rick  Costa Loaf from the Motorola. Yeah. Yeah, I mean I see no reason why not in I  Mean, yeah, I would say what the heck  I don't think they would actually they would have to contract manufacture it out

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's what they do right right now right Aaron is these they're not making the 6p or the 5x  No, yeah, they

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go ahead makes this be  No, I was gonna say while wait while way makes a 6p

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll answer my own question and you guys fight it out  Well, I mix a 6p and LG makes a 5x and in the past they've used HTC HTC made the first Google Android phone  The one with the slide-out keyboard the g1. I think it was called and they've used all the manufacturers  You know under the Sun  So is the telegraph story that they're gonna build it themselves why would they even bother who cares  Even Apple really doesn't build the iPhone Foxconn does

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and they may do this  They may take the same approach where the components get you know shipped in from various places and they put it together somewhere  I think it's really is to  Solidify a phone that actually works instead of having because I  Probably going back and forth between Huawei and LG and can you please include this feature?  We want to do X Y & Z and they're like, yeah, we don't want to do that  It's too expensive or whatever. So there are always these negotiations back and forth from the manufacturers  I think they just want  Jump that whole process and say look  We're just gonna do it ourselves and put out a phone that we know has all the features we want and works the way we want  to work and  they probably are looking to compete more with Apple not only that but  You know, then they actually start making some revenue as well as opposed to the majority of it going back to the manufacturers

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  there's the whole I was just gonna add to that with Samsung being the  biggest seller of Android phones  Samsung's actually been disabling and tweaking Android to a certain point. It's kind of really frustrating for users  So I can see Google being like, all right  Got to take this bull by the horns and own it I've been using

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For about five or six days. I got it on Friday. I think the new one plus  three  Which is an interesting I think a really interesting phone it is in every respect  Equal to the iPhone of the Samsung Galaxy s7. I think very at least very close respect. It's four hundred dollars and  It's pretty pure Google experience  They're using their own oxygen OS, but that is as pure as you can get  I mean it is it's similar to the moto X that kind of you know, a few extensions a few differences  But it feels like marshmallow the the big question though  And I think for $400 this is there's no it's a no-brainer. This is don't buy the Galaxy s7  Buy this but the big question  In my mind is updates and I think a lot of people are asking is updates and one of the things that you could  Guarantee with a Nexus phone and I presume with us with a high-end Google phone is that you're gonna be using the latest OS  And they'll and always get the latest security patches. In fact, that's one of the reasons probably Google would like to do this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I having owned high-end Android phones my entire smartphone career for the most part  I'm on Verizon and Verizon is always so late on updates. I actually that's why I switched to a  Nexus is because I was like, ah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it makes sense this this only I only went off Nexus one time. I had I've been since the g1  I've been using only but they weren't called Nexus back then but Nexus phones  I got a Samsung Galaxy s4 at some point and the updates were so slow  I used the stock, you know OS for a couple of weeks before I rooted it because it was just awful  Having to wait for for in this case AT&T to put that put out an update

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Of course the one one thing about this one plus three is it's it's easy to unlock  I think it may even be unlocked bootloader and it's so it's if you could put any rom on it you wanted to so  You know in some ways you have more more flexibility certainly a lot more than Samsung

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gives you well, did you see the the news? There are discounts on was it?  Nexus phones Amazon's doing discounts on certain Android phones. Yeah, the Amazon front page is interesting. Let's go

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm just thinking about what this means for like the hardware model versus  I don't know everything else and who owns the phone and does it matter anymore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is the blue which is a kind of little known in the US but a well known  Internationally they make Windows phones as well the blue are one  For  Well, what's interesting is?  What they're doing for prime members is they're giving you a version with offers and ads built in kind of like the Kindle  And and that one's less expensive and if you get the version without ads worth with ads, it's a  Like 50 bucks without ads. It's a hundred bucks 50 bucks  And then they're also selling a Moto G. I don't know if the Moto G  By the way, you have to be an Amazon Prime  Customer to get this so this is one way, you know what? I'm not logged in so it doesn't know I'm prime  But this is one way  Amazon is  Spiffing prime users and getting them. Yeah 150 bucks for the Moto G. That's not such an incredible price  Neither of these phones is a high-end phone. However

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I just think I thought it was interesting that Amazon was putting their ads on somebody else's device

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Isn't that weird? They must have it do you think they must have a deal? They have to have a deal

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's what I'm thinking about like, okay. So what does it mean to own a mobile phone ecosystem?  Like going forward if someone else can put ads on it think about how it interplays with like the smart home  I'm just I'm just kind of thinking about  Kind of everything especially as more and more things get unlocked. Sorry. My brain is just kind of going all over the place today

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is interesting  229 without the offers and ads for the 32 gig version  179 you say 50 bucks and if you if you can survive with 16 gigs  Which I don't recommend for most people as low as 150 bucks. That's for the Moto G, which is a quite a good phone  Not I would say if you can afford to spend a little more get a bit little bit better phone than this  But if you can't maybe for a kid or somebody doesn't have a lot of money 50 bucks  For the 8 gigabyte blue Wow  Can't imagine it runs very well. It's got a media tech 1.3 gigahertz quad core processor  But it is I think tell it's more interesting as a story about Amazon and what Amazon's up to than it is about the deal itself

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Sorry. Yes, that is true. Go ahead that Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you think your bigger strategy is I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't know Stacy you got an idea. What is this? Okay, let me think ads on devices selling other hardware. I'm just thinking about  Yeah, I have no idea well

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll wade into the waters here  After all for years, we bought subsidized phones from carriers  And so we thought our phones were only 200 bucks and then we found out when carriers stopped the subsidies  What the phone actually cost and I think that that has put some downward pressure on phone prices on everybody but Apple and  It's it's changed how people think of the phone. So this is in a way Amazon's subsidy, right?  Obviously, they have to negotiate this with Motorola and blue  But that the subsidy is will take 50  We'll take 50 bucks off if you don't mind lock screens and they have done this with as I said with the Kindle and the Kindle  Fire tablets  I have both Kindle's and Kindle fire tablets with offers never bothers me on the Kindle because mostly on the Kindle you don't ever see  The lock screen except the first time you turn it on  Not while I'm reading a book though only when I'm browsing the library, that's true now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I get I have the Kindle app on my phone and I get Kindle notification Kindle ad  Notifications or Amazon ad notifications. See I think that's annoying. I think it's super annoying  Yeah, but you can't turn that off. I mean you're not yes  Yes, I have turned it off. Yeah  Well, this is this is this gives you the permission to send notifications

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it could be a similar. It's just doing that no because it's the lock screen. Although wait a minute though  Let me think about this  If I'm listening to a Spotify song on my Android device, the lock screen is the album art  So it may be a maybe they don't need the manufacturer to do this  Maybe this is just a mechanism where they they as an app they just put an app on here and it takes over the lock  Screen because it's always playing in the background. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Who's gonna buy a $50 phone and see not me I I would buy a $50 phone because I bet there's a way to  Load your own OS onto the right easily and bypass all of that, right?  Right, because the hardware should be independent unless they've built something into the firmware that says, you know  Do a check and if it's not working turn off the radio or something like that  Is this a possible but it's hard to do it's it's really interesting because it's I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Almost feel like this is Amazon throwing something against the wall and seeing if it sticks because it doesn't make sense  If if you're a prime member, you're paying a hundred dollars extra a year for the privilege of second-day delivery  you're I think by definition an  affluent customer  So why you would be interested in a $50 phone as a prime benefit

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Seems puzzling to me if you have kids. I mean I would look at something like this for my nine-year-old

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they don't care about the ads  Wouldn't even be legal to show them ads actually  You might have to certify that you're over 13  Wouldn't that be weird  So getting back to the original premise  If Google were to make it were to compete with Samsung and Apple with us a Google branded  Couldn't be Nexus. I guess it'd be a Google branded made by Google phone  You know, here's the real problem we're at we're we've been at peak phone for a year  There's nothing new that you could put that's why one plus can sell a $400 state-of-the-art phone  There's nothing, you know, he's got a fast fingerprint reader. It's got a good camera. What else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, so this is this gets into like the phone is going is the phone because I'm having this discussion with people I talk  to in the Internet of Things space  Half the world believes that the phone is the key to like owning the phone is the key to controlling the next  ecosystem in tech which is everything in  machine learning right  The other half are like yeah, you can control other platforms and still access it so  You look at us being a peak phone  does it does it matter that you control the hardware does it matter if you can control the OS or  Well, what or rather that you sell them and you get their email address?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know like what what what everybody's got to figure out is what's gonna get people to buy a new phone  Besides they broke the old one

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah  People will buy a new phone every eventually

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Samsung gambit is to put up special things with it so at VidCon I actually bought the Samsung 360 camera  There's the Samsung gear  I've made fun of that strategy in the past  Well, I don't know maybe maybe it's the right way to go is that it's not the phone  It's what you can get with the phone because it's well integrated. Well, it's certainly Apple's strategy apples

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  WWDC they basically said everything works better as long as you have an iPhone and an Apple watch  Then then everything's tightly integrated and by the way  I should point out that the one thing you wouldn't want to do with this 1.3 is VR because it's a 1080 screen  So you will have to buy a 1440 screen from Samsung or one of the high-end if you want to do the gear VR  So that's I think you're right Jeff. I think that's one way to make sure people don't buy these lower-cost phones  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can't see you guys  The integration of the Samsung 360 camera  This the phone is pretty damned awesome  It's stitching on the phone as you're shooting you can see what you're shooting in live 360  You know, could you do that on the other phone with the software well  I maybe you could but it but it but and is that a huge market? No, but the integration is really impressive

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Get ready because there's a guy in  Florida who's suing Apple for ten billion dollars  He says oh no, I invented the iPhone in 1992. He's got a drawing  He's got a patent  And he says Apple stole my idea  From 1992 he was according to the lawsuit the first to file a device so designed and aggregated is to have a creative a  Novel combination of media communication tools as identity was then since then hijacked by Apple's iPhones iPads and others  Wasn't there a palm pilot around about that time or other products the pilot was much later

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean anybody could draw a picture. He never made a phone. Yeah  Did he get a patent I guess he did he wants that Eastern District  Well, he's in Florida right now, but he absolutely should move that lawsuit over to the Eastern Eastern District of Texas  I hear Tyler Texas is great this time of year

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At  EFF I didn't know this there is a Mark Cuban chair of getting rid of stupid patents

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, Mark's been very aggressive  Yeah, by the way, the Telegraph has actually has a great little bit at the bottom here  Where they show Apple's revenue since you start reading this article

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's almost a million dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a counter so I guess they could afford ten billion dollars  Isn't that funny since you started reading this article and I've been on it what for a minute or two apples made almost a million dollars  So it'll cross a million in a few seconds  Ross's patent was never approved because he didn't pay the fees and the application was declared abandoned in 95  But he still claims Apple resorted to dumpster diving  Oh, come on, this will be thrown out so fast. I just want to see your head spin  It'll spin faster than those numbers on the screen  Yeah, typical  Yeah, yeah  nuts  It's like the woman. All right. What do you think who sued Microsoft for?  $10,000 she's a travel agent just down the road here in Sausalito who says it's Microsoft forced Windows 10 on her computer  And then when she tried to revert to Windows 8 it wouldn't work for days. She lost a lot of business. She sued Microsoft one  Microsoft decided not to appeal they were gonna appeal initially decided not to appeal and paid her ten thousand dollars  for the forced upgrade to Windows 10  Unbelievable  Let's see  What are you there for Jeff? Why are you in Mexico City?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I'm here for the tag CDM X conference  which is an effort to kind of think rebrand Mexico City and bringing some cool people who are around me and  So I'm speaking about you know the end of the mass tomorrow  Last week I was in VidCon, which was

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  VidCon was great  You know, I just I've just made 25,000 people now  Unfortunately, sadly because of the two tragedies in Orlando. The security was much higher.

I mean that video that video you just saw has 19 million views  uh  He's huge 32 million for the one that I was talking about where uh dad  shreds the xbox games with a uh, a riding mower and the fun of it, of course  Is uh is is the kid's reaction. He's a good actor because I I wasn't sure this was fake either at the time  Yeah  Um, but now of course we know this is a  So he was at vidcon too. So it's that it's that stuff jeff. Oh here. Here we go

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's that more. I mean, you know, there were a side which was a whole amazing panel for you about mental health for example  Where you had the youtube stars talking about how my latest post on medium is about this  They had them talking about  Um their depression their e disorders their suicide, you know, whatever and in the room are people who feel the same thing  And it's just a room filled with empathy two-way empathy that that you just don't see in big old media  That you can you can meet these people and talk to these people  um, and and it's something different now  Now  It's still it's a big business susan wajiski from youtube the ceo gave uh a c note and  They're giving you know, they're still they're putting big money in people's pockets. Uh, Fuji cmo from facebook was there  Uh facebook announced that they were uh gonna add a live  Formal box to people's home pages soon, which will be a big deal  Uh youtube announced that they're gonna add a live  Of uh  Button sharing button to all youtube players soon  Live is going to be bigger than ever. So it was um

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I was is there any is there any I guess not at vidcon because it's really a fan  What am I hearing?  What where am I hearing that from uh karsten it's not i'm hearing this the audio stream back  There you go. Um  Was there is there anybody at vidcon who stands up and says you guys are crazy  This is youtube ripping you off. You're working in youtube's minds  and  Well, is there any dissent at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh a little yes, uh, I went to a session on on uh, but it's reasonable dissent  I went to a session on fair use or as professor larry lesick says fair use is the right to hire a lawyer  and  Uh, so they were sharing  Techniques about how to avoid problems they were lamenting when they've gotten strikes and they've had huge problems  They wished for more contact from youtube, but they were more reasonable about it than hollywood and and their discussions  But I thought I was going to stand up and say, you know  You guys should have kind of a a union or something to get together together  So you can have some strength and damned if at the final keynote for the creators hank green the founder  With his brother  Uh one of the vlog brothers  Uh the founder of vidcon stood up and announced the creation of an internet creators guild  Which is an internet creators dot  Org, I think we're calm  Where they they can stand together more they can use it to lobby they can use the lobby government. They can use it to lobby  uh the platforms  uh, and and you know on one hand yaleo  YouTube's getting a big chunk of the money by the other hand without youtube mostly people would have no mechanism to get any money. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I I uh  It's just me  But I really feel like it's a it's a it's a it's a fool's game to put your stuff on youtube  I guess, you know people made a lot of money  Um, but I just feel like youtube's making a hell of a lot more  And in most cases with the exception of the mcjuggernuggets and the pewdiepies of the world  Uh, most people are working their butts off  For below minimum effectively below minimum wage like 99.9. Well, but that's true

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo that's true. That's ever been true of authors and artists

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  right  Any glamour business profession can do that  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that doesn't excuse it does it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I'd accept it. What's the market?  Uh, if your video gets a thousand views then you get paid commensurately and that's that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, but you you don't get paid commensurately. That's kind of my point. Well, but here's another way to look at it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's well, but here's another way to look at it, uh, which is that um  There's uh, sorry if my sister  um  probably the phone, um  Most of those people would never have gotten a video to the public or or or you know in the days of the public  See this I think you're gonna go through a big gauntlet. I understand and so for

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just by the way the same as it's always as it's ever been for the handful the top 100 youtubers  success glory fame and money  But that really belies them literally the tens of millions of other youtubers  Who are really killing themselves trying to achieve that and I I think that youtube uses them

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um  I would say that that that  No, i'm still gonna argue that youtube gives me the opportunity to reach a public and maybe have that shot which hollywood never ever ever  gave them

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you agree stacy. That's always been true. Yeah, I think it's true of any sort of creative  Endeavor, um, I agree that like actors are probably a bit more protected. Um  But I also think about journalism which  Not as glamorous but still you know there I worked as a unpaid intern  At magazines while I tried to like that's the old days though. So look, okay. Here's an example

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'd same thing when I was in radio worked my way up got crap jobs  I never got below minimum wage because that would be illegal but I got had crap jobs  But I you know, I worked there as a union blah blah blah  Uh, and I worked my way up nowadays if somebody wants to become good at it  They can make a podcast the mistake what i'm saying is the mistake is to say oh i'm going to put it all in youtube  And let them sell the ads and share the revenue because they'll screw you  I mean you or you could or you could do it yourself

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  so I agree with both of you the problem is like jeff was saying that  It's hard for people to do all that stuff  Especially when they're first starting out and so they go to youtube because it's an easy way for them to get started  Um, but I but I agree with you leo in that the better way to do it is to do your own stuff and use all the various  distribution methodologies that you can like you're doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We post on youtube, but we don't expect to make any money from youtube

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Youtube for these kids is probably like the digital equivalent of like moving to la if you want to be an actor, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you have to get your stuff on youtube to get discovered, you know, I understand that but I thought we had a better way  These days than having to do that the old  sweatshop way

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, leo, okay. All right  I don't know if it's gonna be everybody but for big publishers  You know twix is a sweatshop, but we love to be in here. This is not a sweatshop. Wait a minute. No, it's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now admittedly no, I mean look i'm a capitalist. I don't pay you  Uh a full share of what we make on the show. I pay you and I hope it's enough  But I don't pay you a full share

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You better this but you know the truth is you know, close your ears  You wouldn't have to pay me a penny and i'd beg to be on twig. That's absolutely true

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I wouldn't do that though. So so there's an example  So if I were youtube i'd go yeah, come on and we could do that jeff  And I but I but I don't I feel like you should be paid for your time

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, but here's a change the change you want is coming at least at the high level where it always starts  The new youtube player will be white labeled so the publishers can use it as their player  And sell their own ads on it and backfill as they wish that'll never happen  That'll never happen google will not let that happen. Leo  No, leo, it's happening. It's been it's been promised to the publishers. It's happening imminently  Only the big publishers in europe. Yeah, the big publishers that's where it'll start. That's where it starts  Yeah, it's where it always starts facebook youtube google. It always starts the big guys and little guys get pissed  But uh, no the precedent is going to be there

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and maybe because there's competition facebook we know, uh is paying at least 50 million dollars  To celebrities and media companies to to kind of prime the pump of live video  They want to get in this game as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll wager you though leo that 90 percent of those people who are paid by you. They're all their celebrities  We would get a lot less would get a lot less if they tried to sell ads on their own

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no, but it's kevin hart it's gordon ramsay it's buzzfeed it's cnn

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it's not it's not i'm even talking about the the youtube little guys  If I couldn't sell my own ads, which is what you're saying they should do  You know the structure you need to sell ads. It's huge. It's expensive

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's tough. I mean we're selling ads now and we're i'm  i'm sort of legit in what I do and it's still like  a pain in the butt  And if you're like a 14 year old youtube star  that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not going to happen. I just I guess I always have this argument. I just I would guess I would just say  Consider youtube an amazing deal if you what you think is you're getting free bandwidth and exposure to a large audience  but but but don't consider it to be a path to making a living because it  It really isn't for gonna be and it and they're taking advantage of you. I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's also if you think your living is going to be on ads, but what about endorsements or getting fancy cars?  That's what you have to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what you have to do right if you're going to make money on youtube. It's not really from youtube. You make your money  It's selling  You know cosmetics and other things. I think that's what a lot of these people

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry, sorry, stacey you go you go. Oh no, I was gonna say I think that's actually what they're striving for  They're not looking for ads. So, okay. All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, well, let me say see i'll take the next step what I see happening all over these so-called  influencers  Which the fpc is you know cracking down on but I see this all over where  They they are sell they are indeed selling ads under the noses of facebook and youtube and twitter and snapchat  Because they're selling their influence on products, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, so this all really the reason I ask this question is is i'm just curious if anything like this conversation happens at vidcon

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it social?  Yes to a to a civilized extent it does there listen  Motives for a lot of people being there are to find friends and to be famous and social make money. Yeah  That's fine. That's a good measure of it and those who then do have  the ambition  They get they get um, some of them big enough to go off on their own some of them wish that they had more  Contact but susan wajiski announced that they're going to have a huge increase in the customer service for youtube  Because they realize that's a complaint  You know, they're they're doing some things. Yeah, we're going to talk about facebook shortly, too  You know, you have to be aware that these platforms live first and foremost to serve their users  in their definition and  You know, i'm arguing that we should work in partnership with them, but we can't fully count on them either

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah  Well, we've said that for years, uh, and it's we've said for years if you're a brand if you're  Uh, uh the financial times you shouldn't be putting your content on the facebook platform because you don't own it  And yet everybody's doing it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and I think you have to because you have to put away your public hairs because they're stuck. Yeah  And the days of the destination well, here's when I was in europe  I got this I this conversation I had where you go from an era of the destination which is  I own it come to me and I own you to distribution which is okay. I'll go chasing you on facebook  The next thing that happens I think is more product era where you create products that are  Specially beneficial to people and they come to it because it's useful to them  And and it's worthwhile but not because you just make content and force people to come to you and market  But instead they feel like there's something there community  utility  uh  Friendship social whatever it is that makes them come to that product you've made for that community  That's where we have to have stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You think you you said this is because they don't have a plan this is just  They're falling into it because they don't know anything else to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I  Falling maybe a little overstating. I think they're like they see these successes on youtube  and they want to do that and so they  That's where they go to do it and they model themselves after their idols

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But also no, no i'm talking about big publishers though. I mean there I mean you you come from that industry  You know, you know these these guys I look at what jeff it's a good article about jeff bezos  As a patron of journalism at the washington post  Clearly he understands what a digital first strategy looks like and it seems like  The washington post is  And his his staff is getting it and and buying into it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think there's a lot of dead of all you based business  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and they're still it's very hard to give up  To give up the cachet that comes with being like this amazing  Print publication. I mean you still get I mean when I was at fortune  People still were like will this be in print? I'm like, why would you care?  I it just they didn't even send me the print version of the magazine. So like  I just I don't know. This is this has been crazy and most of them don't  They they don't have a plan for digital because they don't understand it and half their employees are  You know union and old school and stuck in the older era and the other half are like  What are you guys doing?  And it's very different writing for one side or the other

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a great article from yesterday in new york magazine about the washington post and they  They tell a story that when ben bradley the legendary editor  at the washington post the guy who was memorialized in  the  watergate  story  When bad bradley passed jeff bezos wasn't going to go to the funeral  I think it was marty barron or somebody called him and said jeff. You don't understand. You have to go to the funeral  This this newspaper you bought  This is ben bradley's paper. You have to go and jeff said i'm on my way  Uh, he understood i think we called yeah, yeah this he understood the symbolism of of of attending and you know marty barron  Speaking of people made famous by a movie, of course, uh the guy, uh featured in spotlight  Um seems to really embrace what jeff is doing. They've they've built a new kind of high-tech newsroom  Uh moved him out. They apparently were over the printing presses as many newspapers are  And they moved him out and put him down the street  And it sounds like they've got money to spend. I don't know  Do you do you know what's going on at the washington post jeff? Do you talk to people over there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they're a little bezos secretive  But but yes, they they have gone all in on on facebook  I talked to one executive there and he said that they they went to bezos and said  We want to test this facebook thing and bezos said well, how you gonna test?  And uh, it's what we'll put up like our 10 articles a day. He said well what articles are our best one?  They said that's not a test  And they did and they're happy it's it's it's it's doing well  Against their their incremental revenue in their view  um, they really you know what the fight the old fight at the post was about that local versus national and  print was local and national was digital and they had a huge fight never settled to the to the dying days of the grand family ownership  And clearly bezos came in and said, oh no, this is a national fight  Let's let's put all the gas we can on the pedal and they are now bigger than the new york times in the u.s  in terms of audience or traffic and so that's what they're doing, but they're still in a  Volume based business, I think but they're doing very smart things. They were the first ones to do progressive web apps with uh with google  uh, they're the first in on a lot of things because they have the good technology talent and the  Willingness to work at it and I think he's made a very good product all in all

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're right, it was bob woodward who emailed bezos and said he was the soul of the institution that's now yours  You gotta go to the funeral and uh, bezos says understand on my way  He also uh, uh, of course famously sent his private plane  Um to uh get the the journalist who had been held hostage. Yeah  um stocked with I love this stocked with  Food that he liked he checked ahead with his friends  And found out that he liked burritos  when uh, uh jason uh roseanne roseanne, how do you pronounce that roseanne  Was released from an iranian jail bezos flew into florida on his private jet stocked with beer and burritos after asking roseanne's friends  What his favorite foods are?  That's pretty cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is cool. Bezos is a cool guy. He's a tough guy, but he's a cool guy. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and there's a long there's a long history of journalism being supported by patronage

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was actually a model that  Could come back. I mean  Oh, who is it? It's one of the microsoft guys is funding. Uh,  journalism into like brain research and interesting  bio  I don't know if it's bioethics or just biology kind of startups but or not the startups themselves but journalism into the space  And if you think about  That's a model that works because the stuff that people the stuff that scales and gets you massive ad revenue  Is most often crap. I mean  blessed it but  And you have to pay for the real journalism, but when you atomize your revenue streams with digital  Which is what you do you look at it and you're like, well this economically doesn't make sense doing the crap. That's the problem  so  Patronage sounds good either through like individuals funding you through patreon or  one  Massively big rich individual. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Today facebook  Published its criteria for the news feed which I thought I don't know. Have you had a chance to look at this yet? Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I wrote a quick post about it, which you'll find there. Okay, the the facebook said basically did two things today  one was that they um  for the first time  Gave people a little more transparency into the algorithm to the extent that they said  Here are the principles that guide what we do news feed values. Yeah  Right what your family and friends first, that's our job. That's what facebook does people also want to be  Um informed and entertained but what i've heard this in the past it was the opposite order. It was friends entertainment

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Information, I know this hasn't been my experience. There's here's the quote. That's why if it's from your friends  It's in your feed period  You just have to scroll down. That's not been my experience, but i'm no that's not true. That's not true

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, because because a lot of why don't a lot of my friends put stuff. I don't want that's  But at the same time the second thing they did  Which is that they also tweaked the algorithm to say, uh, yes  We're going to favor friends even more and they're warning news organizations. There may be an impact  Well, the news organizations look with batmish. Oh, sorry. Sorry about that carson edit  Um, they went crazy and new york times, uh, you know shock shock. They're going to show us cats. No news  Uh, how they they're a news organization  What are they doing? They've never been a news organization. There's never been a priority. This is a matter of degree  but the the um  Uh neiman lab post was the most reasonable but most of the other posts I saw said oh my god  They're going to de-emphasize news everybody who's partnered with news with facebook is basically an idiot  Uh, well, we've got to wait and see over time and experience and data what actually happens. Yes  There's an impact but the real lesson here is facebook is not a place to read thousand word articles  Facebook is a place where you discuss things and we in news have to feed those discussions appropriately to the platform  You know, we we don't get mad because snapchat will not let us put up an article and we have to make things especially  And appropriately for snapchat. Well facebook is trying to gently guide us there. I think  Nonetheless, all my my e-aurs and the news business all went crazy today  Say big bad. Uh facebook is ruining news again, and I don't think that's the case

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the problem, I mean what are the problems I should say is that a lot of news organizations in the last year or so  Have oriented towards facebook and it's a significant driver of their traffic when you're trying to achieve those crazy scales  So it makes sense that everyone's like holy cow. They're changing the algorithm. It's like when  It's like the greeks when they were like, oh the gods are mad at us again when you know, it didn't rain in enough time  That's that's what it feels like  So, I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are they going to start sacrificing goats on mark zuckerberg's porch is the question. They'll be sacrificing journalists as as per usual  Farhan manju's headline in the new york times facebook a news giant that would rather show us baby pictures

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's just so condescending not only to facebook but to every user of facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah  Yeah, I think actually i'll have to say facebook from my experiences doing it about right  For me personally. Yeah  Yeah, i'm here. I go there and I see  A nice mix  I do see a lot of news  uh, and I can't  Verify that i'm seeing everything my friends and family post  But I see a nice mix and you're right and I don't want to necessarily see everything my friends and family post  Uh facebook's ultimate metric  Is I I mean, I don't think they've this is a surprise is yeah, how much time you spend there period?  And they're gonna just they have the data and they know what you like and what you don't like  So they're gonna they're gonna just watch and see what you like and what you interact with and they're gonna give you more of that  Because that's their only real job

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right here is the same as it is to me from vidcon  Is that we it's less than ever last year vidcon. They're not about content. It's about social tokens  You make things to serve the conversations people have and you can serve it with journalistic value with facts and fact checking  And information and explanation and education, but you do it appropriate to how people live their lives  We don't do that. We still make a destination product called an article. Well, that's sorry folks  But that's what we have to rethink  And and and facebook is making is is gently  Not so gently making us do that, you know, it's really happening. It's this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it's another similar shift from the library to the internet, so  The way you use the library is very different the way that you use the internet  But the library is the old days where you would go to the library and you would  Get something to read  And similarly you would go to the New York Times site and get something to read  And but nowadays you don't need to go to the library  And but nowadays you don't need to go to the library you go to the internet, which is this tossed salad of things to read  If you want to find something to read you can but you're not going to go to the New York Times  you're going to go to a  news aggregator or facebook or twitter  And you're going to see story a story you're interested in read that and then read another  you know a crouton from the Washington Post and a  You know an onion ring from the New York Magazine and you're going to move around  Is that a fair is that an after analogy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo will be asking a question to get you in trouble. Are you saying that libraries should close?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I yeah as repositories of books  They they need to know they shouldn't close what they should do is that they need to rethink their role  In the internet age, they're no longer the place you go to find facts  They know that they of course they do it's a it's the thing librarians have been chewing on for 20 years

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I really think they're trying what they should do libraries roles should be to provide community services for people  To educate themselves get access to things that they haven't been able to I know like our library is doing a lot with literacy  Adult literacy for example, they're doing a lot with a lot of libraries are opening up maker spaces  I don't know how they do that  In a quiet environment like like a library, but they open up maker spaces and they have 3d printers and other things  And it's an investment but I think those are the types of things that libraries can be a wonderful resource  everybody knows where the library is or most people do so you go there to  Uh to learn a little differently. You might not check out a book, but maybe you'll learn how to 3d print  uh  A holder for your tablet or something like that and so to extend my analogy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Perhaps to the point of breaking just as a library has to rethink its role in an internet era. So does a news journal  Because you can't expect people to go to the front page and read from the top to the bottom and see a  Giant full page ad for macy's it doesn't work that way

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think maybe the publishers have to I mean most journalists think of their job not as  They think if their job is providing information. I think right most of the people I do that's a better way to hold it  the business model though  God help us all

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's the real problem isn't there I mean  And frankly the libraries also face that if you're in california funding for the library is so bad that libraries are now not open  But a few hours a week in the public library in many in many cities  And and and and our library here is basically just a place where books are that nobody wants to read and so it's homeless people there  using the bathrooms

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Our libraries are great. We've got people coming in using the computers. We've got I mean  I will I will confess I check out still probably five or six books a week because you have a nine-year-old  Not not just because I have a nine-year-old. It's because I don't like paying for like  Kindle downloads because they're so freaking expensive. I'm like ten dollars. I could get this at the library for free

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but you are in a minority. I doubt it's really crowded there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, there's a lot of people on the computers. Okay, and yeah, i'm using the internet. That's exactly it  No, I mean i've i've done i've done workshops there teaching people how to use  You know software for like job training and I think that's actually a really like I think that's why better broadband access to libraries is so important  and I think  A good library can serve as like a digital ambassador to people who otherwise are going to be left behind so  And it's a good place for books

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I I completely agree our our library's been very  Good at partnering with our makerspace  We've done learned to solder days or learn to solder workshops there where people just come in  They solder a little thing and learn a new skill. I'm going there on the 6th of july, I think  And we're going to do a take apart night where kids middle school kids can bring in whatever they  Electronics or anything they want and we're just going to tear it apart and learn how it works  So I I think there's a huge role and I think that most libraries like you said leo are trying to figure out  What it is that they're going to do but I think there's a huge role for libraries to  Supplement education in their local communities

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They really just need to stick and learn the code sign out there and then taxpayer dollars will just flow right to it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But but as with newspapers  Do we adapt the legacy institution and try to fit it into a square hole?  Or should you just create a whole new institution where people can go use and live on the internet and use the bathrooms  Or should we rethink how we do news or should we rethink education?  That's what entrepreneurship and and innovation do  And then the inevitable that the legacy players will wind their heads off and argue that they're being killed  And newspaper people are the haughtiest of all I think we go back to your question about vidcon the difference is  Yeah, they're all affected by the platforms  but the haughtiness of the news industry versus the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Reasonableness of the vidcon people is a stark contrast. Were there any mainstream media people at vidcon or was it all new media?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, no cadet was there

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, there was fortune had someone there, but they're there on a field trip. They're there to cover it. They're there to learn

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What are they there for? Well, here's my line. The first floor of vidcon literally is the fan 17 000  The second floor of vidcon is 5 000 creators. The third floor is 3 000 industry executives old white men who exploit the two floors below

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, you agree with me  That's exactly what i'm saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm part of the exploiter. Oh, so am I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Doing my best to exploit everybody anyway  Not as effectively as some  It's susan morjiski  She's good. She's really good  All right, let's take a break. We'll talk more about all of these issues and there's some actual hard news as well like a new  700 trillion pixel cloudless  satellite map  From google a chromebook pro  and  2.8 million dollar space  Where google is is uh supporting black girls code?  That's really cool  Right now though, we're gonna talk about a company supporting us  with uh  With their great products. It's atlasian. We use atlasian like crazy here at twitter  We use jira  Which is a great way to track manage and assign tasks in a big coding project first experienced jira in our website a new website design  The team that was building it used jira  It was great. We were able to put our ideas our needs our requests our desires into jira  They were able to parcel it out into little tiny chunks  And then assign that to an engineer then the engineer can move the chunk along and it's a great way. It's agile  Sprint based and it's fantastic. I've never seen such an easy way to take something hugely complex and make it simple  Keep everybody on track. No, everybody knows exactly where you are. That's jira. Then there's confluence. We use confluence here in the studio  Our engineering team uses it to create documentation and about our workflow and our hardware  Instant messaging via hip chat is the best we use it like crazy  I should show you our hip chat room. I mean we have  People uh, we create the beauty of hip chat is it's easy to create a new room and we create rooms every time  We've got a task. We've got a room of course  for our  new studio  We've got rooms for engineering. We've got rooms for booking hip chat is more than messaging though because you can also  Integrate in a lot of other tools like jira  So that you can get alerts and information about how things are working  We have server alerts and things like that. We love these at lassian programs  And if you use git if you're a programmer, you'll love bitbucket. It's a better way to get test review and manage code  In real time it all comes from at lassian  Putting together tools to make it easier to collaborate to work together  We use it for everything from planning events to working on operational issues  All of our communications. It's better than emails better than phones. It's at lassian  Atlassian.com and you can try it free see how jira confluence hip chat bitbucket will give your team everything you need  To organize discuss and complete shared work  At lassian helping teams everywhere team up  To create what's next we used it for our uh, we like it so much. We used it for the app development for our new apps  Uh, we're just and it's great for the studio design stuff  And the build and the engineers use it was interesting to get the contractors using it at first because at first  Our project manager says well i'll email you and lisa said no  Put it in hip chat. Oh  Okay, but once you get used to it like the flow is so so good  Thank you at lassian for your support of this week in  Google. I love stephen levy's article, uh in medium  Back channel by the way, who bought back channel?  condi, right  That is weird bought by them because yeah, wasn't it a microsoft? No back channels the meat is medium  Remember and they hired stephen levy away from wired to run it and everybody's wondering. Well, what does ev thinking?  How are they gonna make money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it was backed by I think it was backed by microsoft. Oh, that's interesting. They paid like a one year  Sponsorship of it basically that paid for stephen

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I did not know that  Um, well, they've got a great team and now they've they're they're still on medium. This is boy talk about an interesting experiment in journalism  They're still on medium  But now condi owns it. I I still don't see any ads in it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they have a new editor. Don't they?  Jesse hemple. Oh, I heard I love jesse. Yeah, I think I just got an email from her. Oh interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's really interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So let me let me see where she popped up

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, because I I I love back channel I love I read it all the time it's become really a go-to  It's weird magazine within a magazine within a site I don't you know, it's a very  Jeff you write for medium all the time. You've been the one who've been telling me all this time and i'm the one laughing at you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh jesse is the new head of editorial for back channel. Oh cool. So there you go. That's she's writing for them

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have seen her byline  And she's also she's very good so great article last week how google is  Remaking itself as a machine for learning first company how they're putting as i've as i've said in the past a thin layer  of machine learning  All over everything one of the he buries way down if he's talking about how they've got  A program to become machine learning ninjas for their coders and they're trying to train everybody as fast as they can and adding machine learning  But way down in the article he kind of buries what I thought was very interesting  Which is there's a machine learning tool called rank brain  Uh that they've been using for some time for some small percentage of google searches  In an interview that uh, steven got with somebody at google the guy had a search I think at google  Um, he said yeah, we're using rank brain for like 90 percent of all searches now  I I don't know enough about  What rank brain does to know what that means but that's so this is uh google rank brain is evolved in according to  Uh, uh dean who is not amit sigal was the master of search but um

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who is it who left really recently? What was the guy who's he left recently from google?  He had kept them from using

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes machine learning so this is how steven cook I think it kind of nicely uh categorizes it  Is there two schools of thought when it comes to search? There's the what he calls the retrieval school  Which is how you how you and I probably think of search which is you go out you spider everything you  You bring it all you index it and then somebody retrieves it like looking up in a card catalog at the library  The search results and then there's the more in more difficult but more interesting  Artificial intelligence technique and that's the one that is now  Winning out rank brain is involved in every query and affects the actual rankings  Probably not in every query but in a lot of queries. What's more?  It's hugely hugely effective levy writes of the hundreds of signals google search uses when it calculates its rankings  Rank brain is now ranked as the most third most useful

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's that that makes sense there's always this battle between the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Retrievers and the machine learning people the machine learners have finally won the battle

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I think it's probably a better way to characterize it would be  um  You've got the machines you let them do their thing and you let the people come in every now and then and tweak it  so less of a battle and more of a  Oh god singularity. Ah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cooperation the machines and the humans are working together at last  Yeah, sure  All right, nothing more to say about that. I thought it was a very interesting article. Anyway, um,  Google maps is getting a new 700 trillion pixel  remake facelift  cloudless now the satellites  Pictures are cloudless  It's the first time google maps satellite map has been updated in three years  I didn't know this but a billion people use up all the clouds on earth. Yes  That's the that's the headline  Write it today more than a billion people use google maps every month  Um, you you may not have it already, but it will be you'll be getting it soon 700 trillion  pixels of new data

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow, what?  Think about the bandwidth that's gonna suck up if you're like trying to find something real fast

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Um, here's an example. I mean go ahead. Oh, go ahead. I was just saying this is from the atlanta

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Atlantic article. Here's an example  christmas island  Which is in the middle of the pacific a thousand miles off australia  Uh is so remote that actually it's in the indian ocean. It's so remote that it's frequently obscured by clouds  But there are no clouds in the new map

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I say this is this is interesting in the scope of it  And the enormity of it, but at the same time, I mean, I know for me I almost never use satellite anymore  I use  um the regular  Map view really use you don't you like those pretty pictures. I like the pretty pictures  My daughter now it's easier for me to navigate and find out where i'm going if I use the regular map if I use satellite  It's all

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the abstract version

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I use it only to snoop on my neighbors and see houses. I couldn't otherwise see because you know that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, shameful admission. I do the same thing  Like do they have a pool over there they I think they have a pool yeah, then you zoom in yes, it's a pool  So part of the problem I guess was the uh pictures that they were getting um  From landsat 7  Were marred by these diagonal lines. This was a physical malfunction on the satellite, but now they have a new satellite landsat 8  And it doesn't have the same problem. It's been operational for since the spring of 2013  So there's a lot better crisper newer  data  So that's kind of cool  Need article I like the atlantic they've they're pretty they've getting more and more geeky  They're very good. Yeah, they are good. That's where the money is geeky geeky stuff. Yeah, I said that for years, but it took nobody believe me

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You might be a little too geeky. Oh, I know i'm in i'm in the too geeky camp too. So i'm like, oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  a little too geeky

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, do we want to talk about uh google fiber and buying web pass or did we yes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, this is a great story and uh, there's a there's a side story that's related  about um, this this comes from a medium opinion piece  By an apartment dweller about house how comcast and the other incumbents  Basically have a monopoly and make exclusivity deals with apartment buildings  And as a result a lot of apartment dwellers, which is the majority of people in the united states  Are forced into poor situations if you live in an apartment  you of course you have no choice but to  To to get your internet from whatever the apartment offers and and comcast and others  Use their leverage to uh and kickbacks  To ensure you have very poor connection web pass is I think ohm malik's  Apartment building maybe you can remember if it does it does have web pass because ohm's always say oh you I have the best  internet access. It's so good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He started complaining about it in recent years  But for like the longest time he had like 200 megabits per second when right it was like back in

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  2009 so and that was because the apartment owners that worked as a co-op and made a deal with web pass  And web pass put fiber in  so  They're they've just been bought by google fiber  Which will give google a foothold into this  Big apartment market in san francisco san diego miami  chicago and boston

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they're buying the so the web pass is a point-to-point service but the fibers throughout the building  So web, I think what pass does it use microwave?  Oh, that's interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it gets a high speed con connection to the building and then the building distributes it to its customers

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is that is my understanding of how web passes. I mean unless recently they've changed things

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I was because I remember talking about it and I wasn't I thought I think that's what ohm's using  So that like that good it is it yeah, um, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, so in susan crofford who's the person who wrote there you go medium article  She's the one who actually was very prescient talking about how the cable companies were basically building up a high-speed broadband monopoly  A couple years back because none of the telco guys were invested a warrior for the good guys here. Yes, he calls it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What is the phrase she uses the the uh?  The new paola

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The new paola, so it's not I was kind of I read this and I was like, come on susan  because  This isn't new this has happened for  decades and the fcc actually made rules trying to prevent it, but the problem is  You have to wire up these buildings and so  The cable companies like they're all through san antonio. You can go and find  Uh u-verse only buildings because that's the infrastructure they put in  and  It's sucky. But if you get enough people my understanding is now you can  Change those rules, but you do have to get enough people and go like  it is a pain and it's it's  horribly unfair and it's kind of a legacy  Of our crappy internet infrastructure plan from way back in the 90s. Crawford who's a professor of law at harvard

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh writes that the fcc made a rule eight years ago that says landlords cannot have exclusive agreements  Uh, in fact, they knew there was a problem. This is the fcc incumbent providers commonly engage in a flurry of activity to lock up  Mdus that's multiple dwelling units and other real estate developments and exclusive  Arrangements as soon as it becomes clear a new entrant will be coming into town  um the problem is  That you can make a rule  But these big isps are not dumb  So they do sort all sorts of interesting things she quotes a story  About uh  apartment building and here's a letter from comcast saying  I'm writing to you regarding an incident that occurred recently in nearby apartment community served by comcast a new provider  Google fiber had set up an on-site marketing event on the property in violation of the exclusive marketing provisions  So you can't have an exclusive but you can't have an exclusive marketing deal  Unfortunately, it put the property in a difficult situation as they were required to remove the google sales team immediately  Fortunately the property owner recognized the error when we contacted with them and worked with us to rectify this  Situation or as she says put down that google donut and get the hell out  So there's ways and ways even if there's a rule against it

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Good

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Shenanigans are everywhere she says the isps are super smart

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're not dumb. I mean, but this is also i'm sure you guys have probably covered this back when it was announced  But I mean google is you know trying to get around this by laying their own  fiber and they I guess the the new uh trans pacific, uh, 60  Terabit per second cable is going live on june 30th. Wow, apparently  I don't know if you saw that but it was it was in the news probably like a year ago  or maybe more that they were going to do this and um

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And apparently it's it's ready to go live here. The other side of this is is you as an apartment renter have some  Power because after all is that the one of the first things you ask about before you rent a new apartment is what kind?  Of internet you got

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It depends on the I mean if you're in san francisco finding a place you're like can I afford to live in this trouble? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so I I don't know it's not a very it is definitely a seller's market in some cities but but where it's not you should really insist  We you know, we we're moving studios and one of the one of the real incentives for the move  When we moved in here five six years ago  We got comcast to trench from way down the street there all the way up to here to put in fiber  And we spent a lot I think thousands five thousand dollars a month or something for 150 megabits megabits of symmetric fiber  the new place  A local provider one of the really best internet independent internet service providers in the country sonic net  I love sonic aren't they great? Well, they're local. They're from santa rosa  Yeah, okay. Yes, so it turns out i'm i'm we're looking at places right and everywhere that we go  I see a little thing that says oh, yeah, we have gigabit here  And i'm going hey this place has gigabit. This is awesome  So we've i'm friends with dane jasper the founder of sonic net i've known him for years  He's the guy with the linux license plate. We've interviewed him before and we talked to him. He said dane  What can you do for us? So we're getting get ready for this 10 gigabit symmetric in the new studio

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  10 wow  Nice, can I move in please? I'm gonna move in

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What are you gonna do with that man? Well, we we as it turns out we do consume bandwidth like popcorn. So we'll  We'll find ways to use it  So well, we were really thrilled I mean that's but that's a sell the point is that's a selling point

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  To have gigabit available. Yes. Yeah, it is when it is. I won't stay at a hotel anymore unless it has fast internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff jeff, you should learn the lesson. I won't come to a country anymore

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So anyway, there's a crappy hotel down in  Silicon valley that I stay at when I go down there and the only reason I stay there is because they have  Normal wi-fi throughout that they don't you just sign on you don't have to sign into a page  You don't and it's super fast. I can watch netflix. I can do what I want  And so that's my top choice, even though it's a crappy room with a crappy bed all the rest that can get work done  I think the same is true. It's becoming increasingly more the case that you want to have fast internet no matter where you go

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the problem. Aaron. Here's the problem  There isn't what we what the world needs is an honest  Fact-checked database of actual speeds in prime times in hotel rooms number one number two  We need suits against hotels for false advertising. We need a definition of high speed and a definition of what's not high  It's just awful

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you know, so I talked to the people who run  Hilton and  Is it marriott? No hyatt  Um those two hotel chains to actually ask about how they  when these companies franchise out or I don't know if it's really franchising when you're a hotel, but they actually have standards for  internet access that they  Make their hotel chains follow what's crazy is oh, yeah  It differs based on location. So like the type of city how many stars a property has  Like like the the status of a property  um  I think those are the two big things and so I was actually surprised because some of them are like  Relatively decent but some of them are like, you know, oh and how many rooms the size of the property?  But some of them are like 300 megabits per second for a property that would have like  300 rooms and i'm like, yeah, no, that's not legit  Um, so I was kind of shocked that that even existed. So jeff hotel wi-fi tests.com

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a crowd source a crowd source for hotel. It's like seek guru for hotel wi-fi. It's a crowd-sourced  Database and what you do when you go to a hotel you test the wi-fi and you upload  The data to the website and they have 350 395 hotels in london 139 hotels in san francisco  200 hotels in barcelona, I mean all over  So you can actually uh, you know if I were in a hotel right now  I'd say yes and it would test the speed and it would upload it to its server automatically. So  You're right. I think this would need but I think what's what you're seeing though already  Is a considerable improvement in all of this because more and more people want high-speed internet and as that becomes more and more  Expected there's more pressure. I mean the days there's still are plenty of hotels that charge you 15 dollars a day for internet  But there are far more hotels now that start off that are saying free free internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, well the big gig now is free basic  Yeah, uh, if you only want to lose email and then pay for  The high speed but then you pay for the high speed they don't deliver it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know but I think that this is we're in a transition  But I think there's significant market pressure now not just on hotels  But on apartment buildings and on renters and every and rentals and everything but I want the legal pressure too the ftc

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The federal commission should make itself useful  And and be enforcing the definition of high and the delivery of ftc has a definition of broadband, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I don't know well, but it's for different it actually is different two different places  I'm going to give you a shred of hope here jeff because last year  The first hotel to offer netflix in their guest rooms and as part of that deal with netflix. They had to actually guarantee  Their broadband speeds to each room, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm gonna remember. I try to say maria when I can oh good news

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there you go, um  It's so it's enough to stream netflix in the room because that was actually one of their big issues that in figuring out  How to make sure people how to sign people out automatically if they didn't sign out of their netflix accounts  um  So we might actually see those kind of deals because I mean  Do you I don't even turn on my hotel room tv. I just sit there and find something on my computer

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And watch it. That's what I do too. I I think this is a potential business opportunity for google, frankly  I mean look what they've done with starbucks. What if they picked a few hotel chains and said hey look we'll provide  Your internet access to your guests if you let us be, you know  Have the sole sole proprietorship of of the internet and just just just outsource it to google. I mean, I think it's a win-win

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're paying brilliant. Aaron really brilliant

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow, if jeff says i'm brilliant i'm feeling good

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google's also responding by building its own internet speed test tool and I haven't got this feature yet. Although some people say they have  so one of the problems with one of the problems with speed test on that which is run by ukula or netflix, uh fast  Dot com website is that isps know about these and they will you know see that you're going there and they'll  Hoke the results. So if you search  for speed test or or um  Uh, what's my speed test or check internet speed on google?  Some people at least are getting a button in the search results that say run speed tests from google's measurement labs

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they also did for youtube  I don't know if when you if you guys notice this but you could actually check your broadband quality on youtube and it would show you if  Your isp was this was back during the peering debates, right? But I thought fast.com was by netflix

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is netflix built that yes, not speed test. No, no ukula does speed test and fast.com is done by netflix. Exactly right  uh, and now  Or sometime coming to a browser near you google may have its own

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Measurement lab does a lot of really cool testing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that should be fun. So, uh, measurement lab is not google. It's another company. It's a third party measurement lab is a non-profit

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  from the  Ota hold on  I used to work with them when I was doing all the peering stuff. They're really m lab and google has backed them  but I think it's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now this is kind of neat

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  open technology what oti  I'm terrible with acronyms

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Anyway, you can find out more at measurement lab net

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There you go. Oh new america's open technology institute. There we go. Cool and  Academic researchers google and planet lab consortium and felt planet lab consortium speaking of which you might wonder

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Where's matt cuts? Uh these days because he may not be able to join us for a while because I guess he's gone to work for the pentagon

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh-oh matt cuts in a uniform

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think he has to wear a uniform  Though we queried him. He said well, I might be able to but I am starting a new job and i'll let you know  After I ask them if I can continue to do this week in google, sorry, it's it's colonel cuts to you colonel cuts  I'd like to say that  Ten hut. I like that. Yeah, he's not leaving google, but he's joining the pentagon's digital team. This is actually  It's the defense digital service  which was formed last fall to improve the dod's ability to  solve complicated it issues and develop new technologies  And so this is kind of cool he he's wanted to as a lot of coders have wanted to  Kind of take his skills and bring him to government to improve transparency to make government work better  For us he says uh over the last couple of years  I've seen more and more people in technology trying to make government work better their idealists who are also making a large impact  It's like code for america people like that. There are people I respect  Some of them have worked to fix healthcare.gov for example, I think a lot of googlers went on loan for that  From take talking to many of them. I could tell you the energy is contagious and they're trying to improve things in all kinds of ways  I want to see whether I can help too. So for the next few months  I'll be taking a leave from google. I'm joining the u.s digital service family specifically  the defense digital service at the pentagon  And he's moving to dc as part of the change change  Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So let us now please pay tribute to matt  For bringing his wonderful cloud to bear to solve the incredible best of the year moment on quig last week with poor jason  Was matt on last week?  No, but matt rescued him after the fact. Oh, he rescued

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I should tell you what happened. Were you here for that jeff? Because I wasn't I was on vacation. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was it was it was  You know jason is wonderful he threw himself on his sword for the sake of the show for the sake of the entertainment  I would have gone completely completely crazy insane had to leave. He kept his good humor

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He used as a lesson, but he needed matt's rescue now explain so he decided to turn on two factor while he was on the show  on uh on google and unfortunately  And this is a bug if you ask me  Um the phone number that he uses and would use to verify  That he was in fact, you know getting the right codes and everything was a google voice number  So of course as soon as he turned on two factor  He was logged out of google voice and then was unable to as a result get the confirming text message that would allow him to use it  Thereby locking himself out of all google services. Is that correct?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, he was in a recursive loop of hell that the only way to get out of it was to do what he couldn't do

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That doesn't seem possible

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As as we pointed out the show as sheena said  Google should know a google voice number and say, uh, you don't want to do that. We're smarter than you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so I haven't talked to jason since he's on vacation right now  But so matt cuts it helped him fix as usual by the way  Matt we love you matt and I know you're listening right now  Even though you're steep within the confines of the pentagon, but um, I think they still have reception there  What kind of bandwidth do they have at the pentagon you think they have 10 gigabits per second anyway

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're gonna list leo

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, I know I got it. I don't need it  um  But he saved our bacon a couple of times too when when we when we screwed up  He intervened for us as I think you know, and he's interviewed many times  So thank you matt for uh interviewing once again for the twit family  You're a good man matt cuts a good man

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And he also put in a bug report that said, uh, you know, we might want to change our ui on that park  Which is very mapped can't be the only person who's done that  I've talked I hope that i've talked to people in other tech companies at other divisions of google  And it's funny how matt is now a touchstone  Because when they get into trouble and lack of trust when I hear people say honest to god  I've heard this from three or four places, you know, they need they need a hat cuts  And it's true he he is such a human being you know, he's gonna listen he's gonna trust he's gonna be reasonable he's gonna level with you  and um  He's the best, you know you feel in good hands. He's the best. He's the best so matt all your jog right now. I hope you're grinning

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I see moving his whole family I guess he is uh to dc I don't know I don't know that  That's commitment to public service. Thank you matt for doing that  And I don't know what the term of his service will be and I don't know what  Whether he'll come back a colonel or just a staff sergeant, but uh  hats off to you  colonel matt cuts  I like colonel cuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Study, no, it sounds like a movie from the vietnam  Yeah, oh, yeah the horror the horror cuts

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love the smell of java in the morning. Did he somebody's saying, uh, did he did he come from the government to google? I can't remember  Somebody said that in the chat room. I don't know if that's true or not  Uh, it's funny how little we know about matt cuts  I'm gonna have a t-shirt made that says ww mcd. What would matt cuts do?  Let me just see he started his career at the university of north carolina chapel hill so he's kind of going home  And joined google in the year  2000 can you believe that?  Um, so I don't I think he must have come straight out of college. He was working on his phd  at the unc

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is he doctor cuts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, he may be abd cuts. I don't know. We'll have to ask matt  Yeah, all but dissertation, right? I don't know what I don't know. Yeah, that's a good question  He was working on his phd at unc matt  I'll call him doctor cuts from now on  He has an ms. I like colonel cutts. He's in ms. It looks like he didn't get his phd if wikipedia is correct  But he's from that area. He grew up in i didn't know this he grew up in kentucky, which is why he's such a nice guy  That explains a lot  Um  20 what is it 2.8 million dollar facility?  for black girls code  In inside the google headquarters in new york city. It's a non-profit  Hoping to give better opportunities for students and increase diversity  In the tech industry  And that's more than just you know paying lip service to getting some diversity  I think that's fantastic. It's a gift from google, by the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I have I have a lot of questions about this. Did you read I mean  When teaching or when saying that you're going to teach someone how to code and expecting that to like solve problems  No, it doesn't of course not so yeah, like oh, I like this. Does it also help?  You know provide training on how to  Do you have a lot of resources on how to interview well, right?  Money for clothing so you can get a job if you want it  All of these other and slowly in some ways

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the first step and the most valuable step in diversifying silicon valley  Would be get some perspective and some different culture into the products that we make in silicon valley  That would be a very good first step to make not merely making it. I mean, obviously eventually you'd like to have lots of jobs, too  But even just having it not be less of a monoculture  Would be hugely valuable you saw the last episode of silicon valley where they they made a great product  But only engineers liked it. Nobody else could figure it out  And that's a kind of a problem in silicon valley

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's why you need diversity. That's exactly right. Yeah  Yeah, no, i've been arguing that for years, but the best way to make that happen is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean well, it's a start to bring people in in and say here you're working in google. I agree  I understand in fact one of the things I love about app camp for girls is they really emphasize it's not just coding there's  They you know, if you're designing an app you need all kinds of  Skills you need to be able to maybe some people are designers  Some people are marketers. There's lots of skills and I think that that's really the way to look at it is  Um is there's a variety you know, you can contribute to technology  From with more than just coding  I agree with you stacey. I think emphasizing coding is uh  Is probably a bad idea on the other hand

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not I don't I don't actually disagree with emphasizing coding  I'm just saying that it takes a lot more than coding right in teaching someone to code to make them a good potential employee

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. I do think I I would like to see coding  and actually maybe  You and erin can weigh on on this because we both have younger kids. I'd like to see coding  Be at least an equal partner to math in schools these days  In other words the skills that you learn in math are not math  I mean, you're not going to use algebra in real life unless you're a coder probably or a an actuary  But what it teaches you is rigorous thinking how to solve problems  You know how to stay with something until you understand it has there's all these extra life skills that you learn over and above math  And coding can do exactly the same thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Um, I completely agree. Um, I talked to my son about this all the time about you know, he always asks  Well, what is all this math i'm learning good for i'm never going to use it once I you know get out of school  And you can say the same thing for programming. This is an example  You know, he comes to me  Said a while ago. He said oh, I want to you know, he's big into video games  Of course, I want to learn how to make video games. I'm like, well, that's what you use your math for  You're gonna have to know this stuff. Um, how old is he? You can do some really cool stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How old is he oh so so he just turned 17

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Um, and interestingly enough, I was on vacation as well. I'm glad we synchronized our vacations leo  Um, I was on vacation last week as well and we I took him to kind of a college tour back east was we were visiting some family  So we stopped in at cornell neat and um took it was a great tour. We took the engineering department tour  And one of the questions I asked him about what's the ratio men to women in the engineering department?  In the engineering department and they said that it was above 50 women actually  In their engineering group, which I thought was a fantastic. Um, great, uh  Number to have but but they said except  Computer science. Oh, yeah  Except computer science. So all the other engineering, uh majors are are 50%  You know if you take them and average it out, but but computer science is still a lot less  So I think programs like this are really really necessary  Like you said leo just to introduce the concept and  All additional learning that you can get out of coding we use coding  It's not just coding in the maker space anyway  We we teach coding but you have to know the coding in order to do something. It's to make something  Exactly, so you're doing a project the laser maze I mentioned before is a great example of that  We need the code to get the thing to work. Otherwise, it doesn't work  So you start with this?  I think it would be cool if you could do this and then the coding is one piece of that giant puzzle  In in making something come to life or bringing your idea to life  And so that's what we teach in the maker space, but I think this is fantastic  Just to introduce coding some place where it may not be introduced. Um

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Otherwise, I think it's fantastic stacey. Does your nine-year-old daughter have an interest in tech at all or

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  so sometimes and and this is actually worth  I don't know if this is because  Why?  Okay, but as a girl when she's there's a robotics club in her school  And they do a lot of it's not just battle bots, but it's making robots and she is  so not into that she's like screw that like straight up like  Roboty things but she is interested when I showed her like projects about using arduinos to  There's a project to teach to use an arduino to program a lemur feeder for the oakland zoo  Oh neat awesome  Yeah, she was like we could feed animals with this and that so  And then there's a girl they started a girl's kind of oriented  Tech club at her school and like the project that they were working on was building a trash can that when you stuck a new  Piece of trash in it would weigh it and give you like data on how much space it would take up in a landfill  um, wow  and they so I think part of it is  When my daughter thinks about making something she's thinking about making something  A lot of times with more of a social component and i'm not saying it's no that's her that's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gender specific, but that's her

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and so like I think once we brought in tech out to like  More applications beyond just like video games or something that has historically been a little bit more  I don't know  Male or loner or whatever. I mean I built computers with my dad  So I i've always been more of the guy side of tech

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe that's the argument about bringing diversity to silicon valley is instead of thinking the same applications that we're already doing is to get  Some diversity in there. Maybe you'll come up with something like weighing garbage. I mean, that's the whole point

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, or you'll put a period tracking app and health kit or you'll I mean  Isn't there one there is no yes, but it launched without one

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right because well and uh, I mean along the same lines apple made a big deal about  Oh, we've adjusted the apple watch now for people who are not walking but in chairs  um because and I didn't talk about insensitivity and if you had more people in wheelchairs in the apple campus  Maybe this wouldn't happen. The apple watch tells you to stand up every hour  Which must be very  Frustrating so they've they've now they've changed that and then in iowa and the new uh apple watch os  They'll you'll be able to say, you know get active or something else and they're even instead of just measuring  Pacing and steps. They're they studied how people use their wheelchairs how they move their arms  Apparently there are multiple ways of doing that and making the watch work with that and all of that comes from having diversity  In the building. Otherwise, you don't think about other people  So it's true. Yep. This is good. We all agree  Uh, i'd be interested to see what's going on with the chromebook pro so  Google initially at wwdc said that you will be getting the play store on three different  Chromebooks in june. One was the chromebook pixel 2015. One was a asus flip one was an acer  It has arrived on one and only one the asus flip which I don't think anybody has around here. I wish I did  i'm cross  Crossing my fingers. It'll arrive on my chromebook  This is the pre-release you have to be on the developer track to get that  Now the apparently now I wouldn't expend I wouldn't expend too much energy on this  But do any of you use the google opinion rewards app? I do

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you get these surveys and some of the surveys. Yes, I use it all the time and i'm so pissed  It doesn't i've not been asked the question you're about to say

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait, does it is that the same thing that asks me questions about restaurants i've been at or is that a different that's that's another thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's different the opinion rewards is actually you must get it because here's what happens  you first of all  There's something satisfying being about being asked your opinion  As if they care right as if it matters as if it matters  But so the the the it's actually quite satisfying to take these little surveys and sometimes they're very just two questions  Sometimes there's one question like, you know, do you helisky?  No, thank you for participating  But you get money you get credits in the google play store for participating in it, which is really  cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, better than the expert points I get for answering questions about restaurants. No, this is much better

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That you must be that must be four square or something. So that's google. It's google. All right, that's google local

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which is separate sometimes they will ask you for reviews, but this asks you  But it's also wonderfully freaky because it knows exactly what stores you've been in. Oh, I do see that sometimes. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so I don't have any surveys at this time, uh, nor do I apparently have any credit  But a redditor says look what I got on my google opinion rewards the other day  How would you think a chromebook pro is different than a chromebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And if I were in marketing I would run all kinds of surveys just right people talking about I don't think it's meaningful at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, but what would a chromebook pro be for you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, the pixel is a chromebook pro right lte. Yeah, plus lte. Yeah, I love my pixel

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's great, but you're right. It's missing that one feature lte. It's also heavy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'd love to see it as nice and robust and bulletproof. It is. It's still pretty heavy. It'd be nice to be a little lighter  But with the same great screen the same great camera  I actually love the four by three aspect ratio with the pixel  The nice thing is there are lots of good choices dell's now making an excellent chromebook  Many companies are there's some really good chromebooks out there and some of them even are not very expensive  There's some high quality chromebooks at 250 to 300 dollars. So  Yeah, we looked at getting a chromebook for my daughter as her first computer. I would  We ended up passing out a macbook air, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you're nine you'd be lucky to get a raspberry pie  Yeah, she's she doesn't always realize how lucky she is with the hand me downs. I know hand me downs. Yeah, that's it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's it. My my 13 year old stepson has a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  probably 2012  Mac pro cheese grater running windows so he could play his steamer

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then he had a  He had a  He had a  Probably a 2012  Mac pro cheese grater running windows so he could play his steam games. Wow, that's lucky  That is lucky  Hand me downs it's the probably the only benefit to having a father who's a tech journalist or a mother who's a tech journalist  What does brexit mean actually jeff i've been dying to ask you this  What does brexit mean to all of these eu?  Suits against google  And others in fact, apparently the eu according to the journal is set to set to  Set issue fresh antitrust charges against google

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think you know i've been thinking about this and and in fact i was asked to write an op-ed  You know blog post for an eu commissioner, which i've kind of figured out what it would be  And I think what I would say is that it's a time for europe to make friends more than enemies  That you'd expect me to say that but I think that um given the break with um,  Uh, you know the uk and god knows what's going to happen there and it's just so trumpian  Um, and people don't email me for saying that  um  But uh, I I think I think the european union could be more isolated the more they try to be the power broker and the tough guy  um  I personally believe that the west  Success are going to have whereas if they take the power they have to say how could we be collaborative?  And how could be the friendly people of europe rather than those idiots in the uk that did what they just did  Uh, they'd be in a better position, but I don't know where it's going to go. It's just so wacky

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  margaret vestaya the uh, eu's antitrust chief  who has already skewered google and is currently investigating for  Uh favoring its own shopping service and search results and for how it um  Uh imposes uh restrictions on android phone manufacturers  Says that she's advancing investigations into whether google is abusing its dominance with its advertising  service  Advertising is 90 percent of google's revenue  Of course at issue is whether the company prevents or obstructs website operators from placing ads on their website to compete with google's advertising business  What  That doesn't make sense. What are you saying? If I use google adsense. I can't use some other advertising, uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Service, of course I can well well, you know the thing i've always said quietly  And you know i'm google fanboy and all that but the one area where they are the most vulnerable where they do have a monopoly  Is in advertising sales if you are an advertiser  And you decide not to use google you have a tougher time in life. Oh really?  Yeah, I think so you mean in search results  Or well, you know, he's being well not just search results  Um, um, but because of double click and everything else. Yeah  You know google has a considerable hegemony over the ad business. It's better to be a google customer than not  Yeah, whether they use it properly or not is another question ftc closed a similar investigation in 2013

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  After google committed to removing restrictions opposed on advertisers  Trying to coordinate their online advertising campaigns across several platforms  I'm reading from the wall street journal and the journal mentions that its parent company news corp  Has filed formal complaints with the commission about google's business practices  So there you go. Thank you for the disclaimer at the end of the story  Um  Anything else we want to say before we wrap this thing up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can we talk about the ai that defeated?  the army not the army the  Jet pilot the alpha the alpha ai. I thought that was like both kind of scary and cool  Yeah, and what was it? And what was it powered by?  It was um, it was a pilot ai developed by a grads a doctoral grad student from the university of cincinnati

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  um in a virtual dogfight

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In avert. Yeah, this is not a these were not real planes. It's not autonomous air force yet, but um,  It was I think two u.s air force

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, yeah retired u.s air force colonel  um and a um  An actual pilot current pilot. I don't know. I mean, um, the the colonel was a pilot he is retired

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's more like a battle tech technician. Okay, tactician. They defeated several

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Experts this is from let me let's go to the original the paper is from the journal of defense

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Management, which means I probably can't read it without uh, I thought they were using a raspberry pi though. I thought they were no

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Genetic fuzzy based artificial intelligence for unmanned combat aerial vehicle control in simulated air combat missions  Breakthroughs in genetic fuzzy systems. So fuzzy logic. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's it's this says it's breaking it breaks the tests up and it does it do statistical weighting in fuzzy logic?  That's the question i'm trying to figure out fuzzy is robust adaptable high-performing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  computationally efficient and provides an excellent framework to synthesize formal models for the purposes of verification and validation  However to date it suffers heavily from the quote curse of dimensionality end quote  That is as the scope of the problem increases the computational cost of d increases rapidly  That's why by the way, they chunked it up  So this is not yet something you're going to put in an airplane and send it to the sky  To beat the bad guys  It says a standard fuzzy based system would be extremely computationally intractable for a problem like air-to-air  Combat, I guess they've made a breakthrough that makes it a little bit more  computationally inexpensive using a genetic fuzzy tree  Got it, which sounds like a dr. Seuss plant. It sounds like that plant with the yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What kind of the spanish dagger spanish dagger my my yucca?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is a genetic fuzzy tree?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, and now I found a pdf a comparison of fuzzy baize and a weighted average  Oh, please

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I told you didn't I or maybe you weren't here when I told you I bought a book because I want to learn about this  using python for machine learning  And I literally even though I was reading it in the early evening went comatose after the first chapter I was like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So i'm gonna recommend jeff hinton has  Yeah, so they've got it he's got a corsera on convolutional neural nets  That's great. Well, there you go. And if you can find anything with yan lacoon who works at facebook  Having yan explain how a machine learning network and unsupervised machine learning works. Wow, your brain is just like  Oh, it's so awesome that i'm a journalist and I'm impressed  It's it's good. So I I encourage that because  Or just take the corsera course with jeff. Did you take the course?  I took the first like part of it and there's an ama actually his reddit ama is actually really good. Okay  So I would jeff hinton's  Geo ff, I think

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Let's see my

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Geo ff  He's at the uh, he's a distinguished researcher at google. Yes. He's the google guy at the university of toronto

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Huh, huh

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I put I put a link in the rundown, um, because I saw this on reddit earlier and I didn't know it was it was in there  Um, but I saw it because it they claim it was powered by raspberry pi. I wasn't kidding  With powered by raspberry pi I wasn't kidding. Oh, so there's a newsweek article that actually claims that they were using raspberry what for this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Test that's even more scary

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are they the are they the five dollar pi zeros or are they what the what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, i'm sure these are the 35 dollar versions because it's they have quad core cpus and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, we need like 500 to build an ai that can take out

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, hey i'm all for it just put in a little plane and you know  Send it up in a drone or something and the protect our shores. We'll have like ender's game happening right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right here in a few years  Wow. Oh no ender was an actual person. Never mind. Yeah, but he was

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He you know if you yeah, maybe maybe we could control him with a raspberry pi  We should create it we could create we'll call them ender that's what they should call it ender

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not alpha. It should have been ender. I'll call it and wiggins

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay. Wow, that's a wild story. That's amazing. Yeah, I mean I was looking at the the research pdf. They didn't mention the  The fact that they were using a raspberry pi  And that was in that was in real time that they were doing that they were  We're

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what it's it has to be right it has to be in real time right if it's a if it's a dog fight

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's real time

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, it's just I think it's just a matter of time now  Wow robots take over  Super cool is your project a raspberry pi fighter pilot this week, yaran?  No, okay. Can you work on that for next week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, i'll have it ready for uh for next one raspberry pi powered ai

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you know if you could download that code onto some pies run it on a drone  You could have some really cool aerial battles happening. Look at that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Doesn't seem possible  By the way, the uh, the colonel said it was the first time he'd seen an ai consistently beat a human pilot in uh in tests  us air force colonel gene lee  And it beat lee every single time by the way  This beats your vibe  Holy cow  I want one of these  Oh, that was too short only six seconds of  excitement

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right, let's uh, let's wrap this thing up. It's time. Uh, if anybody has a tip  Why don't we start with you aron? Because you brought us a little a little project here  Here

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and actually sent a video which is in the rundown because I know i'm not usually i'm in the studio  But yeah, it was too late. No, that's fine kind of last minute for me today. So yeah, thank you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Joy, we weren't sure we weren't sure if jeff would be able to get through but he's managed to do it  Anyway, oh it says they're still processing the video. They're still processing. Yeah, there's another link below that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll do the photos. Yeah, google photos. See if you can bring that up. Yeah. Anyway, this is what it is  It's a project. I actually made for my son as part of one of his uh,  His things that he was doing for class and this is really simple  It's very similar to the the 20-sided die that I brought in one time that told you what position it landed on  Um, but all it is is a keypad keypads are real cheap. You can get them for a couple of bucks on ebay  Mounted to a little project box with the speaker inside and when you hit the code it actually will uh,  Do a message. So let's see if I can  There it goes there's a message for you  That's box here you just put in the code and if you put in the correct code it plays whatever message you want  And of course you could have multiple codes and multiple messages  But on the inside it's all powered by an arduino. This one happens to be a pro mini. It's very similar to the nano  So it's uh, you know again very cheap three or four bucks on on ebay  You can get these things and a sound module that when you get the correct code in it triggers the sound to play  Um, and that's it and you could easily modify this  Uh that little sound module there again, it's probably about five bucks on ebay and it stores  I think about two megabytes worth of  Sound files and you can trigger those either through a serial  Command back to that module or you can trigger it just by shorting a pin to ground  And it'll play the first or second or third sound that's loaded on the uh on the board  And then the case was uh, you know, just a project case that we had I milled out  Some little mounts for it and a hole for the led and all that  Really simple project to do. Um, and uh, it works quite nicely nice hand work there carol merrill. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's right. Well, I had to be vanna

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You could also use this instead of uh, you know sending that signal to play a sound on that  On that little board I showed you could also use this to do we trigger your uh thermonuclear war  Oh, okay. Well, that's actually the the advanced version of this will be in the white house in case  Trump ever gets elected  Just to trick him from mr. Trump. I haven't given you the code yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hang around a little bit

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, but you could use this you could modify this really easily and put a servo instead of the mp3 player board  I showed and you could have like a little electronic latch so you could make your own  Uh combination lock for a box or for something or make something for the kids where they  Have to know the secret code in order to get into their toy box or something like that. I like it  Yeah, so there's a lot of really cool it's like a starter project  But there's lots of really cool applications you can take it to next levels if you want to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, uh, have you posted the plans anywhere or did you find them anywhere? Where do we not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not yet. I just made it up but i'll i'll put  A few if you're interested in doing it yourself  Reach out on twitter and i'll send you a link to to some instructions on how you can do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Aaron nukem, what's your twitter handle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Uh, erin nukem. Oh, that's easy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  At erin nukem, yeah, you know jeff jarvis who's in mexico city i meant to uh  Meant to ask you give you a chance if you want  um hillary clinton's campaign has released her  Uh kind of policy paper for technology and I was very impressed

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I know you're uh, i haven't read it. I haven't read it yet. Yeah, i'm a clinton supporter

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not ready yet. I'm eager to yeah. I mean the problem of course I have is that it's easy to say anything  um, but um  It's what you do in office, but but but as since nobody's in office yet, we have to decide  um from what they say they're going to do and this is pretty impressive including  Uh, I think an understanding obviously she's got staffers who have a deep understanding of what some of the issues  Are she wants to invest in computer science and stem education provide every student in america an opportunity to learn  computer science train up to 50 000 computer science teachers in the next  A decade build a human talent pipeline for 21st century jobs is kind of what you were talking about stacy  Uh open the higher education job trading landscape reboot job training around industry needs and job credentials  A lot of this is aimed at by the way silicon valley and concern silicon valley has about a a workforce that is not  sufficient to provide the brains they need  diversify the tech workforce increase access to capital for growth-oriented small businesses and startups with a focus on minority  women's and women and young entrepreneurs  Uh to first student loans to help young entrepreneurs attract and retain top talent from around the world  uh, and I think she also talks about closing the digital divide in terms of  bandwidth  Uh and providing um, something i've said for a long time  Uh internet access as we had in the past provided electricity  Uh to especially to rural areas through a government, uh, you know internetification, uh projects

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  reduce and now that go ahead I was going to say now that we have better technologies like the  FCC's 5g plan keep an eye on that because that's going to help us get gigabit wireless

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which will be way less costly to dig than fiber. She talks about that deploying 5g wireless and next generation wireless services  Connect more anchor institutions high-speed internet. I mean all of this. These are all the right words  Absolutely a fight for an open internet abroad

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go ahead jeff the other side is just gonna say the other side is just gonna say  I have the most I got a great plan technology. I have more technology than anybody i'm smarter

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Defending that neutrality improves the patent system to reward innovators  Uh reduce excessive patent litigation  Effective copyright policy and of course, there's going to be some ip stuff in here that some of us may not be thrilled about but  You know, uh some security stuff, you know anti-snowden stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're like literally at eye level like not even a mile away. Yeah, it's it's awesome  So we have a big party. Um, I would love to do this as my tip and show you so what i'm  What i'm doing is I set up the  Arlo the netgear arlo cameras because i'm doing a thing where i'm testing outdoor cameras  This one isn't set up obviously because it's still got the thing on  um  Now I will say that these just had a security issue. That was a big deal on reddit. That's not the one

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Those aren't the cameras where the guy  Sent it back and then the the next guy had it and he was able to watch the next guys  Through the camera. That's the one

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have they fixed that yet? So what the so here's here's the scapegoating that's happening there is they're like well  When when someone returns them the retailer is not supposed to sell them

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh put it back on the shelf that makes sense and that's what happened. They're supposed to send it back to neck here for reset

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, right  so i'm like  Uh, I want fewer chains. I want fewer like possible weak links in my chain that are fewer links in my be weak. Yeah  So, but I still like the camera mine are brand new from netgear so  Maybe you should buy them online. Yeah  These are this is actually so I my camera pack came with four of these in a base station  I don't really love that. They have a base station that I have to use a port for but I do like these cameras. This is maybe

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe 1.2 pounds probably i'm trying to see have you used the drop cams or as they call them nest cams now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do they have used the drop cams? How do they compare?  um  The drop kit this is so wow. Here's what's key. This is wireless  And this is indoor and outdoor. Yeah, these are to me a totally different use. Yeah drop cams can't be used outdoors  They can't be used outdoors and they're wired  so  It comes with this magnetic mount. I actually just  Stuck I have silver railings and I just stuck these on the railings and they've so far been up through a rainstorm  And some decent winds wow  outside  The magnetic mount comes with like a little keyhole thing in the back  So you could just stick it we're going to stick a nail in one of the trees and just bunk it on there  For the other side of the house and here's what the camera looks like so you guys can see  Um, I don't love the app. I'm going to be honest here. I'm  Let's see. Is it too bright for y'all still? Yeah, it's too bright. Hold on. Yeah  I

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's get my text out of the way. Oh, let me set up the camera so you can see  um  And it's  It takes a minute for it to like load. It's got motion sensing all that other good stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So here is it's still loading. Do they need power or when you say wireless do they not need they're battery powered?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the bottom camera's working this one's still trying to load so they're battery powered their battery powered nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um, and presumably they'll last what a month two months. I mean they're not on all the time, right?  That's why it's starting up because it has to come. Yeah. Yeah press live  That camera failed to work. Well, press it again. Maybe I am but that's how that's how these battery cameras work

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They can't stay on all the time. Otherwise, they die very quickly, but they do have a motion sensor. So there's there. Oh, there you go

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  nice  Wow, you're gonna have a good view of the fireworks. That's that's why we have the party

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was actually looking for I shared it with kevin  I was looking for a place to like show it publicly like to share that camera publicly during the fireworks because I thought yeah  Super fun. You should but

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't if you want stream it to us and we'll show it. There you go. We got more bandwidth than god now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Indeed. Yeah, I think date for that. Yeah, so  I I like these  Um so far i'm actually going to be testing a bunch of these out over the next couple of months because i'm in the market for  This and I get a lot of questions about outdoor kind of capable security cameras. This is a huge category  Yeah, it is. Yeah, and I put them on the roof because during our party  We often get kids trying to climb those railings and it's a tall drop if they go over so i'd like to be able to see

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I ordered a and it still hasn't come yet and I ordered it a long time ago a weather station that has a built-in cam  Huh? And then it uh, it makes it public  It makes it public  Uh, and it makes a time lapse of your locale  Public  So that's so you can I can go see my neighborhood. I can go see downtown new york  the name of that is  While i'm trying to find the name of that have you used the eroe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wi-fi devices yet. I'm on them now  I actually bought them for my house. I like them. They're so expensive  So, yeah the luma's out and then there's a new system called plum that's coming out i'm waiting for my luma's I pre-ordered the luma's  Check out plum. That's a really interesting model. They're they're actually just the radios and instead of uh,  Processor on the on the box. It's actually all in the cloud. So the eroe is like 500 bucks for three units

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  400 bucks for the luma and the plum is how much?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh less I would guess it's well, it's a different thing and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So but the theory the theory of all of these is is they make it easier to do wi-fi extenders, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um, so they're not wi-fi extenders. There's actually they're actually a wi-fi mesh. It's a mesh. It's not plum plume. Oh, yeah  Yeah, yeah  Forgive me plum is a light switch. That's a wi-fi light switch. The iot is getting to you now

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's too much iot  That is true  So i've been I I had i've actually had two eroe. This is my third era  The first one I got was paired to somebody else and you have to get the person who originally used it to deactivate it  Kind of like that camera  Yes, but that was a review unit and they obviously set it to a some other journalist first  So the second unit I got I never got it to work  I I had to put all three units in the same room, which doesn't really create much of a mesh  But I I thought but they said please try one more time  We must have given you a bad unit. So I tried one more time and you know what? Wow  It really does work  Yeah, I don't know if it's worth 500  But we have a very challenging house  and it and lisa  Who drives me crazy all the time saying the internet doesn't work god damn it. I thought you were the tech guy  She's nicer about it, but that's the that's what I hear. She goes honey the internet's down and I hear  I thought you were the tech guy

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have that voice too. She's happy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She's the first time I've ever seen you say wow, it's been working everywhere super fast  So i'm i'm now gonna revise my opinion of the euro. I was wondering if you tried it. So you like you're on it  I'm on it. And incidentally normally on wi-fi. Are you you're not on wi-fi though. I am on wi-fi leo  Okay, well karsten will vouch for we don't let people use wi-fi because it's so terrible  I wasn't going to tell you  Well, but you can

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because this works great you haven't had a single dropout it does now I will say here's the caveats my eros  Are on a lan so each arrow is plugged into the lan  If you have your eros  Doing okay, there's words for this and i'm gonna mess them up

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mine are not on a lamb. I have a base unit and then I have extenders for every hop  You're gonna lose a little bit of yeah, but that's the way it is in life

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's not like an extender

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For every hop you take in life, you lose a little capacity that that is true. Yes. Wait, is that shots or hops?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But anyway, these these are working really well so each one of them is plugged into the wired internet  Yeah, because I built my house in 2013. So you have it nice. Yeah  But they're still meshing they are still meshing. Um, and  All of the new mesh routers are going to work pretty much the same is kind of my understanding  The plume is a little bit different. Yeah, but we can go into that if you want to try those

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We'll get reviews as you try the various things  I have the luma on order as well, but I was very i'm very pleased that the euro worked so well  this by the way is the bloom sky is the  I'm gonna put this on my roof. It's the camera with a weather station  So you can see people's time lapses and they have an app  So you can see people's time lapses if they if you share them  Can you get the temperature data? Yeah, it's a little weather station that also streams  And you don't need to have  The weather station to use the app  But I ordered the weather station so that I could be we're gonna I want to put this on the new studio on the roof of the new  studio  So you can see what the weather is the runtime battery?  Uh, that's a good question. I guess it does. How does it do it?  How do it work?  I don't see it. Oh, no, there's a little power line power over ethernet. Maybe oh no  See that that's a solar panel. Oh, there you go  Solar baby

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's super efficient solar baby  Isn't that you see your ring doorbell added a solar panel. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know  What do you think the rate is? Is that what you're saying? Yeah, is it like tipping at 20% or 15?  Well, you just try it and let me know  I was gonna say  I think what it does is gives you a choice  oh  But this is cool, isn't it? And and by the way, he's really into  Yeah, this is like a react.js site. So he's really into all the kind of stuff  So as you hover the mouse around things happen and  It's kind of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Uh, you know, I forgot about a skew for example, if you do, okay google and then say a skew  It gives you the definition for a skew but as it does it it turns your web page slightly sideways
