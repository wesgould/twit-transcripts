No, it's not all about Google. It's about everything and anything that Jeff Jarvis and Gina Tripani want to talk about.  And it's particularly Google, the cloud, that kind of thing.  Gina Tripani is here, founding editor of SmarterWear.  I'm sorry, she's always been the founder and editor of SmarterWear.org, but also of Lifehacker.  And the author of Think Up Hygiene.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hi, good to be here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We have decided on a new feature for Gina. She's going to do the Italian recipe of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, OK, that works.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  There we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

And joining us, and we always welcome him, Danny Sullivan of Search Engine Land.  And you now have a whole bunch of lands.  He's land rich.  And one of the land marketing land, too.  Good to have you, Danny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thanks for having me back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One of the most astute observers of the Google sphere and this space in general.  So, golly, where to begin?  There's so much to talk about this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The president is doing an Ask Me Anything on Reddit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just had to say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go to Reddit.  It's reddit.com slash r slash I AMA.  And right at the top there, you should see President Obama's Ask Me Anything.  OK, just had to get that out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How many questions did we get to before the birth certificate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's so silly.  I love this because it's, you know, you have to, when you do an Ask Me Anything, you have to say, I am and Ask Me Anything.  And he says, I am Barack Obama, President of the United States, AMA.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He actually doesn't start till 1 30 Pacific, 4 30 Eastern Time.  And then he says, proof, it's me.  And he quotes his Twitter.  Isn't that funny?  That's what you're supposed to do.  And then he says, yes, that's I'll be taking your questions online.  So that is pretty cool.  Yeah.  And it's a verified account.  So we know it is the president.  Make that happen?  I wonder.  Who is his team?  I'm sure there's a team working with him.  They're very, very savvy.  Oh, there he is typing on a Mac, although they've obscured the Apple.  Look what they did there, except they made a mistake.  He's got a magic mouse.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What did they do to the Apple?  Can you zoom in on whatever that thing is?  Is it an Obama logo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It actually looks like it's just a oh, yeah, that's it.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not fooling anyone.  I think Apple might sue the president.  Oh, and look what happened to Reddit.  As soon as we said that, Reddit is under heavy load right now.  Sorry.  All right.  Now, as long as you've got my screen up, keep it up because I want to go to Google.com and  note that things have changed a little bit on the formerly clean, simple Google homepage.  I'm counting, let's see, an ad for the Nexus 7 right there, the bounced up.  Another ad here for discover a faster way to browse the web, install Google Chrome.  And now it's telling me somebody's birthday.  That's the part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's great.  The birthday crap is going to.  Where do you draw the line?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where's Marissa Meyer when we need her?  Marissa Meyer is trending in her new Yahoo office.  Oh my goodness.  So, this is coming from Google+.  These birthdays are people.  I don't actually know who this is that I'm supposed to say happy birthday to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don Draper, it looks like.  Don Dodge.  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Don is a Google executor.  Very strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think what you're seeing, though, is the coming Yahoo, Yahoo-ization of Google.  Oh, God.  Don't say that.  Oh, but it will.  Here's what's going to happen.  This is my prediction.  So, you know, Yahoo makes a ton of money off of their homepage.  Right.  So many people go to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google has traditionally, what was it they said?  Millions of dollars a day that they're foregoing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think that's going to stop happening.  Now, the ad that you see for the Nexus 7, we've had ads like that kind of thing, maybe  not with a little pop-up, but they have over time done little lines underneath it like  that.  So, it's not even like you can write the headline.  Like, for the first time, Google does an ad.  But the pop-up is a little more.  They've never sold it, though.  I know the pop-up is a bit different.  But I think actually the more significant thing is what's going to happen with the birthdays.  I think what's going to happen is in a year from now, you're going to log into Google  Plus because we will all have accounts at that point.  And Google is going to show you a different homepage.  You're going to go to Google to do a search, the Google homepage, and they're going to  say that, hey, because you're on Google Plus, we've now put the best of Google Plus into  the Google homepage.  And you'll get things like not just a little birthday notification, but maybe what's hot  on Google Plus.  And slowly and gradually, but what will happen is the Google homepage will turn into being  this portal page.  They'll be able to have ads out there.  They'll be able to promote Google Plus out there.  But they'll say that they're only doing it for people with Google Plus accounts so that  the classic Google homepage will remain the way it is.  And they can still kind of say, well, no, it's still all clean.  It's still all new.  Not anything different.  But yet they'll tap into this huge amount of inventory that they pretty much haven't  been able to use.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Didn't they just kill that with what's called, what was the homepage they killed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  iGoogle.  Exactly.  Exactly.  They killed iGoogle, right?  Good way to get rid of it because nobody really kind of used it.  You never necessarily got forced into it.  It wasn't really growing.  But this will be what will come down the line.  This will be the iGoogleization of the Google homepage or the Google Plusification of the  Google homepage.  That's really the better thing that's going to happen is that I think you're going to  see Google Plus start to move out and take over that homepage so that when you go to  Google.com and you are logged in, it's not just going to be a search box.  It's going to be here's what's hot on Google Plus.  And that'll be another way of them to help promote the Google Plus social network too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what happened because Google has chewed this for so long and turned down millions  and millions of dollars.  What happened to Google that they changed their tune?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They want to make more money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but they could have made more money any time in the last eight years.  Why all of a sudden?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not for them to do it.  Now it's like who are they having to compete against to be a portal like that?  AOL?  Yahoo?  I mean, now that they haven't necessarily done it, but now that you've had a lot of  these things sort of go away and you're looking at the landscape, what are they competing  with?  They're competing with people who are going into things like Facebook and starting their  day at a Facebook by seeing everything that's showing up.  All right.  Well, that's what Google Plus is in part supposed to do for them.  But if you're trying to entice more people into it who aren't necessarily going there,  you start leveraging your homepage.  I think that they, I think what happens in their minds is that they look at these different  things very individually.  That they'll say, well, we're putting this stuff out on the Google homepage because it's  in the benefit of the user and we're showing more stuff for them.  That's going to help with discovery and that's going to help with all sorts of stuff.  And they don't tend to look back on it like, wait a minute, didn't we say we were never  going to do this and there were reasons why we were never going to do this?  And, you know, to be fair, sometimes reasons do change.  But that's why I think you see this sort of thing happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then the chat room is saying reasonably, well, who cares?  Because nobody uses the Google homepage.  We all use the browser search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I was just going to say, I mean, the entry point to Google search isn't, you know,  I think that the homepage is on decline, not because they're adding crap to it, but because  people don't use it as much.  I mean, there are so many other entry points in a Google search.  And if you look at what Google is doing with Google now, that's them trying to anticipate  what is relevant to you right now.  What do you want to know?  So you want to know if it's one of your friend's birthdays.  I also agree that that's just not something I want on my Google.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you can control it in the Google now and you can say, I don't want to see that card  again.  I actually love Google now.  I don't know why that's different from my mind than the Google homepage.  That's a really good point.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Google now is a totally new product and you expect that it's trying to anticipate  what you're going to ask for.  I think that's kind of I mean, these things are all sort of merging into Google's just  like Jeff talked about, you know, for 160 episodes, you know, they want to they want  to divine your intent.  Right.  And they want to use all the signals they can.  And so now they have this whole social graph, right, through Google+.  So they want to, you know, show you stuff that they think you're going to want to know.  And of course, well, the next seven advertisement is just them trying to, you know, tweak sales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They want to sell it while they can before Amazon comes out with its new Kindle and Apple  comes out with its iPad Mini.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  One is that Google has still not sold its homepage.  That would be a huge Rubicon to pass.  That's a good point.  This is all Google stuff.  It's Google stuff.  And they're promoting their stuff.  They get crap from Google stuff.  Oh, earthquakes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you just have an earthquake, Danny?  I'm having an earthquake.  Where are you located?  Newport Beach.  That was definitely a quake.  You felt it pretty strongly?  Yeah, you guys go on.  We're having swarms down here.  Gina, you should feel it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.  I'm looking at my hanging plant that hasn't moved.  I'm not feeling it here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm checking my sling.  Because you had some strong ones the other day.  There may be my imagination.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Anyway, go ahead.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's look at the real-time earthquake map.  What was the king and the earth moved for me?  The earth moved under his feet.  The real-time earthquake map is not showing anything right now.  There was a big cluster in your area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They've been having a lot out in Brawley.  Brawley, that's where it is.  Here we are, 2057.  No, that's too later.  Anyway, I'll hang in there.  It might have been just my imagination.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't it funny if you start having earthquakes?  People are wondering what we're talking about.  But if you start having earthquakes in your area, you feel them then all the time.  Phantom earthquake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's like a phantom phone buzz, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can we just talk about the phantom phone buzz?  I thought I was the only one afflicted by that.  I get it all the time.  Now I hear that this is actually a thing.  So I feel like I have my phone in my pocket and I feel like it's buzzing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When I don't have it in my pocket, that's why I know I'm nutty, I feel the buzz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, well then we know it's not real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You people are crazy.  You've never felt that?  I don't.  I'm having aversion to voice calls.  So no, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just a buzz.  It could be anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So like a notification.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I kind of have an aversion to those too.  But yeah, no, I'm not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Others in our chat rooms say they are feeling the phantom vibration.  And Chad, you feel it too.  Isn't this funny?  We are all subject to this and nobody really knew it until somebody said it.  And then now we go, oh yeah, I got that.  Well, I mean, I got that.  Yeah, we talked about that way.  Oh, we have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, me and my friends, I remember before I moved out to California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Your Belinda.  There we go.  It is in your Belinda.  All right.  Oh yeah, here it is.  Five kilometers south of Brawley.  Boy, there's a big, big cluster.  Yeah, four ones, you'd feel that.  So it's not a phantom buzz.  It's the real deal.  I thought I was getting earthquakes all the time and then I realized that it was my dryer

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that was in the house.  Was that the note you couldn't fit in your pocket or something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I tried.  Yeah.  I broke out the note because of course one of the stories will be the new note.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's so small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's so tiny.  How do you survive?  How do you live with such a small phone?  And we'll talk about the new note in a little bit.  Gosh, earthquakes, phantom vibrations in the Google homepage.  Time number one.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let me say this about the homepage.  I think I'll just go too far because that's what I do here.  I think all homepages die.  The notion of a homepage is there because you have to have one, like you have to have  cinder blocks under a house or something, but it's just not part of what you do.  It's happening with news sites like crazy.  No one goes to the homepage.  They're all coming in elsewhere or your real homepage is on Twitter and Facebook, etc.  All these companies spend all this effort going to homepages if anybody comes to them  as a destination, including media.  The New York Times, they do, but otherwise, no, they don't.  So I think the homepage is absolutely meaningless and Google in that sense is far ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that I know that we all will use Chrome and we'll search with it and we'll go with  it, but there are lots of people going to the Google homepage still.  There must be.  If they weren't, they wouldn't be bothering doing this sort of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it depends on the page.  I go to the homepage at TechMeme every day.  That's a homepage.  But of course, it links deep into the page that I should be.  So I don't go to the Verge homepage.  I go to TechMeme's homepage and that links deep into the Verge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was talking with somebody I work with today and he said it well.  If you think about a site, not as a site, but as an API, which Dave Weiner is talking  about.  That's RSS.  It's a stream, it's a river, it's a hooks into something.  Then yeah, you may have a page and it's your page and it's the one you go to, but your  page is like no one else's.  That's where iGoogle was starting to go.  That goes back to what Denny was saying.  So maybe the new experience you have with Google is indeed Google Plus.  By the way, yeah, you have a search box there too.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, there you go.  There's not that much more to say about the new Google homepage except that it is the  new Google homepage.  It's theirs to mess with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just a bit, I was pulling up some things here.  They have promoted as far back as like 2005 different things.  They promoted Firefox.  Right.  I remember that.  They promoted Google Pack.  Everybody remember Google Pack?  Oh yeah, Google Pack.  Google Pack, Google video content from NBA and CBS.  They promoted DaVinci Code contest that they had going on up there.  The G1 when it came out was promoted there.  The Nexus won.  The Droid was promoted on the page as well.  So they've promoted lots of things that are there.  That Meyer quote, when she said there will never be banner ads on the Google homepage,  this is in 2007, there will never be crazy flashy graphical dude ads flying and popping  up all over the Google ever.  It's 2012.  We've moved on.  It was a long time ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And remember we were all playing Pac-Man and the Google doodle.  Yeah.  And no one was complaining about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was fun.  It wasn't an ad.  That's why.  I should do an ad right now.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No, I'm a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No ads.  I'm going to...  No ads today.  Throwing out the ads.  No, don't throw out the ads.  No, I don't know actually.  I don't have the right clipboard.  That would be bad news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a very bad news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google has once again disclosed all the people they gave money to in the Oracle Google suit,  including I'm sad to say the guy at Foss Patents.  He was being paid by Google or Oracle.  I can't remember.  Oracle.  Yeah.  And I still like Foss Patents.  But it's just kind of depressing when you find out, oh...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But a lot of them were...  That was the point is Google at first said, well, nobody.  And so then they came back and they said, okay, well, this person who's an employee  of ours did talk about this case.  And this person, like Lauren Weinstein, we've done things with him in the past and he using  his free speech has talked about the case.  There was no one for one that said Google paid anybody to talk about the case, was there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, here's the one that...  Stanford professor who apparently is oft quoted without saying he's getting money from Google.  Then Google says, well, he's our outside counsel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's sort of like a contractor?  That's a question of disclosure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And part of this is because Google initially told the court in the Oracle trial that it  hadn't paid anyone to comment on the case.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But parts that exactly that says that we paid you to write about the case.  Right.  Unless I'm wrong and I read it very quickly.  I didn't see a case of that.  They saw, okay, all right, if you insist, here's people who've read about the case with  whom we have a business relationship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it really, it doesn't come down to...  In my opinion, it doesn't come down to Google.  It comes down to Florian Miller at Foss Pattens or Mark Lemley when they blog about the case  to say, oh, by the way, I'm outside counsel for Google or oh, by the way...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, you know, Karis Wisher was very good about that, including her personal relationships.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  In fact, if you go to all things D, you almost can't avoid the ethics disclosures.  They're big fat links.  Pop-ups sometimes.  So I don't know what to say about this.  It did seem like it was a little indirect.  It wasn't like, here's some money, go say nice things about us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So dumb question.  Don't lawyers pay experts to testify?  Yes.  Like to offer their opinion in cases all the time?  Yes.  But that's generally the law firm pays?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's understood that if you're coming on to testify, you're a paid expert.  In fact, I think they often, and if they don't, the opposing counsel will say, well, you're  a paid expert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You'll be declared a paid expert.  I've done those sorts of cases in legal things before.  It's not hidden.  Yeah, they know.  In this case, the court was really trying to understand experts that might be speaking  about the case and writing about the case that were paid that were not providing legal  testimony so they wouldn't have been declared.  The key difference seems to be, if I understood the case with false patents, is that he was  actually hired to do consulting for Oracle on it and was writing to, whereas I don't  think from what I understood, the outside counsel was hired just specifically for that  case.  I could be wrong on that as well.  I guess we have more clarity as to what we didn't have before on both sides of it.  It was kind of late coming into the case to ask for all that, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it was like when it was over.  Basically.  Can somebody get my...  I must have some commercials today.  I do.  Okay.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Please, God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Please, from your lips to God's ear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm going to have to start paying you for the pleasure of being here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do have one.  Thank you.  No, I have two.  That's wonderful.  Why don't we do one now?  That way we will pay some bills.  This is not exactly on our homepage.  Actually, it is.  Come to think of it, on our homepage.  You are our homepage.  If you go to twit.tv, I do believe there is, in fact, a display ad.  We were talking about the value or non-value of display ads on Sunday.  It was actually a great conversation.  Adam Curry said, look, there is a picture of you and Gina on our front page.  Aww.  Aww.  You are kind of obscured, Gina.  I apologize.  It's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I guess you took your lighting down too much, Gina.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  And I pulled the blinds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Our show brought to you today by our folks at Citrix, our good friends at Citrix, who  do a fabulous remote access app.  If you are in enterprise, you probably know the name Citrix because they are the most  famous remote access company in the world.  They pretty much invented the business many moons ago.  Microsoft licensed Citrix software for their remote desktop.  Citrix makes very easy to use remote access product called Go to My PC, which is misnamed  because it works for both PCs and Macs.  In fact, if you are about to head out of town, this would be a good time to install Go to  My PC on your office computer because then as you hit the road, you can access that office  computer anywhere.  You can either log on to any computer or your iPhone, iPad, and Android tablet and access  your office computer.  That is pretty amazing.  When you're looking at your office computer on a tablet and you're doing everything you  could do at work.  You can run any program, send and receive email, access any network resource.  That is the coolest thing ever.  I want you to try it free right now.  Visit the Go to My PC website.  Click the Try It Free button.  The promo code is TWIT.  We want you to use that just so that Jeff and Gina get credit.  Full credit.  The promo code is TWIG.  I think you will be very happy.  Easy to install.  You don't need the IT department.  You do not need to open up ports in your router or anything like that.  It uses a very sophisticated NAT traversal technology.  See, it looks nice on your tablet there.  Nexus 7 looks beautiful.  Go to MyPC.com.  Use the offer code TWIG.  Google Crisis Map for Hurricane Isaac.  I guess it's been downgraded to a tropical storm.  But Google has done, as they have done in the past, they've done websites part of their  Google Crisis response.  In fact, it's Google.org, which is interesting, slash Crisis Map.  And boy, it's really cool what they do here.  I think I first became aware of this during the Haiti earthquake.  So you can click on Active Shelters, New Orleans Levee System, evacuation information, user  generated content.  You want to see YouTube videos?  There they are.  Isn't that cool?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Compare this with a news article.  I know.  Right?  It's just so much more informative.  It has so much more stuff.  And it's embeddable and open.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's amazing.  I just really love what they've...  Here's the USS Alabama Battleship Park webcam.  So you can see the webcam and see the storm coming in.  They've got the path of the storm.  This is really, really, really amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've gotten really good at this.  I mean, even over the course of just doing the show for what, two years or three years?  We've seen Google get so good at being able to come up with these single serving sites  crises that are just beautiful visualizations and informative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  If you're an information junkie, we live in wonderful times.  Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think Google's relationship to the news industry is what I always think about, of  course.  But I think that becomes really important because they just become a supplier of raw  information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, they charge people, though.  I saw I was watching CNN and they had it said, big letters, Google Map.  I'm sure they're paying for that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know.  I think so.  I don't know.  I think it was before use on the web, but I think the promotion is valuable, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but I think they actually pay for it.  So it's a revenue source as well.  Yeah.  Well, Google's killing the weather API, which is kind of interesting.  Instead, you're going to use Weather Underground, I guess.  That's too bad.  I actually use Google's Weather Service a lot, although I ended up using AccuWeather  on one of my widgets because it was more reliable.  So if you click, if you're using iGoogle and you click on the weather, you'll get Weather  Underground, not Google's API now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was that the only place that they were using it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, like I said, they had an API.  So I had a widget, my beautiful weather widget.  Oh, like on your Android phone?  On my Android phone.  And you had a choice in the weather widget, whether you use Google for your weather information  or AccuWeather.  I always ended up choosing AccuWeather because they didn't match.  Maybe Google didn't have the, I don't know, maybe they didn't have the best weather.  Let me see if it's still here.  Widget settings, weather, weather.  Oh, I don't know.  Maybe it's, I'm looking at the wrong place.  Weather settings.  Here it is.  Weather service.  Choose between AccuWeather and Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that was the API.  But I always chose AccuWeather anyway.  The API apparently has been quietly closed down by Google.  So if you query the weather API, you'll get an error message.  We're sorry, but your computer network, your computer or network may be sending automated  queries to protect our users.  We can't process your request right now.  See Google help for a nice Python script.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I got a question for you, Danny, since you cover Google so magnificently.  If that happened at a media company, then the people who did that product would be fired.  But I never hear that coming out of Google.  And I sense it's because people, when they start at Google, don't go to a particular  job.  They come to Google, then get placed.  And if their job goes away, then they get placed somewhere else.  Has this led to any displacement of people's losing jobs?  Well, here's one.  Currently in .NET.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Currently in .NET.  This is the website.  If you go to CurrentlyIn .NET, which I guess was a website where you could say, what's  the temperature currently in, currently down, Google has shut down its undocumented weather  API.  Undocumented, that's a key word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's interesting.  Like, I didn't know that there was a weather API.  And apparently this was a private API.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, then they can't be held responsible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of all bets are off at that point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  To be honest, I didn't even realize they were running weather APIs.  I didn't think it was that much of a deal.  In terms of them, you know, you mean if they shut down a product, Jeff, do people get fired?  Right.  Or do they just find another home for them?  Yeah, Google Wave.  People don't get fired from Google.  They just move on to other things.  They go to Facebook.  Yeah, because Google doesn't seem to find a reason to kind of want them to stick around.  There's any number of Googlers that left to go to some other company and it was a big  splash and then it was, aha, see, Google is losing people.  Part of this story in that is also that Google might not have minded losing them.  Because when Google does mind losing people, sometimes it really pulls out all the stops  and it tries to keep them.  I think the Google Wave folks were a good example of that.  Yeah, we put every single thing.  There was nothing they could not put behind Google Wave.  I think it would be hard to argue they didn't get behind that in a big way.  The product really didn't take off and at that point it was like, well, we don't really  have anything else to go here.  Nobody got fired, that I heard of, or you know, there's always talent that's going on  there but you just may not feel like you need to go out of your way to retain that talent  and go further with it from that.  Marissa is probably the best example of this now, right?  Here she is running Yahoo.  She was a talent and sometimes people can talk about and have some debates on her management  style and was she credited with doing all the things or she wasn't credited doing it  or whatever.  But the bottom line is there was nothing left at Google to retain her.  She's gone off somewhere else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You'd expect that in a business, right?  If somebody doesn't have a place to go, they let them go or they disappear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You'd expect that but then you'd also get an impression that Google fought that hard  to try to retain her.  There was this shift that went around where she seemed to be moved off into the local  product.  They still had other people doing local products or whatever.  Again, there's been some debate on whether or not she was sort of sidelined or whatnot  with it from there.  I think that on both sides the departure has been very positive.  Nobody has been saying any negative things about each other on either side of it.  There's a big argument that it's hard to figure out what you do with someone like that  who really probably sees their next challenge running a company like Yahoo rather than running  yet another division of Google.  But there still isn't that sort of retention because imagine that other Google execs that  might be around that are actually very powerful that have been put in a position of power  suddenly decided that, well, you know, I want to go off and do something else.  I think there'd be much more stops that would be pulled out with it from there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't sound like a counter.  No, no, no, no.  I'm just looking for the next story.  Let's talk about the Galaxy Note.  Samsung had a big event this morning at IFA, which is a big trade show in Berlin.  I'm not sure what IFA stands for.  International Phone.  Funkacunck.  It's German.  It's German.  Yeah.  And the Samsung Mobile Unpacked event.  They announced quite a few things.  There were live blogs.  There's a guy doing card tricks.  Something you won't see in an Apple keynote, I don't think.  International Funkhausstellung.  It's the Funkhausstellung.  There you go.  Funk is distance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it's basically communications, but it's another word for it.  And Ausstellung is a conference, a display of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, I'm sad I didn't go because the event opened with Vim Venders, one of my favorite  film directors, who for some reason unaccountably has been appearing in teaser videos for the  Galaxy Note.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because as you walk by Berlin and you see these things, you need a way to note it, create.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Das Kind was, das Kind was, or whatever it is.  He was the director of Wings of Desire, which was a beautiful movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You'd be happy to know, by the way, Google Translate translates International Funkhausstellung  into IFA.  You were talking about IFA.  I kid you not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's exactly what it translates into.  So I guess Vim Venders, as you write, Jeff, been doing drawings, a five-day effort to  recreate Berlin in drawings on the Note.  One of the things that I liked about the Note is they've always really focused on not business  but creativity.  When they introduced the Note originally at CES last year, they had artists, they had  ateliers all over Las Vegas with people doing sketches on the Note, which I thought was  cool.  And I really liked the Note.  It was my phone of choice for some time until the S3 came out.  The new Note is kind of a merger of the S3 and the original Galaxy Note, 1280 by 720,  which is not a very high DPI.  I mean, it's the same as actually as the S3, but on a five and a half inch screen.  They are using now a non-pentile Super AMOLED display.  So that's a good thing, but it's still a Super AMOLED.  It has a quad-core 1.6 gigahertz Exynos processor, which makes it, as far as I know, the fastest  phone out there, and a 3100 milliamp hour battery, which is also the fattest battery  in a phone.  So I will order one as soon as it's available.  They didn't say when it would be available, but the thinking is perhaps...  Well, it's going to be sold in Europe first.  In Europe, as they did with the Note originally and the Galaxy S3 originally.  Let me ask you again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that means that when you get it, you won't be 4G or super speed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, this one, I think you might be 4G, but the frequencies would be wrong, because they  do say this is a 4G.  That's what I'm saying.  So you can't really get 4G.  Right.  You'll be getting HSPA plus on T-Mobile or AT&T.  I don't care about that that much.  I can't get 4G.  I'm in Petaluma.  I got nothing.  I got nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jelly bean.  That's great.  Jelly bean, which is a little bit of a surprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We didn't expect that.  Or at least some of the rumors were there would still be ice cream sandwich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder if the trial affected that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what?  I bet it did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I bet it will come without some of the Samsung stuff, right, Gina?  Yeah, that's what I'm wondering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If it's pure jelly bean or if Samsung...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It said TouchWiz, and I'm looking at it, and that looks like TouchWiz on there.  In fact, it is definitely.  TouchWiz is weird because it puts the apps icon on the right instead of in the middle,  as every other phone does.  To color back, they're going to have the S Pen, and it does new things.  It has a hover mode.  Look at that, though.  That is thin and light, and it looks a lot like a Galaxy S3 with an engorged screen.  I will be getting one.  I really like the Note.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was out today on the streets of New York and put this in my back pocket looking incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, this is a good compromise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's the diagonal pocket protector.  I love having this with me, but it is just a hair too big to carry around credibly,  and being able to carry that around, I think it may be a magic size.  I like the Note.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Two gigs of RAM as opposed to the gig of RAM in the original Note, and I think in the S3.  That's a lot of RAM.  I don't know if Jelly Bean requires it or what.  It's available in 260 partners in 128 countries in October,  and then somewhat later in the US, just as the S3 was.  That's interesting.  Samsung is maybe back on its heels a little bit after the Apple-Samsung decision.  I guess we should talk about that.  I feel like I've talked about it.  I bet you talked out about it.  I bet you have.  It happened on Friday, and I immediately ran it.  We did not expect it.  We thought, oh, it'll be later this week.  I thought it'd be after Twig this week.  How could a jury possibly rule on something after three weeks of testimony,  109 pages of jury instructions, 33 questions, 20-page verdict form?  Couldn't possibly decide that in three days.  They did, and came back.  And now that we've heard from the jury, they apparently didn't understand the case at all.  But that's okay, because I think in hindsight, they probably made the right decision.  They said they were most influenced by the emails from the Samsung executives  when the iPhone came out saying, there's a crisis in design.  We've got to respond to this.  They said that to them was evidence, proof positive,  that Samsung set out to copy the iPhone.  And it's true that the earliest Samsung phones looked an awful lot like the iPhone.  And I think that's what swayed them.  They were not ruling on newer phones like the Galaxy S3 or the Galaxy Note.  They were ruling on patents that were affecting,  the most recent phone in effect was the Galaxy S2.  The judge will decide on December 6th,  she's going to have another hearing on whether some of those phones  That's unknown.  She also has the right to triple the damages,  because the jury ruled that the infringement was willful.  $1.05 billion in damages, the judge could make that $3 billion plus.  And finally, and I think maybe under reported,  the jury decided that none of the tablets violated Apple patents,  only the phones.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Any thoughts, anybody?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Danny, what do you think?  I'm sure you've also talked out on this subject.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, the past stuff largely I just had left to others.  It got into so many different nuances and these different debates.  I think the big takeaway from this was really the Google response  that came back saying, you know, this isn't going to go to core Android.  I think some people have taken this like, aha, now Android's dead.  And no, it's not necessarily dead.  This seems to be going to certain design aspects of the icons,  certain design aspects in terms of whether you do the pinch-to-the-punch  or you're going to do the pinch-to-zoom, that sort of stuff.  And, you know, it looks like these are things that you can work around.  And in fact, some people are working around it.  One of the crazy things I found with the S3 that I've been testing  is that they've got all this touch with stuff.  And if I throw my phone in the air and clap three times,  it'll send a message for me to where as if I bounce it twice on my desk.  They've got all these new gesture things in there that almost feel like  they're trying to come up with gestures  that anybody else might have.  I don't know, I tend to strip a lot of this stuff off anyway  and just use it straight.  So I think the Android operating system is going to continue on.  I think this will be more of a road bump or a speed bump to it.  I'm sure Samsung would be a heck of a lot happier  if they didn't have all the jokes about,  well, I guess you just copied Apple coming off to them.  But it's not going to be this sort of big reversal, I don't think.  I think it's also interesting that for all the upset that Apple had with it,  these things seem to be relatively minor  as to why people would have actually picked a Samsung phone over an iPhone.  I just haven't seen anything in general people saying,  oh, thank goodness it had pinched the Zoom, that's what made me pick.  When I talk to people about why,  why do you have that phone?  Why do you have this phone?  And it's like, it was small.  It was big.  It was cheap.  I was with my carrier.  It was like the things that had nothing to do with the things  that you would expect them to go for the iPhone.  It just amazes me sometimes  because I find the iPhone to be a really, really great experience.  To me, the biggest downside to it  tends to be that it doesn't have LTE.  So when I see people,  and I say that as somebody who uses an Android phone on a regular basis,  and I still, when I go back to the iPhone,  I kind of almost breathe a sigh of relief  because a lot of it feels very intuitive, very elegant, very clean,  and I'm not having to struggle with it.  But there's more to people making their choices  than just beyond, hey, it's an awesome iPhone,  that's why I'm going for it.  Not everybody agrees with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You guys buy, I think Mike Elgin repeated a lot of these posts on Google+,  the idea that overhearing people saying,  well, gee, if they're the same,  I should have spent a lot less on Android.  I thought that was funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought that was really anecdotal though.  It was a fascinating post where it was Mike or somebody  who was saying, I was in a Starbucks  and I heard four different people come in  and they all were talking about the news  and it was exactly the same.  I paid how much for this computer or whatever,  but there's more to the gadgets,  especially with the Apple devices,  I think what's happening is that  they've built up this entire ecosystem  of my phone can talk to my computer,  that can talk to the iCloud,  which can talk to my Apple TV.  I'm buying all my content through it,  I'm locking it in there,  now I've got 2,000 music songs that I bought  that are all in the cloud.  I think that's going to be much more important  as to why you're going to stay  with a particular device than another device.  That's also why I think the Nexus 7  was such an important thing for Google  because it really should have been called  the Google Play in some ways  because it really crystallized  what they did with Google Play,  which was to say,  we don't have an Android market anymore,  we have this thing called Google Play  and it's where you buy content for Google  and it's where you can get your movies  and all your stuff or whatever  and it's not an Android specific type of thing  and that's sort of our iTunes that comes with it  and the Nexus 7 itself  really crystallized that I think  when you turn that thing on  and it's like your content is the main screen  and it just really highlights  that one of the focuses in these devices  isn't just what they necessarily do  in terms of can I bounce back  or can I pinch the zoom  but where can I get my content  streaming to them through it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think consumers are smarter  both simultaneously smarter and dumber  than we think.  I think they know the difference.  They completely know the difference  and a lot of the things we care a lot about  they couldn't care less about  and they have simpler reasons.  What do you think about the decision  Jeff Jarvis, Samsung versus Apple?  I was just disappointed in the war

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  where we find ourselves  I think Samsung's response  that gee it's amazing that you can  own rectangles with rounded edges  I think we've lost the sense  of the definition of innovation  and you know is design innovation  well sure Apple has proved that often times  but I think that we're protecting  the wrong things  and we talked last week about copyright  and I argued that it should change  to a notion of protecting credit  that's easier to think of in text and ideas.  You know the bigger question to me  and I don't know what to think about this  I honestly don't  are we past the idea of ideas  as property and ownership?  What would the world look like  if we didn't have that doctrine?  I'm not sure I like that world  I'm not sure I want that world  I'm not necessarily advocating that  but it just  which is spur innovation  and get innovation made public and shared  it's doing the opposite

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but could this be good for Google though?  I mean could this decision  discourage manufacturers  from trying to make products that look  look I have to tell you  I kind of agree with the jury  I mean I didn't follow the trial very closely  the whole way  wow they're clearly just trying  to make a low end iPhone  that was my gut reaction to it  and I think Farhad Manju wrote a great piece  I love Farhad Manju  yeah I mean when the iPhone was a big hit  companies had three choices  do nothing, try to copy it  or try to invest the R&D  to make something more innovative  and now they're paying for it  and this decision was not about Android  it was about these particular Samsung products  and Google sees Jelly Bean  as kind of the solution to their  lawsuit problems  very much so  from iOS  and so in a way this kind of discourages  this may encourage more manufacturers  to stick either with the pure Google experience  or to make an experience that looks very different  I think that's a good thing  I want things that are different

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  no I agree  I think the jury  even though they did it for the wrong reasons  did the right thing  Samsung knew it  they thought the billion dollar fine  even if it's a three billion dollar fine  it gave them enough leverage in the market  they became the number two  and back down number one  smartphone company  and it's clear with things like the Note

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and the Galaxy S3

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  they're innovating  well that's a good question

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  why not sue Google  I read something like you can't really sue Google  because they didn't have a product

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they didn't make phones  you could sue them  but you wouldn't get any damages  because the damages are based on  commercial losses  they're not punitive  it's what did this cost in the marketplace  because they didn't sell anything  but I think that also it's clear

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  no

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I just fear what comes next

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  does Apple now emboldened  no I think they're exhausted  and I think I'm hoping

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that what will actually happen  is that everybody will come down to the table  okay we got we proved our point  now let's license  we're not going to ask  and everybody will sit down at the table  and we're just going to handle this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  yeah I'll take bounce back scrolling  I think that's the 3G patent

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and I think Samsung's taken that stuff out  Steve Gibson was pointing out  there's no bounce back scrolling in the Nexus 7  that's Apple's patent  they didn't put it in here

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it doesn't bounce back  is there tap zoom there is isn't there

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  certainly pinching  yeah that's an interesting point  the tap zoom is cool  of a website  let me do this in Chrome  you're looking at a small version of a website  I'm going to put some text here  let's do this  unfortunately all of this is already zoomed  go to a newspaper story  yeah you got to go to like CNN or something  NY Times  this is and this is the Nexus 7  of course so this is what  this is what Apple invented really was  we're going to render the whole page  and then you want to read this article  you double tap it  you see it doesn't zoom exactly like Apple did

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  right  that's not necessarily  it depends on what you're looking at  go to a particular article  if you double tap  it'll zoom into the whole article content  give it a second  just let it load

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  now tap on it  let's say I want to read this paragraph  on the iPhone Danny wouldn't  if I double tap that paragraph

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it'll bring the whole article up

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  double tap let me see what happens  it's like a dog  so it is in fact see  here so let's take this paragraph

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  yeah it did the full thing there

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  but just the squeeze that  I need to go back through  those were things that  I remember when the iPhone first came out  that were like wow  it's the first time I've ever seen this stuff  and those were the distinguishing points  I think the difficulty is  I think it's hard to say  should you be able to patent something like that  doesn't make sense  I don't know who invented the telephone keypad  that got us off of dialing  but at some point somebody said  hey why don't we do touch tones  and why don't we have a touch tone pad  and maybe we should patent that sort of thing  and then somebody else comes along  and may say right  well that's obvious you should have that  I'm going to make that too  and where do you go about  that idea actually does get paid for it  or does get to be able to license it or whatever  as opposed to somebody else  as opposed to somebody else saying  oh well I'll just make all the push buttons circular  and then now that's fine  or I'll

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Danny it's also about the norms that we use ourselves  so let's say that  who owns OK  we all know that means OK  if you're really dorky and old  nobody actually does it anymore

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  this is kind of old fashioned

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  so now hand gestures  that means something  that means something to your computer  not to a human  now we can own that  you know so obviously  turning the page  is that something you really own  yeah fine you enabled it  but you took a human behavior  that makes sense to humans  and you gave them that back

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and so it's obvious  to an expert in the arts  then it can't be patented

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  well that's what the argument was  in the case of Samsung

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it was about design  well OK design is another  you're right  design patents trade dress  that's a different issue  and that only comes down to  did Samsung try to confuse consumers  by making it look the same  but in terms of  what it stands today  and it won  Apple won based on the laws it stands today  should we change the law  absolutely 17 years for a software patent  what that's crazy  if you have software patents at all  but the law does say if it's obvious  it has to innovate  it has to be something clever and innovative

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that's what I'm saying  we've lowered the bar  of the definition of innovation so far  that we're rounded rectangles  and innovative  and innovative sorry  British influence  but  that's  so there is a matter of interpretation there  what does  so the law says be innovative  and how the judge and jury interprets  what is innovative  is something that is still on the horizon

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's true  but you know like Danny said earlier  I remember the earliest iPhone commercials  when they were showing full web pages  that was cool  I remember reacting to that  and being like oh that's  and I think that the most like innovative design  and successful designs  seems so obvious in retrospect  I mean certainly I wasn't designing touch screen  apps at the time  and I wonder if you would put  10 different touch screen designers in separate rooms  and said okay  what would happen on these different actions  or what actions would a user use  and I think that's many of the few of them  may come up with the same solutions  that Apple came up with  but you know even that bounce back scrolling  I was talking about this with my wife  she was like that just seems so obvious  and I was like well but not back in 2006  when you know these things

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that didn't exist  but here's another way to look at it  web 8791 who I'm sure is how all her friends know her  said innovation will cost you 30 bucks a piece  right because that's what Apple asked for  the opening bid was 30 bucks a piece  and you know you deserve to get paid  if you come up with that  okay I'll buy that  but is the market really better off  if every phone costs 30 dollars more  how does that serve

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  no only Apple is better off  but that's the only  that's the point of patent law  is that the inventor gets to benefit  reap the benefits of their invention

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  for a certain period of time  by the neck to do so  and the people who don't understand

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree that's the point of Fran licensing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  but then you invent  or you invent your own other juncture  or other way that you want to go  and figure out a way to do it  could be promoting innovation

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  by saying don't copy Apple  do it your own way  right which is fine  or you take something that becomes a standard  becomes a norm that we all take  and now you can't do that  you have to do this  if you use another device  because of the way the patent structure is set up  and that's the point of discussion  just as with copyright  we've struggled with  what does it mean to own a copy  and how does that work in a world  where copies are free to make  and so on and so forth  when it comes to patents  and we are as a discussion  but I don't think we're there yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  oh I think we are  and I think these big lawsuits  Oracle versus Google  and now Apple versus Samsung

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  well we may be but  I think everybody is  lawyers who are quite well off with this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  well yeah but I mean it's  Apple won this round  right they won this round  and it may be that down the line  they're not going to win this sort of thing  and they may have the same side of incentive  of saying right let's come up with our own  and all this other stuff  but you know if it really was the case of  hey we just wanted to pay $30 to do this or whatever  maybe you should have paid $30  that's an awful lot  what I find insane is when Google plunks down billions of dollars  from Motorola primarily because they want patents  or people with patent portfolios  are getting huge amounts of money  and it's just protection  it's like buying domain names  but worse

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  have you ever taken out a patent  no I haven't  probably

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  so did you did you did did you know  and now you're in a startup where  and so on and so forth  or I'd be a fool if I didn't or

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean I thought about in the context of doing this show  you know it's interesting I see sometimes  I see software developers kind of on their resume  you know list patents that they own as a as a as a as a good point  as a positive point I always  I'm kind of feeling ambivalent about it  I mean it's tough  look when you go into business right  you know I've never been in position  I've never worked for a company that asked that  Andy Andy Bayer wrote that great piece about how  when when his company was acquired by Yahoo  they encouraged  engineers to file patents  and so he did it because they got a little bonus  if they did and now that now his  patents are being used offensively  and he's upset that his name is on  is on these patents  and you know I think things like the Twitter's  IPA  that's something I would love  to use in in our company if we do go down  that the patent road  to do myself  I've never felt that compelled  to to to file a patent for my own work  just for myself

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and there's no point in filing a patent unless you're willing to go to court to defend it  and who wants to do that  right exactly unless you already have lawyers  you know on retainer by the bushel  yeah  I trademarked Twitter in the Twitter logo  because it seemed prudent but  then when I started pursuing people  I realized the cost of doing so  was so high  that it's not worth it  the cost in by the way  in not merely financial cost  but the cost in your reputation  this is this impacts the reputation of both Samsung and Apple  and that's hard to measure  when one doesn't know how that will play out  I think that in the long run  and say we don't want to do that anymore  in fact I think if Steve Jobs hadn't conceived of this in the first place  Apple might not have gone this far down this road  this is this may be Steve Jobs legacy  yeah  among some innovations Samsung talked about today at their mobile unpacked conference  they besides the Galaxy Note 2  a new Galaxy camera  Apple didn't have one of those  running on jelly beans  and they're going to be able to do that  and they're going to be able to do that  and they're going to be able to do that  and they're going to be able to do that  and they're going to be able to do that  and Samsung's kind of  dare I say patented  ginormous  4.8 inch HD LCD screen  that's an interesting product huh  Apple doesn't have one of those

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  was it the other camera with Android  was it Nikon

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  yeah Nikon also has an Android camera  but it was running gingerbread  this also has Wi-Fi and 3 and 4G  which is really interesting  and it doesn't have Siri  photo management  shot share remember that's the big thing they've been pushing with the Galaxy S3  and I like this if you have an S3  you can use a remote viewfinder  somebody else has the camera  I don't know why that's useful  but interesting

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  that's innovation

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Samsung innovates  I don't think there's any question about that  they also announced  and I think this is very interesting  a 4.8 inch  Windows 8 phone  the Samsung Ative  very much like the giant screen phones  that's  I'm sorry  this is the Windows RT tablet  they also are doing a Windows 8 phone  so this is the Ative Smartphone  it's a smart PC  running WinNT  or RT  Windows RT

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  very weird name  Ative

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ative  probably stands for something  they're going to do an Ative tablet  also Windows 8  and the Ative S  the Windows 8  device phone  the screen  2300mAh battery  8 megapixel camera

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  NFC

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  chic hairline design

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know what that is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so I think Samsung  this is the message from Samsung  okay Apple you got us on the fascinate the captivate  but we're way beyond that now

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  we're doing different stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  was there any mention of the suit?  I presume not  no joke or anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  no  not that I know of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well there are going to be appeals  it ain't over  far from it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  nobody's paying any money for a long long time  meanwhile a smartphone market is exploding internationally  this is an interesting article  from the Flurry blog  the countries with the greatest number of active iOS and Android devices  US of course number one with 165 million  then China 128 million  UK, South Korea, Japan  the fastest growing iOS and Android markets though  China, Chile, Brazil, Argentina, Iran  400% growth in China  countries with the highest penetration of smartphones  among adults  92% of Singaporeans use smartphones  87% in Hong Kong, 86% in Sweden  US is only 78%  that's higher than I would have thought though

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and the interesting thing about the US is  it's still holding that those numbers are higher in African American and Hispanic markets  it's a leapfrog situation  where those markets are ahead  in mobile and smartphone as a means of getting to the internet  which really is baffling media and other companies is what to do about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would love to see these numbers compared to computers usage  you know what I mean  many of these countries people are going directly to a smartphone  but in the US many households probably I would guess have big screen computers  Flurry says the rate of iOS and Android device adoption has surpassed that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  of any consumer technology in history  10 times faster than the 80's PC revolution  2 times faster than the internet  3 times faster than social network adoption

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  but cell phones per se does it say?  doesn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  cell phone market grew pretty fast  it was pretty fast

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  well cable I guess was slow from its beginning days

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  640 million iOS and Android devices in use last month  and now it's 1.5 billion  which is interesting because there's a billion users on Facebook  but then only half of them are real so I guess that makes sense  that was also an app  that was interesting was it?  yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  only like 150 of them are real

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Adam Curry that's what he said  yeah  the rest were on the moon  so any day now Facebook should hit 1 billion users even though

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  so let's talk about this for a second  because there's been as I was going through prepping for the show earlier today  and just did the Google news search on Facebook  it's you know one after another of people slamming Facebook  Mark Zuckerberg the company is worth a lot more if he leaves  Facebook is a disaster  a billion people are using it still  but this is why

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean if you have a billion users and you still can't figure out how to make money  but they are just not enough yet  and they have it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  well and less every quarter  well that's the  it's going the wrong way Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  got a good point there  the number of users is going this way  and the amount of money is going this way  that's kind of a mis-  I can see why the market might be a little antsy about the whole thing  they have to lick  you're probably good on this  they have to lick the mobile app problem right  that more and more people use Facebook  but they are all using it on mobile devices  which don't show ads

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  well they can easily insert the ads whenever they want to get around to it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's different though isn't it on mobile  we can ignore ads easily on the big screens  but on a-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  but yeah if you are going into your news feed  and they already are  and there they are  so you know that's  or you do other things if you want  you start transforming any links to an outbound site into an affiliate link  and then that turns it into some money  there's all sorts of things you can do  I just get the impression they haven't been bothered to get around to doing it  yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  there's no hurry is Mark Zuckerberg's attitude

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  well now there's probably more of a hurry  because they're not going to make all this growth that they thought they were going to be getting  but yeah I think they can solve those sorts of problems  if they want to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean it seems like there's so many opportunities for mobile for location based ads

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and there's no hurry  really is  they're making you know what is it a couple billion a year anyway and they're fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought it was interesting there was a survey where I think that people were saying they would spend like $10 a year to buy Facebook  and one of the things I wonder is if we'll get down the line where you not buy Facebook but buy you know to buy an ad free Facebook  but it would be interesting to see what happened if Facebook said hey you know you're welcome to use the website for free  if you want the app it's going to cost you $10  and whether people might say you know it's valuable enough I do want to pay for it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  doesn't even have to be $10 what if it's $5 or $3 for the mobile app  or $1

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you say that but I mean people spend $1 on the stupidest games  that's not the point

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  what's the essence of the business Danny  if the essence of the business in the long run is that Facebook knows more about you than anybody else  and Facebook can then when it finally gets smart advertisers can target wisely  the question is not people will pay for it the question is where will they make more money  and that's the issue constantly with media is that well people should pay because they used to pay  that's not the point it's completely beside the point  the point is where do you best put your resources and effort and where are you going to make the most money  and I don't think Facebook is ever going to make the most money by charging for itself

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  no I think that you have to go through that kind of balancing act  I think they could also do things though if they wanted to where you get a Facebook premium app  and put any old thing in there and you're going to have people who decide they want to buy Facebook premium  and perhaps you even get surprised by what happens with it from there  you may have some people who really don't want the tracking  and decide okay you know you can pull the app net and flip it around and say hey  you don't want to be the product okay then pay $50 a year here you go

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  but you see the other thing is and I deal with this with my students  when you sell a product there is a customer acquisition cost  that in the case of subscription products is much greater than the revenue you get in the first year to three years  because you don't really make it up unless people continue on  and so it's a huge investment to charge for a product  the New York Times spent $30 million to build its meter and then $13 million to operate it in the first year  most of that is marketing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  if you take Apple for example I mean I've got iCloud and it was free right  but I needed more storage they already made the investment to give me a certain amount of it  I shelled out the $25 on two different accounts for myself and for my wife just because I needed more storage  it was easier to do it wasn't going to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  yeah and that's fine that's fine but that's not the essence of Apple

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's saying okay you've got a hundred million photos that are up there  do you want to keep them there do you want to keep this stuff going or do you want to have these additional things  this is what what it's going to cost you I guess I could just see them doing that sort of stuff  I agree with you I don't think that's their big priority I think it's even lower priority than what we do about any more mobile ads that are out there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Force Square is doing an incredible job of mobile  I mean I'm pretty I don't click on ads I generally don't interact with ads I use Force Square  Force Square has this American Express I have made so much money on that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have too and it makes a great kaching sound

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's awesome it's an awesome user experience it feels good you feel like you're saving money I mean you have to wait a minute

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  how can they be making money if they're giving me five bucks back  it's only once they only give it to you once no they don't I've twice now I've gone to the same Chinese restaurant  and I paid with and I and I consciously pulled out my American Express card because of that deal you have to check in  and then you have to hook up your card with Force Square and then it goes kaching and I get five bucks back I had $15 meal I paid 10 bucks for it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll have to check on it again because I signed up for it I did it twice and then it was like I didn't get it for the second time  I was like what I went through all this hassle to sign up to get five dollars what

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've done it a few times I think I've done it like four or five times I mean it's setting up linking your card I was sort of wary  and I wasn't sure but I was like all right let me try it but once you do that once you get through the setup you just say like  claim this on my card and then it gets

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  pretty much every restaurant in Petaluma is doing this I have saved so much money but I don't think there's a business model  was American Express giving them five bucks who's making money on this

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I had entirely stopped using my American Express card they did foreign exchange things I couldn't stand it they didn't count as you know members since 1970 whatever  they didn't give it rats rump I completely stopped and I used my United Airlines card well you know I went to the US Open and  spent 25 bucks here which is easy to do you know it's like a hot dog and we'll give you 10 bucks back  so it brings me back in the fold which goes back to the point about customer acquisition and retention costs it's a marketing cost  it's all it is it's making us talk about it right now you're talking about your friends people are using it so who pays it American Express?  I think in great measure yes I'm sure there's a there's a there's a joint deal that goes across there's value here for the restaurant there's value for  Foursquare there's value for American Express how that's divvied up I have no idea and full disclosure is I'm working with Foursquare for one of the  companies I work with and you're right they're very smart and doing wonderful things but they're just at the beginning stage so at this point they learn  plus the other value that comes out of this we talked about this last week with Square is the more they know about your transactions and can tie it to you  and where you are and all this other data one of the key things about Foursquare when a media company ties up with Foursquare is that they and if the user  only if the user hooks together the the sign-ins right so so the user is saying it's okay for you to know who I am then the media company knows more about that user  and where they go and what they want and so on then they have ever known ever that data if they can figure out this is the heart of the four of the of the Facebook problem  if they can figure out how to use that data and exploit it to economic benefit while still benefiting the customer then that is what Foursquare is doing  that's where the value is that's where the value of credit card companies is going to be and where Square is going to be and that's what Foursquare can help bring about

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's a it's a huge promotion and it when I discovered it I just used my I've been using it like crazy yeah it's five bucks I don't doesn't cost me anything I guess probably Foursquare makes 50 cents or something right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  American Express is probably paying I basically never do things like that I'm not me neither I rarely interacted things like that and that I just I just happen to happen a lot and it's really well done  and I'll go I'll eat in a restaurant if I see the special I'm much more likely to go eat there because I like the idea that I can check in and that's you know going to get get a deal  if that's something I would have been doing it otherwise and I just thought it was a really good example of mobile advertising monetization yeah that is really interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  American Express could have spent 20 million dollars on a commercial right instead they divvy up that five dollars at a time right in happy user experiences that also bring them back benefit in terms of the relationship  with the platform Foursquare and with their merchants because the merchant says hey man people are using their American Express cards this is great right and they learn more about you you take the marketing money and put it here  that's the future of Facebook if they can friggin figure it out you replace marketing with relationships that's you've just you've just made my argument for me thank you I haven't been able to make it  the Foursquare MX deal is a perfect example of that where it's marketing dollars so you look at this basically they were paying five bucks before for you to watch commercials why don't they pay five bucks for you to get you know low main and be a happy customer and they know more about you and they've done all these wonderful things so much better

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I must debunk an error I made remember when we talked about this incredible discovery of new Egyptian pyramids in Google Earth  it was my error I put it in the rundown no no I love the story but unfortunately an Egyptologist reports that now we've known about those since 1925 they're not pyramids they're mounds nothing to see here  we appreciate the fact checking yeah yeah well we gotta we gotta correct it Paola Davoli an Egyptologist at the University of Salento in your homeland Gina says the features in Google images have been well known since 1925 when they were surveyed by G.K. and Thomas Thompson and E.W. Gardner  their natural mounds surrounded by a building and by Doug Wells for sure they are not pyramids we don't know what they're for aww

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  while we're talking about corrections last week we talked about the Twitter API 1.1 changes and I gave Twitter a very large benefit of the doubt and since that episode Twitter cut off access to Tumblr to the social graph you can no longer find your friends on Twitter  they had done this once before with Instagram but it was kind of easy to write that off because you're like well Instagram's owned by Facebook and there's a little rivalry no no they cut off Tumblr they didn't really have a good reason why that wasn't covered in the 1.1 API changes but I just wanted everyone to be clear that I think it's totally crappy and I'm really disappointed and I'm no longer going to give Twitter as much of the benefit of the doubt as I did last week when we talked about it  it doesn't even make sense frankly it doesn't it does not and Jeff's rant last week about how this is our data I was feeling the outrage I had the Jarvis outrage going on I was like this is my friends list that I put together on Twitter and I should be able to export it anywhere to any third party app that I want or to you know CSV or whatever and it really bugged me that they cut Tumblr off

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  you might want to take something for that feeling when it comes on Gina I don't know what to tell you it's not a good thing  a meatball

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you've got to be careful here

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I generally don't exist in a state of outrage it just exhausts me so I have to save it for the really really angry angering things and that got me so I think that really sucks

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's kind of a bummer isn't it  yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it's also it goes back to the Samsung Apple discussion it's it's we're living in and then this is this is business and I know it's business is naive to think otherwise but I think a lot of us have kind of a sesame Street view that Sandhill Road is sesame Street and that and the long where we all want to work together and we're all creating such neat stuff and isn't this wonderful and it's it's just about wrong to think that there's a lot more anger going on and fighting and things

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  no everybody's all anxious and upset

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the Facebook stuff is really I mean the Twitter stuff is really confusing because it just hasn't really felt very Twitter like I mean I could see you wanting to I could see you wanting to like say okay Instagram you're part of Facebook and we're not kind of getting along with Facebook right now and I don't know what the status of Facebook shifting data back into Twitter is I know that Facebook hasn't allowed Google to pull data so you could see no loss between the two of those but you know what  what what happened what's going on with Tumblr why would they become enemies and was not even making any money you can't get angry and David Carpenter great guy and I don't get it  well you know unless somebody is about to acquire Tumblr and and it's not going to be Twitter or or there's some other things that are going on they're going with it but to to what Gina was talking about I had done this thing earlier this year when the whole fight was going on about what Google could or couldn't get from Facebook  and could or couldn't get from Twitter and what Twitter was saying you ought to be doing this is back when the whole Google plus thing was going on and Facebook and Twitter were like well you know you're you're favoring Google plus more than you favoring us and Twitter and Google was like well yeah well we can't get half your data so if you want to start giving it some of this data and then we'll talk yeah what I what I did is I wrote this thing called a proposal for social media to taunt but in part of it it had in part of it you can look it up but part of it had this thing called a  search engine land that looked at this where it looked like that was opening up the other thing was that our profiles ourselves what we do who were you know we're with or whatever that that sort of metadata that should be able to be included and this goes to what you said Gina you know your friends are yours they're my friends and I should be able to take those friends anywhere I want and I mean not like the way Facebook does it where okay here's a list of names you've ever done it on Facebook you go oh I export my friends is like well here you are here's 1200 names you know it's  like to get to take them with my my Twitter URLs or all that other stuff and and what I said was what is proprietary to the social network what is your most valuable data is your social shares in your social actions the inner relationships that we have on your social network between the people we know there that's yours okay we don't need to take that stuff out there that's that's that's your secret sauce that's your type of thing you know you want to do that but the raw ingredients I should be able to take out they don't they don't belong to you they belong to me the user

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  we need data liberation for third-party data liberation you know you know what I mean so tools that and I'm sort of waiting for these two and I'm a bill I'm to some extent I'm building one tools that that help you extract your data from these networks and maybe you know import it into other I mean it gets it gets complicated because there aren't standards for formats and that kind of thing everybody you know that the companies that do offer data liberation or export do it in different formats Facebook gives you a zip of HTML files and and you know Twitter gives you Jason or XML whatever  but I think that this is going to become you know a bigger issue and when the tumbler thing happened I thought hmm like who's gonna set up I think Marc Jacob from WordPress said this you know who's gonna set up the pirate export my my friends sites that then you know feed into tumbler you know using the different API is kind of that third party app that's gonna plug them into one another but yeah there's a big need for this but who enforces this like you know is this a third party organization that's gonna enforce this are we gonna come up with principles rules and then different

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  social networks you know either meet them or they don't so I think the big you gotta get I think I gotta get angry Gina you gotta get mad you know and make barricades I think the users I think the users could get mad but I think the big three and I would count as the big three being Facebook Google and Twitter have all been interrelated Lee angry at each other that at this point they sound hypocritical not to support this stuff it was funny when Facebook  and Twitter came out with their don't be evil tool to show what Google could have gotten off the pool the public web that they wanted to put stuff into their Google plus boxes for Facebook and Twitter and yet Twitter looks stupid in the sense that you guys cut off access to Google to call your stuff and to this day we still cannot use Google if we want to to find stuff as well as we can on Twitter you Twitter don't even have a database that goes back past seven days finding my own tweets it's painful I have to go over to topsy which is great they  have been the anointed alternative Google and it's great for tops here whatever but I'd rather search on Google just the tool I want to use and I can't do it because you don't want to have a deal with them because we don't know we don't know what it is we don't know if they didn't want to pay you enough or you thought it was too competitive or whatever the deal was we don't necessarily know from Google all we know is you two couldn't make a deal over the ability for Google to index stuff that belongs to us and so we're mad as hell we're not gonna take it anymore right but so then when you a year later come around and say well Google  is not being fair to us it's like well what's your problem or when Facebook gets upset and they're like well Google isn't indexing out of our stuff it's like okay we wanted to take our stuff out of Facebook and bring it over to Google and you wouldn't let us do it but but we could do it for Yahoo what what's the point I mean you're you're just so I think there's enough hypocrisy all around for the pressure to go on to them to say you need to stop fighting amongst yourselves you need to pull it together really

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  optimistically not optimistic well it's funny because Twitter wants it both ways because there's a court battle going on right now in New York State the New York the Twitter's have filed an appeal to the New York Supreme Court saying our users own their tweets and and that Twitter says that the users have a property right to the content they post and a fourth amendment privacy right to their accounts deleted tweets are not public and Twitter  should have the same protection as personal email accounts all of which is God's work and I'm this is this is where this is what can be better that's why I love Twitter but should the judge said by design Twitter has an open method of communication and so this is really kind of an interesting battle in which Twitter I think you're right is on the side of the angels is trying to protect us but it's just I guess it's good when it's convenient for them we own our tweets when it's convenient for them they own the tweets just depends I wouldn't have been that cynical I am  that cynical now I wouldn't have been that cynical a few weeks ago yeah I would have still wondered where the real Twitter is I'm just starting to see in the dark side in early in 2012 prosecutors asked Twitter for information about a protester during the Occupy Wall Street protest last year Malcolm Harris Twitter told Harris about the subpoena he filed a motion to quash the court denied Harris motion and told Twitter to comply in May Twitter filed a motion to oppose that order in June the court denied

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Twitter's motion and now in August Twitter is appealing and filed the court said in part that the things that are made public are in fact public public is public for and I I agree with that it's been public and even if you kill it somebody recorded it somewhere tough right but what the court what they're also going for is more information than that they're going for identity they're going for when and where it happened they're going for other data that isn't public and so Twitter is indeed with the right thing but well I kind of like this because maybe we

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  can kind of use it on Twitter here right and say ah you're right you're right we do own it it is ours right so give it to us or don't count on Twitter fighting for you for much again yeah I'd be that might be that might be gone Google this just in Google is apparently tapping Barclays Bank to seek buyers for Motorola's set top box business Google of course makes no sense to me well we had some question about what with  what were they going to do the Google makes kind of big set top boxes Google TV the but apparently doesn't want that it just wanted the smartphone business both were part of motor road mobility which Google bought they say it's worth about two billion dollars all right well it's a nice bit of money you can pull back in what they sure Motorola again 12 right 612 yeah pull in two billion you've still got all the patents that you wanted you perhaps even keep some of the patents that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  were associated with it because you saw it you get a cross licensing type of thing but I mean set top boxes I think it's a business the future of your set top boxes in Apple TV or or maybe a Nexus Q if they ever fix it right they're saying it's a dead business I think okay I got it I got it so they will be the set up by business but not this not this way they want to be able to disrupt that business I don't know we're gonna take a break come back with your tools and tips and number

Transcript:  The week Microsoft sky drive which I admit I haven't used I signed up for a long time ago but it's seven gigabytes of free cloud storage similar product to Dropbox or Google Drive.  But a little more space I think that they're kind of competing on how much space they give you so you get seven gigs their Android app is now available just became available this week the iOS app the Windows mobile app had been out for a while so sky drive app for Android.  Pretty pretty simple for now you can upload multiple photos you can open documents it's got.  Very jelly beanie oh can you hear me still you're back okay good that's available for free in the in the Google Play store now and like I said I have I haven't been using sky drive but it's seven gigabytes of storage cloud storage so you know hey why not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I looked at it in a while check it out it's good for people using Windows and Mac and Mac and Android actually sky drive is this kind of unknown and good deal it's a really it really is pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is I mean they offer more yeah more storage than Dropbox and Google Drive and quite a few of the others.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis has several numbers to choose from what do you want to pick pick a few.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We could do Zuckerberg meets the oldest Facebook user Florence that Laura who's 101 years old but that's the number 101 we could do 18 million which is how much the Winklevah have paid for a brand new home in the Hollywood Hills but I won't do that because Citrix is involved.  In a study looking at the percentages of people who are confused about the cloud and is it a hundreds.  Well you know this is what 51% of respondents believe that stormy weather can interfere with cloud computing of course it can 51%.  A majority of respondents which is not a majority 29% also think that the cloud is an actual cloud I'm guessing that's what.  I'm hoping that's a punch line it's like those those ways that say you know that 98% of Americans think Obama is an alien you know yeah it's how you ask the question exactly.  I'm sorry found the 54% of respondents claimed to never use the cloud in their everyday lives but in fact 95% actually use something powered by the cloud of course and the majority.  40% majority but I think I mean morality of respondents see the major advantage of the cloud being able to work at home in the nude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Come on this is from the onion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is the click on the link there it's it's web pro news and it's a company doing something for Citrix and I think with some humor involved I think so Wakefield research.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They did survey 1000 Americans.  They found them in bars yeah what's the cloud it's a little floaty thing up there looks like a goose.  My tool of the week is who I just like the name.  Yeah you like that I like the name who used to be jive but who has so much better it is the first Android app free for app net.  And we talked with Dalton Caldwell of app net.  It's a paid kind of answer to Twitter response to Twitter it's not a Twitter clone but the idea of app net is that it's uses open API's pub sub hub hub and things like that to to make it possible for everybody to participate and you have to pay though 50 bucks a year to be a participant.  Who looks strangely like I don't know kind of as a Google plus feel to it but I like it and it's very easy to use and I who had just a moment ago and we've been looking for a new term now you can't say tweet on that net so I think we might all who.  You who or did you hot hot and then I who.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just are P do our P is the new thing.  I'm not the new thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Our P is the R T for app net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The R T is that that now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I don't know what to think about app net but at least you know what's amazing is the developer community has just lept on it and there's hundreds of claims seems like maybe dozens of clients and this is the first day you know kind of Android standalone client and it doesn't feel like it this point six zero point six but doesn't feel alpha feels very.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They have but you know I got to say there was little thing that was coming up this week where I can't remember who was saying it was like you know developers made Twitter developer Twitter and I just sort of like thought you know I know users made Twitter right and they still make Twitter and developers can make it easy but if you hadn't developed a single thing for Twitter and it was still a website there might have been people who still would have taken it up into some other area and maybe they would have just built their own ecosystem so I don't mean to come down on developers but as an actual just tech user type of person.  Or whatever my world's not revolving around the development space.  Well you got to have users and so you want to and that goes to app that it's you know it's great every developer out there that wants to spend the hundred dollars or two hundred dollars or thousand dollars whatever it was to get on there was you know you can go on it but I don't need an app dot net so developers have a better place to develop.  I need an app dot net because it's a better place for me to do the things that I cannot do as well on other services which this is aimed at Twitter obviously so if you've got something that's better for me then Twitter has great right now you don't got anything that's better than me the Twitter I can't shorten URLs I can't share photos it's not a very pleasant experience but you know I'll keep playing with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like it it's nice smart people in there that's why I use it but you're right it doesn't have critical mass by any means so it's not you can't like if I wanted to know if somebody died I can't go to app dot net I have to go to Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah I mean one of the main premises is that developers made Twitter and I and I even though I am a developer and I develop on Twitter I don't know that I completely agree with that you need to you need to build a product for users first right a platform becomes compelling when there are users.  Right so but you know listen when we had we had Dalton he did a great interview here and he said hey you know do you remember what the Twitter home page look when it looked like when they first launched I mean he made the point that Twitter you know no one used Twitter and everyone made fun of what Twitter was in the very beginning to and look what happened so you know who knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is Reddit still down let me just check the president was doing an AMA on Redditor maybe he was oh it's back up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He wrapped it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  13,340 questions he answered nine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's devolved into an analysis of his grammatical skills as well.  Oh that's of course it's Reddit what did you expect.  And failed to use an asteroid instead of said a asteroid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh and it crashed again.  Oh dear.  The Reddit fail hammer.  Danny Sullivan so great to have you search engine land calm marketing land calm.  Thank you.  Great sites.  I have one tip to say oh I didn't ask you you could do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Interesting item I worked one up.  Okay.  It's on the home page of search engine and it's on the Google inside search blog as well but you know Neil Armstrong died this this weekend which was really sad and it really brought back a lot of memories that they had.  It brought back a lot of memories I think of the whole Apollo missions and I think that got Google thinking and they went through and they looked at all the computing power used to make the Apollo missions possible from the whole period of the time that they had Apollo going on.  You know all the power that they had on the rockets all the power they had a mission control and everything and they said that all that power that they have is equal to the amount of power that now gets consumed when you do one single search on Google.  So you know and Google does 100 billion searches per month so it's like they're launching 100 billion Apollo's without the actual hardware of course we can send people to the moon we can find Britney Spears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's exactly what I can you get me nude pictures of Britney Spears.  It's like all that computing power being used that we could search for Rebecca back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel good about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a sign of how cheap computing power is apparently now.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So yeah I mean the Apollo guidance computer ran at 40 kilohertz.  They had five IBM Model 360 mainframe computers.  They weren't really much faster.  They were calculating liftoff data and orbits monitoring biomedical data during the mission.  Basically your phone has more computing power than any of this stuff all of this stuff put together it's kind of amazing.  That's wild.  That's a Peter Norvig post.  Yeah.  Yep.  Love it.  Thank you Danny.  Really a pleasure.  Thanks for having me.  Appreciate it.  Jeff Jarvis the author of What Would Google Do.  His new book is Public Parts.
