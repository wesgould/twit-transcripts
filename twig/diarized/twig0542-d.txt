Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hello y'all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's getting Seattle snowpocalypse right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I am.  It's crazy.  I've never seen this before in my life.  Really?  You've never had snow?  Oh, well I've had snow.  I mean I lived in New York, but it was in the city so we didn't have like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it was gray.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, it was gross.  And how's your daughter?  Your daughter definitely hasn't ever seen snow, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, they built a snow fort.  She and my husband built a snow fort this morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dorks.  That's so cute when they come in and the tips of their fingers are black and falling off.  I just love that.  Hey, that's Aunt Proett who doesn't know from snow and never will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I know snow and I hate snow.  Yeah.  I was the weird kid.  My mom would tell us to go out and play and I'd say, Ma, no, that stuff's cold.  Wait a minute.  You didn't have snow in South Carolina.  Oh yeah.  We get snow every February.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Up in the mountains?  Yeah, we're in the foothills.  We're in the foothills.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We get snow every year.  Usually January, February.  I think of it as the South.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think of it as getting cold enough to have snow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We get all the seasons unlike you Northern California folks here.  No, we don't get seasons.  We get seasonal suggestions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am wearing a scarf though in Stacey's honor.  Oh, it's a nice scarf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Isn't it?  I like a scarf.  You look so regal, sir.  I'm wearing a scarf myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's down in the...  Now what about those people?  I see these people in New York.  It's a cold day today, right?  It was like 38 degrees.  They're walking around in t-shirts.  And I see the occasional bozo in a suit with just a scarf like that's going to keep warm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does.  That's what I'm doing.  I'm the bozo in the scarf.  All you have to really do is keep this part right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That does help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It does help, but you still need more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wish I had my Yale scarf because it was long.  You could wrap it all the way around your head.  Did you have a crimson scarf, Karsten?  Of course.  Yeah, seven foot scarf.  Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  CES, the Consumer Electronic Chokes, if you're not supposed to call it that.  Was it worth the trip?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was outstanding.  It was really fun.  Totally worth it.  We worked our dairy air shoes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, it's kind of like when we hit, when we wrote the treatment for Ant and  Leo's excellent CES adventure, I had booked in for, I said, we will do 10 segments a day  for four days.  We will have 40 segments plus three half hour shows.  We got 38 segments.  We'd have had more if they chopped some of them up.  Like there was one segment was all robots.  There were like six things in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We worked and I think it came out quite nicely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't see you, Stacey.  I looked for you.  I saw Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know.  I'm sorry.  I was only there for two days.  Like I left Wednesday night.  You don't need to apologize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm just, I'm sad I wanted to see you, but did you have fun?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We wanted to take you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And we were trying to figure out a time to do like the SANS with you, but we didn't even  get to the SANS until Wednesday afternoon.  So SANS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sounds about right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I am not going to the Las Vegas Convention Center again.  All the cool stuff from the show is at the SANS, I thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, the good IoT.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I love the, I love the, the, the central hall cause that's all the TVs.  You saw some nice 8K TVs, didn't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay.  Like I care about that.  I can't, 8K TV to me is just like a greater number of flaws that I can see.  I'm just like, ah, stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wash your mouth out.  Yeah.  It's not my business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got to see the Joker on 8K if you really want to have fun.  Yes.  Give me all the pixels.  All the pixels.  Well, you wrote the article on stacey on iot.com.  I went to CES and had four epiphanies.  I could, I only could eat about three.  So I was impressed that you could eat all four.  What were your epiphanies?  Oh man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's see.  I'm like clicking on this story.  Like I can see, like I can click here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you were at CES and not overwhelmed by the array of products in front of you, I'm  impressed, she writes.  Every year I come back feeling like I only saw a tenth of the things.  If you saw a tenth of the things you were doing really well, there were 4,500 booths,  each with many things.  So if you saw a tenth of the things, you would have seen hundreds, maybe five or six hundred  things.  You didn't see that many even.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I feel like we saw about 400.  So I've got it now.  So one was, and I did a panel.  So my first epiphany came from this panel and the AARP booth, which was actually really  cool.  I had thought, when I think of technology for seniors, I think of health related stuff.  Most of us probably do our fall detection.  And there was so much stuff on VR and AR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The other big story, because hearing aids are going over the counter this year, there  were a lot of companies like Phonak and showing over the counter hearing things, not just  hearing aids, not just audio, but sensors of all kinds.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can stick a lot of really interesting sensors in the ear.  I think I wrote about that a couple of years ago for IEEE.  But yeah, you can get galvanic skin response.  You can get steps.  You can get heart rate.  I thought it was interesting that you thought that us olds wanted VR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was surprised that you thought that was a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I don't know if it's a good thing, but I'm glad that they're doing things with it.  And I will say I talked to somebody from Johns Hopkins also and a doctor from Humana talking  about VR and not just for like travel, although people apparently like that, but telemedicine.  So there was a lot of interesting VR for doctors visits.  Yes, we're getting back to the medicalization, but it also kind of provides a social outlet.  I don't know.  I mean, again, I don't know.  I'm such a hermit.  I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I do know, for instance, my mom who's 86 loves technology.  She loves her iPad.  She loves her iPhone.  She's an artist.  So like Aunt, she likes to draw.  She likes to use the pencil and draw on the iPad.  For her, technology is a way to stay in touch.  She doesn't get out much, but she can stay in touch with me.  We do FaceTime all the time.  I completely get what they're saying about seniors in technology.  I think there is a lot to be said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There is some kind of age to my father.  I can't get my father on a smartphone.  He just beyond him.  But my wife's late mother, it was how they stayed in touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is just another way of being inclusive, if you will, today's technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think that if a parent isn't, I'm a Windows 10 person, if an older person, if  you just get them like a Nest Hub Max or an Echo Show, the device with the camera and  the screen.  When we first got the show, I would set it up in the kitchen while I'm cooking and my  mom would be on it.  And for her, it felt like she was sitting with us while we were cooking.  There's things like that where it's not for her, it wasn't complicated.  She just says, call, you know, call Leo and it rings me.  It's not like they're sitting down coding.  I don't know if she'd be in the VR, though.  I don't know if I can get her into augmented or virtual reality.  I guess if she felt like she was sitting in the kitchen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My mom liked VR.  She actually enjoyed.  It's kind of like just we used to have one of those view finders when I was a little  kid.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  View master.  Yeah, view master.  She loved all the remember when they were making all this content like of different  places.  She loved all that.  She would sit there and like swivel her head around and look up and down.  And she thought it was super fun.  So I honestly I think it just depends on the person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  Oh, it does.  Last week we have a new feature on the show.  You don't know about a Seinfeld episode in every show.  So here it goes.  I think I mentioned this one last week already, though, when I got my mother a Kindle years  back.  Yeah, it was there was reaction was like Jerry's parents when he got them the fruit of the  month club.  Why are you getting me all this fruit?  Who could use all this fruit?  Why would anybody?  That same reaction.  Why would you do this to me?  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, we can't do that.  It's your Seinfeld theme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're going to play that.  I could play a little bass, a little slap bass.  Don't show the screen so they don't know where it came from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, no.  YouTube is going to slap us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just can't play the Jeopardy theme.  Now, that's that's right out.  That's I know Alex Trebek is going to come down hard right out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just got a little gadget.  Yeah, what did you get?  What is it?  The O2 ring.  It's an oximeter.  It's to check your oxygen.  It's this little thing you put on your thumb at night and checks your oxygen all night  to see because the doctor says I have sleep apnea.  But the device that you wear for this thing, it's like this.  The huge thing on your head and things going all around and oxygen is coming in.  You need the better.  Right. And it's got you got to sleep and supposedly you're sleeping  and it's testing your sleep.  You can't sleep with this crap.  You need the better. Look at this.  Get the better.  No, I got to get. And I saw this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is just in fact, Michael loves this.  Michael Sargent uses this.  It is basically a sleep study in a little thing that glues to your forehead.  You look like a dork, but and I mean, I didn't say that today.  But it's not going up your nose or anything.  And it does do all of those same measurements.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It does. Or or in a couple of months, you can get the why things scan watch.  Now, this was very annoying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who was going crazy about this on Twitter?  This is Mr. Heiner.  Jason Heiner loved this thing.  In fact, I want to buy this because it's got E.K.G.s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's got a fib detection.  It's got sleep apnea or oximeter.  Oximeter. Yep.  Oximeter. It's it's amazing.  So check this out.  It's two hundred and forty nine dollars, two forty nine ninety nine,  I think, for the 38 millimeter and then three hundred or two  ninety nine for the 42 millimeter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And what's it is pretty.  What old people like you, Jeff, will like is  is that it's actually a wristwatch with hands and a second hand.  It's a physical watch with just a little.  I can read it. Yeah, I could see it's a real watch.  But it has a little screen on it.  So it does all the smartwatch stuff.  This is this is their previous version, but it looks just like this.  So it's a regular watch with a smartwatch screen, little screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The straps are nicer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, this is yeah, this is just looks like a classy watch. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is. I mean, it's a nice watch and it has its and it's medically.  It's FDA approved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is not like I want to get this.  Well, this is I wear an Apple watch, but I think in some ways  this is better, more functional, does more things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Carson, I just said, because I don't have Kevin, your email, I said,  Carson, I sent you the picture of me being embarrassed.  The device you have to wear for the sleep test.  Now you don't go to the lab anymore.  You do it at home, but it is such.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wore one the other night.  So I actually did a sleep study for sleep apnea as well a couple weeks ago.  And Jeff, I think you're making a little bit of a mountain out of a molehill.  Oh, it is a lot of stuff all night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The lady, the lady, it talks to you.  The lady wakes up and says, put the nose thing back in.  And then so the old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, Jeff, Jeff.  Oh, mine had it.  Mine had a slightly smaller head thing,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  but it had a strap around your heart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The guy I'm breaking bad who couldn't talk had to bring that bell.  You know,  this is the watch this when you prefer, Jeff, to wear.  This is the wife.  It's called the scan watch.  But you said it's not going to be out, Stacey, for a couple of months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's cute to coming soon.  I think they were saying Q2, which usually means the end of Q2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is the report I get from my thing.  Oh, that's tracks by the hour and tells you what.  So I had 97% average oxygen.  Oh, good. I had.  Let's see. Oh, I had 38 drops below more than 4%.  I guess that's the papnia.  I don't know. I don't know how to read this stuff.  That's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I can tell you because I read mine.  I had 32 and I was barely sleep apnea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, OK. So this is the highest I've had.  So, yeah, that's why I think that the the the the what?  What's the none of you is Jewish, I think.  The thing men wear on their forehead.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's the the the Tevye.  No, the what do you call it? I can't remember chat room.  But it's that thing. It doesn't work.  This this is kind of neat.  And I'm going to go to my doctor and say, OK, do you still say I haven't?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was able to speak with the Phillips folks  in Sands and to fill in.  They had the different sleep band or something like that.  I can't remember exactly what it was called, but I think it's called smart sleep.  Yep. Smart sleep, deep sleep, headband.  And they're updating their product.  I believe it is Q2.  And it's not necessarily a sleep tracker,  but it's more of a way of training you to to to figure out how to sleep better  and fixing your head seems to be a big category.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really? And you have to think that some of this is baby boomers who,  you know, I mean, this is going to be a huge market as we all,  you know, face knee surgery and poor sleep and, you know, and all of the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The CPAC. I hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hold on. OK.  Casper, the mattress company, filed to go public.  Last last Friday. Oh, they did.  And they named the global sleep economy.  I'm just going to call it that as four hundred and thirty two  billion dollar opportunity.  The U.S. sleep economy is only a seventy nine billion dollar opportunity.  And that counts things like mattresses, bedding,  bedroom furniture, et cetera, et cetera.  They it's it's pretty hilarious anyway.  So I wanted to give you actual numbers for sleep being a big deal. Go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I went and saw so so CPAP.  I'm I'm I'm being I don't know.  I might get certified for the World Trade Center Health Fund,  in which case I'll get it for free.  But if not, to get the CPAP  plus the mask, plus the the cleaner thing they advertise every two minutes.  It's like twelve hundred dollars. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes. And your insurance company will monitor that you're actually using it  because the paths are now connected.  And if you don't use it, they'll be like, yep, we're going to take it away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And we're going to, you know, increase your your rate.  This is this is this is a privacy violation.  This will probably agree. Oh, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What just happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know you agreed.  Is it a. I think it's tech panic.  Wait a minute. What?  Moral panic, Jeff.  No, the both of them agreed on something.  I know.  Leo hates it.  You know, I know I want to come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fight you to privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I will say that was one of my epiphanies, which is  tech firms need to grow up and recognize the power,  the potential harm of their innovations.  And I'm not seeing that yet.  And like Jeff, I would say Jeff needs to recognize  the potential harm of some of these tech innovations himself.  But you just did.  And that was exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Aren't you wonderful, Jeff?  She wiped the tears.  You start liking each other.  This is just going to ruin the show.  That's OK. I'll be I'll  I'll annoy Stacey enough for both of us, Jeff.  Stacey's epiphany number two, speaking of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, OK. This one was good.  Yeah, we are nowhere near serious enough.  Serious enough about climate change.  And I saw some really awesome devices for climate change  that run the gamut from like crazy fabrics for industrial, like  keeping people cool on industrial sites, to personal devices,  to this crazy thing that pulled moisture from the air  and made it potable water out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Samsung had a or LG had a  twenty thousand dollar refrigerator, let you go herbs inside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. Right.  You should see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did you see hires zero hire zero waste kitchen by any chance?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, no. What do they do with the way? Oh, my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, so the idea was you would.  And this was only a concept.  But you it was a beautiful kitchen where that you were growing  herbs and vegetables on your wall and you had a monitoring system  built into the wall to manage that.  You also had a system that weighed out your food and could identify it.  So you put food on it, whatever you had in your fridge  that you wanted to get rid of.  And then it would show you like project the slices that you needed to make  or the weights that you needed to make.  And there were scales integrated into things,  projectors integrated into things.  It was really a fun, fun kitchen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does it help you with composting potentially?  It does. The waste, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That waste is all the food you didn't eat in the right.  And the packaging and all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, the packaging, they didn't have an answer for it.  They had a recycling center as part of the thing in a composting site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did. There was a personal greenhouse.  Did you see in the sands, the small greenhouse hydroponics?  The herbs were growing up sideways.  So I wouldn't be surprised to see a lot of stuff like that coming along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In my new house.  Your photo, I got to ask you about this.  Your photo says Kevin is trying the device.  I don't see him trying the device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, you know what?  I think I might have cut the device out of that photo because I'm a terrible person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's testing a personal cooling device from Ember, but you can't see his wrist.  That was the one that went on the wrist, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. This is the wrong photo I put in there. Sorry, guys.  He is wearing the Ember, but I had a larger version of the photo for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, I'm glad that that mean S.  Higginbotham gave you the courtesy of the use of the image.  Your own courtesy, S.  Higginbotham.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's I just I pull it because sometimes I use Kevin's or others.  It's just our style, man.  I have a style guide for Stacey on IOT, if you believe it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I respect that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You should just write image courtesy me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK, no, it should be italicized.  I clearly did not do a good job when I posted this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You were drunk when you did this.  OK, I was on a CES hangover.  Believe me, I understand that.  I went to bed at seven last night.  I was exhausted.  How are your feet? That's the killer.  You know, I did it hurt your feet.  We walked a lot, but we I like seven miles or eight miles.  She's really good shoes.  You know, the carpeting is, you know,  and I both notice this, if it's a fancy company, they have thick carpeting.  It's it's like, you know, a cheesy company  like the Arnold Schwarzenegger robot company.  All right. They had. Oh, you're in the concrete.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's concrete.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, there's no plus darting around people constantly is there.  I especially imagine there they're they're they're texting and doing all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, God. So I hadn't been there in eight years.  It is now an epidemic of people looking at their phone, just  wandering into walls, wandering into you,  going three, you know, fetus an hour.  I mean, like, I'm dude, go to the back.  You're going to the bathroom. Go to the bathroom.  Don't walk there like in a funeral procession.  Looking at your phone. I throw me nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I was telling Mr.  Sargent yesterday, it was a couple of times where, you know,  I'm trailing behind you and Mr.  Wilkinson, what was doing a TV segment.  And I had my cameras. He was shunned. Yeah. To my shoulder.  Yeah. And people just kept bumping into me.  And I'm like, I know you see me.  We took my camera off and I decided that I was just going to be rigid  as I walked through. And if somebody bumped into me, they felt it. Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is this is what happened.  This is the most I've been bumped at CES.  Like I was just like, what?  Like my shoulders were just they're not looking constantly.  All right. I guess looking down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was I was like, I just it just really cut into my Pokemon go playing.  I just want to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I'm going to say this because I've been at CES for the last five years  and Kevin had been there for the last 15, maybe six years.  I don't remember.  Did anyone notice that the Intel booth was gone?  This is the first year that Intel was not the main booth in the.  You know, what was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not only did I notice it, but what was there was a Chinese TV.  Yes. Tonka. Oh, TCL was one of them.  And so this I actually talked about this on our segment because across the.  So Intel was on that corner.  Microsoft used to be on that corner.  Microsoft left years ago. TCL.  That's what that was taken over by Hisense.  TCL took over Intel.  The Chinese TV companies are the ones that are taking over all these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They put a lot of money into it.  Oh, a lot of money. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Qualcomm was behind Intel and they moved over to the North  Hall with all their automotive stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we I was just like, you remember where the booths were?  Oh, you do. Well, it's PTSD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can. Yeah.  You go in and Intel was hard to.  I mean, it was like, what a blue. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Really, it was an AMD show.  Intel. I'm too lost out to AMD in this particular show.  We talked about that on Sunday.  But there were a lot of green things.  The badge no longer is in a plastic badge holder.  It's a recyclable kind of plasticky paper thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Still cost you 300 bucks if you lose it.  Really? Oh, yeah. Did you lose it?  Oh, I didn't lose it.  Oh, but they tell you like three times.  Don't lose your badge.  Lose it is three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And at the end, there was recycling bins for the badges.  Put your bag when you're done.  Put your badge and lanyard in there instead of lots of plastic water bottles.  Everywhere you went, there were water filtration systems.  You could fill up your.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I never saw a water filtration system.  What? They're all over.  I was all over the place.  I was like, yeah, I was sad.  Interesting. Huh? Huh?  Couldn't I missed I missed all of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that there are at least it's it still feels like lip service  because you're also seeing a million disposable gadgets with lithium ion batteries.  And I mean, it is not in no sense.  Can you say the modern tech industry is eco friendly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not yet. No, I was looking at the I was talking to 3M actually there  about their filtrate sensors or a filtrate.  What are those things called?  The things that filter filter  for your air conditioning.  And they have a connected one, of course.  And it is a Bluetooth sensor that measures air pressure.  So it detects how efficient your air is flowing through the filter.  And then it's like, oh, I'm not efficient. Change me.  But when they change you, you just throw that whole thing away.  And they ask you to steal the sensor with the Bluetooth radio off  and recycle it, treat it like you do batteries. But.  I mean, are you? No, nobody's going to take that.  That's actually epiphany.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Number three, tech firms need to grow up

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and recognize the personal harm of their inventions.  Yes, this is the no longer do you get out of jail,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  get a get out of jail free card because you're like, I'm doing tech  and solving cool problems.  You need to start thinking about the impact of what you're creating.  And your executives need to start thinking about that.  And I think that's the key to the technology.  And I think it's a great way to start thinking about that.  And this came about because Plume announced this really cool  Wi-Fi motion technology.  They did a deal with a company called Cognitive, and it is really cool.  It is like motion sensing.  They've got people tracking right now.  It's just for sorry, it's through your Wi-Fi router.  So if you have a Wi-Fi router that has the plume software running on it,  it has the ability to basically add a motion sensor in your house.  And if you have signals between the Wi-Fi between your devices,  it'll be like, hey, something's happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And what would they use it for?  Why would someone want that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You would want it for coming into a room and turning the lights on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know who it is, but there's a big bag of water in the room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly. Big bag of water enters the room.  They actually can do person recognition if you have your cell phone on  or testing things like gate recognition to recognize the individual without a cell phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And of course, you'll get the data, but who else gets the data is the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Your ISP gets the data.  Oh, great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now Comcast knows which room in the house I'm in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Comcast is a plume customer.  Comcast owns, is an investor.  They do not own, they do, yeah.  They're a big investor.  They have an investment, but they also manufacture the plume pods for their own stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Now they're selling it as if it's their thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I see. I didn't know that.  All I saw was just their own little devices.  But they're also in the Samsung Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Those little octagonal things, those are plumes.  Pods or something like that.  Those are plumes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did not know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But they're the power inside the Samsung SmartThings Wi-Fi routers.  Plumes?  Yes.  And they just did a deal with Linksys, so they might become part of Linksys routers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've got some good technology.  I used plume for a long time.  I love the idea, but the results were not great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like the results now.  They're not faster on where it's at.  Did you move with them?  I did not move with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I could have them now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Comcast would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  No, I have, I went all in on plume when they first came out.  I have the new base station and like 12 little plumes, because the problem with the plume  is each room has to have a plume.  So your Wi-Fi extender, unlike say, Euro or Orbi or Link Veloc.  TP Links or whatever.  Yeah, you have to have one in every room.  But the way they described it and the reason that they say it works is because Wi-Fi is  like a lamp and it doesn't travel very well through walls.  So what you really want is a lamp in every room.  You can't expect the light from the room next door to do a very good job getting into the room.  That's a fair analogy.  Yeah, I think it's a decent analogy.  The guy who told me that, by the way, was the guy who told me humans are the biggest  problem with Wi-Fi because we're big bags of water.  We'd like to like movable Wi-Fi interference devices.  Yep.  We are a pain.  So that's they're turning, they're turning water into gold.  Gold.  Yes.  Yes.  And.  So, but this.  Oh, go on.  Epiphany number four, not everything needs to be smart, especially Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  What does that mean?  So I saw a lot of things that we had connected to gather data on people that I didn't think were  necessary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the tech industry writ large, though.  They get any idea they say like AI or blockchain.  They just say, well, spread it all over everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, so yeah, so this is, this is I was looking at my,  I think it was the third pee on a stick and get information company that I had seen.  And I was like.  Gee, I missed those.  I'm like, okay, so this, this device will tell me, you know, are you drinking enough water?  Are you eating enough vegetables or too much protein?  And I'm like, you know what?  If you tell me something like eat enough vegetables or in the case of better,  you need better sleep, right?  Sleep more.  There's not a lot like.  It's not that it's not going to help me.  It's not that you unless I'm one of these dedicated people who are going to be,  you know, really, I might eat more greens for a day or two,  but I'm not going to change my life because I purchased something and it told me.  And this may seem overly cynical, but this kind of data getting out into the world,  I just, I don't think we need most of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, you hit on something because I've been saying for a long time, don't do,  we have, I have had a lot of sleep trackers.  All it does makes you anxious about your sleep patterns.  It doesn't help you sleep because it's not telling anything you don't know.  I didn't sleep well.  I know I'm tired.  And I think you hit, you hit something here though.  These companies are not making it because they think they're going to help you sleep better.  They're making it because they can sell the data that they get from watching you.  And so it isn't really, none of these devices are in your interest.  Oh, there's, I don't know.  There's, I don't know.  But I remember talking to Philippe Khan who created, he was a guy,  he was like a legend in the computer industry, created Turbo Pascal.  But, and the first smartphone camera, he has a patent on it.  But the other thing he did is create a company called Motion X.  He's the guy who makes all those sensors in everything.  It's in your watch and your phone and everything.  Everybody's using his patents.  And he was telling me about the sleep tracker I use, which is sold by Beauty Rest.  And it's a little pad that goes under your bed.  And it's, he makes the hardware.  And he's, and he's, I wish I could find the clip from the triangulation.  Philippe's, he's, you wouldn't believe the data we're getting.  It's like, and, and it's, and, but what he's saying is the insights we can offer get better  and better and better as we learn more and more and more.  So they will say, well, did you drink last night?  Did you exercise?  When did you eat?  How late did you eat?  And then they correlate that with your sleep patterns.  And he says, as people use these devices, they'll become more useful.  So there's one use, which is a benign use.  Well, it's a benign use because you're going to, you're an early adopter, but you're going  to get a better and better product because I mean, that's Google's doing it.  Why do you think Google asks you if that's a crosswalk or a hydrant every five seconds?  Because they're learning from you.  They're using you.  There's no benefit to you for telling Google that's a hydrant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And some of the sleep data is interesting.  It will be interesting for doctors, but it will also, I mean, there are like,  if your corporate wellness program tracks your sleep, for example, once your employer  understands how much you've slept last night or whether or not you had too much to drink,  I mean, these are things that could start having real world implications for people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I would hope we would prevent things like that.  But once again, we are not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll always say, we need legislation about the use of the data, not necessarily the collection  of the data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's right, because there is a benefit.  So Philippe's saying, look, as more data I get, the better I can tell you how you slept,  you're going to benefit from it.  But he might also be selling it to insurance companies or like a CPAP machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's prohibitions on use.  There's permission.  There's transparency.  There's all kinds of things that we should be looking at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But your insurance company can monitor your use of the CPAP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, because they're paying for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm paying for you guys.  And they, since they're paying for it, they should be able to monitor it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll call you in the morning and tell you how well I slept.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They want to see if you're actually using something because they're spending the money on it.  I understand.  It becomes interesting as if your employer, which right now does not see that kind of data.  And should never see that kind of data.  I want to see how healthy my people are.  Can I just, I have to do this again, you guys.  Check this out.  It's crazy.  I have never seen anything like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's snowpocalypse in Bainbridge Island.  It's pouring white stuff.  Please keep that up there.  It's nice, isn't it?  Oh, it's lovely.  The weather outside is frightful.  That's a nice little gif.  It's show a delight.  Move it over a little to the left so we get the window frame out of there.  So we just get.  Oh, sorry.  Yeah.  Zoom in.  Can you zoom?  Okay.  Center.  Okay.  Now I've got to stand up.  Enhance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Center.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There you go.  Do you want more trees?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it's a snowpocalypse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nice work, Mr. Kevin.  Nice work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Snow sheep.  Where the heck did sheep come from?  I have no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kevin is a master of the trikester.  They're talking about sleep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sleep.  You made a Blade Runner reference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sleep and snowman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Boy, that is an obscure.  Kevin, I'm proud of you, though.  I'm proud of you.  That's the original Philip K. Dick short story that Blade Runner is based on.  Right.  But I am impressed that a man of your youth.  He is next level.  He's next level.  That's another way of putting it.  Yes.  Kevin is planning on buying a pet fitness tracker.  That's the epiphany I got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  What the hell?  He is going to buy the Whistle Fit.  Did you guys see this?  Poor Norman Whistle Fit.  Oh, Norman.  This is for your dog.  It's a Fitbit for your dog.  It tracks not just steps, but it also tracks licks, shakes, and I want to say something else.  Norm has allergies, so he licks himself a lot.  Kevin thinks that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not his lick of you, but his lick of himself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Himself.  So he licks his paws.  That's a common thing for dogs with allergies.  So they're interested in finding out, I don't know more about his allergies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Poor Norman's privacy is going to be violated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Poor Norman.  I bet you Kevin's privacy a little bit too.  You get notifications when it's time to go for a walk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I always wonder about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't want my phone to tell me it's time to walk the dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I never really found a use for all of the connected stuff for pets.  Because most of the time there's something about feeding or something about exercise.  I don't think you need a device to remind you about that.  They'll remind you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's their job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, see, this is why it was in my you don't need to be smart section.  But Kevin was like, I really want this information.  Did you also see the dog talking device from Lengu-Language Less?  Did it translate?  It did translate.  Okay, sort of.  There's two trends here.  One, stupid stuff that's connected.  The other is heart rate variability.  So this company from Japan measures your dog's heart rate variability to determine if it is happy,  excited, relaxed, stressed or afraid.  And then it will I'm trying to let me pull up my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because I know human heart rate variability can tell you a lot of stuff.  That makes sense.  And that is.  What you train if you lift, you don't want to you want to wait.  You want to lift.  Let's see the more variable, the better.  So you want to lift when there's a lot of variability.  You don't want to live from the variability is low because you're still in recovery.  Right.  Now, you know that you take a day off after you lift heavy.  Right.  But it helps you do it a little bit better.  Optimize your performance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All of that makes sense for us tracking with pets,  especially because pets can't tell you I'm stressed out.  They can't just verbally tell you that.  But they can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They don't see the point.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's the matter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is an external device based treatment for premature ejaculation.  So that's smart technology gone truly crazy.  So this was my epiphany.  This is at CES.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So last year, you remember CES had awarded a vibrator.  Right.  It was only last year.  Yeah, it was only last year.  And they took it back.  They pulled it.  Right.  Because, oh, and female sexuality.  Male sexuality, fine.  But females?  So they got the good thing after that is that that company got more publicity than they would  have ever gotten if they just got the award and everybody went on with their lives.  And this year, CES decided to devote entire swaths of the show floor  to female sexuality.  There were.  Yeah.  Right.  And lots of them.  And I don't I have I just I declined to give it any I just didn't I wasn't going to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I still worry about why does it have to be Bluetooth connected for those things.  I just or Wi-Fi or Wi-Fi.  Or Wi-Fi.  That was just me.  There was a lot of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm trying to go.  I played with one for guys.  Mm hmm.  I use my fingers, not other parts.  Yes.  I saw.  We decided not to run that segment.  I just feel like I'm going to stick with computers.  Process.  This is fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait, did you did you go to that booth next door?  Marari?  No.  So based on basic science research and study data, it uses transdermal based product using  neural modulation as a means of inhibiting the nerves on the penis, thereby delaying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everything is connected.  Now, nothing wrong with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then they send the information back to Google and tomorrow you're going to get all  these ads.  All of these ads.  I don't know.  I'm not I'm I'm not a prude, but I didn't really think that that I wanted to cover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just a bit.  But I'm just proving Stacey's point that now everything is connected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not everything needs to be smart.  You're absolutely right.  It's more and I think that's really kind of the other thing you kind of get from CES.  It's just this overwhelming.  Everybody's striving so hard.  Everybody wants to be the next unicorn.  And especially like the Sands Basement, which it feels like a science fair.  It's like a high school science park.  Trash.  It's fun.  And I and boy, you know, I talked we talked to the Italian company  that is making the curry of olive oil.  And at first I was disappointed because at first I thought, oh, you just bring your olives  and they'll squish them.  But no, they you have to buy their prepackages like Juicero, the prepackaged frozen olive  I just got their own.  And then you put the capsule in there and olive and then like this much olive oil comes  out.  This is like what was the what that curry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What was the other one that Stacey had that she defended?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Rotomate the Rotimatic.  The Rotomate the Rotimatic or no, no, we love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The June.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Juicero.  Juicero.  It's just like the Juicero.  And then there was the curry.  This is also in Eureka Park, the curry of muffin ovens.  You might like this, Stacey.  Muffin pots.  Little pods.  No, they're just little pods.  And it's a specially built oven to take a pod.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Single bake muffins?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's single bake.  The excitement on her face, folks.  Oh my gosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How much was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what?  There was such a crowd.  We Lisa and I tried to get video of this guy three or four times.  It kept coming back and there were so many people there and I think they were just there  for the muffins.  But there were just I couldn't ever.  I think we got video of it, but I don't know.  Did you put video of that in the?  Does anybody know?  I don't recall seeing that one.  Yeah, I don't recall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think we got that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, we shot a lot of stuff that ended up on the cutting room floor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I just I was looking for it.  I just call it the story from the spoon of all of the food stuff there.  Robot pizza, robot ramen, ramen, beer bots, drink bots, wine tech, DNA driven food choices,  smart countertop cooking, intelligence, surface cooking, smart home gardening, vertical gardening.  You mentioned that one.  Home food robots.  What does that do?  It's a cooking robot.  That's like the Rodymatic and all of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's it is really lots of coffee stuff.  I think what's interesting and this is one thing that  it's not changed, but it's just it's even more than it was eight years ago.  There's so much money if you get a hit, right?  Everybody wants to be the next Uber.  Right.  And and so you just see the show floor is jammed with these people who are just so  sincere and they really want to be the next unicorn and they got the best thing ever.  It's like you don't any idea you can anything you can think of.  Somebody's going to make it.  A lot of the booths were companies that do that.  I would go to the smart pet rocks.  Yeah, I would go I would go to a booth thinking, oh, that looks interesting.  They're realizing, no, no, they're not selling that.  They're a company that you go to with your brilliant idea and they make they get they  connect you with China.  They make it.  And then so there's a whole supply chain for people who have an idea now to make products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I respect that to a certain extent, because if you have an idea,  you have every right to try to absolutely market.  Oh, I don't mind it.  But the problem is that I've seen and it's not just from those little guys,  but heck, even some of these big tech companies, I think they try to create a problem  and make a product off of it.  It's not necessarily a problem that I want to flip my light switch with my with my fingers.  Humans are endlessly creative, but they want to tell everybody, hey,  we can connect your lights and have you turn it off just by speaking into the air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Burke says we should talk about the power of the exoskeleton.  That's because we make Burke lift.  Delta, first time an airline had ever had a booth and they had a big booth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Their CEO even spoke at the keynote, I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they had did you see that, Stacey?  They had the exoskeletons you put on and you could lift massive amounts of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I saw the old people exoskeletons.  I missed the Delta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, old people exoskeletons.  It was very similar.  It was very similar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's similar.  You sort of look like Tony Stark on Sage.  You look like Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you go inside the Delta booth because they had a new kind of screen they're going to have at  airports where everybody gets a different thing.  So you go in, you scan your ticket and the screens you see at the airport,  instead of showing all the flights, say, hi, aunt, your flight's at gate 32.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Customers, your three hundred forty seven people around the same screen.  Yes. And each of them gets their own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. I don't know how they do it.  I don't believe it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do they get an individual of the whole screen or do they block it off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no, you get your whole the whole screen.  Huh?  These are the exoskeletons.  This guy's lifting a hundred pound, a hundred thirty pound tire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Speaking of one thing turning or like showing a single individual,  a single stream to a single individual from a shared resource like a television screen,  have we talked about Bluetooth yet?  Bluetooth's five point two codec that was announced at the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's take a break. I want you to tell me about that point.  And we can also talk about those light field technology, 3D things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Lots of potential, lots of potential.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what that means when they say you have lots of potential,  potential, just not living up to it.  Our show today brought to you.  We have a great panel.  Is this you know, I hope you're not bored with this CES talk.  We have lots of Google news.  We're going to get to that.  Stacey Higginbotham is here with three of the four of us were at CES.  So, you know, we're reminiscing Stacey.  I feel so left out.  Oh, Jeff, next year you're coming with us.  Jeff Jarvis from CUNY and Pruitt.  Our show today is for you, Ant.  This I use you as an example with Health IQ all the time.  Health IQ is a life insurance agency.  They work on your behalf, but they have a very special niche.  They are for health conscious people, people who exercise.  Who pay attention, who get the right amount of sleep, who take care of themselves.  Health IQ is a concierge life insurance agency that goes to bat for you.  So the perfect example is you're in great shape.  You lift.  But because you have so much muscle mass, your body mass index.  I am overweight.  You look like you're obese.  You're morbidly obese.  Right.  And an insurance company is going to look at that number and say,  we can't insure you, Ant.  So what Health IQ does is they go to bat for you.  Say, no, no, no, you don't understand Ant is in fantastic shape.  And they'll even use with your permission.  They'll say, we can get you an even better rate if you'll give us the data from your smartwatch  or from your fitness tracker.  Because that proves that you've been lifting.  And so this is very highly personalized to you.  And this is a really neat idea.  They use science and data to get lower life insurance rates for people who care,  who get a minimum of eight hours sleep, who eat well, who exercise.  And it can be really a good deal.  A million dollars of life insurance for 36 bucks a month.  See, the reason this works is, look at these guys.  These are the guys who started it.  They're fitness fanatics.  The reason this works is, frankly, the life insurance companies have been subsidizing  the unhealthy by charging more to the health conscious.  It's not a conspiracy.  It's just actuarial science.  It's how insurance works.  You need to let your insurance company know you're healthy.  And then you can get these great rates that only Health IQ can give you.  Health IQ is Concierge White Glove Service.  They do the whole thing.  They work through the entire process.  They are working with the top 30 insurance companies.  So you're going to get a policy not from Health IQ, but from an insurance company.  They're an insurance agency.  And by the way, they have rates that only Health IQ can get.  You won't find them anywhere else.  But you have to qualify.  So here's what happens.  You go and take the Health IQ quiz.  It's healthiq.com slash twig.  They have developed this proprietary health quiz, which is not asking you about your habits.  It's asking you about your knowledge.  It's a knowledge assessment.  They put together a team of the top medical health and fitness experts to create this quiz.  Depending on your score plus other qualifying factors like the access to your data on your  fitness tracker, you can save a huge amount, like up to 41% of your life  insurance premiums compared to other providers.  There's no commitment.  It won't cost you anything.  You'll learn even more about potential opportunities to be rewarded for your commitment to living  healthy.  But you've got to go to healthiq.com slash twig.  Take the quiz.  You'll give them your phone number.  Your concierge will call you, talk you through the process.  It's just such a great idea.  Health IQ.com slash twig.  They came to us because they say, we know you have healthy listeners.  You have smart listeners.  They take care of themselves.  I said, really?  But they don't couch potatoes?  Really?  But you know what?  You look at this panel.  We all are very health conscious.  You know?  And I think that that's the proof is in the pudding.  Except don't eat the pudding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because as I say, we can't eat the pudding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Health IQ.com slash twig.  I say this now in the ads.  We don't track you.  We don't track you.  We don't know anything about you.  So you've got to use that address so that they know you saw it here.  Health IQ.com slash twig.  I'm really nervous because Spotify just announced they're going to start tracking people who listen  to podcasts, Spotify exclusive podcasts on the Spotify app because they know everything about you.  They have your credit card.  They have listening.  They have your location.  Data, data, data.  And they're going to start selling that to advertisers.  So much money in data.  It scares the willies out of me.  Because we're not going to do that.  We don't want to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So by the way, I just put up in the chat, there's a Delta video of the screen.  And it depends, apparently, it takes a while to get to it,  but it depends which angle you're at on the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  So there were a number of technologies like that.  This is the light field of red.  So it made me think of it.  That are doing glassesless.  Fast forward a bit.  This I didn't I didn't try.  There we go.  As they come up to the screen.  I didn't try to shoot this because you can't.  No, you can't see it.  So each person is getting a different message depending on the angle of viewing.  In order to do that, by the way, they have to scan something when you come in your ticket usually.  And there's cameras everywhere that are watching every step.  It's going to freak people out.  So they say, oh, just stand in there, show him.  Oh, yeah, because they know exactly where you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Behind Stacey wondering what her name is and gets to see.  Oh, yeah, that's a good point.  I took two calls.  I'm really excited.  On 42nd Street in New York, we have finally have those Amazon Go stores.  Yeah.  So I did it.  I got the app and I went in.  I'm so excited.  The sandwiches are overpriced junk.  I like the chicken.  But I want to be is that all right?  Oh, Bonnie, you're great.  I love Bonnie.  I don't think we have that one.  Yeah, it's like seven bucks for a basic turkey sandwich.  On plain bread, I wasn't that impressed.  But I'm watching two colleagues.  Those cameras don't come cheap.  I know.  They say, what's the big deal?  What's the big deal?  So then they realized I said, well, you know, one person can check you in.  And then everything you buy, I pay for.  They said, oh, OK.  I bought a soda and a sandwich for colleagues, but it is pretty amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So not waiting in line is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do people trust Google?  Yes, they do.  More than they trust Tom Hanks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You do try to argue on this moral panic show.  They don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they do.  This is the state of brand trusts, a survey of 16,700 people per brand.  The most trusted, by the way, is your doctor.  50% of Americans trust that your doctor a lot is the phrase they used to do the right thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Who doesn't trust extreme weather warnings?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it gets weird.  Then Amazon, then Google.  Those are in the top four.  Extreme weather warnings is number five.  Then teachers, then Tom Hanks.  Then the police.  So they trust Tom Hanks more than the police.  But they trust the police more than they trust Oprah.  And they trust, and this is what really scares me,  Oprah more than they trust scientific studies.  That's the scariest there.  They trust health warnings more than they trust Donald Trump.  But you know what they trust the least?  Hollywood.  Wall Street.  Okay, so.  And the US government, which is really weird because Donald Trump is the US government.  But okay, fine.  This is so funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is Americans who say they trust each of the following a lot.  A lot.  To do the right thing.  So we're just saying, are these brands going to do the right thing?  They're not, I don't know why extreme weather warning,  are they doing the right thing?  The wrong thing?  Why doesn't Tom Hanks get 100%?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Geez.  You know he's going to do the right thing.  Yeah.  I'd rather trust him than my doctor.  Wilson.  They trust the labels on food packaging more than they trust religious leaders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Religious leaders have taken a dive on this whole Donald Trump thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Jeff, you'll be sad to know that only 8% trust the news media.  Why is this that high?  This is the state of brand trust.  It just says a lot about society.  It could also be just a BS study.  You know.  It's from Morning Consult.  Yeah, it is.  Google is the most trusted brand among millennials and Gen Z.  Amazon is third.  To do the right thing.  Yeah.  Gen Z and millennials, according to the report, hold brands to a higher standard.  They're more distrusting of brands across the board, except when it comes to Google.  Or, Netflix is pretty good too.  Netflix is right up there with Gen Z's.  I trust Netflix to do the right thing.  Don't you?  I do now.  What does that even mean?  Oh, maybe they're watching do the right thing on Netflix.  Well, in the old days, it was send you the right tape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Actually, you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They were very good.  It was amazing how accurate they were getting as DVDs.  Those little red envelopes.  The other day I talked to my daughter, 27, she said, did you know that Netflix used to send out little red envelopes with discs in it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We still have some that we bought.  My husband bought some old Netflix videos, DVDs, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They just cut that plan off, what, just four or five years ago?  It wasn't that long, right?  They just cut that plan off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, man, though.  It was a bad idea because I think I had the five disc subscription.  I just kept meaning to watch those discs by the time.  Yeah, right.  You know, you just gather dust.  You can't get another one until you send one back.  Streaming is so much better.  Streaming is so much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Blockbuster, man.  I miss my blockbuster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really?  Do you want to go rent a VHS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what I miss?  You know what I miss?  I miss browsing.  Yeah, that was fun.  I miss going to the record store and the bookstore and the electronics store and the computer store.  Remember we had those?  And just browsing.  Browsing is dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I remember going to the record store and flipping through the LPs.  Right?  Now, you talk about this.  What do you browse, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's our old fart moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I know I was going to say I browse differently now.  So I look at top 10 lists or I go places and I'm like, hey, what are people watching?  Or I ask friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, like that survey we just did.  That's a kind of browsing, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What gets me is you talked about having to struggle to get your DVD, your five set DVD  and turn in one every week or whatever.  But yet just last week, you told me you binge watched some show on there just back to back  to back to back to back.  Yeah.  How was it more?  How is it easier for you to do that now versus trying to just pop in one DVD?  Oh, no, it's better.  You'll watch eight hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's good.  You have a problem with that?  So at CES, Lisa and I didn't get any party invitations.  Is that what it was?  We watched Messiah the whole, the new Netflix show Messiah.  We watched the whole thing in one week.  I can't watch this DVD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just don't have the time to watch this hour and a half DVD.  It wasn't the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe it was just getting up and putting it in.  I don't know what it was, but something about streaming.  You got a point there, Andrew.  Come on, man.  This is a good show.  I like this terrible reviews.  Well, it's it's it's somebody's talking to me.  My phone or my watch?  Oh, is my watch.  It's been you, sir.  Siri said it's beyond my abilities at the moment.  OK, thank you, Siri.  The it got like 38 on Rotten Tomatoes.  So don't watch it.  But I happen to like it.  The idea is there's this guy of kind of unknown origin,  but he's vaguely Middle Eastern who just appears  and starts creating miracles and people start following him.  Bigger and bigger groups start following him.  They think he's the Messiah.  And meanwhile, as one would expect, just like the Romans,  the authorities go, he ain't the Messiah is a terrorist.  Let's arrest him.  They're throwing him in jail and he mysteriously escapes.  And and so but they did a good job preserving throughout  the entire season the ambiguity.  Well, is he or is he a trickster?  Is he a magician?  Is he really the Messiah?  But I think season two, you're going to find out he's neither.  I know what he is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you know.  Oh, I think I know.  Care to spoil.  Anyway, I enjoy.  He's a Facebook executive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, it's Mark Zuckerberg.  You figured it out.  It was his his yearly challenge.  Did you see Mark's not going to do those anymore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, he's got enough challenges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's basically what he wrote in his post.  I've grown out of this thing about doing a challenge every year.  I'm just I got problems.  I got to solve these.  That's kind of a nutshell.  Well, YouTube is should I do Zach's Zach scoop?  Let me do Zach's.  So Carson's son, Zach, is actually a very smart fella and noticed that there.  Well, so should I show this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Careful channel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Careful as you can't because of the next the next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there's a channel that my 17 year old and I think Zach at the same time discovered  called Don't Hug Me, I'm Scared.  It's puppets.  It's colorful.  It is subversive because they're not muppets.  It's kind of weirdly surreal.  It's actually great.  It is not for kids.  But YouTube says it's for kids because of the because it has puppets.  And this is going to be the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, so the paradox here.  Oh, it's for kids.  Oh, they say it's for kids.  It's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Definitely not for kids.  Right.  It's got puppets, but that doesn't make it for kids.  But now it shows up as a, you know, by the way, if you if you want to be disturbed, watch these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So yeah, they're they can't monetize.  What does this mean?  They cannot have comments.  Basically, all of their interactivity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can they appeal this?  Can they go to YouTube?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There is no way to appeal this.  This has happened to them.  This has happened to Cartoon Network.  Well, that's for kids, sort of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a lot of stuff.  I mean, BoJack Horseman is not for kids.  There's a lot of cartoons that are not for kids.  Archer.  Archer is definitely not for kids.  But now is there the risk that kids will now be seeing more of this stuff because  YouTube's decided it's for kids?  Because that's really disturbing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It just shows you how screwed up this stuff can be.  They have all these wonderful ideas and not necessarily go through all of the proper R&D  and not having enough human training for this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and then we get all upset when we find out that humans are involved.  Microsoft's getting heat now because it turns out that contractors have been listening to  Skype conversations to grade the speech recognition.  And it turns out it was just a bunch of Chinese people in their houses at home.  And so I'm sure Microsoft will do something about that.  Frog pants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, Mr. Johnson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel so bad.  I did not know this happened.  Scott Johnson.  I got trolled and also F you tube.  The instance was terminated because it was linked to a channel that was disabled for  having three or more copyright strikes, which I'm sure is not the case with Scott Johnson.  So he's moving his everything over to Twitch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He got dinged on years old content and every single one of his channels has been taken off.  The morning stream, which is a great thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The morning stream, which is a great show, has been banned from YouTube.  By the way, please be aware you're prohibited from accessing, possessing, or creating any  other YouTube accounts unless the link channel is reinstated.  What if this happened to us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This would kill Twitter.  If it's going back to something that's a year old for Mr. Johnson,  what about some of the stuff that's three, four years old on the Twitter network?  The good news is shh.  Don't say it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Every day, every day.  We get dinged a lot.  We get dinged on stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The good news is we never relied on YouTube because I knew this was a potential problem.  Right.  Same reason people said, oh, you ought to go all in on Facebook video.  Nope.  You build your platform on somebody else's site, they can always do that.  They have the leverage.  So just a word of warning, I guess.  These automated systems are just not very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I get them wanting to, I get where their heart is.  They wanted to do the right thing, YouTube.  But again, we still need to have someone step in and put some common sense on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You need humans with scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  That's the problem.  Humans don't scale.  There's only seven billion of us.  Somebody said in the chat room, Bleak Double says you're already making editorial choices  based on YouTube.  It's true.  There's a chilling effect.  We are now very careful about not playing a video that might get us copyrighted.  Although we just did that.  Yeah.  I just.  Whoops.  It's not my nature.  You tell me I can't do something.  Pretty much I'm going to do it.  Pretty much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then I'm going to go behind your back and edit it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As good Karsten does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's a story that really could be in the changelog, except it's not happening until  So it's a future changelog, but a very big story, I think.  Google has announced they're going to drop third party cookie support in Chrome.  Which means, by the way, since everybody's basing on their browser and Chrome Brave does,  Microsoft does with Edge, I wonder if third party cookies are dead.  Dead.  Dead.  This is a post building a more private web from the Chromium blog, a path toward making  third party cookies obsolete.  You might think, well, isn't this against Google's business model?  I mean, they're business model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not when they have all the data everybody has.  They don't need to share this.  Yeah.  They don't need to share it.  They don't need to.  Yeah.  I mean, it hurts the competitors in the ad world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So how soon will we see the government step in on this?  Yeah.  Because it's.  They won't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's anti-competitive behavior.  But at the same time, it's good for privacy, right?  In fact, one of the first things we tell people to do.  Be careful what you wish for.  I know.  First things we tell people to do is turn off third party cookies in your browser.  Almost all browsers except Chrome would let you do that.  Now Chrome's not even going to give you an option.  They're just going to block them.  So just to understand what this is, when you go to a website,  cookies are a completely benign mechanism and they needed to exist.  When you, for instance, go to Facebook and you don't have to log in again,  that's because Facebook saves some information on your hard drive.  They call it a cookie, but it's just a little bit of information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Even getting all the various parts of a single page requires it.  Yeah.  Maintains state when there's an estateless world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was originally created by Mozilla as persistent client-side state information.  They should have called them Pixies, but instead they call them cookies  because they thought, oh, it'd be nice.  But the problem is not first party cookies.  Cookies saved by the site you're visiting.  The problem is third party cookies.  Cookies that are, for instance, like the Facebook like button.  That's a third party.  You're visiting a website, but that's a third party saves a cookie.  And then in effect gives them the ability to watch everywhere you go around the web  because anytime that cookie, anytime that Facebook like button shows up,  they could say, oh, they were just at Starbucks.  Oh, they were just, oh, they were just that.  So there is a privacy information leak there.  Cookies were carefully designed to prevent,  you know, they're designed that only the first party can load the cookie,  but nobody imagined the idea that people would embed little bits of content  coming from their site on somebody else's site.  So third party cookies are a potential privacy violation.  What do you think, Jeff?  Does that bother you if the Facebook like button then knows everywhere?  It only knows when you go to other pages with the Facebook like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  With the Facebook like, which that was a major kerfuffle at the time.  We're a bit over it now.  I've always said that when it comes to antitrust and stuff,  the weakness for Google is advertising because it's in the advertising business  and it has the power of God.  But I don't think so.  I think that all of the ad tech stocks are all nose diving.  Because of this?  Because of this.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and then there was a story related that Apple,  because Apple now, when you use your iPhone, ever since iOS 13 came out, says,  you know, Google's been tracking your location.  You want to let them do that.  Because of that, what used to be nearly 100% opt in for location tracking with apps  has dropped to 50%.  So location based advertising is really getting hurt by iOS 13.  So I imagine that has something to do with it as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I wrote a piece that will get Stacey and me disagreeing again.  Which came out of a discussion on the show last week in defense of targeting.  That targeting as a whole is being demonized.  And the alternative to targeting is mass.  Where I know nothing about you and it's a billboard and everybody sees the same thing.  Taking away relevance and further taking away efficient, inexpensive advertising  that democratizes advertising for new and small businesses and movements  and small candidates and so on and so forth.  And we've got to find some kind of medium here where you got Roger McNamee,  who's driving me completely crazy out there saying,  you'll get rid of all targeting and hyper micro targeting.  Micro targeting is, you know, just.  He hates Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know Roger because I went to school with him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He hates Facebook and Google.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He really, he was an early investor in Google, but turned against them at some point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Facebook.  Well, because Mark stopped calling him.  He used to be Mark's mentor, but Mark stopped calling me.  So I'm going to go on every TV show in his passion, but that's another story.  So, you know, targeting to me is not an evil.  It can be misused, of course, but it opens up possibilities.  There were small, you know, moms selling her jam that was only possible  because you could find people who just love jam or movements that occur  or the low cost of ads on Facebook.  And I think it's being demonized so much.  So this whole notion of third party cookies, cookies as a whole got horribly misused  by the advertising industry and the media industry and the technology industry.  We didn't tell people what they were and it was easy to then demonize them,  but they have functions that are valuable.  And I worry about that.  I'm worried if we go to a mass web.  Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I actually agree with you on micro targeting.  I don't think it's a terrible evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What has happened to the alignment of the planets?  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  But you probably don't like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And what Google mentions with third party cookies is when people turn off  cookies and that kind of tracking, then much more draconian fingerprinting technologies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I interrupted Stacey to make a joke.  Go ahead, Stacey.  I heard other words and she was actually agreeing with me.  So I want to make sure Stacey gets her time to agree with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  To agree with you.  I also think that cookies.  I remember being offended by cookies, but by golly,  when you turn them off, the web does not work as well.  So I feel like we still are huge impasse that we've come to is that right now we're sacrificing  convenience for an exchange of our information and the ability to be targeted.  I do think targeted advertising is more effective.  I think it can be, if not coercive, definitely manipulative in a way that I don't love for people.  I think we need to.  I think the solution, though, isn't always to turn it off.  I think we need to do a lot more education around it.  And I also would like to see business models that do not rely solely on advertising.  And I'm kind of optimistic we're getting there in some ways.  But your site relies on advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't that how you get paid at Stacey and IoT?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do.  I do not do incredibly targeted advertising.  When you come to my site.  You already are targeting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, yeah, I'm not your targets.  Yeah, just like with the content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I'm not just the best way.  Right.  So the questions that I think we need to answer is how do we fund things for the mass?  Because there is value in mass without being without scraping too much data and misusing that  data.  And I don't I mean, paywalls are one way and we might all hate them.  But there's a reason people are going to them.  And I mean, we're buying them.  So I mean, I subscribe to a bunch of publications now because I do want to read them.  And, you know, it does it irk me not if I know that it's helping fund a publication whose stuff I value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can I ask Stacey how many of them are I presume a fair number of them are business expenses  and needed for your expertise there?  What about on the personal side?  How many do you subscribe to, if I may ask?  Personally, I subscribe to probably eight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're generous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I do NYT cooking.  I do New York magazine.  Only for vulture that I like reading about shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a really good column, though.  I love vulture.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do Scientific American just for me.  I guess I could justify that as a business expense.  I have the New York Times Normal.  That could go either way.  So some of these like Wired I would subscribe to regardless.  But I put it as a business expense, you know, because I can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That wasn't as good as your account.  I want to get your trouble here.  But yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no.  I mean, well, I mean, it is a legitimate.  Those aren't hard.  It is.  It's fine.  Yes.  And then let's see.  I subscribe to The New Yorker and The Economist just.  Well, she's so smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How much do you get to read?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's expensive and it piles up like guilt for me.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, my husband also reads The Economist.  He reads it more.  I read probably one out of every three issues.  I read all of The New Yorker, though, except for the baseball  articles and the fly fishing.  She's so smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Seriously, just smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She just doesn't watch TV.  That's the secret.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I read a lot.  Yeah.  And if I've never told you Libby is my pick of the week, I encourage everyone who has a public library  that supports Libby, download that today and start downloading books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  And actually, if it's not Libby, your public library almost certainly supports some sort of  digital content application.  There's different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can I give you my library moment?  No.  So I'm doing my Gutenberg research and there's this whole series of extremely expensive academic  books.  They cost $200 each.  I'm not buying them.  No.  Right.  And the New York Public Library has them.  My best crowdfunding thing ever, which may not be saying much, but it is I love this crowdfunding  thing.  I crowdfunded the CSER, C-Z-U-R, Aura scanner.  And we try to run the open up for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Moving the camera.  It's a book.  So you wait a minute.  I wonder if this is legal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You go to the library, you get books and then you scan them in.  It's personal purpose.  Didn't Google get in trouble for that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So yeah, well they did, but this is fine for me.  Oh, this is cool.  So it looks like a lamp.  It's a little thing.  Yeah, it's not big at all.  The software is phenomenal.  It does OCR as well as scanning.  It does OCR as well.  It does PDF as well.  And then it'll also recognize when I turn the page and take the next page.  OMG, I got to get that.  That's cool.  And sorry for making you all dizzy with that.  What's that called again?  The CSER, C-Z-U-R.  This one is called the Aura.  That's the one I have.  And they just come out with a new one that's cheaper.  This is $350.  I got it for like $250 on crowdfunding.  And it's magnificent.  And so I'm getting these books and I'm just able to have these chapters and mark them up.  But there's no legal ramification, sir?  No, no, no, because personal use is fine.  Okay.  Fine.  It's something fine.  At the New York Public Library, I could take pictures with my phone, but that doesn't work  as well.  So you do all the PDFs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stacey's buying it right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was tracking my gloves for the chat room.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It has a foot pedal or it has the automated thing because it comes with these little thumb  things.  Do you find it works pretty well?  It works brilliantly.  Beautiful.  I'm getting it.  That's awesome.  And so software, so you do a whole bunch of PDFs and then you say, okay, make all that one PDF.  Boom.  And there it goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you have the Aura X Pro or?  I have just the Aura, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's the Aura Pro and the Aura X.  And this man is...  Oh, it's a lot more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a hundred bucks more for the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I don't know which one I have.  But David Caesar has a new, new one that's 200 bucks.  And if it's the same software, I think it'd be good.  But my point library, so I love our university library.  I love the New York Public Library.  And because I'm a professor, though a fake one, only a journalism professor, I get these books  that you're only supposed to use in the library, I'm allowed to take out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wait, how is it a journalism professor is a fake professor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I have a bachelor's degree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I have a bachelor's in journalism, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You guys started three master's degrees.  I don't have a master.  You guys beat me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got a high school diploma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you've got a great acceptance.  So anyway, so this has just been a godsend to me  because I was trying to figure out how to do scanning and stuff.  And it's wonderful.  So I just wanted to plug those wonderful people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like this disclaimer on the Caesar site.  If your materials are more in color demand, such as magazine, art books, and so on,  please contact us first for scanning sample via message in case of unpleasant product experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That is nice.  That's warning you that it may not be amazing for, you know, high quality color.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Cool device.  I also on the top on top of that arm, there's a screen on the top of the arm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, so you can stand up and see what you're standing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to have to spend some time looking at the various models because there's very,  this is the global version for overseas customers.  I guess I don't want that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's going to happen next is you're going to see this in your Instagram ads.  Oh, you know, that'll be a good test.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course, if I had an Instagram account, I would, but I don't.  You know what I found?  I have an Instagram account, but I only follow Lisa.  If you only follow one person, you don't get ads.  Oh, really?  You have to, I guess, have enough content for them to give you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That must be why Jeff Bezos follows only one person on Amazon.  This is in the rundown.  But he only follows one person on Instagram.  Guess who?  And she doesn't follow him back.  So knowing those two things, who do you think it is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Lauren Sanchez.  Nope.  Mrs. Bezos.  Yes.  Of course.  And she doesn't follow him back.  Of course.  I got the money.  You take your high little girlfriend.  I got the money and I'll, I'm not, of course she doesn't want to see his pictures  of going to the Aruba.  He wants to check up on her though.  That's interesting.  Man, we got a whole soap opera out of that one little fat boy.  That quick.  That quick little thing.  Google is, besides third party cookies, Google also plans to phase out user agent strings.  So browsers announce what they are with the user agent string to every site they visit  so that the site knows what the browser's capabilities are.  And of course, many browsers lie.  And there apparently, there is a privacy issue with this.  UA strings have been used by online advertisers as a way to track and fingerprint.  It's one of many data points they can use.  Dastardly.  Dastardly.  User agent sniffing, which is illegal in 22 states, I might add,  is an abundant source of compatibility issues,  in particular for minority browsers, resulting in browsers lying about themselves  and sites being broken in some browsers for no good reason.  So instead of UA strings, they're going to do something called browse or client hints.  Client hints are a mechanism that provides a way for webs.  It's more like, remember when you, do you remember modems?  And you would dial in and go.  Modulation.  That was a negotiation.  It was the handshake where the modem says, I can do this, this, and this.  What can you do?  And the site would say, I can do that.  Let's do this and talk.  That was the handshake was the negotiation.  So that's kind of what client hints are, is a conversation between the website  and the browser about what they can do.  That's my understanding anyway.  So that's kind of interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you identify your capabilities, not your brand?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  A mechanism which might allow user agents to be a bit more aggressive  about removing entropy from the user agent string.  Generally, okay, programmers, stop it.  Entropy, what?  By giving servers that really need some specific details about the client,  the ability to opt into receiving them.  So instead of just, hey, I'm Mozilla, take it or leave it.  Browser hints or client hints can do a little bit better.  That's interesting.  So Google, I think I always think of these companies as monolithic.  Everybody at Google has the same marching orders, but that's not the case.  There's people at Google who want to do the right thing for privacy.  There's people in advertising who say, what are you talking about?  We need all the data we can get.  But in this case, I think the Chromium folks and the Chrome folks are doing  probably doing the right thing.  I don't want every site, Stacey, to have a paywall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't want every site to have a paywall, but I do think if you're producing valuable content,  you should get paid for it.  And if the advertising models are becoming too intrusive, then that is a problem.  And I mean, that's why I'm okay with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I we chose early on.  We tried briefly the idea of listener supported and that didn't give us enough money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jake gave you money way back when?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Seven bitcoins.  Seven bitcoins.  But it wasn't enough to have.  We have 26 employees.  We have a big facility.  We have many shows.  So we decided to go.  Free food on Wednesdays.  Free food on Wednesdays.  It was Mexican today.  Free lunch.  We have a massage therapist come in once a week.  But California.  Yeah.  But I like the idea of being free because I feel like and Mike Elgin was the guy who  told me this is democratic.  Anybody can listen.  There's no means test to listen to Twitter.  And fortunately, we can do it ad supported.  I do worry though, Stacey, you're right that this reaction to tracking and ads  and the demand for advertisers to have more information about listeners  could jeopardize us because I don't think we can turn around and stay now.  Okay.  Five bucks a month.  I don't think we can do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think we've been worried about the redlining of journalism and quality information.  That too.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I get bucks every time I go to the financial times and I cannot read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stacey, where do you stand with ads from the broadcast standpoint with television and radio?  Where it's not as targeted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Where do I stand?  I don't understand your question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you're saying it's like it's dying and it makes more sense if you could put some  value on it and have people do a paywall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, for okay.  So for public television, and this gets into some interesting issues because, you know,  the airwaves are a public resource, but they're charging for the channels now,  which I'm kind of like, ah.  Um, but I don't have an issue with those.  I do have an issue with the idea that, you know, Canoe wanted to do this way back in the day.  There's a lot of effort now for understanding exactly what TV shows you're watching.  So your TV is watching you while you watch TV kind of thing.  And that that gives me the heebie-jeebies a bit.  Partially because I watch I sometimes watch trashy television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you don't want them to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So while I'm watching the bachelor, I am also flipping through the economist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's the problem.  This brute force blunt object tracking can't tell that she's also reading the economist.  I don't actually watch that much TV.  Now you're actually television is a really good example.  Shove it back in.  Because there are both models and both models coexist.  We pay for Netflix.  We pay for HBO.  We pay for cable.  But there's also free to broadcast to the air.  I don't like to watch broadcast TV.  There's too many too many commercials.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In this academic book I just bought the first page, how to lose money in the business of books.  In 1524, the Leipzig town council appealed to the Duke of Saxony on behalf of all the printers,  saying they were in danger of losing house, home and all their livelihoods.  They ask in desperation to be allowed to print or sell anything that is made in Wittenberg or elsewhere.  For that which one would gladly sell and for which there is demand they are not allowed to have or sell.  You can't sell books early on Catholic treatises until the Reformation.  What you had to give them away by law.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, they could sell books, but the way he's buying them,  the first wave of buying was the ancients and all and Bibles and soldiers and all the stuff was around.  And then the book industry started collapsing horribly.  And then along came Luther and pamphlets and what was then news before there were newspapers exploded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the same in podcasts.  Along came Gimlet and then everything changed.  Gimlet is the Luther of podcasting.  Bitterly, he said so bitterly.  How much did they sell for?  230 million dollars.  They have 16 shows.  230 million dollars to Spotify.  I'm not jealous, but I better do an ad.  I like our model.  I think ad support is fine.  I just don't think we could charge people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're just like a different retire, but that's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think our model works because of the research we put into it.  We try to give people good content.  Right.  We know who our audience is.  We're not just throwing trash out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Some of us aren't.  Leo is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you subtweeting one of us?  She's subtweeting me, I know.  I can tell.  She can't punch me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we try to do high quality.  I've tried to have a certain standard because I don't want to waste people's time.  But I don't know.  Our show today is brought to you by a number of fine sponsors.  We are very grateful to them for making it possible to do this.  It's very expensive to run this.  I was going to add up all the money I've spent over the 15 years of Twitter,  and then I thought that's a bad idea.  Nope.  Nope.  That's a really bad idea.  But we couldn't do it without the advertisers.  So I'm very grateful.  We have great advertisers.  We're very picky.  For instance, LinkedIn Marketing Solutions.  This is a company we've wanted to do business with for a very long time.  We're big fans of LinkedIn.  I've always said it's the last decent social network.  But people don't know that LinkedIn does a lot more than just a social network.  LinkedIn marketing can help you speak to the right professionals at the right time.  With over 62 million decision makers on LinkedIn,  you're going to be able to connect with the right business leaders  who are relevant to your company.  And with LinkedIn ads, you can make sure your messages are getting through to the right people.  You talk about an ad landscape that's valuable.  Man, it's LinkedIn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And where the conversation is productive.  It's high quality.  And nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And smart.  Yep.  How do you get people's attention when there's a million messages a minute,  there's a million hours of TV on all at the same time,  there's just not enough hours in the day.  LinkedIn ads are a very efficient, effective way to reach a very high quality audience.  Even small to medium sized businesses can use LinkedIn ads.  They're doing a great job with them to get their voices heard,  to get their messages to resonate with the audience.  And it's by the way, it's not just about awareness.  No, no, LinkedIn ads drive traffic.  They drive engagement.  They drive visits to a landing page, registrations to events.  Did you think about that for your event?  Are you doing an event?  What better place to advertise an event than LinkedIn?  Downloads of thought leadership content.  We try to put stuff up all the time on LinkedIn because it's such a great place  for people to learn about what you're doing and how you're thinking.  And to establish, you know, it's a subtle way to establish your brand as a thought leader.  As an executive with precise targeting,  small and medium sized businesses can talk only to the people who matter.  Very efficient.  At the end of the day, LinkedIn ads are helping smaller businesses get big results.  This is exactly what we've been talking about here.  And I think this is a very benign, very effective way to do it.  And we believe in it so much, we're going to get you a $100 ad credit right now.  If you want to launch your first campaign,  but you do have to go to the special landing page,  linkedin.com slash twig.  Some terms and conditions apply about it.  $100 ad credit is a great one.  Believe it or not, we were talking about this earlier, Jeff,  how $100 is a very, you can do very efficient buys.  Amen. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so because of targeting, yes.  And you go to a place like LinkedIn, you want to reach people who are  HR executives in this industry, that kind of stuff.  That's, that's incredibly valuable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they don't say this in their, in their ad copy, but I'm going to say it.  A lot of other places you advertise, you don't know what your ad is going to be next to.  Right. You really don't know what the environment is going to be.  Any on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube, YouTube, especially,  but on LinkedIn, you know, it's a quality environment.  You're going to be, you know, this is going to reflect well on you linkedin.com slash twig.  We're really happy to have LinkedIn as a sponsor of this week at Google.  And it really is kind of apropos this whole conversation.  I did not plan this, but I think it does make the point that there, that some targeting,  whether it's the targeting Stacey and I do where we know, and that LinkedIn does that too,  where you know what the audience is because of the content you provide.  And some of it is LinkedIn also as a social network.  So they can say, well, we know this person is an executive or this person is a buyer of certain  products. I love that.  Very efficient. I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I really don't.  I always ask people, well, wouldn't you prefer an ad  for something you're interested in and something you're not going to ever buy?  Doesn't that add waste your time?  Exactly.  I've always thought that linkedin.com slash twig.  Don't waste your time. Don't waste your dollars.  It's a very effective place to advertise.  Google people love going through the APKs of Google apps and Android apps.  And I'm sure they talked about this and all about Android, but apparently  the Google call APK has a little bit of code that shows that they're going to be,  this is from GSM arena. They're going to be adding call recording.  Now it's a slippery slope.  A slippery slope.  I mean, you also will have to be cognizant of what the laws are in your.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In my day and Leo's, since we're very old farts.  Wait, I know this is about recording your conversations.  Yes. Well, you had to put a ding on the call if you were reporting.  Oh, remember that the beep?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep. Google voice does that.  That was a signal that you were recording.  So California is a two party state. New York is not.  Texas was not.  Yeah, Texas is not. New York is not.  And it really is an ant. These are antiquated laws because  the reason that Texas and New York say, well, you only, only one person has to know  is because they were trying to prevent like wire tapping.  But really both people should have to give informed consent to a recording. Right?  I think so.  So I think the California law makes sense.  The New York state and Texas laws seem odd to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I couldn't remember if North Carolina was, but I had a situation where I had to record  a conversation and I just told them straight up, hey, I'm going to record this right now,  just so you know, because right now I don't remember if we have to consent that.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As a journalist though, it's damn convenient not having to tell anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, or as a whistleblower or disgruntled, you know, if you're an unhappy employee,  your boss is harassing you. Having a phone, I mean, it's the plot in many a movie,  having a phone in your pocket, recording the boss berating you.  Go ahead, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh no. I was, I was just going to say that  it's interesting because now I record people and I'm like, hey, I'm going to record you for  note taking purposes versus record you for publication.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is a little bit. I mean, in that partly that's because my show is not adversarial in that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you went above and beyond.  North Carolina is a single party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you, Mr. Scooter X in the chat room. Thank you very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, I think those are older laws that were more worried about  a conversation be recorded by some other party outside. Right. They're not worried about you  recording a conversation you're having with somebody, but really they should.  Should, but that's not.  You know, to carry in a 40 pound reel to reel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. That's what's changed. Right. I mean, everybody has a, a, a very good call recorder  on their phone. In fact, pre marshmallow Android phones did have call recording.  And they took it out, I think, because of these legal concerns.  Right.  Now it looks like they're, they're thinking about putting it back in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, I used to have, it was part of a, I mean, when I was at business week as an intern  back in 1999, we had like your phone system was a, you recorded your things through the  phone system and it was fancy, fancy setup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you could do it on Google voice, right? There's a star.  Yeah. Google voice. Let's do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it announced it on Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This was before IP or as IP was rolling out. This was huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you that old, Stacey? I didn't know you were that old.  She's not that old. She's just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was working for the print version of business week in 1999.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She was only 11.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you work with Steve Shepard? Was Steve Shepard the editor then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, Steve Shepard and Mark Morrison. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He was, he was my first Dean. It's cool.  Wonderful man. Wonderful. Wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There you go.  So, um, have you tried the call, the new call recorder? Cause I think they have it on the three  a now. What? No, I haven't.  Yeah. That does that. I remember we showed you this before that it records.  Oh yes. Yes.  And then it transcribes. Oh yes, I have.  Yes. Yes. I've tried that.  So, I mean, talk about for a reporter taking notes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, so I used it actually, cause I didn't have time to transcribe something from my podcast.  I know I could have sent it away, but I was just trying to finish something up. So I've,  I like played it. I recorded something like from my podcast so I could get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How well did it work? It worked really well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, it was super handy. It was kind of just a little hack just to be like,  I need this quote and I don't want to listen to this to transcribe it, you know, slowly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're going to look back and say, do you remember when you had to write things down?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You should still write things down. I think it's an important part of retaining information.  And as my writing, no, I was going to say as a writer, right? When I'm writing a story,  when I do my first draft of a story, like anything that's more than a news story,  I actually do TKs wherever I don't have the facts. I write everything. And then I do  paraphrases of the quote with quote TK. So I can smart and I do that too. So I can be,  it's basically like whatever flows to the top is probably the most interesting.  It's first draft. Do you know what TK is? Sloppy copy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So mean. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I say that with, with,  it's a typesetter. It's a typesetter abbreviation, right? No, what you were describing was, it was a  sloppy copy. And I, I'm the same way. No, you type, cause you want the first,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I told my daughter this when she was writing, she was writing an opinion piece. I said, just write,  don't don't cause she was getting writer's block. I said, just write. Yeah, just let it out. That's  your first draft. You don't, you're, you could throw the whole thing away if you want. And I  think TKs are a great part of that. You go, well, the quote was like this. TK. Yep.  I didn't really know TKs were magazines. The problem is you've got to then search for your TKs  because the worst thing is to file a copy and there's no editors anymore. And TK makes it to

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  print. Right. Yes. That's why TKs are, that's why you don't like, it's yeah, that's why I don't make  things up. I'm always like TK, cause otherwise you'll not see your made up thing. And your

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  personal assistant has made you a cup of coffee to replace that old, cold cup of coffee. She knew

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was freezing in here, so she brought me some more coffee. Thank you so much. I don't get this kind of treatment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Aunt's way nice. I would bring aunt a cup of coffee any day, but Leo, I gotta say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm wearing my Bob Cratchit scarf today. Thank you, Ms. Sarah, as always. So,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Instagram, I really want to know what aunt thinks about this. When Instagram first started, I do  remember that it made me mad that people would take pictures with SLRs with big fancy cameras.  No, Instagram is made for your camera phones. For socializing. And so you shouldn't be posting,  but I quickly gave that up, right? Now Instagram says you're not, you can't use Photoshop on an  image on Instagram. At all. I hate this verbiage. I hate this verbiage. What do they mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I saw this on- Fake news. Right. Everybody's wanting to say it's a way to sort of knock down  all of the bad mess that's being spread and all the false information. Also a way to improve photos.  But you just, you can't say a Photoshopped image. Everything, even if you just boost the saturation  to make it look a little bit better, that's Photoshopping it. Right. So why are they using  that particular terminology for this? Now, granted, you can look at the example on the next web where  they had a picture of EZE and his crew with Kurt Cobain, quote unquote, Photoshopped in. Yes,  that is an actual manipulation and sticking him into the image and totally changing that image.  Cause that never happened. That never happened. But all of this whole Photoshop, we're just going  to stop locking all of this. Are they doing that? I haven't seen it in my feed yet, but there's been,  I believe on pedipixel.com, they had a couple of people that had examples of the screen saying,  this has been flagged as not legit or not real or something like that. I can't remember the exact

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  verbiage. Are there technological signatures of kind of that larger manipulation or could we have  Photoshop type programs add some sort of technological signature that companies could look for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah, like 40 little invisible blue dots saying this has been Photoshopped like printers do.  Pixel, right. Pixel stretching, things like that. You can analyze a photo and say, well, that's been  manipulated. See, it's going to hurt my favorite Instagram feed. Do you know Kirby Jenner?  Kirby Jenner? You're going to like this one, Jeff. That's Meg Whitman and Jeffrey Katzenberg,  the founders of Quibi, the new short form streaming service that's already raised a billion  dollars and says, but we're going to spend 1.2. And there's Kirby Photoshopped in, he Photoshopped  himself into pictures and that's great. He pretends he's Kendall Jenner's twin brother.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then just, but see, this is art. See, this is what, I'm going to say it, I'm going to say it,  this is where moral panic means us. You get rid of a technology because it can be misused and then

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you lose all the good uses of it. This guy is one of the best, I don't think people understand how  brilliant he is as a parodist. I mean, all of this stuff is fake. It's awesome. It's so awesome.  There's Kim Kardashian and Celine Dion. And now that's a real picture, that part.  And then he goes into the studio, shoots himself in a perfectly suitable outfit  and edits himself into the picture. It's brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's Photoshopped. Photoshopped.  It's great Photoshopped.  That's probably going to go away.  I put up visual grams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't even know what's happening here, but...  So crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Napoleon Dynamite in the chat.  When I saw this, what is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the MoMA gallery benefit. It's a great benefit. Every year,  Kirby and Kendall go. And of course, they're famous for their outfits.  Looks like he's wearing a one-man tent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that does look like a tent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is a tent. That is amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I knew I'd get you eventually.  I'm showing years worth of work because he'll take a long time.  It's a lot of time.  Yeah, it's a lot of work.  That composition.  And he gets the lighting just right here. He is with Kanye eating Froot Loops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, and see, that should be flagged because we know that didn't happen.  That is fake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're not going to take it down. They're not going to block it, but they're going to say...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The screenshots that I saw, maybe it's in my other rundown for focus on photography.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it visualgrams here? These are all Photoshopped too.  This is photographic art.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Visualgrams is a popular account on Instagram.  And when you look at it, it just plays into the eye, but 90% of those are  quote unquote Photoshopped images, but they're just beautiful art.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My friend Trey Ratcliffe uses HDR and Photoshop to do some of the most beautiful art ever.  Here. Okay. I'll find the PetaPixel site here.  Somebody in our chat room has linked it. Instagram now hiding.  And it puts a big X across it.  Reviewed by independent fact checkers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, see, this is where this leads us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is not ideal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is where they should be fact checking every political ad makes them so scared.  This was the picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is also what happens when you don't invest in people  for content moderation.  And this is what happens when you try to scale.  Well, they're rule based.  That's what this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now I have to point out that even though it had this false information, this big X on it,  you could click through it.  And yes, clearly those mountains aren't that rainbow color.  All right. So it's not false information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to stop you right there.  So let's think about that. If you can click through it, you're scrolling through just.  You're not going to click through it.  Exactly. You just, I can't see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and it really casts aspersions if account has lots of these X's that  the implication is this guy's trying to trick people.  Kirby's definitely trying to trick people.  But it's a joke.  You know, it's a matter of time before.  I mean, this is, this is what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you can click through, I think it's okay.  I'm going to be honest.  But that's the thing though.  I know not everyone's going to click through.  So I think it'll be harder to establish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's also saying it's false information.  And I think that's not okay because it's false information about that photo.  Just because a photo is manipulated doesn't mean it's misleading or false information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You could say this is a manipulated photo.  That's probably a better way to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And maybe not put a big red X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think the big red X or a, if you get a, this is,  this photo has been manipulated across the photo that you click through.  I think that's actually okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can see why this is a problem because guess who's getting a lot of hate?  Because they won't do this.  Facebook.  They're saying any politician who wants to say anything they want in a political ad can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As on television, they are allowed to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we're going to allow that.  And so this is, which is ironic because Instagram is owned by Facebook,  but this is the problem is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The former head of News Feed is now the head of Instagram.  So he's going his own way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You think Mark didn't say yes to it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah, no, I absolutely did.  But Adam, I'm sorry, I'm sure argued there was a different culture there  and it was a lot easier to do.  Well, and that's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's about change or not.  And that's why this is such a bad thing because it is using a mechanical system to say,  oh, well that's been photoshopped.  And the presumption is it's misleading or it's false, but we can do it.  And this is my problem with it because well, we can do it.  They're going to do it even if it's the wrong thing to do.  And Facebook's not going to do it because they can't do it,  even though that's the right thing to do.  And so it really comes down and does every single time in Silicon Valley to the technology.  Can we do it?  Then we'll do it.  If we can't, well, we won't.  I don't want Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't want you think Facebook's going to do a good job of fact checking.  They're going to do an awful job of fact checking.  It leads us to the kind of stuff you showed.  No, I agree.  And, you know, everything the politician says practically can be called a lie by somebody who  doesn't like it.  Right.  I think putting them in that position and telling them to fact check political ads is ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How about anti-vax ads?  Should they run those?  Yes.  No, they should get rid of those.  Yes, I agree.  Well, they're running them.  Here's this is from Buzzfeed, Carolyn Haskins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a screw up.  Is it a screw up or a policy?  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the policy is not to run anti-vax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Policy is not to run them so they're screwing up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or, well, this is an example.  See, technology can't do it.  So, well, we're going to just go ahead.  I think this is bad because people might look at this guide to pertussis,  which implies this is a guide to whooping cough and what to do about it.  It falsely claims that the whooping cough vaccine causes neurological damage.  Instead, you should buy a product from the company that makes this pamphlet  that contains elderberry, elixir, vitamin C powder, and a mixture of herbs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So is a person human?  They're going to get fooled by this?  Yes.  Yes.  Yes, they're going to screw up.  And the problem is that story just brought that a hell of a lot more attention than that ad ever did.  I don't know.  I wouldn't say that.  You think so?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How many?  We don't know.  That ad might have been millions of people might have seen that ad.  I guarantee you, millions of people did not hear this show.  I wish.  I wish I was as effective as Facebook.  We are heard.  We are heard.  I wish.  So PayPal bought honey.  Remember we talked about that for like what, a billion dollars?  Now Amazon says, honey's a security risk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They were talking junk, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Interesting.  Honey, which my wife uses and loves, is a browser extension that finds coupons.  I asked Lisa, I said, you know that the reason that's free is because it's tracking where you go.  She said, yeah, that's fine.  I can save so much money it's worth it.  So she knows.  Right.  Amazon says, well, that extension is a security risk, not a privacy risk.  Amazon would, that would be, that would be chutzpah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Honey's lying on you.  And no one is saying anything about Amazon's tracking cookies though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're doing the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And by the way, honey's been available on Amazon for years.  So it's not, you know, four billion dollars.  That's what PayPal pays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey, every woman I know who's a mom or a real person who does not speak technology,  they all use this.  This is legit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think they know Stacey, how honey makes money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A couple of them do, but most of them don't care because they're also getting value in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the point, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  If you can get value from things, people don't mind.  I think the question is that value is easy to see because you're saving actual money.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the same argument I have with just being logged into Google services on my Android device.  There's a value for me to be able to go through the big city of Petaluma down these streets that  I have no idea about and let Google track me and tell me the right way and so on and so forth.  There's a value.  Oh yeah, Maps for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But do you leave Maps location tracking on when you're not using it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think so.  No, most of the time.  And that's that Apple thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It says only allow one app is running.  Yeah, most of the time I do turn it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do that all the time now on Android.  Now you have that choice on Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google offers you that now on Android.  It's like, hey, this app just got your location in the background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm glad both are doing it.  This is why I actually really like California's Consumer Privacy Act because  there's really only two parts to it.  It's easy to understand.  A, you have to tell them what information you're gathering and B,  you have to give them a choice to opt out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, let us delete it too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's very simple.  And I think that that's what we should expect from every company.  Honey should say, look, this is what we gather.  You're getting a great deal.  We're saving you hundreds of dollars in return.  It's a free service.  We got to make money.  This is how we make money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just be clear.  Be upfront.  I would say this is what we gather and this is where it goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yes, yes.  And that's in the law too.  This is who gets it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Which if we'd done that, it's the early days of cookies.  We wouldn't be in this situation.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Disclosure is.  Which I wrote in a book.  Secure.  You did.  See, I should read more.  Was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stacey's the one who reads.  I just like to watch TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As Chauncey Gardner said, I like to watch.  Twitter.  All sorts of changes.  They're looking at all sorts of things.  One thing they will not do according to Jack Dorsey is that.  I still don't quite get that.  Because it's already out there.  It lives.  I didn't know.  I even.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It goes out on RSS.  Even if it's already out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can put an edit tag on there just the same way a chat room does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, because they can't pull it back.  It's out there now.  They can't control.  So you can edit it.  You'll think it's edited, but it's not edited on all those other places it went.  Oh, now I see what you're saying.  Yeah.  So what Mastodon does, which is the Twitter clone that we use,  twit.social if you want to join our Mastodon instance,  is if you say I want to edit it, it says you can delete it and post a copy.  And we will honor that.  So you say delete and edit.  That's a twit.social Mastodon if you want to join it.  Twit.social.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's actually great about the Twitter compliance feed.  No, what's that?  I just heard about this today that evidently when Twitter takes something down for some kind of legal reason,  they send out a feed to those who still have mechanisms to run Twitter saying you must kill this.  So they could have sent out a feed.  This is you know, you got to add.  I never wanted them to allow somebody to change a tweet and not have evidence of that.  All I want to do was to say.  The full original tweet is fine.  Let me add on to it to say here's the mistake and it goes with it.  That's all I ever wanted.  I think I mentioned this to Jack personally two years ago and evidently what the story says is  basically they've been there's a quaint Americanism grin effing us all along.  Oh yeah, okay.  We're thinking about that.  We're trying and they never intended it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Honestly, it might be easier now, but when there were lots of third party apps.  That was hard.  The issue is you can't guarantee that everybody is seeing the edit.  Right.  So it misrepresents it to you.  You see it on Twitter, but you don't know who's seeing the edited version.  That other version has gone out.  It's out there.  It's in the world now.  You can't show something else like live TV, which is their argument.  That's the case for SMS.  I think they turned that off after Jack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, sorry.  I was like, wait a second.  Is that still a thing?  They can check out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, great bit on security now this week yesterday.  Steve Gibson talked about a report.  I think Princeton did it where they got prepaid accounts with all the major phone companies  and they showed how easy it was to SIM jack any of these accounts because the customer service reps  really did not.  You could say, well, I don't remember my pin.  Oh, well, do you know, tell me two calls you made recently.  I don't know.  I don't know that.  Tell me two calls that came in recently.  Oh, I do know that because I placed them.  And then you have the SIM jack.  So SIMs and cell phone numbers are a terrible way to authenticate.  This is a great story.  And listen to security now because he talks about this and shows the whole process.  But the point being that's how Jack Dorsey got hacked because they did have a way to tweet  without authentication because it's from your number.  It must be you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's not like customer service people are paid enough to care.  No, their job is customer service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They don't care.  I think it's the other way around.  They want to serve.  And if they think you're the customer, they're going to do everything they can to get you  that new SIM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll rephrase that.  Care enough to do enough fact checking to make sure you are who you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They don't want to be mean.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I'm going to tell you that I called Verizon and I had them.  Now, if anyone tries to get access to my phone or any of that, basically, if anyone tries to  change my phone number, get access to my phone or my SIM information, they call me.  That's a good idea.  And I had to call them and ask for that.  I don't think it's a service they provide, but I think they should offer it.  You know, the only problem with that, Stacey,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  if the number they're calling is the guy who's SIM checking you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're calling me on a different number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So that's like the Google has the recovery email address,  which is different than your Gmail address and our recovery phone number,  which is different than your Google voice or your fine number.  That's what you need to do.  You have to have a second number and that's better.  I mean, it's still conceivable that you could be SIM checked on that number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, yes, I mean, but pins don't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The point was pins don't work.  In almost every case, these guys were able to say it's one, two, three, four.  No.  Oh, my, I must have written it down wrong.  Oh, well, we have other ways you can authenticate.  And of course, the other ways were increasingly weak.  At one point, they were saying something like, what's your birthday?  And you said January 4th.  No, you're getting warm.  They literally, they literally, the customer service versus no, that's close.  It's a little earlier.  You got to listen to it.  No, that's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But again, I don't think they're not trained to train enough, paid enough to say,  you know what?  No, that's not cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what else is Twitter's doing?  A bunch of stuff.  Let's see.  Conversation participants, screen compose screen tools coming this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is this is going to bug me.  This is this is trying to make Twitter kind of private and you can  there's all kinds of making all kinds of levels.  It happened to me for the first time yesterday.  I saw somebody respond to a tweet.  I want to say, well, this person restricts some of what some of who can see with this.  You don't know who the person is.  You don't know what was said.  So now you can you can have four options global, which is everybody a group panel,  which I think is people who you name in the tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then statement is for everybody.  Nobody can respond to where you post a tweet, but you can't get any replies.  It's like a perfect presidential press conference.  That's perfect for Twitter.  It's just right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah, wait, wait until Trump discovers that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, he should be using that one.  Why does he need replies?  Actually, probably he's not allowed to write.  He has to he can't block replies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, now it's just a feature.  He's not blocking them.  He's putting up a statement instead of a tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  It's a statement, a statement thing from the Oval Office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Royal Knight in the chat says it reminds him of the him or her of the Google Plus circles  back in the days.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we have that on Twitter social, by the way.  You can make a toot.  That's what we call them on Mastodon.  You can make a toot that's public, private, friends, you fart in any direction you want.  Twitter is also considering tipping.  This is according to Yahoo Finance.  I don't know.  Are they are they are they the information?  Oh, no, it's not.  It's the information we got to give credit.  Then this is a good source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You actually have the account.  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I paid for it.  So see, apparently one of the things the information this is a leak.  Twitter has not announced this, but one of the things they're talking about is tipping.  What about Twitter banning political ads?  Was that not an appropriate solution?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I argued that it was both Facebook and Twitter were wrong.  And the reason I'm against what Twitter did is once again, it cuts off new candidates  and new movements from an efficient mechanism of advertising and forces them back onto television  where Tom Steyer and Mike Bloomberg and Donald Trump all win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The information says Twitter is considering a feature that will allow users to tip send  each other money from the tweets.  According to two people familiar with the company's decisions, it couldn't be learned  when the tipping feature will debut or whether micro transactions play.  We'll see Twitter linking up with Dorsey's other company Square.  A Twitter spokesperson said the company explores lots of ideas.  It wasn't currently developing a tipping feature.  They denied it in other words.  Sending money from Twitter is completely reasonable.  You can send money in Facebook Messenger.  You can send money in Apple's Messages.  I don't see any reason.  It's a Chinese thing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why wouldn't this be an obvious pivot for them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Maybe then I could drop all the advertising.  You just send me money.  Means you got to go back on Twitter.  That's why we chat.  No, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what they do.  Twitter was like WeChat.  They allowed paying and boom.  They went off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, Leo, we discussed this while you were gone, but the in-defense of Twitter line there  is a there was a really good, I think, because I agreed with it, op-ed in the New York Times  by a Pennsylvania professor.  I did like that.  Yep.  So she has a book coming out which we might want to just mention  called, I'm suddenly forgetting the name of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sarah Jackson is a professor at Penn.  Hashtag activism.  Networks of race and gender justice.  Her point is that lots of marginalized groups got a voice on Twitter like Black Twitter,  which is actually the best Twitter of all.  I've heard that myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. You probably don't follow.  But I've heard that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Andrea Langston gave me, I asked on Twitter, well, who should I follow?  She gave me a whole bunch of people I should follow on Twitter.  And it definitely adds flavor to the Twitter feed.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No pun intended.  Yeah. A little chocolate in the Twitter feed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's the point is that there are different disenfranchised groups who suddenly have a voice.  And I think that's absolutely true.  Nobody says, even Leo, when he says Twitter is a dumpster fire,  I don't mean to say that there isn't some value in it at all.  There's huge value in it.  Yeah. You and I have had that several times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We've argued about it several times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's value in it.  The question is whether it's worth singeing your eyebrows on the dumpster fire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a position of privilege for us who have these megaphones to say that others shouldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you're right. All right.  She mentions, Jackson mentions the hashtag justice for Trayvon.  The hashtag Black Lives Matter probably wouldn't exist without Twitter.  Right.  Oscars so white.  Me too.  Oscars so white.  You can go on and on.  There are a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My favorite is Living While Black where I have learned things that I should have known.  This is a case from people's lives and I did not know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How about hashtag why I stayed, which gave women in abusive relationships  a chance to talk about that.  That's heavy duty.  But Twitter and its anonymity, its kind of spontaneity really becomes a good place for  conversations like that.  You okay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And do you mind if I ask you something personal and please say if you do.  Sure. Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't guarantee an answer.  Do you ever wear a hoodie at late at night?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wouldn't.  I'm asking the updated question of whether you have the talk with your sons.  Oh, God.  Okay.  And then whether you have it in social media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Any talks with the boys are always just between us and four walls.  Okay. Fair.  And as far as them being online, yeah, they have private accounts.  But I only hide Queen Pruitt for the most part.  I don't hide the boys because they're athletes.  And since they're athletes, they're going to be in the public eye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they've got to understand how to maneuver it.  They're also really good looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. And they've learned how to watch for this and watch for that and, you know,  to look out for predators and things of that nature.  And, you know, every now and then I had to tell them to stop putting locations down.  But they've learned.  Oh, doctor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, Stacy, as JJ Stone has been very open about talking about what he tells his daughter  about being black.  Because oh, doctor lives, drives a fancy car in a fancy neighborhood and gets pulled over  like weekly for driving while black.  And he is very open with her about, well, you got to understand racism and you got  to understand what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We've had those conversations prior to coming to California.  And that was part of the discussion of deciding to come to California.  It's like it's going to be different because some things we're not going to see here.  Not to say that it doesn't exist, but it's a pretty strong.  It's a different kind of racism.  Right. You know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I mean, if I had a teen, if our black and a black son, a teenager, and after Trayvon,  I would tell him.  I don't know what I would tell him.  I would say I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Tana Acy Coates, incredible book, which was written for his son is the conversation.  A letter to his son.  Letter to his son.  And it is it breaks your heart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My boys have dreadlocks and whatever those hairstyles are called.  I don't know.  I don't have any hair.  You're jealous.  But but that was part of our conversation.  You know, a couple of years back was, you know, you're going to be judged just because  of how your hair looks.  Just period.  It's not fair, but that's just the reality of it.  And we've we've worked through that and we've been fine.  We've moved on, you know, because they know that they offer more than just their haircuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep.  Yep.  One of my students in social journalism is her every student picks a community and her  community is people who keep their hair natural.  And the discussions about how people change their hair to get a job interview, what happens  to their work, all of that.  But what's interesting to me and Stacey, I'm curious from you, too, as your daughter gets  to the age where she can be on social media.  What are you telling her these days?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She doesn't want to be on social media.  She looks at it as not.  I mean, she lurks.  She wants to be on.  She calls it Pinterest.  She wants to be on.  She has a lot of friends on Instagram.  She sees things on Instagram.  You know, she I don't know if she has she doesn't have her own account, but she does  look at other people's sometimes.  She's not interested in putting herself on Instagram.  And I think part of that is a result of me being hesitant to put her online anywhere  and talking about that with her.  I don't know.  So so right now, it's not something I have to deal with.  I did let her have an account on Pinterest and we and she knows her school has had a  curriculum around it.  I think this is where her school did.  Yeah, her school did a lot for her in a way that I don't think most try to just ignore  No, I think that's starting to change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I really do.  Yeah, yeah.  We didn't have it in the first place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We did have the discussion about the mental health side of it.  And I had to have that talk with my boys and say, look, I know you guys enjoy showing this  and that to your friends on social media, but I want you to sort of be cognizant and  not be braggadocious on social media, because you don't know how that's affecting people  because like, like you said, they're good looking kids.  They got money.  They got money.  They got money.  They got money.  They got money.  They got money.  Like he said, they're good looking kids.  They got my jeans.  But they're, um, I was gonna say, look a lot more like Queen proof.  Watch it.  Watch it.  But they, but they, they have personality and charisma and they do really well in school.  They do well with their athletics.  And so they're superstars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can tell they shine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So every now and then they could come off as braggy, but I have to tell them, look,  tone it down just a touch.  I know you just whooped that dude in track, but, you know, though they have that southern

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  humility, they say, sir and ma'am, they're actually really good.  You, you don't know how good your kids are.  They are really, really well behaved and well brought up kids.  This is the book and it's, I listened to it on audible tanes and coats between the world  and me and I was in tears through much of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's I recommend getting the audible because it's, he reads it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's so powerful and it is, it's what he would tell his son and he's, you know, it's  the world is not fair and this is, this is the world you're growing up in and you need  to know about this.  It's between the world and me.  Oh yeah.  I'd be actually really curious what you think of it.  Yeah.  I'll add it right now.  What's your experience?  Let's take a little break and Stacey's going to get to go home in a minute.  You want to build a snowman out there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a, I was like, we built a snowman.  We built a snow fort.  It's been snowing for three days.  How many inches did you get?  Like six, seven.  Wow.  Three days.  It's been snowing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, yeah.  Kind of jealous.  I love snow.  I miss snow.  Nope.  You want me to show you the snow fort?  Does King Higginbotham do the shoveling?  We have to shovel it.  We gotta call him King Higginbotham.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not going to call him King.  I'll call him a Prince.  Prince Higginbotham.  That's even better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That sounds pretty good.  Prince Andrew.  No, actually, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, nevermind.  You're right.  He's not that guy.  Yeah.  No, Andrew can be Andrew because he's online in a consent.  He's public.  He's been on the show.  He had a segment, right?  Yeah.  Although I realized, you know, and I do so much to not show my daughter online,  but this whole time in my office,  there are pictures of her on my little bulletin board behind me.  Oh, we can't make those out.  She is too in them.  So I don't feel so bad.  Yeah.  But I'm like, oh, this whole time I have not been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's something I grapple with all the time because when my from the moment my kids were born,  I was on TV and then doing this and I have a bad habit of talking about my family  and they don't like it.  One cotton picking bit.  None of them.  Well, the kids actually don't seem to mind that much, but none of my wives have enjoyed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My family has been indifferent about it and like, yeah, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The good thing is, I mean, in this environment, it's not bad.  It's not like you're exposed.  It's not like I'm on national TV or anything, but still,  it isn't something that they agreed to or bought into.  This is my life, not their life.  So I kind of feel I should have done that better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, well, too late now.  So much on that list, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So well, yes, it is a long list.  The older you get, the longer it gets.  People just called me.  I don't know if she's listening.  I'm not talking about you, Abby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The people who started blogging in 2004, 2000 and my daughter was born in 2006.  So that whole time period, everyone was putting their kids and everything online.  I think of Deuce and yeah.  Yeah.  When it was kind of normalized, but around when she was two,  I kind of got the heebie-jeebies about it and we stopped.  It was weird for a long time.  Only in the last probably four years has it been okay.  Her schools and camps always ask for permission to photograph her.  I'm always telling them no.  I know we look like crazy people.  They're like, what the heck?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, you don't look like crazy people.  You don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're reminding me that I let Abby do a podcast on the network when she was in high school.  So I guess she did sign up for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My daughter's come on the show.  My show, she comes on once a year usually to talk.  But again, that's audio only.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a little different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's audio only.  She's getting a chance to put on her professional face as it were,  or her in the world face that I don't think kids are really aware of until.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you're lucky to be able to give her that.  I think that's a good experience for her.  Honestly, if it's in a safe environment, which it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm screwing her up in other ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by a tool you will use a lot.  You got to sign up for Zapier.  It is awesome.  We use it all the time.  Zapier allows you to, how can I describe it?  You create zaps, which are little applications that connect one thing to another.  Your Gmail to a spreadsheet.  Actually, we use a lot of the Google stuff.  For instance, I have a Zapier that automatically, when I favorite an article in my news reader,  automatically bookmarks it on Pinboard, which is a bookmark website,  which automatically sends it to a Google Sheet in a precisely formatted way  so that Karsten can then add it to the show rundowns.  That's all done automatically.  One of the things I love about Zapier is it has multi-step zaps.  It also has all the integrations, over 1500 applications,  software, lots of business integrations.  In fact, it's really great.  If you're in sales, for instance, you could just set it up so that the minute you get a lead,  you engage them, you automatically import new customers,  you notify your team about what you're doing, what your opportunities are.  It works with Salesforce, with your CRM, it works with spreadsheets.  Because it supports multi-step zaps, I love that feature.  You can have one trigger to a bunch of stuff.  We're all in on Slack, it works with Slack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I used it last week during CES.  Did you?  I did. Whenever we had something go up on our YouTube channel,  my Zapier account would grab that information for the YouTube, grab the thumbnail,  and then send it on over to my Buffer account so I could post it out to Twitter  and to LinkedIn automatically because I couldn't keep up when our editing team...  You know, you were doing all this tweeting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't understand how you did that. I should have known.  Zapier, baby.  Should have known.  It made me feel bad. I thought I'd answer out socially.  Zapier.com slash twig. Connect the apps you use the most.  Let Zapier take it for there. There is a free tier.  I'm on a paid tier because I found a thousand ways to use it. It's amazing.  In fact, you inspire me. There's ways.  That's the thing is you talk to people and there's other ways you can use it.  Don't get scared. It's not programming. It's very simple, step by step.  Anybody can do this. In fact, lots of people do.  Four and a half million people use Zapier and on average they save, get this, 40 hours a month.  That's a full work week free without any work on your part at zapier.com slash twig for business,  personal. I just love Zapier. You got to try it.  Zapier, Z-A-P-I-E-R.com slash twig. They've got a free 14 day trial up there for you.  Zapier.com slash twig. It's kind of fun. You get hooked on it and then you start thinking  about other things you can do and all sorts of stuff. I'm looking at those hue lights that  they announced the outdoor lights, Stacy. I want to set up a little extensive zap that'll  do all sorts of things different times of day and so forth. Zapier.com slash twig.  Stacy, what's your thing this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I was going to do the personalized pop socket that my husband gave me for Christmas,  but I'm just kidding. No, does it have your picture on it?  It has my dog's picture on it. And the best part is she's grrr. But this,  you flip it upside down, now she's happy. Happy dog, angry dog. I love it. Okay, but that is not  actually it. Although you can buy customized pop sockets for your loved ones. And I will say that  was the best gift that I think I got. Very sweet. No, my choice this week is a, I saw it at CES  and I'm a heating pad aficionado because I have migraines and I get all this tension and blah,  blah, blah. And I hate being stuck to the cord. I'm constantly, I want to move around,  I want to do things, but instead I just have to sit and watch TV or read The Economist. And  it's just no fun. So a company called Relief Heat makes a heating pad that you strap. It's mostly  for your back. Oh, you strap it around your waist. Father Robert had this. Okay. He brought it in on

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sunday. 160 degrees on your back. I put it on it. It's so hot. I was sweating. Okay. Yeah. It's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  little hot, but yeah, it's battery powered. Yeah. And you control it via your smartphone.  I love this. Yeah, I love this too. Cause I'm like, so I bought one. I'm going to wear it more  around my shoulders. It's not ideal for that, but I'm going to see how it works. But yeah. It's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  designed really to go right in the small of your back. It's just the right size to go right where

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  most people are tense and tight. But I was like, had they had a Relief One design, cause I have a  little, I have a shoulder and neck heating pad that I love for my migraines, but I'm going to  try it because how awesome would it be? Like I could be cooking dinner while wearing this. I  could be doing the show. I just love it. So that is my pick of the week. Tell me the name again.  Relief Heat. Relief Heat. Is it available now? It is available now. Great. In you, there's two  sizes. So make sure you look, there is up to a 40 inch waist and I believe bigger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, if you're bigger, you really do need it. 40 to 60 inch waist. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There you go. What is up with you these days? What do you want to share with us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, my pick is, um, Ms. Patty Mates. And I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly. This is someone  I started following on Instagram. That is P-A-M-A-T-T-E-S on Instagram. And I came across  her from watching another one of my favorite photography resources and she's someone that's  getting started in photography. I love her pictures. She's wanting to step up her photography game  because she's wanting to be better with getting picks for the animal shelter. So she's been  investing a lot of time and trying to learn the world of photography and is really trying to just  make these animals shine on the... So it's studio photography, portraiture, but it's for animals.  But it's for animals. And she doesn't have a lot of followers. So Twig folks, go over there and  give her a follower and just show your support because she's trying to do something really good  with getting all these animals adopted. And she's thinking, you know what? I can't just take regular  drab pictures. I've talked about it on hands-on photography. If you're going to do headshots,  you can give someone a nice headshot or you can give them a mug shot. It's all about the personality  and it's all about what you do as a photographer to make that person shine. Same goes for these  pet portraits. So Patty Mates on Instagram. It's P-A-M-A-T-T-E-S, Instagram.com slash

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  P-A-M-A-T-E-S. I bet it's Mattis. Mattis? Mad Dog Mattis. I don't know. Okay. P-A-M-A-T-T-E-S or maybe  Mattes like lattes. Lattes. I don't know. Jeff Jarvis, a number, sir? So I have a very quick

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  collection of mogul moment numbers. Google is about to hit the trillion dollar valuation club  where Amazon, I mean, where Apple and Microsoft have been. Mark Zuckerberg is now the fifth  richest man in the world. And interesting stuff in this story about the subjects of the movie.  So Eduardo Severin, who complained about losing stock, is worth 12.3 billion. What? So he was the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  guy who was like Mark's roommate and kind of get aced out of it, right? Did he never sued like the  Winklevoss twins? Well, they had a fight. Yeah. And the social network, it felt really bad for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess not. He would have had a 30% stake, which was ridiculous. It was ignorant and naive that Mark  did that. And Dustin Moskovitz, who was the other kind of roommate partner, sold some of his shares,  the fool. Nonetheless, his holdings now are worth 7.2 billion. If he held onto them, it would be

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  worth 27.4 billion. What is the functional difference between having 7 billion and 20 billion?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know, but I'd like to try to find out. You're infinitely rich in either case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me try to find out. Meanwhile, Ed Williams. You can have 20, I'll have 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay. Will you sell the company? Yeah, give us a little bit of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, a little bit. Couple of billion each. So then, Ed Williams, who besides having medium,  has just raised another $271,828,182 for his third raise for his fund.  Oh, not for medium. Total size about $585 billion. No, he has a fund. They owned, the fund owned  9% of Beyond Meat. Oh, is that the Impossible Burger is Beyond Meat? Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it's a different company. Did you have the Impossible Slider, Stacy, at CES?  I've had Impossible Burgers. Apparently the pork is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pork could be easier because it's so spiced. So, Ev invests in world positive startups.  Good for him. Oli Diamond Foundry, which makes diamonds in labs instead of mines.  Plant-based food, Miyako's Kitchen, and AI. Here's the fun part of this one.  The last round was $191,919,191 as a palindrome. Oh, $191,919,1919,191.  This one is again $271,828,182 is a nod to the mathematical constant Euler's number.  Euler's number, yes. Euler, thank you. Yes. Don't look like an idiot.  And then finally, our last global moment of the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You look like an idiot. Don't know Euler's number. My God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Euler's constant. I'm sure people will  abuse me in this audience. E.  And then the last global moment is that Jack Dorsey now eats one meal a day,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  which is more than he used to. Oh, he used to fast a lot, right? He'd like three meals a week.  Yeah, so now he's doing a meal a day. He's looking kind of fat.  I'm going to body shame Jack Dorsey. Jack. No, no, we're not body shaming anyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, but this is a guy you should body shame. No, no, no, you never have to body shame anyone,  even if they're being obnoxious. Nope. What's with the nose ring, Jack?  Let it flutter down like a little good fairy.  Oh, thank you. I used to have a guy I worked with who's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  said, no, no, it's just bad mojo. Don't do it. Bad mojo.  Bad mojo. Some of it's real about his reputation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Also, I did not know how to spell Euler's constant. So thank you, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  E. And I didn't know how to pronounce it. So between the two of us together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I still don't know what the heck you're all talking about, but I'm quite all right with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's E. What does E stand, what does it represent? What is it a constant for, John?  He's got the Wikipedia page up, as we all do right now.  How many show of hands, how many of you opened up Wikipedia? See,  that's why we have a smart audience. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They look it up immediately. So they can show us up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I do. Okay. I confess to something on iPad today. Yesterday.  iOS today. Yesterday. First of all, I don't know the name of the show. That's one.  One of your shows. Some show I do. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you mean? Adam Carolla did that documentary. That's his production.  Adam Carolla made Ford versus Ferrari. That's him. He's done quite a few documentaries out there.  He's a little more prolific than one may think. Wait, Ford versus Ferrari is a documentary?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's not. Oh, okay. But maybe, well, it's a true story. It's a true story. Not a documentary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry. It's based on a true story? Yes, it's true. It's about-  Right. He did Dad. He also did-  Shelby. What is it called? Shelby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Zoferari. And Lea Iacocca is in it. And it's great. Matt Damon plays Carol Shelby and Ken  Miles, who's the race car driver in his play. Beautifully played by Christian Bale. But I confess,  we're watching it. And we're watching it in a group with Lisa, my wife, Lisa's son, Michael,  and Lisa's son's dad, Mike, who is a car guy. Maybe it was I just felt a little bit like I should  be competing. So I'm surreptitiously Wikipedia-ing the story. Oh, no. Really? During the movie?  Yeah. So you're like, oh, yeah, wait, watch what happens here.  During the movie? Come on, man.  Think then what happens. That was bad. I got away with it though.

They were showing cops reruns.  Bad boys, bad boys. It's like, it's embarrassing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it looped people in for some reason.  Oh, sorry for that detour, but I just was amazed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. Well, I think, what was Mike Bloomberg's weird tweet on debate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you didn't see this? His whole account went wacky during the debate.  And the weirdest of all was find Mike's face in the meatball.  And journalists were sure it was hacked and they kept on going to them.  Are you, is the account been hacked? What's going on? And then no. But hey, we got your attention.
