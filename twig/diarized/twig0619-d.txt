I'm not gonna mention it. I'm not gonna talk about it. It's just weird  We I was talking about that with Lisa this morning because I now have a drawer full of white socks  We both bought whites mice whites bought me some white socks  So I now have a lifetime supply and I remember when I was a kid in junior high  They said don't you're not allowed to wear anything but white socks to gym class  Yep, and the and they and they implied that it would somehow poison you if you were  Dark

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, the black socks craze came back in the 90s way back in the day Oh interesting with  The the fab five Michigan basketball team  Bad freshman they wore black socks and they wanted to wear long short pants  So that was their style and I jumped on that bandwagon and I've just been wearing black. Oh, that's cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So there's it's actually thought out  Mm-hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Fascinating and now I feel weird if I wear gray or white socks

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have seen their Gutenberg Bible on many occasions. I really live across the street from it. Is it famous? Oh  It's one of the it's one of two in the two intact Gutenberg's. Yeah, Yale had one at the Beinecke library

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  But I don't think they sold socks  To go with it  I'd work out no socks  These are nice because they're both black and white they get you get the best of both worlds. I dig it  Okay  That's black letter, right? So this is the first

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Twig in history, I think in which we're starting the show with an absolutely empty Google box  Is there nothing in the Google box?  Nothing in the Google box it is empty

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, there's that sounds you something there is a change log we'll get to that  I went looking and Google is involved in our top story. There's what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They got notes they're getting sued. Oh, yeah by the president it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Trump's who's that too?  Well, and what's weird is it's a class-action lawsuit  Twitter Facebook and Google plus CEOs Mark Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey and Sundar Pichai  For banning him and I love I you have to read tech dirt's  Take on this Mike Maznik always great. It can always get dumber. That's the department  Trump sues  Claiming his own government violated the Constitution  There it's a lawsuit in the state of Florida

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Count one, of course, where else would it be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Count one says that Twitter Facebook and Google's YouTube removing Trump from their platforms violates the First Amendment, which of course  Constitutional scholars or even some dim bulbs who've just read the damn thing will note that the Constitution only forbids the government from  Making any law rich free speech. So unless  Somehow well actually a little later in the suit. He does kind of assert that Facebook Twitter and YouTube are the government

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, which is because on the basis of section 230, which is what he wants to  Remove by the suit

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, he says that these private companies violated his First Amendment rights by conspiring with the government he led at the time  To platform him. I mean this will be immediately thrown out. But of course, there's will it?  Yeah, oh, yeah, the judges will just as the judge threw out the the or at least the Florida thing  The Florida thing  Put out

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He got what he wanted which is exactly what we're doing right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I'm raising the attention and fundraising and raising yeah, because immediately emails went out to all the donors saying help  You know President Trump fight the good fight and it's a good way to make money  the second claim  Says that it wants to clear it towards a judgment the section 230 our much revered section 230 of the  Communications Decency Act is itself or is no it's not communications decency acts telecommunication

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the funny. This is the funny thing in the suit  They call it the Community Decency Act when it is in fact the Community Decency Act Jeff Kossoff  And I traded this on Twitter. I said well, of course I have argued for a long time

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Community is community. Yeah  They claim that it's unconstitutional and censoring  plaintiff and the class  Defendants relied upon an active pursuant to section 230 of the Communications Decency Act  Defendants would not have deplatformed plaintiff or similarly situated  putative class members  But for the immunity purportedly offered by section  230 it might have been in fact quite the opposite as Mike Maznik on the Tector points out because had  These companies not had immunity from lawsuits. They might have banned him faster. Yes, not not slower faster faster  Back to the as Mike Maznik calls it lull suit

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Let's see

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  By the way and and this was the argument in favor of Florida's social media  Moderation law and that of course was thrown out of court  But at least there there was an injunction was first laughed at in court. Yeah, and then yeah  Let's see, there's a ton of other garbage rights Mac mostly performative  Performative throat clearing none of that really matters beyond the two laughably dumb claims  Mike wrote writes. I did want to call out a few really really stupid points though in the Twitter lawsuit  Trump's lawyers misleading a site the night First Amendment Institute suit against Trump for blocking users. This is a suit they won  Because they said the president can't block users on Twitter if he's going to use his account to make official statements  in the in the pleadings  Trump's attorneys wrote in Biden versus Knight the Supreme Court discussed wasn't the court as Mike points out. It was  Clarence Thomas  discussed the Second Circuit's decision  Holding the plaintiff's threads on Twitter from his personal account were in fact official presidential statements made in a public forum  Likewise president Trump would discuss government activity in Twitter on his official capacity  so

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What's weird is

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  In the night case  President Trump's argument was that his account his Twitter account was not his official account  Was his personal account that was his argument for saying I need to be able to block people because it's my personal account  Now he says oh no this is my official government  This is my government account  Point being he's a private citizen now. I think he might have had a case when he was president, but he's not now  He's a private citizen and I just I can't have had what case would he possibly?  There's no compelled speech. I guess yeah, in fact that would be a violation of the First Amendment  Yes, the federal government said you cannot ban you must carry this. Yeah, you must carry government speech. Yeah, that's right  These are private companies, that's a good point. So he says in  Clause 82 it goes on very long time folks. He said that that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Relying on the permissible language of section 230 a statements of actions of Democrat legislators  Those legislators made it clear they had a strong preference for censoring the views of the da da da for example  COVID-19 air quotes millions of people  For example  COVID-19 air quotes misinformation including the lack of safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine and the use of face masks  COVID-19 originated in the Wuhan province of China was a transmission from scientists in a government and  Questioning the integrity and results of the 2020  Presidential oh he actually got that in too. He did it got it all in it's a it's the greatest hits

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's amazing I mean it's greatest this information hits yeah, it means so there you go, there's the lawsuit you tweeted about it a little bit  Jeff  earlier today, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Love it that they they called it the

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Community Decency Act. Yeah  When he said  I love it that they they called it the  The Community Decency Act. Yeah  When he said

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Paragraph 51 the comments generated by plaintiffs Facebook posts also give rise to important public discussion and debate about government policy  Typically his posts would generate thousands of replies posted by users some of which would generate  Hundreds or thousands of replies in return all of them, of course incredibly intelligent  President Trump's account was a digital town hall in which the president of the United States  Communicated with music here communicated news and information to the public directly members of the public use the reply function  To respond directly to President Trump and his office. That's untrue. That's all true  That's exactly true. I don't know how it protects

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  his  Well, it's it's just a ridiculous characterization

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not it's not untrue. I mean, that's where that's how the was a discussion of policy, but well

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Policy but well, yeah there was I mean he might not have read it but there certainly was in response to it  Makes any difference in terms of whether a private company can say  Anybody know nobody has the right even even the former president of states to have an account on Twitter Facebook or YouTube  I mean, that's I don't know how you can how any government held speech is not free speech  So  It's just a complete misunderstanding of I guess the Constitution, but we'll see what the courts do with this  There is a there is a slap loss  law on the books in  Florida so  That might allow Twitter. It'd be very interesting if Twitter Facebook and Google are or their respective CEOs  counter sued asking for legal costs

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would want nothing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really? Yeah, first the corporate lawyers have to stop laughing. Yeah on zoom. Yeah, and then figure out what's there

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  By the way, the president's team did launch a new social network  I didn't mention it last week which the former president please the former president  Get her G E T T R launched by one of his former  spokespeople Jason Miller immediately hacked. I mean literally  The day launched compromised it got compromised the day it launched and then  shortly after  Information about all of the account holders was exfiltrated. Oh boy, so  Maybe they want to work on their security a little bit  Parler got hacked remember Twitter's been hacked but not not quite so  Dramatically and certainly not on its first day. You know his first day  Geez in other on Twitter's first day. It just was down for most of it  First day nobody knew she that's the real truth Twitter took a while to take off  All right moving right along Pentagon has canceled the Jedi cloud contract  This this this was another  This this was another  somewhat political decision the Pentagon needed a  New secure cloud for all of branches of the service  All the different services they bid it out  Google  Microsoft Amazon and Oracle all tried I think did Walmart try to try to get on this to  Everybody tried to get in on it  Eventually was awarded to Microsoft Amazon promptly sue saying the president former president had his thumb on the scale because he didn't like Jeff Bezos  And it's taken so long now because of the suits that the Pentagon just threw up its hands and said, you know what forget it  It's just dragging out. So we're gonna try something else, which they should have tried in the first place was which is a multi cloud  Solution

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, okay saying you should do multi cloud in the first place from going to your own disparate systems instead of to one cloud  That's like saying you know what instead of for my first house. I'm gonna buy a house  I instead I'm gonna buy an entire apartment complex live in it manage it and offer the first floor as

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  But it is the Pentagon and I think they probably have the resources to buy a bigger house

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They have the money they don't have the expertise well

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's why and in fact wouldn't you prefer that instead of having just Microsoft or just Google or just Amazon doing it having?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The best minds three companies. No, I have seen so many in the years. I have covered cloud computing  I've seen many a good company try to build their own cloud and fail utterly. It's very hard  But go for it Pentagon and just because in many companies are like I am IBM  I can do it right cannot

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  well the new  JWCC  Which I'm trying to find with that acronym joint warfighter cloud capability  Will be a multi-vendor contract this time they're gonna bid it out again  and they said  Actually Google's been left out. They said they're gonna ask for proposals from both Amazon and micro Microsoft  Saying they're the only cloud service providers that can meet its needs

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it may be half so basically Amazon threw a tantrum and they're like fine  Just do it this way. This is our government's problem. We don't stick to our guns  Sorry, I just  Well, yeah

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Microsoft said that the legal fight over the Jedi contract was evidence that their reform was needed in the process

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I hate agreeing with Microsoft but dang I agree with they and they won the process

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So even they knew what a mess it was. Yeah. Yeah, they were like this is gonna suck

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So it's a big contract a billion dollar a year contract for ten years  I don't know what the the JWCC  Dollar amount will be but it's a big important contract  Amazon stock up  Microsoft stock down on the news  But it could be for other things could be for lots of things

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We don't yeah, and I don't mean it's a big deal that AWS revenue

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  have you said have you seen any big changes in Amazon over the last couple of days because  Jeff Bezos is no longer CEO Andy Jassy's in charge  It's a different company. Actually one of the things right before Jeff Bezos stepped down on Monday  They did add a couple more bullet points to their leadership principles  Which  Maybe were  Designed to make it seem like a more  Responsible and caring company  The new leadership principles strive to be the earth's best  employer and  That's new. That's new success and scale bring broad  Responsibility the new principles require employees to take into account the well-being of their co-workers and society  Beyond the company's walls of making decisions  They also address persistent criticisms of the company as a bruising workplace and inconsiderate corporate citizen  This was something Bezos kind of alluded to in his last shareholder letter  But I think this is a response to the criticism Amazon's been getting and I wonder if this is something Andy Jassy had a hand in

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But didn't I also see a story from Bezos  debunking the whole work-life balance thought  Called it a fallacy you can't have both

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And by the way, I'm taking my money and I'm going into space. Bye. Bye. Yep. See you  That's how you find work-life balance you quit  Yeah, I don't know, you know, I think this was within a week it's widely considered that Amazon is a well-run company from the  Corporate governance point of view, but I think there's also a lot of thought that maybe it's not the best company for its employees  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  At least they're discussing it. That's yeah  Principles. Yeah, so now let's just get the ball rolling and have some action on it. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So be interesting to see  What what Andy Jassy does with Amazon? I imagine it's you know, hold the course but at some point

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the stock went up like mad and that's not because it was Bezos last day that the stock market things two days ahead  I don't know why I could

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The government contract like was something that valuable can't be no it isn't that valuable. I don't know. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Don't understand the stock market is  Stacy knows that I I believe it's disconnected from reality

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's I don't think it's yeah, I think you're probably right and let us I but I can't believe that it's totally divorced from reality

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I could be wrong. Well now the reddit has arrived. It's totally divorced

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's less reddit and more the fact that young people can trade stocks easily on Robin Hood now that now that don't blame young people

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Come on. Yeah. Yeah, play more and buff it just as much

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Maybe I don't yeah, I guess that's when you look at GameStop and AMC and you know  The diamond hands on reddit that maybe that is because it got cheaper and easier to trade those meme stonks meme stonks  Let's take a little break and then we'll go to the empty Google section

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where we sit in silence I look like four or five times I went back to search Google News for news on Google and and

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  The cover there. There's just not a lot. There's not a lot of news in any for any of the shows

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, Stacy. This this this is just proving Leo's point last week that Google's now boring

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  by the way Robin Hood has filed for an IPO if you want to talk a little bit about Robin Hood and  Yeah, this is this is according to the walls  The filing which was released on Thursday  Robin Hood disclosed that 81% of its revenue in the first quarter came from sending its customers stock options and cryptocurrency orders to high-speed  Trading firms in other words, they got payment for order flow  That's because remember Robin Hood doesn't charge you a commission for trading. They have to make money  Somewhere but PFOF which is an excellent acronym  payment for order flow PFOF  Makes it possible for Robin

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fofo Fofo Fofo  Germans would say as they say in the German fluff fluff

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Let's  Customers place trade with no upfront Commission payments and that's one of the ways they get younger less affluent customers  It's the standard practice now many competitors because Robin Hood set the bar  payment for order flow critics  including  security Exchange Commission chairman Gary Gensler  Don't like the practice. They say it poses a conflict of interest for brokerages  Because the brokers can either collect more money for selling their customers order flow or  Pass that money on to customers in the form of price savings on their trades  I've always heard that one of the problems  With using Robin Hood is they make money on the spread but I guess really where they make money is PFOF and the order  payment for order flow  so  interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're learning paper for order flow is telling people what's been ordered

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  No on a timely basis though you you so you I take your order for a stock and then I offer it to  to somebody a trader and  but what I do is I say well who's gonna give me the most money for this order and  Stacey's I'll give you a buck for it and that's my money. Yeah, it's kind of like kayak. Yeah, the problem is  Why does Stacey take that order why does  Where does that money come from? Well, my opinion and I may be wrong on this correct me  Please is it comes from the spread so these high-speed trading firms  Maybe don't have the most advantageous spread from the point of view the person buying the stock, you know if I if I go to a  White shoe financial, you know broker  They'll give me a price, you know when I sell my stock they'll say okay you you made a buck a share  But I may only make 50 cents a share from another trader  And if Robin Hood is choosing the trader that pays them the most money  It's likely they're also choosing the trader that has the worst spread from the point of view the consumer  So it's a trading desk for trades. Yeah, and so you may say as a consumer. Well, hey, this is great  No commission, but the price you're getting the price you're paying for a stock or the price  You're getting paid when you sell a stock is not going to be as good as it should be because they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Getting at the price from one of these but is that increment that you're losing more than the Commission was?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's an interesting question that's a good question real calculation

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's it's less of a huge  It's less of a huge spread thing and more of a scale thing and being able the the bigger your chunks because the the big  Trading firms they have to move  They don't trade in small like like 10 10 shares right they're aggregating and moving right so I  Feel like there's an advantage to them to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  PFOF is illegal in the UK. There are countries that ban it  Because for a variety of reasons it is not illegal currently in the United States  Although some Democrats on Capitol Hill are considering  Making it illegal  Prohibiting PFOF might force says the journal might force some brokerages to abandon zero commission  trading I  think you know the issue is if  You're buying a million shares for 35 bucks Commission  Or you're buying one share for 35 bucks Commission that makes a big difference and the spread makes a much bigger difference for you  If you're trading a lot of shares, I don't know well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I just found an entire paper called the good the bad and the ugly of payment for order flow  Oh, it came out in May from

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So I'm gonna do an ad while you read that and report back  Miss Higginbotham your assignment should you choose to accept it?  Is to explain?  Why PFOF could or least read that first handy first paragraph?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's more than any of us  You're way beyond anything we would

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Payment for order flows existed for decades says the journal  The SEC has reviewed the practice several times and allowed it to continue  To date they've accepted the argument put forward by many brokers and traders is sending retail orders to high-speed traders benefits  Small investors proponents of PFOF say investors save money when their orders are routed to such trading firms  Compared to what they'd get at exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange or a Nasdaq

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's interesting. They're actually talking about it being part of  Being becoming part of a pool of what they call unpublished liquidity  That means that people don't understand the actual cost of buying and selling the stock  High-tech right these people get kind of an information advantage

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's what I was thinking yes, yeah high-speed traders the smallest advantage can make a huge difference, right? Oh, that's interesting. Okay  All right, well, this is beyond my

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that was a bit of a but you know, I can I can send a link to the paper to somebody if they want it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somebody because you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there you go that was that was one of his  The practice of PFOF began decades ago was mainstream by the controversial figure Bernie Madoff him made off himself  Who once justified paying retail brokers by comparing the practice to hiring salespeople on commission to bring order flow to a broker?

We talked about it yesterday on security now  This is Kaseya which provides monitoring services for  Managed service providers who provide it in IT services for small businesses  We use a managed service provider for instance  Means that this is a great leverage point because if you can get these managed service providers  You know you get into each of their customers you might get hundreds per MSP  the CEO of Kaseya  Estimates anywhere from 800 to 1500 people have been ransomware  So far the biggest most notable  supermarket Swedish supermarket chain co-op or is it coupe closed 800 stores  Because they couldn't accept any money because their cash registers were down  This is the Reval ransomware gang if you're interested in this stuff Steve goes into this in detail  This week he talks a lot about the Kaseya and Reval next week. He's gonna talk about  Some of their software the the actual encryption software is gonna do a deep dive which will be very interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What does he recommend for protection? I know we've talked about this before where you're kind of screwed  But is there anything these companies?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah  You know there is no magic bullet in  Security and he talks about this. It's a layered process of having a great backup is certainly a start  But it's not the only thing training your employees. You got to do that too  and  Honestly, you know a lot of times the problem really is the IT department knows what to do, but they're not well-funded  Funded  It's a it's a cost center for the from the point of view of the board and the executives and they just under fund them  They don't take it seriously enough until they get bit  Maybe now they're gonna start taking it a little bit more seriously and then then sometimes just the executive order

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, oh, sorry, go ahead the executive order that Biden signed May 12th is something that's going to apply  to some of these cases, so this was their effort to  You  Saw what I'm looking for. He created a task force, right?  I don't know. He actually signed an executive order that is going to require people to so it requires  NIST and CESA to  They have 90 days to come up  Well, the executive order takes effect 90 days from May 12th when he issued it  But they have up to a year to come up with policies to prevent supply chain attacks and software  As a result of solar winds and so some of the things now what's unclear or there's lots of things that are unclear  but one of the things that's kind of a little wonky about it is  Your from the day the order was  Adopted so May 12th your stuff has to be compliant, but we don't actually know all the rules yet  Like even it is just actually released some crucial definitions just last week

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Reporting requirements, which really is a big part of it. It's like the  breach reporting requirements that GDP are introduced a lot of times people don't want to admit this is happening and that lack of information  Really allows this stuff to spread a lot farther a lot faster  So some of this is you have to report if you have if you are breached  Service like you need to collect information  Yeah, this is this is good I'm looking at the the order  I mean, it's just an executive order and so there's some question about how much can be  Done like is this like the whole

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Sarbanes-Otsley  Movement from teen years ago. Yeah a little bit. Huh? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  He also part of the order was modernizing federal government cyber security  Because they've been bit in the past by supply chain solar winds, you know hit a lot of cabinet level departments  So yeah, there's definitely stuff that needs to be done. I think it's more than an executive order, but it's certainly it's a start

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  From what I remember with socks was the the whole audit scare  Where I worked at it seems like we were always  Dealing with some auditor and was gonna face X amount of dollars if this wasn't in compliance and yada yada yada  So it's just a scare  Socks did up to reporting requirements. Yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, yeah, these things will have consequences but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would argue that you know, they implement it's of course you're getting around socks now by implementing SPACs  So I'm kind of like we are we gonna adapt? Yes, but  This is going to be a good thing overall because it does encourage defense in depth  There's some things in here that could lead to adoption of software bills of materials  There's a lot to like here  Uh biden is meeting with officials of casea

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  To talk about this, you know casea and this is actually the most shocking thing  Was told of the cyber security flaw in april  And did nothing  See that should be illegal. They need to you know, yeah  I mean if you're a managed service provider, that is literally your job

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean if you're a managed service provider, that is literally your job

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I mean they were told about this april 6 by the dutch institute for vulnerability disclosure  Um, they uh, cause say it acclimbed to comment on the timeline  Uh, but I think that uh, it's pretty clear that they they they were told about it and did they work on patching it? Um,  Because say the they say uh, they responded once they were notified and worked quickly to  Issue two patches one in april and one in may  But they they weren't enough

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, well, okay, then they tried. Yeah. Well, that's weird because they are literally a patch management  I'm like if anyone you you're like, come on man

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, um  Biden is going to meet with senior officials, uh  Today to discuss this  daily, huge of ransomware attacks. You remember he he brought it to putin  During their summit during their non-summit summit  Saying, you know, you we got to work out a deal not to attack infrastructure  It's unclear how much  The russian government has to do with these attacks, although many of them do come from criminal groups operating within their borders  hackers  Republican national committee yesterday disclosed that one of its contractors had been breached by hackers  But that no data was accessed  Hackers affiliated with the svr russia's foreign intelligence service are believed to be responsible for that breach  So it is it is getting bad out there  I encourage you if you're if you're interested in this stuff to listen to our security now show because  We deal with the we deal with this a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In great detail and it's it's kind of I mean what we're getting to is the ability to destroy  Basic infrastructure without having to spend billions on it's the new warfare tanks or yeah  I was I was reading um, there was a fun article in a foreign policy this weekend  about um  artificial intelligence on drones, so basically turkey I think just  Killed some people without  By flying a drone a weaponized drone that actually targeted people using ai as opposed to having a human in the loop  So they took the human out of the loop for the first time and that's a pretty significant step. Yeah  And that brings that kind of I mean the consumerization of technology brings that to like anybody  but I don't know if there's like you can a treaty is not going to help there because  There's enough people who would pay for that and it's kind of like arms dealers and how they live in this like  gray area

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I don't know and how do you feel about instagram saying we're no longer a photo sharing app

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Um  I'm okay with it, but there's there's quite a lot of people in the photography community  That's a little bit concerned and I get it  But at the same time I get it where instagram is coming from as well because things are changing and you see the  The prowess that tiktok has I mean, it's got mr. Jarvis hooked on it. So it must be good, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the musicals

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Me too, that's why I deleted it because it's a time sync it's it's seductive  Adam monseri the ceo of instagram posted an instagram video  He said uh how people connect with their close friends has changed a lot over the last five years or so  And has moved primarily to messaging and away from feed  and stories  projects  He says I want to start by saying we're no longer a photo sharing app or a square photo sharing app  They use instagram people we find people use instagram to be entertained. That's the phrase right there, right?  So  Because let's be honest  There's some really serious competition out right now tiktok is huge youtube is even bigger and there's lots of other upstarts as well  I think some of this goes back to the original founders of instagram leaving when abu facebook bought them  Kevin cistrum and company stayed there for a while but left not so long ago  Adam monseri who's a facebook guy was put in charge. This clearly is facebook's agenda now  Instagram was started by photo by photography lovers  It was about sharing photos, but they're gone  And now it's facebook's agenda, right and facebook's agenda is tiktok's huge. What are we going to do?  And things change

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  right  But I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, but  That doesn't mean that that there's something wrong with having a photo sharing app that people love  I don't think that there's anything wrong with instagram. I think instagram is being changed because of facebook's corporate need  to attack a competitor  Not because its audience is demanding. Oh you can't no these photos. They're so boring

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't think the audience is demanding and I think that's what the audience is showing  If you look at the average person and apparently they've done it in their analytics  Well, they say they have yeah, I don't buy it just scrolling through and scrolling through I can walk through and look at the  Users here in my home when they're on instagram. They are literally just flip flip flip flip flip  I hardly ever see them stop unless it's a video  But why make instagram into a tiktok clone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You know, that's what you got tiktok for

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There don't why should we stop printing our newspaper people like the newspaper. They like the smell of it  They like the feel of it. What's this this internet thing? No, no, no, no, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  No, i'm not saying look i'm not saying that I think I'm saying that in that face my opinion facebook is modifying this  for its own commercial purposes they're worried about  competition from tiktok  Not because the users are demanding it they're saying there's hand-waving saying all your users are demanding it  But I think the fact that instagram is a great photo sharing app. Why are why turn it into tiktok?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could still share photos there now you do something that's the thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They didn't say they're not going to have photos available to be shared on there. Sorry about my voice  You still can post your photos in in four by five or square image if you want to but  Where instagram is going to make its money is for people stopping and engaging on your video content your motion content

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So there's an opportunity then for somebody to create a a new instagram. I would say

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's what flickr was so successful. We've gone through this before leo. We loved flickr. Isn't that what flickr is for?  And and flickr was in a sustainable business and it got screwed up because of instagram, I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But but now i was before that instagram dominated instagram dominated the photo sharing space completely  Twitter is starting to see a growth in the photography community. Um  You know how twitter gives you those different hashtags and groups to follow and things like that and  I'm seeing more and more people and going there and engaging and basically saying you know what I like this better  Than my experience in instagram because of the engagement here about my photos and it's not necessarily just people  Just thumbing through and saying nice shot. There's more of an engagement for them  I'm not seeing that yet, but I can't say i've put a lot of effort in photography on the twitter side  But you know, i'm just it's a small  instagram account

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean I don't I don't really have a dog in this hunt either so  I don't really care but  uh  You know, I think instagram had a lot to be said for it and it's slowly over time, especially since the facebook  Acquisition turned into really an advertising vehicle  Uh, they've increased the number of ads now it used to be what every ninth image now  It seems to be every that's why they got bought because they

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think a newsman off. Yeah  I think um  with instagram it all depends on what the user's goals are from a  photographer's standpoint if your goals are to just  Show off your stuff for the family then it may be fine if your goals are to try to  Drive business and yeah, you may want to rethink using instagram to drive business and start to  Work the algorithm if you will  uh, I look at my feed and I have a mix of photos and a mix of videos and sometimes those videos have  Nothing to do with photography. A lot of times the videos are just stuff of my family's usually something of the hardheads and their achievements  But those things get a lot of engagement  even though my  Use of instagram is all about being a digital content creator

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, yeah, so I just put up a great casey newton says every us social network is tripping over itself to copy tiktok  And tiktok is just like, uh linkedin  They just put up a new thing here. I put it on um  resumes on tiktok

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So ben thompson talks a little bit about this and he says tiktok has been  tough for facebook and instagram to respond to  Uh for three reasons first if instagram has been defined by sharing moments  tiktok has been about  Manufacturing them with easy to use tools that commoditize creation. I'd agree 100% with that  He says also tiktok has defined a new format  Which is something different than a scrollable feed or or even tappable stories both of which instagram has  swipeable videos that are a meld of both  Tiktok provides both an endless feed and a full screen immersive experience. That's easily navigable. I agree they solved that one  But I think the biggest one of all he says tiktok isn't really a social network at all  No, which freed the service to surface the most compelling content from anywhere in the world  Most of the time you spent until you deleted it stacey was probably not on the people you followed  But on the four you page  Right it was on the for you page just watching random stuff. Yeah random stuff the algorithm picked for you  Not it's not in other words. It's not a social network. It's an entertainment  network  And it does it really well. I mean it really it it demonstrates  Uh the that the youtube model which is you get everybody to make content for you then you use an algorithm to surface  the most uh appealing content  The stickiest content it it took that and made it. I mean really weaponized it with short clips

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it added in the important layer of collaboration, which is social it's social

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Less collaboration than I used to though. Did you notice that? I think that's what you click on like I I see still lots of  Collaboration. I mean, yes, it's probably less but far as tiktok. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, the collapse has started to fade away  Uh, I think people still see him. Yeah, I mean they're I see him but not nearly as much and maybe it is the algorithm  And it's what i'm seeing  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know my concern with naked women leo. I mean I try I try I do my best to collaborate

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I do my best. Hey, honey, you want to collaborate?

I guess so it's good. It's

Speaker: SPEAKER_09

I've been a tiktok creator since 2018  In 2020 I became a tiktok college represent for spelman college  Where I attend as an engineering major. I love to create art. That's kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe I should do that  You know if I were a cio and i'm looking for a developer a certain type of person  Yeah, right to build an in-house custom application for the company. I'm probably not going to look no  at tiktok  if I were  You know a hiring  Representative at adobe that's looking for someone to help synergize the product and work with promotion and things like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That makes sense here. You're looking for a young person with a certain kind of skill set. Yeah, because this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm just throwing this out there  Any like if you're one of those people who's focused on culture fit or you don't want to hire older people or you don't want to hire  Black people this is going to be harder to avoid. I mean  If you've got biases, you're gonna be like  Well, I don't want this person. They're ugly. Yeah  So that is something i'm like, oh  I don't know  I mean, obviously we don't have blind hiring in the u.s today  so it doesn't matter but just throwing that out there is like  uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, but I can remember the days of doing resumes because I don't remember the last time I did a resume but  the  Story was to make your resume stand out from the rest of them out there. I tend to remember people  Having the taboo of using like canary yellow paper and stuff like that  Just because they wanted to stand out and I guess this is just another iteration of that  For people trying to get into the workforce, I don't know. Yeah, it all just seems generational to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Instead of it's more like a cover letter not a resume, right? So your your resume is supposed to be okay  That makes more sense. This is your chance to be like hey, i'm stacy and I love the internet of things  Here's some crazy visuals about that and you should hire me because of this and then the resume will be like oh  And I did all this boring stuff too do that one more time

Yeah, that don't just  The video now has seven hundred and eight thousand views  Ha ha ha and the anti-police terror project from all the publicity now has 1.1 million  subscribers just growing so  Maybe that's not the best strategy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or metallica

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Metallica would have taken him down. Look the deputy even says you can record all you want  I just know it won't be posted to youtube because of their uh,  copy protection

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Plus the protesters were great. They didn't go overboard. They just  Let it roll and let it roll

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  There it looks like they're bringing them coffee

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, if I remember anyways due to uh, someone  Having a scuffle with the police and I believe they lost their life and they had mental health issues and these these people were out there  to show support for the family and peacefully protest and they had a banner up and  The police said you need to take that banner down and it's just a mess a bunch of mess. Well, yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Don't play taylor's sweep music  It's not gonna help  In fact, you might even get more views and more attention basically. Yeah, so they call it the strisand effect exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ah exactly whoops has taylor had any response? Oh, i'm sure she she's i'm sure she loves it maybe

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe well taylor doesn't talk a lot about those kind of things. She she wades very judiciously. Yeah, but when she does

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Stand back. Yeah, she she got involved in georgia and it made a big difference. So  Yep, by the way, mozilla's done a little study  About youtube regrets  they did a  survey of  2,000 youtube users  It's funny and sad. It's funny and sad  the the headline is that uh  People who the the regretted seeing videos  Most likely watch those videos because of youtube's recommendation engine  Yeah  so uh, yeah  We wouldn't have seen it otherwise, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Conversations I have with my daughter which is  You can't unsee things so  Be very judicious on and we talked about the algorithms and what they feed up so you can be kind of aware

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So this was an interesting they made an extension the mozilla regrets reporter browser extension for firefox and chrome  That's how they got so many  reports between july 2020 and may 2021  Um, and I guess when you saw a video you regretted seeing you were supposed to  Click it and they say why most of the videos people regret watching come from recommendations  youtube recommends videos that violate their own policies  non-english speakers are hit the hardest  And and of course youtube regrets can alter people's lives forever  they say  And I kind of agree with this urgent action must be taken to rein in youtube's algorithm  It's their secret sauce, but uh, I think they could maybe do a better job

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Always true, but we also didn't on the other end of that spectrum. You have a youtube user such as myself that  Loves the way it serves up content for me

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So you so you would do you have the autoplay turned on and you'll just let it go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Most of the time interesting and I even watch it downstairs on the tv, you know because it's I get a lot of good  I do

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You know I do notice that that is one of the big ways young people watch youtube is they'll put it on the tv

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And let it roll. Yeah, and then I also do likes and dislikes on certain videos  That don't necessarily hit the mark for me  but most of the time the content that served up to me is pretty topical or pretty funny or

I did like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I mean look how ripped he is as a result. Yeah. Yeah, see it works  Uh, I do I think this is interesting norway has passed a law  That requires influencers to label their photos on instagram if they've been retouched  Because interesting isn't that interesting not because they have some you know devotion to the  integrity of the photo but because they're concerned that people are  Uh judging themselves based on the body types of people they see on instagram

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They require the same thing out of vogue magazine and people magazine  Every photo is retouched

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's a lot of those magazines actually have gone into voluntary standards around retouching. That's good

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Advertisements where a body's shape size or skin has been retouched even  Through a filter before a photo is taken we'll need a standardized label designed by the norwegian ministry of children and family affairs  Now they're saying advertisements  But I guess if you're an influencer anything you post is kind of an ad is that it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So i'm a teenager. I have a zit on my nose  And why not let me get rid of the zit on my nose? Okay, hold on hold on

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They want you to say it because a lot of these people a lot of the people we've grown we we now understand  magazines  Alter images too. We've had so many conversations about that a lot of influencers  Pointed they they're selling their authenticity. Yeah, so if you think about them selling that this is their actual life  It's the same reason why they're the f t c made them put like sponsored on it because  Yeah  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  People thought they really liked this stuff. The norwegian word is copse pres, which is literally body pressure  Uh, it's it it the proposal is if you post and get paid for that post on facebook instagram snapchat tiktok and twitter  and your  Photo has enlarged lips narrowed waists exaggerated muscles  Then you need to label it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the stars get to do this and the real people don't I remember when  My partner at the launches of ew and a condonette and a precarious the brilliant johan feeney  Sat me down one day and said jeff. Why is there a fragrance credit for the cover photo on vogue?  I don't know because somebody paid for it. It's an ad. Yeah, right. It's an ad and um  You know we look at at at how things are manipulated in all ways visually and otherwise  in media  And so but we leave them alone  But now the real people get a chance to maybe live a little bit differently  Maybe it's maybe maybe photo touching is my version of cosplay or something, but I get the points about  Saying love yourself as yourself  But it's also about imagining yourself differently and now this has all been made to be something that's bad for you  Maybe it's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You just have to label it by the way  Not according to the norwegian daily news paper  The regulation has been positively received by a number of influencers in norways  When one even arguing that it should apply to all retouched photos, I mean, I think that's the direction I would go is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Make everyone be labeled. Meanwhile, how how pink am I in my video today? Is it better? Yeah  It is actually i've used my app to change it. Yeah, I see

Speaker: SPEAKER_11

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and it it covered a huge space it covers  Seven feet by almost four feet. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You have you have as they say designed your personal oasis  It was very nice nano leaf  Dot me if you want to know  more jeff a number

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  so, um  4.3 billion. Holy cow. That's a big number. That is the spack  IPO number the valuation now for next door  A company that never should have started because newspapers should have figured this out ages and ages ago how to start this on their own  they were too damn stupid and they left open the opportunity and and um  Folks came in and figured it out  And did a much better job. I think I think it's very good. I had meetings with  Nirav tolya, that's his name right who was the founder co-founder?  Uh, I had meetings with them in a newspaper company years ago and they kind of said we don't really need the newspaper  You know, you're just another marketing place. You know, you're manipulated. I'm not so sure they were right  so it's a spack from  um  uh  Vinod  kosla  Um, they had received 270 million  I'm sorry  No, they received yeah raised over 270 million from venture capitalists most recently at a 2.2 billion dollar valuation  Including benchmark raylock and shasta now. It's a 4.3 billion dollar  Spack  And in the deck they say that they are in one in three us households or rather the households are in next door  60 plus million verified neighbors. This was the key. It was verified local identity  That was the whole thing you had to have verified you got a post you literally got a postcard of your house  Saying yes, that's me. I didn't have to do that when I joined if somebody else vouched for you  But if you tried to get in they had they had a backup postal system because they really want people, uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  To be members who are in the neighborhood

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, yes, and they've expanded pretty greatly the definition of neighborhood, but be that as it may  uh 27 million weekly active neighbors  or wands  um and  Yeah, I know, uh  At least they don't have a company song  Uh, so I think it's an impressive company that's done well and yes some neighborhoods aren't as pleasant as other neighborhoods  And yes, there are jerks in the world and some of them are on next door  Uh, but it's interesting one of the things interesting to me was I think they try to make themselves the unsocial network  Because they compared themselves  uh differently to  um  82 percent of next door users did not visit snap in the last month  64 linkedin 63 twitter  Uh, 27 Facebook or messenger, right?  That they're trying to say our people are different people. They aren't in all those  Yucky places, uh, it's just like google saying don't call us a platform. Don't don't you know mix this in with them. They got cooties  um  Uh, and so it's doing well. They have a uh, you know a ceo who was at snap. Um  Sarah fryer who replaced nerov golya and um  Um, uh, they're doing well, so congratulations to them should have been newspapers, but it wasn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Hmm  Uh, yeah, i'm just looking i'm looking at my uh  At my next door. Uh, let's see. Here's somebody one warning about a a plumber  uh  Who ripped her off the mountain lion has he been caught yet? Do we know? I don't know  Uh, if you're here's what to do if you encounter a mountain lion  Um  We get a lot of those too  It says offer any handy small children run away while lion eats  Wait a minute. Okay. You can't trust everything you read smart

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Uh, yes, I have to be the fastest just firework to the next person

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Hey certain neighbors, thanks for setting off the illegal fireworks. My dog is now terrified. You are a selfish jerk

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Uh, yeah a lot of that on twitter. Yeah, I think you're reading my next door

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We have the mountain lion discussion. We have yeah, it's probably very I would imagine they're all pretty similar

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Uh, you get advertisements for homes for sale in your neighborhood, right?  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We had a bunch of extra boxes. My wife went on next door and said anybody want them?  Uh, so I have to recycle them and boom somebody came and said thanks. He saved us 40 bucks in boxes  They just picked them up. Yeah, here's a fox eating somebody's chicken

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Uh, so a little punk say everywhere. Yeah, they like chickens, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But so do I so if you were a fox you would be in the chicken capital of the world

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Exactly, where else would you be why they moved there free moving boxes? Yeah, it's kind of boring, but it's kind of useful  That's the point that's the point it's it's intentionally boring  54 percent of my neighbors are on this  Actually  That I think it's more than that. It says I have 144 neighbors  Out of 140 166 households, so it sounds like almost everybody. It's there's at least one person from almost every household

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So when I started my neighborhood in hurricane sandy they said and I went for my street  Rather we live on because we're out here in the middle of nowhere next to trump, you know golf course  um  There's only so many people I actually knew they said no, no, that's not enough neighbors  I said well if I if I get enough neighbors for what you want me to i'm going three miles away people  I don't know you want me to verify people and  Right, so it was they were kind of mixed up in the early days and then now indeed. It's a much broader area  Because they want enough interactivity  Uh, if you're in silicon valley people have very active, you know palo alto is just insanely active  So that's all you need is is part of palo alto  But another area is they expand it  They also have expanded so you have your home neighborhood and then your vacation home neighborhood and then your work neighborhood or whatever else you want  But the secret to this was when I when I talked to neurotolio the co-founder  He said yeah, he said I couldn't believe the newspapers didn't figure out that the whole point was verified identity and social networks  Didn't figure out verified identity  And they found their niche and they built a huge company on it

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Here's another interesting thing you can see which of your neighbors  This is my area and which of the neighbors are signed up. The green ones are signed up. The pink ones are not  So you can actually social jerks. Well, you can even see like oh hey peggy and rolf aren't signed up  Uh, that's really interesting. You can see who is and who isn't signed up. You should evangelize. Yeah. Hey peggy  Come on  Uh very you know, so what do you think? Uh,  Worth 4.3 billion. I guess it is. I mean it's a real social network

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait, wait, are we assuming the stock market's based on anything? Sure. It's worth. This is worse than stock market. This is the spack market  Well, the stacks are for the stock market. What's the difference between a spack and an ipo?  A spack is where private investors put the money up and then they merge with  Another company that's already public. It's kind of like a pipe  A spack is like a pipe please  Oh  what  Um, sorry a spack  So basically a spack is where you have a big public company or sorry you have a big pool of investors or maybe one investor  and then  They are a shell corporation that's already listed on the stock exchange and then so they are already they've already been gone public in effect

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And by merging with them, you go public without all the raw

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah in a pipe what does a pipe stand for they were all the rage and like the pink sheets pipe  Oh, that's not gonna help pipe financial industry  I won't make you explain

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Have I explained how sudoku can really be an entryway  No, you you sufficiently answered this back versus ipo and why people want to do that  Because it's faster and eliminates a lot of the regulatory paperwork. Yeah, you can avoid a lot of socks issue

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you still have to eventually have accounting. But yeah, so once they're in this coast

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Acquisition fund they're now merged with this so that they're now technically public people could buy stock in next door  Right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They'll buy a stock of the company that is next door, right?  Whatever they've named it. Yeah, yeah, whatever thing and it could become next door, but sure. Yes, but  Actually, they won't be able to buy the  They're not buying it at the ipo. They're just buying like publicly on the market. Yeah, so does that same fund?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it able to do this again or no? It's one fund. No, they have to create a new one company

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  In fact, this fund to find a shell. Yeah, this will this will help you understand  This is the particular name of this is something like coastal adventures  SPAC number two, right? No, it's a it's specifically designed to do for this purpose entirely  Interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then you form it not knowing what you're going to spend you don't know ahead of time and I guess

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  But the question is where's the money flow from it flows initially from the SPAC company buying next door

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. No, it flows from private investors. So what happens is like maybe hedges  Maybe it's your best buddies that you met through linkedin y'all get your money together  You you basically build this SPAC which is the corporation you find a publicly traded company  You buy said company or you or a non publicly traded company a private company

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, no, you are you first you buy a publicly traded company to become public. Uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know your order of operations. I think you you create the pool of money  You find the public target or you find the private target  I don't know which comes first in this situation

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So there are investors who put money into this basically. Yes. I mean you but in in most of them

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Know where I mean there's when you have this pool of money  You know what you're like  It's not like they're like a giant floating pool of money that's looking around  It's a giant floating pool of money that was they've had the discussions with next door already. Okay. All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, and then and then stacy, um  So  There was 270 million dollars prior investment. That is a pipe according to this. That's the money coming in  I already came into it  Uh, and whatever equity they had the total valuation is 4.3 billion  How much money do we do we imagine? I don't see anything here of how much the kosher and company put in  and then  I don't understand how that mixes because because when you do an ipo you do it to get money in this case  New money in this case is everybody who's involved selling off their equity to the public market  Uh, I don't understand how that works. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so what will happen is this is basically like a set of  Investors coming in and giving you  I'm just gonna make up a number four billion dollars, right? So four billion dollars goes to next door  and  next door  Will work with them to take some of that money to do the deal to get them on the public market  And then the rest of that money is just liquidity for next door. So that could be  and then  The stock that the next door people have like their their what are those called their shares and stuff like that  eventually those  Should translate into the publicly whatever the the share the exchange

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And create more

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh shares too, right? Okay, but so so but that's no different like when a company goes public anyway  that when you do an ipo that  The bankers and the people who buy into the ipo are gonna you know  They only raise like 250 million and what happens is when they go on the trading markets  They hopefully pop right and then suddenly they're worth a billion  and that's when  Your shares if you're a person who has shares in that company and the employees and stuff  That's when you can start shelling selling them and  You know accruing value after a wait period. It's not at the actual ipo point  Right, that's when your investors sell their shares. I think it

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  They just trade them in yeah, but it's a liquidity event down the road. Yeah, what's the difference between a pink sheet and a fuchsia sheet?  Stop it. It is now time

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For ant saturation in hue

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You
