Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Their their their virtue signaling and so now they're trying to make it car free. This is California people

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's impossible. You can't get to Shoreline amphitheater by walking  There's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They can if you insist on driving you're supposed to like literally go to San Jose and take a bus  That's ironic because sure if you're at Google you're right next door

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  If you're at Google you're right next door to Shoreline amphitheater you can walk over but anybody else it's incredibly

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm gonna have to take a lift and it's gonna take god knows the traffic will be worse  Because everybody will be the lift and there's plenty of parking carpool tons of parking

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's why I don't know anybody don't take lifts if it would make say you save  The environment if you take a bus, that's better than taking individual cars. Where do I get a bus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not like you have the subway and there's really no good way

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There's a light rail I take the a

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  or the D I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Take yeah, I was like I take Caltrain when I come up from the city to San Jose or Mountain View  And then I usually take a uber or a lift from that's not a bad. That's actually not a bad way to do it, which is

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm a fairly yucky. That's not fair. I have I have a nothing is the hotels on the peninsula in the city are just so impossible  First world problem, but I have one near the airport  So I think I'm gonna stay there go down arrive Monday go to the hotel go down Tuesday Wednesday  Go up to you and back Thursday. I flight LA. So that's why we well here's not the only thing here

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  If you're at BJ's restaurant and brew house, you take the 55 bus to the body  That's where I usually go up there. Yeah, and then from the 32 bus you take the 185 bus and then you can walk the rest away  It's about 95 minutes. I  Think it's a dig you can enjoy that day. It's a it's a little circuitous

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But you can do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, the first bus leaves at three minutes from DeAnza and Marianne  Actually BJ's is right next to Apple. So I guess that's why they've been there

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I also the other one is right across near the airport. I go to the BJ's

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So I'm hoping they're gonna give you a nice new phone the pixel 3a and 3a XL  We are now sure will be launched there. Google has done some you know, semi cryptic  Invitations and things like that. In fact, they are implying that night sight will be a big part of this new phone  It will be about five to six hundred dollars. Although  The pixel 3 has been such a poor seller. It's it's actually possible to get it close to that price as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's the difference in specs? Well, what's the what are you giving up in this phone versus the full XL? Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Good question. I I don't know. I mean I tell you what the yeah, they haven't announced it  I could tell you what the kind of the rumors are they'll be plastic  Bezels will be bigger  There's no notch in any of the that's the best-selling point. I've heard no notch, but that means  I hate the notch. Yeah, you know what hates the notch  Microsoft they've they've uninvited notch from the micro from the Minecraft 10th anniversary celebration  That's a different notch. That's the creator  No, it's a geek joke, but the notch has turned into kind of a not such a nice person  He's transphobic. He's homophobic and he is apparently a believer in QAnon

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this shouldn't surprise a lot of us. I have lots of like engineering deep programming people who are very nerdy  Fascinated by weird minute topics much like I am  Yeah, and then those a lot of them are QAnon people. It's weird cuz

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, if you if you were able to sell Stacey and IOT for three billion dollars you too  Might end up kind of strange. Yeah, I would take a billion really

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  half a billion even

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Anyway that you're right. That was a bit of a digression. Let's see here. Yeah, I don't I don't see  A lot of information about the 3a and 3a XL

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  You do give up the lack of a head headphone jack. There's a headphone jack in it. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No notch in a headphone jack. Yeah, that's that's it man. That's your phone. It's Jeff's phone right there and  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Qualcomm Snapdragon 670 or 710  That's the those are the lower-end less expensive phones 4 gigs of RAM more than adequate  4 gigs of RAM more than adequate a choice between 32 and 64 gigs. By the way, this is Android Central speculating  3000 milliamp hour on the milliamp hour battery on the 3a  unknown on the 3a XL same camera same camera as on the pixel 3  What's the battery? I'm sorry. Well, it's tiny on the pixel 3a and we don't know what it'll be on

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a problem. My battery is great on this one on the two

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It may be a Verizon exclusive, but as I remember your Verizon, right? No, I'm a D&T. Oh, okay  Well, we'll see we'll see we don't know what the price really will be

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They were not exclusive in terms of them. They wouldn't do a you can only get it at Verizon  They'll still do an unlocked version. It would probably be the exclusive

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Sales. Yeah. Well carrier exclusive, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But you know, but they'll I'm sure they'll do an unlocked version maybe maybe not sometimes they delay they defer that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's like a two-week yeah, they did a two-week window. Yeah, it was it was not

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because I've always gotten the phone right I always got every phone and I've no only been a lot, okay  I don't remember cursing about that. I've cursed about much as some of your viewers tell me

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Your I don't agree siren that's what that was

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Can you give us your your Stacey excited whoop I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have to be genuinely excited to give you a real

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She can only do I said I think we have to do we have to isolate these things and you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You need to be the Fred Norris of twig. Is there anything else that we think Google I'll will bring us any other  Any out-of-the-way surprises?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know none of the stuff I care about is is up for grabs no IOT stuff for  Not I mean nothing that I've really heard about there. Maybe I'm trying to note. That's a different thermostat  I was like that's ecobee who's making a new thermostat

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So yeah, I mean there'll be Android Q of course the next generation of Android that's been in beta for some time  Stadia which they announced to great fanfare, but little excitement we should probably see something about stadia  Maybe not though. I don't know they announced it at GDC in March and then dead silence ever since of course  We got the pixel phone. That's about it. You know this might be a very kind of uninteresting Google I oh well they demonstrate duplex  Which was probably the very human voice that they showed last year and gotten it got a little trouble  Maybe duplex will give the keynote. Oh  Wouldn't that be cool?  You know who will not be on the board by then is Eric Schmidt who is not running for re-election. It's a long history  Yeah, he's gonna stick around as a technical advisor, but he will not be on the board. Yeah, that is kind of interesting  So long maybe they'll do a little farewell to Eric because he was the CEO as many  Remember of Google for years. He's been on the board for 18 years. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right. There is supposed to be a Google smart display. I forgot about oh  Yes  A new one. I don't remember the features that it's supposed to have but I actually love my Lenovo smart display and  Kevin loves his actual Google branded tinier display

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I wish I'd gotten the Google one because this is a bit big don't you think Stacy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I've got I mean I keep mine in my kitchen slash living room area  So it's perfect for a big open space. I wouldn't put it like by my bedside table

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Kitchen slash living room. It sounds like you have a hibachi next to this  couch I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have an open floor plan Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, I like that actually open floor plan Eric Schmidt tweets  Yesterday after third 18 years of board meetings. I'm following coach Bill Campbell's legacy coach was legendary at Apple  early board members of worth and helping the next generation of talent to serve thanks to Larry Sergey and all my BOD  Board of director colleagues onward for me as a technical advisor to coach alphabet and Google businesses tech plus  dib and  SCA I Schmidt futures teaching and more

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So that's kind of retirement. I would guess yeah, but don't forget. He was a coach to Larry and Sergey  So he's got a lot of coaching experience. Yeah, he was adult supervision. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  like I like Eric and as  Robert Robin L Washington has been appointed appointed to the board of directors

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm old enough to remember when Eric Schmidt putting his foot in his mouth was worse than Mark Zuckerberg putting his foot in his mouth  Oh, it was legendary  But then but but now it seems so tame

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Diane Greene also leaving the board. She was CEO of Google Cloud

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She she's still there. Yes, even though Thomas Kurian is there. She left Google Cloud January 2019  Oh, so she's still not at okay. I think she's I thought she had stayed there

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  she is now a CFO at Jiliad Sciences of Biofarm and

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did they say who's joining the board yeah Robin L Washington

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Reckon a recognized business leader. I recognize you with extensive experience across finance and operations and  She'll serve on alphabets leadership development and compensation committee

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, so independent compensation committee. Yeah, that's good and it's a woman. Yeah, so  Silences maybe well it mitigates the loss of Diane

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So yeah. Yeah, and of course today's the day that the Google walkout number two is ongoing right now  As we speak this is all about the retaliation. We talked about last week  Google employees  more than 200  Participated in the New York office earlier today  hundreds of  Google employees expected to be involved throughout the day sit-ins at offices at 11 a.m. Local time  There you go

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So and basically this was a sit-in saying don't retaliate against people when they bring up legitimate complaints  Is that what this is? Okay, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And the Meredith Walker who organized the first sit-in  Said there were tears and talks of unions. Oh  That should send a shiver down the collective spines of the Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  executive offices and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  their investors and

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  their investors  Okay  Google says we were tip we prohibit retaliation in the workplace and publicly share a very clear policy  To make sure that no complaint  Raised goes unheard at Google. We give employees multiple channels to repel concerns including  anonymously and investigate all allegations of retaliation  so  There you have it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sure they have a written policy and maybe people just don't abide by that. It's hard

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's big company managers have you know little fiefdoms  And there's all sorts of ways to retaliate that aren't immediately obvious and I mean it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People do get defensive when someone says hey the way you're doing things sucks  Right even even if you say it in the nicest possible way and honestly when you say things nicely  Nobody pays attention. So there's a real fine line and you're gonna that's my rule of life Stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Be nice what no, no if you say things nicely people don't pay attention. I'm just  Like yeah, okay somebody came out somebody of the show came out to me for being liberal  Complaining today. So I'm just I'm just deciding to play to true to form

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Jeff, we cannot say that you're not liberal. I think you own that right? I don't think that's a bad thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And city. Yes  Call what a bar call  I  Think he called he called Mueller's letter snitty. I think it was Lord  It's a bit snitty a bit snitty so I'm quite a bit snitty

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  People call me that makes me snitty

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My friend I've never heard the adjective snitty

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Brian Williams, sorry  Brian Williams said it was related to snooty or snotty. No related to sit it. Here we go. It's a Germanic noun

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Coming from from the Apple  It's a noun. Okay, Jeff, you'd know this it comes from an apple slice the word for apple slice in German  It's a cut the schnitz schnitz  But it didn't help etymologists much  According to Merriam-webster. In fact, it just gets them into a snit or  State of agitation no matter how they slice and dice the word snitty. They can't get to its core  All we know is that snit was being used as early as 1939 and snitty appeared some 40 years later  Both words are mainly used in the United States  Yeah  It's a schnitz. You got a little schnitz  disagreeably ill-tempered

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  snitty I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can see that

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You snitty liberal you  I  Wish I could read this story in the Financial Times, but it's behind a paywall the cost of being woke

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google Edition. Yeah, I did want to read that. Is that a T? Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, well I put it up there clearly. It's a Jeff because Jeff gets everything you have to synopsize for us  What is the cost? No, I gotta remember a

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Buck Fitty. Oh, I know what it was. No, I remember no remember no remember. So  Part of the finances for Google this time apparently came off of YouTube and part of what's happening to YouTube is they're trying to get rid of a lot of  Bad content and that's having a business impact. Yeah. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's basically the same thing that happened to Facebook when they de-optimized advertising. So yeah  I again, I really feel like  We're entering an era and we have the ability now with you know, they've been able to do it  The ability to gather data analyze it quickly to optimize intensely  For the wrong things we optimize for profits, which means we're going to you know, boost engagement  We're gonna do whatever for profits and then we're gonna do that really well, and then we're gonna have all these unintentional side effects  So it's really time for us to sit there and say hey  Wall Street wants us to optimize for profits, but that has unintended costs that we can actually see and  It's time we start taking account of those and we have that ability with technology  we just have to start writing the algorithms for it and I  Don't know why this is such a controversial position. We've always talked about like externalities, right?  So pollution that sort of thing and and we're realizing that those are important. I don't know why we don't talk about social  externalities and like the costs of having a bunch of contract workers who have no health care and

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Etc, etc. There does seem to be this point of view in Silicon Valley that nothing should impede  Profits and growth, you know hundred percent gross every year that it's just un-American to slow that down

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The venture world and model is very much predicated on growth  Not necessarily revenues until you become public and then Wall Street then Wall Street's demands and they take over take over. So  It's very short-sighted it's very frustrating and  Just want to just smack people. Sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's another head. I'm not the snitty one folks  That was not she was smack people. I'm I'm deep in I'm knee-deep in schnitz

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  People she's slapping ideas the  Other yes, I know  The other headwind that these companies are gonna start facing remember Facebook took a three billion to put aside three billion dollars for  Upcoming they felt you you find of three to five billion Facebook is not alone. I was FTC. That's right FTC  Google's putting aside one point seven billion dollars  for the EU's  Yeah, well, but but they're not done with the EU  So this was this was part of alphabets quarterly earnings report a couple of days ago

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, we could call that an externality right there. Yeah the lack of privacy now  You're that's the cost right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And I don't think it's the end of it. I think that these companies are gonna continue to face these kinds of funds  But maybe maybe they hope it's the end  Tough quarter for Google actually  Alphabet really 15% increase  She's how dare they?  revenues of thirty six point three billion dollars earnings of per share of nine dollars or fifty cents  Company stock went down almost immediately by seven percent  Here's Google's canned statement we delivered robust growth  led by mobile search YouTube and cloud with alphabet revenues of  Thirty-six blah blah blah I mentioned this that's up 17% versus last year or 19% on a constant currency basis  That's pretty good. This is Ruth poor at CFO speaking  We remain focused on and excited by significant growth opportunities across our business. The real problem was  Google's facing more competition in advertisement and its other bets which are funded through ads are also  Draining the gas tank a little bit. So here's the question

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go ahead Stacey you first. Oh, I was gonna say yes with Amazon the advertising  I mean if you look at in the context of what's happening up in Seattle with Amazon Google does look  Like an also ran

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's really sad I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Keep wondering and  You know, I say this is somebody in the media business and I have Google stock as I've mentioned before so I'm I like their benefit  I wonder whether  Even though Google and Facebook took advertising away from media in media's view. That was ours. You took it away  Whether how long for the world is their kind of advertising I  Just I talked about this forever

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, cuz if you talk about things like search via voice, right and Microsoft actually put out a report last week all about voice  Search and what that means for how to advertise on that  You look at like IOT and moving less to a screen-based world  Their business model changes significantly and they have to figure out how to change with it  the challenges  with voice  Advertising voice is such an immediate interaction mode  Advertising feels jarring which is why you're gonna see them focus on products that that do require screens  So things like recipes things like maps  Again email docs, etc those kind of things  Yeah, maybe I  Feel like and I imagine Google's thinking about this and being very careful about this  It's very easy to cross the creepy line in the home. So I think  That's one of the latter places will see like true advertising if that makes sense, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So so that's one factor. I think you're right. Stacey. I want to explore that as voice. I think there's other factors as well  I think that  For example privacy is gonna be an issue the  Advertising has to become more targeted the more targeted it becomes the more bugs people the more is gonna cause problems  That's one factor  Another factor is the Amazon experience that you can start making your own products and don't have to advertise them  If you have that kind of platform, so I think there's various factors that affect  Just just simply abundance and an ever decreasing price and an ever increasing desperation and an irritation  So those are other factors as well. Let's go back to the voice  if if you were to you know, if you were to say that now voice interactions versus  textual interactions are  Forget video because that's passive  So let's just say things you're interacting with which is your point with voice if today that represented point oh one percent of interactions  Where does it go in two three years?  How much is this gonna grow this voice thing in your view?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me pull up the being voice report because literally this is part of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They talk I'd be very impressed if you if you pulled it up with your voice

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That would be I wouldn't be using being if you did

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually who was using  Someone used to use being anyway, it's telling Amazon Amazon used to use being actually  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So it's very telling that  Microsoft announced it at to yes on its quarterly results a week ago. They're renaming being to Microsoft ads  Huh? Not the search being but the Bing ads. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so  In terms of how people are interacting with voice. Yeah  They're using it mostly with a digital assistant  about and this is a survey  Survey so it talks about 72% if you scroll down to page 9 of this report, you're gonna see the thing  I'm looking at right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  showing a  Facebook portal. Yeah, that's weird. Okay. We just took ours apart  Yes, we couldn't think of what else to do with it. That's probably the most benign. This is such a new Microsoft  The very first image is Facebook portal then such an Adela  All right, here's page six. Oh you want to go to nine? Okay  How are people engaging with voice

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Go ahead

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well I think it's 68 percent of people have used a digital assistant so

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And that's then that's the vast majority of people using voice are doing it with voice search with a personal assistant  72 percent 35 percent through a speaker 36 percent to a TV or smart home device. That's not a speaker  Oh, I'm surprised at that. Yeah almost a third to a vehicle and  That I would think to be more up. Yeah and 52 percent of  their interactions are  Voice skills or actions through a smart home speaker like for instance  Hey Cortana play morning edition  Which I can by the way say out loud because I don't think anybody in our audience is gonna  Is actually gonna be effective by that?  The most popular digital assistant may be different than you think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's Microsoft's plug right here

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, they're not gonna say correct. Although the Amazon is widely known and advertised in the US  It is perhaps surprisingly the not most the most popular one  Siri and Google assistant are tied for 36 percent  Because they're on the phones. Yeah and echo with 25 percent because you have to buy an echo thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, and look Cortana is on there with 19 percent  People who are using that's bizarre, maybe they're talking to their windows. Yeah, it's on Windows. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We always forget that it's like people like my friend in the father's were still on a well

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I don't forget in fact, I actively remove it from Windows installations

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do too  but you know  I actually was playing with someone who are playing with someone's computer and they had it and it was actually really cool because I said  I was like, wow, I asked Cortana to open a spreadsheet and she did  Yeah, so it was kind of it was a little weird because that's not what I'm used to doing and I wouldn't have it  But once you get into the habit, I could see it becoming really compelling

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean I do that already you hit Windows key type the name of the spreadsheet return it'll open it  So to me since my hands are in the keyboard and it's a more direct way of doing it  But I could see the value of that, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes back how much how so so  How much does this become a part of everybody's everyday life in your in your predictions?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mmm, I think it's gonna become part of almost everyone's everyday life  I think because it's on phones and because it's so easy to use even people who don't have a smart speaker  they're going to search for information via voice and  I think that's already proven out  They talk about like how people are using this today. Most people use it for searching for a quick fact  That's they say it's like 68% here that jives was how people are using the Amazon Echo  Although the Amazon Echo that most popular use case is still setting a kitchen timer timer. Yeah  Some of the things like asking for directions I do that all the time on my phone and I'm sure you

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I do too. I say navigate to the twit studios or whatever. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I was actually surprised 47% of people use it for searching for a business  So if you think about again, that's such a direct interaction, you know, hey G  Where is the nearest Jiffy Lube to me?  You know, there's there's a lot happening in the back end and the voice comes out with it's 14 miles away  Do you want me to navigate to you or navigate to there and you say yes and then poof all of that has happened  Without a chance for an ad right? I

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Would so I would guess that the creators of these technologies are happy  Very happy with the trajectory. It's not taking the world over yet, but it's enough  It's enough critical mass so that when the technology gets better  They're gonna have enough people who will can be using it to then tell everybody else  Oh, wow, you got a tri Cortana or echo or whatever. It's it's amazing  Smart home speaker ownership. Oh, here you go

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In  2018 com score says that fifty percent of  All searches will be voice searches by 2020. Yeah. Wow, you believe that? Yeah  I do actually because I I  search for data probably equally  via voice and via I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Actually think that might be low and do you prefer the results on?  screen or on voice

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I tailored I pick voice for things that I know voice is good at  So I search for quick facts and things like that on voice

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is such a such a Microsoft II report  75% of households will have at least one smart speaker by 2020 next to it is the Harman Kardon echo or invoke  Which I have but very few do in fact, it looks like only about six percent  I'm sorry five percent of the population intend to buy one in any compared to forty three percent for the echo  actually  Big drop for Google Home, which is kind of surprising for fifty eight percent to seventeen percent

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is plans to purchase I can see that I think I think  People went out with Google because they they were waiting for it  There's pent-up demand and I think once people had it they were like, that's good  Yeah, and it doesn't really have the bind share that echo really is winning in this

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I want to see the percentage of people who read this report and thought that that was a picture of an echo

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I did yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Percentage of designers maybe it is am I wrong? Maybe it is an echo that looks like an echo plus. I think you're right  I'm sorry. It looks the Harmonic. It's more is more tilted. It's triangle. Yeah, it's a little more  slightly more  Yeah, that's a weird there's a weird angle on this thing that made me yeah, you're right. It's a nevermind. It's an echo

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  45 percent of our survey respondents question to how many people know reading this report even know what a card and looks like a

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Harmonic card. Yeah, apparently not me the invoke. I don't even are they still making it? I don't even know if you can buy it anymore  I'm gonna keep mine. It's a relic of the past  How many people own multiple smart speakers? What would you think?  59% only own one 30% I'm in the 1% too  Yeah, I think I'm actually the 1% they hardly use them we're 1%ers  Because they're cheap they're 30 bucks

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although right now in my 1000 square foot apartment. I am I only have three assistants

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, cuz you're not so you're never too far from any any one of them  80% of users reported being somewhat or very satisfied  See is that number is that number  Goes up and can't go up much, but I think it's the somewhat satisfied turn to very satisfied  So that's when you and you're good enough that you're gonna have critical mass so that that can really happen

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And we're definitely past we're past the earlier. We're in the early majority or past. Yes, that's right. Here's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Technology this is actually a graph you could use for other stuff to technology adoption lifecycle market  You got your innovators us techies us we try it early adopters visionaries get ahead  That's 13% then the chasm, but we've bridged the chasm  Because we're right here in the early majority 34%  late majority 34% laggards 16%  So you've got techies visionaries pragmatists conservatives and skeptics  Isn't that an interesting  Isn't that an interesting  This is good crossing the chasm  I think we could say safely the voice assistants have crossed the chasm now. They just have to get better  That's a good report. Thank you for bringing that up stacey. Yeah, that's very interesting. I am I am full of reported information. Yeah  Going back to alphabets earnings  One of the reasons they're doing these new pixel 3 and 3a so early is because the pixel 3 seemed to be  Kind of a flop so nerpa chai cited year over year headwinds  And the market by the way responded google's stock I should show you the graph oh my gosh, it's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's kind of a mention earlier. I have a little of the stock

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, get ready. Hold on to your hats. You see that big drop  Right here  That's that's when the quarterly results came out  Uh, they dropped from a peak of  1,287.58 to  1,183 that's not a huge drop. No, it's you'll be all right, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are you in the long run? That's why that's why I was bringing this up though  I think that  Google and amazon are really smart companies. I'll start there  and  Um, I think they're gonna have a long future  um  But you know there was microsoft there was there were others. I still think but that's why i'm wondering if the if the ad-based business  For google  Is more challenged than we know today and they're so dependent and same for facebook  I was thinking about facebook today, too  And I don't want to get into the whole well actually I do because we I watch talk about fa

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Actually, let's take a break and I would like to let's because the fa the facebook developers conference was yesterday  We agonized uh over whether to stream it  um and decided not to because we're streaming google and  Microsoft events next week. Um, but I just I couldn't bring myself  To do it, but but there were some interesting things. Yeah, and you watch you're going to be our report in just a second. Okay  We'll continue with this week in google, but first a word from last pass  This is really more like a public service announcement if you're not using the last pass password manager  do  Start right now every security expert agrees. So  First of all, we should say just to make you feel better  This passwords thing is way out of hand passwords suck having to remember thousands of passwords is just not possible  And of course it leads people to do dangerous things like reuse the same password over and over again  Use memorable passwords usually memorable memorable means  Uh easy to guess or easy to break  So if you're using your kids, you know birth dates and your dog's name  You need good long strong passwords. No one could remember  And then you use last pass to keep track of them last pass will generate them  And then you unlock that password vault with one long secure master password  And then whenever you're using windows or mac or ios or android or linux, it'll just fill it in for you  I've installed lately a bunch of new systems and of course the very first thing I install is last pass  That way I can log into everything else get everything else set up  Last pass is amazing really important if you're a business  because  Maybe you've got your password hygiene under control and i'm sure you do if you listen to our shows  But but your employees probably don't we know more than half of all employees share passwords sometimes even with people outside the company  They put post-it notes on their monitors so they can remember them. They they think up bad passwords last pass fixes all that  we  Started using last pass enterprise at twit  Some years ago i've been using last pass for almost a decade since they started  It lets us manage password security. We have complete administrative oversight. We could do things for instance  There's like 100 policies that you can configure including  requirements for the master password  And requiring two-factor which we do  You could even use last pass as his own authenticator app, but you can use a yuba key or duo security google  Authenticator you get to choose and I think that's really a great way to make your stuff more secure  If you're in the cloud, you've got lots of passwords that hold the keys to your business  You need to protect them with last pass enterprise  Uh, there's last pass teams for smaller companies teams of 50 or fewer last pass premium for individuals  At home, we use last pass families  Which has some nice sharing features as does last pass enterprise that let you share passwords with your spouse or your  Other family members, uh very easily by just putting them into a family folder  I also use the one feature of last pass families. I really like emergency access  So if I should become disabled or pass away, my wife would get access to my passwords  After uh, some precautionary things  And I think that's really important really really important  You got to try last pass 13 and a half million people use last pass tens of thousands of businesses  Visit last pass.com slash twit this this is  Probably the single most important thing you'll hear today if you're not using last pass get to last pass.com  Slash twit and protect yourself protect your company  Lastpass.com slash twit we thank them for their support for providing a great product  And we thank you for using that url showing your support for this week in google  F8 was yesterday. I saw a little bit of mark zuckerberg. He doubled down  Jeff jarvis. He doubled down on his privacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Plans which actually bothered me. So he's if you there's a there's an image of him  Under the sign the future is private. Yep  That disturbed me  Because what i've been fearing is an internet that  We all go into our turtle shells  And I understand why facebook's doing it  I understand why you say that I get all of that and a full disclosure is that I  Raised money for my school from facebook. I am independent of facebook. We receive no money personally from any platform end of disclosure  But here i'm complaining about it  uh the  What the internet does that I so treasure is that all these voices can be heard and anyone can be public and that  We share and sharing is a public act at some level or another  and  That's what that's why i've celebrated facebook and twitter's existences  And  I don't know what facebook is going to do with the core facebook besides take away the blue  Which we'll get to in a minute  but I  Do worry about the world we heard about here, which was that everything is locked down in private. Everything is temporary  Um that we lose  um  The links and the permanence that that build a culture in new ways and yes with things that go wrong  And yes with things we've learned and i'm not saying that I want everything to be public. I'm not saying that at all  but  If everything is private, I think we lose something so that that bothered me

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think if you go beyond facebook though, these same avenues exist  You could create a wordpress blog to make things public  and it's  Facebook if you think of it a better analogy may be like the conversations you have with people on the street that you need  So imagine the public square and you're talking to them  Having those be more ephemeral and private  Makes sense and you can even develop your opinions there and test them out against people without them penalizing you and then you can go  And write a blog post and post it on media like I still feel like there are plenty of avenues  That are still accessible to lots of people  that  that give you  Because facebook was trying to be both things and I don't and what I discovered is it it couldn't be both things because  No one no one tries out their public opinions unless they're a teenager  In front of everyone right? That's that's not a sophisticated way to develop things or you  um  Let me play it. I think go ahead. Oh  And I think this is actually a really good move because it it makes it safe for people to explore  and it also  helps protect young people from  being penalized for  Things they said or did and even older people that they said and did when they were, you know younger and stupid  I mean  That's a good thing and there's still those avenues. Yeah, I don't disagree with that stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just think that  That we haven't yet fully explored  So I mean, yes, I think you need those spaces and maybe facebook was the wrong one  But let's just say that twitter did what jack has been talking about and goes to subjects not people  Then you know what my now hack date because i've said it so often example  But but how do we get then the coalescing that occurs the the gathering that occurs around me too or black lives matter or living?  While black how do we get ferguson, missouri?  How do we get those moments when voices who are not heard can now find an audience they don't know  Which is which is the point of being public?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, and I think we are I think there's two things happening. I think there is a cultural shift and journalists are looking at places that are  not just  Quote unquote the mainstream media and I think we've brought in more voices to journalism in general, which is good  And I do think  That there are plenty of like a medium post can help draw attention to things  I think twitter still I mean, let's hope that that doesn't go away if it does. I think those things will still develop  because I I don't think  I don't think we can turn our backs on  Most of the population, right? I I don't think we'll be able to I hope not. Anyway, maybe i'm too naive

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I it's not like either or it isn't an either or there's going to be plenty of a  Conversation in the public square. I just think it's nice to have the option to really be private  If you want to you're saying everybody should be private by default or public by default, but that's what he's saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, i'm not saying that please don't put me in that position again  No, no, no, but mark was saying that it becomes private by default, which is the right default

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, but but not just default. He's saying the future is private. Here's a the verge did a 12 minute cut down  I won't play the whole thing but here's a little cut down at least at the beginning  Of mark's comments at f8. Let me turn on the sound everyone

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Welcome to f8  Today we are going to talk about building a privacy focused social platform  privacy  Gives us the freedom to be ourselves  So it's no surprise  That the fastest ways that we're all communicating online are private messaging in small groups and in stories  This is the the next chapter for our services I get that a lot of people aren't sure that we're serious about this

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is all I know do you think the laughter was written into the script  It did not seem organic

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you know poor poor mark he's  Yeah, I I don't actually feel bad for him. I'm just like he's he's an awkward individual  And you know power to him for he is acknowledging so he could be that he's acknowledging that nobody really

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Believed him when he said yeah, we're gonna go private and a good on him for acknowledging it. Yes exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was necessary that we don't exactly have the strongest reputation on privacy right now to  Put it lightly  But i'm committed to doing this well and this vision is based on on six principles  You know first we're committed to working openly now second  We're taking a more proactive role. This is a super  That's why it's a little bit  But we're taking a more proactive role and making sure that all of our  Hold on for one second Leo

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What was that sharing all about?  So that was that was developers seeing themselves on the screen  Right, but that was also funny because because mark was about to say  Well, we're cutting back your power as developers  So he was he he says well the the response doesn't match the words that i'm about to say  Boy sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're taking a more proactive role and making sure that all of our partners and developers use our services for good

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We're also building out. What were you saying stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I was gonna say their their marketing and pr team are excellent  In terms of that juxtaposition, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A lot of deep technical infrastructure and re-plumbing the whole infrastructure that we build  For this company to support this privacy vision  It's not going to happen overnight. So let's start with our messaging apps

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So we don't have to continue through this. We don't know by the way, by the way, just a little side note here  This back screen color, you know, does that thing with the screen color changes?  Yeah, there's about 20 seconds where he's behind he's in front of a green screen

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So if you want to have fun get ready memesters. Yeah, exactly get ready  So one thing that got a lot of attention is the new look, uh facebook which has as mark said you got it yet  Hardly any blue. I don't have facebook  I have to say this morning. I thought well I should log in and see it and it said we don't who's leo  Who are you?  We don't have an account for you. So I literally it's gone now  Um, but this is what it looked like. I think that's a much better look

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess you know what?  What cracks me up is so this is a big thing back in  2000 and I think it was nine when facebook launched their open compute servers the first hardware that they built  They in the whole goal of it was to reduce the cost of running their servers, right? They actually made a  Decision to use blue leds even though there were seven cents more expensive because it was facebook blue, right? So  I'm like 10 years later. They're like, okay, we're gonna get that's facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He laughed zuckerberg laughed on stage about how we're even getting rid of the blue  I think this is the fine good hand of fidget cmo

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Notice the very front and center groups stories  By the way, which is straight out of instagram. In fact, this middle  Thing looks a lot like an instagram feed  But groups and what other what other big social network?  Pivoted to groups all of a sudden  Communities how did that work for google plus when they did that?  So groups are  Groups are already big here. Yeah. Yeah facebook groups and groups can be private by default  He said something that surprised me. He wanted you to be able to share  Your health information with a health provider privately through facebook  That's going to take some relearning for people to say yeah, i'm gonna tell the world tell my  Privately tell my health provider on facebook about my health issues

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's that's the day but that's where the wording changes, right?  So what you're what he's doing is saying you're not doing it on facebook. You're doing it via facebook  Yeah, well, which is going to be hard to I agree with you. It's gonna be hard to train people

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's in essence what they're saying. That's what apple is doing with their watch and other data efforts to share with your physician  And that's and that is where  Both google amazon and all of these they all want to be the intermediary data provider between you and other  uh organizations  Or other services so this isn't this it makes sense from that perspective. It's just and that's where facebook  Honestly, it feels really strange that they didn't realize their privacy problem given that this is what they wanted to do and where the market was going  So it feels kind of like they missed  the opportunity much like they miss mobile and now they're kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Adapting to it and they may they may they may make it so I went through my I hadn't I said  Oh, what groups am I in? I'm in tons more groups than I than I could have possibly remembered  My favorite here  Is that I joined the I like john c devorek group  Good of you. And here's the better part. It was last updated eight years ago. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Vibrant growing community on the facebook  This somebody pointed out in the chat room has no ads on it. Is that going to be the future of facebook the no ad

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, no, no, this is this is actually the wrong thing to look at because they're not going they're not even coming out with this web  Version for quite some time. This is a mock-up what they're out with today is the mobile version  Okay. Well, i'll just have to trust I don't think I don't they have an image of that since you can't show us because  You are, um, let's see. Snitty snooty and snotty. Oh, i'm happy not on facebook though. That's

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Snit snoot snot. I am very happy  Show title. Let's see since i'm trying to find the mobile design. I still like knee deep and snit  I know how they're going to make their money back though. They're turning facebook back into a hookup app  Uh facebook's adding secret crushes  So you it's basically uh tinder you could see which friends  Uh have the hots for you  And it'll match how tinder operates. Yeah, it'll match you up  So if you indicate interest in somebody you can't message them until they  Indicate interest in you and that's how apparently how this will work. This is part of the new facebook dating which isn't available here  Uh, five countries already launched 14 more join the service today  Secret crush lets you express interest in up to nine friends  If that friend has opted into facebook dating and likes you back  They get a notification saying someone likes you  If they pick you as their secret crushes one of their nine  Nine seems like a lot but okay, you both get notifications  This is where all the money's gonna be in the future if you ask me  This is what facebook was already all about  From day one

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm gonna apologize. I'm gonna go and mute for most of the time because they're grinding up trees behind me

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, it's about time those gosh, I don't think we're hearing it. Are we hearing it? She's muting herself when she came on and we heard it  Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Anything else people are gonna accuse me. Yeah, people are gonna accuse me of of of talking over interrupting stacey  So I want I want carsten make sure you you when stacey wants to talk make sure it's clear as can be  I don't want to get accused of anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because tree grinding is going on you'll hear the trees grinding jeff and you'll be like, oh my god, what is that noise?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Stacey's here. Oh, no, she's really angry now

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Stacey wants to talk i'll just mute jeff. Hey, there you go. That's fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Um, do we care about the oculus quest and the rift s the new wait, wait, wait while we're talking about privacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can we talk about google changing their data?  Retention policies on their apps, uh location sure that was a terrible  Terrible terrible way of paraphrasing that but  google is allowing you  To it'll give you two options a three month or an 18 month time limit on how long it keeps your data  um, so you can now auto delete your location history and web and app activity by

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Either after three or after 18 months or keep it until I delete it manually

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  right

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Which is how it is right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but manually deleting all of your stuff is pretty terrible  So, I mean, I guess it's kind of like, you know deleting cookies from your website  You're going to have a really crappy experience for a little bit afterwards where you're like, ah, i've got to log into everything and  Nobody knows who I am anymore. So that's the downside of doing this

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So this isn't an app but it's going to be in a new a new setting inside your google account dashboard  on mobile and on the web  Uh a drop down option that'll allow you to select those time windows three months or eight months  Uh, it'll also cover cover not just location but web and app activity  things searched for browsing google services maps  Search google play  Older data will be deleted on an ongoing basis. This is a very good thing  And why you know why not because honestly google probably  Had gets much more value out of your most recent activity than out of your you know, 18 months old activity

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do wish I could tell it to stop doing youtube videos, but keep my you know  Maps history, but kill my web search history, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Like there's a little bit more granularity. I wonder if you can't in in in their in their dashboard

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. I don't have this option yet. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This does not make a distinction  but uh, yeah  That might be the next thing is get a little more granular because maps might maybe I like actually that's really the the  A good idea because I like to keep my location information as long as possible because it's a great way for me to look back  I don't know. I don't i'm not going to delete anything but  There you have it  Uh, how about we were talking about the oculus?  Quest and the oculus rift s available for pre-order they ship in three weeks  I see I feel like this vr thing has just died died

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  On the tree here. It works really well with my surround sound eight track

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The uh the quest uh  Both headsets headsets use computer vision technology  oculus insight which enables inside out tracking via sensors built into the units  So you can navigate virtual and physical spaces in real time. The quest runs on a snapdragon 835  No wires and no pc, which is kind of cool  Um, there'll be 50 titles available when the quest debuts  Units are shipped with five pre-loaded demos beat saber creed journey of the gods  space pirate trainer  and sports scramble 399  You can order it now as I said, it'll be uh come in three weeks. The rift s is basically an updated oculus rift  But the new headset has reportedly much better optics much higher resolution display  399 much lower price. Yeah as somebody who spent 1500 bucks on the original oculus rift. That's a that's a big difference

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you do you order these things it's still leo or no, you know, I uh, we're

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We have the vive which is htc's competitor and the 16 year old likes to play in the vive with his buddies

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I don't I don't do you ever use it? I don't i'm not a game player. So I guess that's why

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's fun for gaming. I think it's I think it's uh, I don't know if this technology is going to take off  I was a little skeptical even in the beginning  I think me too. Yeah. Yeah  I'll have to ask georgia dow she's going to be on twit on sunday  She and her husband actually bought a new house  So that they could have not one not two, but three virtual reality gaming rooms  So that all all of them could play simultaneously

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are they are they padded walls so you don't kill yourself bumping into walls sure they are I don't know but i'll

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We'll talk to her on sunday. She's gonna be on twitter. She'll actually be on not this sunday. Oh a week from sunday 12

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right. Okay. Do you when when she built it?  Did she design them with different parameters like a like basically how big does your vr room need to be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Uh, it's a known number. I can't remember what it is. But uh, yes, it had to be that big  But I don't think she padded the walls or did anything else you just have to have a  Clear space of I don't know. It's about 10 by 10 feet something like that 100 square feet  Uh somebody in the chat room is asking great question. Nothing original would mark pay two billion dollars for oculus today

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, that is a good question. I don't know I think the implied  Uh in that question is the answer that you shouldn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, well, I mean if you think about the focus on privacy  And you can create basically worlds where people can actually interact interact in in a virtual environment and have their interactions be private  There's actually a lot of interesting ways you could make money there. There was a lot of attention

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  originally on the oculus to those kinds of  Spaces in fact, I think was called spaces. I don't hear a lot of talk about that anymore. It's really boiled down to playing games

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, but that's because the technology right now is so heavy cumbersome  You really have to in in the content for it is game related in because it's so expensive, right?  so  But if you do get a consumer oriented  Vr device and you create a way for people  With minimal  Minimal action on their part to interact with people. I think that could be good. I just don't think we're there yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  other uh announcements at f8  We're getting we're going from the from the macro to the micro now instagram has new camera features  They said that we really don't want you to have to leave instagram to get the picture  We want to be you want to be able to take it in instagram. And actually, I think this is interesting  Likes are now less prominent, uh, maybe trying to eliminate that all that influencer stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And this is instagram under adam asari who used to be in charge of newsfeed  And there's an argument somewhere. I saw online  I don't think I think it's on the rundown but that that instagram becomes the old facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's the it's the public place. It looks more like instagram is becoming the new snapchat, but okay  I'll crunch i'll crunch at that  Also, uh facebook messenger is going to somehow focus on close friends

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because you labeled the people in your family unit like close friends or because because nothing's public

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah  So it's really a one to one

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah or a small group but but you're you're it's only people you've chosen to speak to yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So that's f8 I I don't know and we might have made a mistake not covering it but I just  I just uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think there's kind of a of a fairness question. There's they're a big company  The other thing I wish that amazon because amazon is so freaking private wouldn't it be amazing if amazon had a

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They do and we actually have covered it last year, but they don't have every that's more. Yeah, that's about

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But you know what they're about to do right? No in june. They're gonna have something called mars

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh remars, which is going to be ai robotics and

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Uh, whatever them that reminds me when's my racer coming? I think it's pretty soon

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, i'm very excited. I need to replace your um, uh bankrupt robot

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh the anki cosmo, isn't that sad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We had kevin right about what what's going to happen to anki and how this is sad. He's very sad  He picked the best picture of the story

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So anki which we uh, we covered quite a bit from the very first when they had a race car that  Followed a racetrack using cameras. It was a lot of fun  Then they came out with this little robot you see the kids staring at it looks like a little mini  Bulldozer called a cosmo. There were three generations of cosmo  We reviewed all three and loved all three  So you could most recent when you could program with python and it had seemed to have a lot of nice features  It was expensive. It was several hundred dollars  And apparently the market just wasn't enough. So is this the is this the robotic theranos?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So no, no because they had a product they actually shipped big difference  I don't the way it went down. It sounds like  Okay, this is just me and because I was at giga ohm and that shut down. So like these abrupt shutdowns are weird, aren't they?  Yeah, I think what happened is an investor backed out  It looks like it looks like someone either called something in like a debt in or an investor backed out at the last minute

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Leaving them they had 200 million dollars in vc

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they also had a hundred million dollars in revenue from 2017 which was before vector was launched, right? So  If you've got that much revenue coming in, I don't know how I don't know if they were profitable at all, but that's not  That that's not in a small business. So in the company basically said on monday they were like, okay  Yeah, we're shutting down on wednesday. You get a week severance. That is it's wild, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Means they had zero runway or they were running out of runway and didn't tell anybody  Vector was 250 bucks. It's the most recent one had amazon echo built in  Although the speaker was so bad. You could wasn't really practical

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kevin loved that thing. We all loved it. I loved it. Yes  And he used it for very kind of practical things. It followed him around as a mobile basically amazon echo  And you know, he was doing cool stuff with computer vision on it and cool stuff. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And it's it was he likes python. It was python program and he loves python. Yeah  Yeah, that's very sad and you're right. We don't know the whole story. That sounds right though. Somebody pulled out at the last minute

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It just it  I've seen that happen so many times with companies an investor somehow basically screws over the company

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's why we do not have investors here at twit

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  so the deep racer, which is not nearly as cool as the vector and was  Will be coming july 10th. So I got a little ways to go  Oh, this is the amazon thing. Yeah, this is the ai the idea is you could you could pro  It's an autonomous race car that you could program

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I thought it'd be kind of fun to play with this if it's a race car. Don't you need to buy like four of them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Uh, no you know, this is the wild thing they're they're virtual racing leagues  You should tell kevin to get this  Because it does it uses python. It could be a good replacement for his vector

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think he's actually looking at I mean it's it's so recent  You know, he sent a bunch of questions in that have yet to be answered but you know, they they could open source the code  They could they can do lots of things

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We uh, we're gonna try I know you can't be here next week and we're hoping to get kevin in  Next week on the show. So maybe he'll tell us a little bit more about it. Oh, whatever happened

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or you can read his blog post. It's a little anki

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Okay, is that gonna be on about chromebooks.com or stacey? No, it's on stacey on iot

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't have to read it. I'm just saying he did use a good picture. Yeah, it's already there

Transcript:  Oh, but so but he still hasn't heard from them yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know if he's heard from them yet or not. I haven't checked the story for an update. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh kevin if my budget was 400 I'd buy the hp chromebook x2 today. Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Kevin i'm coming to you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know if he's watching  These are good questions. He usually does doesn't he? He usually does but then he also when we start talking about him  I usually get im's from him saying something  Commenting on it. So we should have one more often

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, plus it's fun to watch you and kevin together here too. We could get we can't exist in the same place at the same time

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Only on the podcast

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Okay, we could easily have a three-person show there's no reason we can't do that  Um this I don't think mark announced this in his keynote, but he has built a sleep box for priscilla

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I I really did not want to click on the story. So I did not yeah, I didn't either I didn't do it either  I just I was like I thought about michael jackson in the hyperbaric chamber and I was like, yeah  I'm I don't I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So the box sits on her nightstand. I think this is actually  This is oh, this is what she got in it. This is totally cool  This is exactly what mark zuckerberg should be doing  Uh, the box sits on her nightstand admits a soft glow between six and seven a.m  Which is when their daughters also think that she slept in it. Yes, I did too  I didn't click on it for the same reason

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Those fancy like cute light bulb cloth that was like a coffin thing. I was getting claustrophobic

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I imagine priscilla chan waking up like opening the lid and

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've made you a sleep box, honey

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Come to the basement  uh  The the funny thing is there is such a thing already our sponsor casper  Makes a really cool light called the glow that does exactly do you have one of those? Yeah, I love it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want one so badly

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think john I think it's in my office on the desk  Uh it you set it to what time you want to wake up and it's dark, but then it slowly  Raises the light  It has some interesting they pair so you can have multiple ones and they have some interesting  Other features like if you go to the bathroom, you could pick it up on its charging stand  And it will glow very dimly  As you walk to the bathroom, it's like a candle  But uh, it'll go over and then you go back also you can twist it on it's so mark you didn't you didn't really need to  I don't know why he did  Maybe he wanted to save the hundred bucks. You know, he can be kind of cheap  It probably cost him ten thousand dollars to build brussels sleep box. That is a very well done

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it's very pretty now that I know it's not a coffin use his staff woodworkers

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Chargers

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you think he didn't build it himself I would hope he'd build it himself

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's kind of thing if he kills things he builds things. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. That's the old saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, no  If you kill things you build things it's just right it's the only thing so this is this is actually the glow has a really clever  Um technology so that's the charger. So he only has one charging pin and on either side. There's this circular  Conductive ring. So any way you place it on the stand it will charge  and  If you turn it it turns the light up or down  Whoa, yeah, it's really well designed. It's really clever  It's also the battery's dead  I'll charge it up and we'll set it to glow slowly. So  Zuck got four hundred seventy eight thousand likes on that instagram post  Why is there a sharpie sitting next to the box?  That's just the kids are going to come in and draw all over it mark. Maybe that's the plan

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think I think in silicon valley there's a rule that you have to have post-its in every room  Oh, yeah, in case you have a material because you have a design thinking moment

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, once the light has started you your technology has propelled take a quick sniff of the sharpie to wake the rest of you

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Karsten I don't know. He's being snitty today karsten

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Huffing sharpies to wake up. I'm pretty sure isn't she a pediatrician. She's probably not more than huffing sharpies

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Um, I don't know maybe mark will start talking about his woodworking on this podcast I would if I were him  Are you excited about one day shipping for amazon prime members?  Yeah, I am too, but I have a feeling the people in the fulfillment, uh,  Uh, the senators are not so thrilled  Uh, they're gonna spend 800 million dollars to expand prime from two day to one day shipping  They said it won't be easy  It won't be easy, but  Nothing worth doing is easy. Is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is really worth doing  Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Because I want it now. I want it now mommy now. Well, it's how to compete with walmart. Yeah, right  I mean it's just a a step in the path because eventually they'll have it so you order it and you get it that you know  an hour later  That's i'm sure the goal if I were jeff  Dropped on your head via drone. Yeah, they have approvals for drones, right? I think they got approvals. They do  Uh ring doorbell, which is no longer sponsored but was for a long time and I have a ring and I love a ring has  Done something that neiman labs is maybe looking a little askance at ring wants to start producing crime news

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is not true

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So they're looking to hire somebody with the title managing editor news

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Scroll down for the update

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We'll work on an exciting new opportunity wrote a whole piece on the alattic about this  Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, but they said that they've already had this role. It's not it's not what people are making it out

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, it's okay so they've received some a little heat I think rightly so  Uh for this neighbors app. I uh, if you even works within the ring doorbell, you can see crime in your area  And in my area  You could say maybe it's a little racist

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. No, and i've talked to janey about how to fear that racism. Yeah. Yeah  I'm not for the neighbors app, but the way that the well i'm not against it

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Because the idea is that you could keep up if there's we often have package thieves as well  And if there's a package thief in the neighborhood that people share it  So I you know, I think it's kind of useful. I just throw out the stuff where what's that chinese lady doing?  Although there was a weird one  There was a really weird one  Actually, it attracts you in the same way the police blotter of a small town newspaper is attractive. There was a weird one. There was a woman  older woman  70s  She had a big bouquet of flowers scissors a water vase. She was doing something on the person's porch  She said I don't know this lady the lady looks up sees the ring doorbell flips it off  Then gathers up the flowers the scissor the vase and leaves  And and they're trying to figure out finally somebody said on there. I I know this lady  She goes around and she cuts the flowers in your yard  Makes a bouquet. So she had probably cut your neighbor's flowers  Hustled over to your stoop to make the bouquet  And then saw the ring and knew she was busted. So flipped you off and then left but she had a  She was a flower thief  What a strange thing to do but see without a ring doorbell you wouldn't even know

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  yeah, I mean the issue here is is that it is in a time when  um  Strangers danger. Yeah is rampant. This really does promote that the fear is that it promotes that  And and josh benton who's the editor of neman lab who's who's really really good  um his argument, I think if I got it right, uh  Is that a company?  Who's that sells devices to deal with us to call themselves an editor or journalism or news?  Is is a bit of a conflict now interestingly when I was in the uk last I saw ring being advertised  None of that scare stuff. It was all good. It was it was back to the old convenience  Argument that ring made yeah, and now rings gone to it because usually rings said oh good  You can find out what the package there. That's nice. You can do this. You can do that now. It's  There's criminals everywhere and we're gonna stop them together. You know, it's sad it's sad because that's what it always descends to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what sells products. Yeah, I mean your fear sex and

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  fear sells  but you know when we do the ring ads we we don't I always  Focused on the good stuff, you know the delivery and stuff like that  They didn't tell us how to how to slant it  But but when amazon purchased them, I think that's when they stopped advertising on twitter. So I don't know what their current strategy  Is I do I do have some concerns but it's the same kind of concerns about the neighborhood watch  And the committees and you know, it's it's it's not so far from the you know, the committee  Positatus it's not so far from vigilanteism, right?  Here see the low the little glow you can't because turn off the lights  Yeah, you can you see the little yeah, we can see it. This is the bathroom glow  So I shook it off the lights. I shook it like that. It's like a little candle

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Or you could scare the children  Hello children is it time for bed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's very see look at how did you see that how it goes from the top to the bottom it flows nice, isn't that cool?  And then you can uh, you can turn it up and down  Welcome to this week in scare tactics you could turn it up and down  If you can maybe it's not it's not doing it right now  But this I guess when it's off you can do that. Oh, there you go

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think you should I think you should do the show this way. It's bedtime with leo

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Anyway mark  100 bucks  Casper the glow light  Is it 100? I thought it was 79. They just raised the prices  what  Casper did a whole press release by the way sponsor did a whole press release on why they had to raise it  I haven't read it yet  um  But apparently the costs went up or something. I mean, i'm sure there's a good reason they're not I don't think this is their prime business  Yeah, they're not in the in the light light business, right? Although the engineering on this is really

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kind of engineering on its side. I pulled it. I posted a bolt innovations to the teardown on this

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It was actually really interesting. Wasn't that great? That's actually why I got this. Why I said, wait a minute. That's cool  I gotta get it. It was 89. It's now 129  Ha yeah costs associated with making the product have gone up since our last production run  They probably priced it, uh optimistically in the first place  Priced to sell I think 129 is not out of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Market particularly. Um, I mean, can you read by it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, yes  And it's battery powered. So it is actually great for blackouts. You know, it's an emergency light

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If I could read by it then yes, 129 for a bedside table lamp is fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jail. Yeah, yes  I thought it was literally only read that. Yeah, I just thought it was a gowler or a gailer

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's why we spelled it. J. A. I l for you yanks  Who don't know how to read?  how  We knew if we called it a jail you would say gaol  And there's nothing gay about the old bailey

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right, so the joke on twitter is which embassy will he serve the sentence in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The jailers are going to get rid of him in 30 weeks. He goes i'm sorry. We don't want you anymore  Anyway, I don't want to joke about it's much more serious than that. So he will be in a british gaol  and then  perhaps extradited although  There's some question about that because one of the rules of extradition  I think we mentioned this before is that  They can he can only be extradited on the charge that he is  Uh that the extradition is they can't add charges after the fact so  uh  The the charge they have is kind of slender this this charge of offering to hack  Uh the emails  Or the hack the nsa  To that they he made apparently in a in a chat conversation with chelsea manning that seems like a fairly flimsy  Premise but if they do extra them on that ground those on that grounds  They can't charge them with anything extra, but now they have a year to think up a better now  They can come up with better. Yeah, maybe this is all i still think trump's gonna gonna pardon him  I have the all right. You want to know my really complex conspiracy theory? Sure  So a lot of them let me get my tin foil, please  Yeah, really a lot of the redacted muller report almost all of the redactions were because of it's an ongoing matter  They needed an ongoing matter with julian assange  To redact all the wiki leaks stuff and all of the wiki leak stuff was in fact redacted  So they come up with this  They say julian just come out  We're going to put you in jail for in the uk for 50 weeks  We will never extradite you we will never charge you but this way we can redact all those  Really bad because that's those are the ones that the most direct contacts with the with with roger stone julian assange and the russians  That was all redacted  It's of course roger stone's stuff is still uh  A matter of current action. Yes, that's interesting. That's my that's like a really crazy. That's qanon level

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Cray cray, but that presumes that the world is that well organized. It's the problem. I think the world is that well organized

Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, that's actually about the right price if they had 25 million in revenue in 2018. It's about 8x revenue  That's about I think that's about 8 to 10 times revenue. Oh, no, it's usually 8 to 10 times profit. Sorry  What's their profit?  Don't know bet bet. It's not 25 million. You always know if it's a profitable media. Yeah, it's so rare  So you're actually much better off not making money. I found out when you're trying to sell the business  Yeah, if you don't have rev if you don't have profit, there's no multiple of zero. So they just make up a number  Right cheddar did get 40 million households. So they're on dish sling  At&t's direct tv now mostly over the top  but uh still 40 million households  Twit I mean tech tv had  41 or 44 million households and sold for more than 300 million. So now it was it was cable households, but  And that was  Tech tv did not make money except for one quarter that they faked it  so  Um, so good good for uh, good for steinberg the website was always profitable  The website made a million dollars a year rain or shine  the tech tv website  Uh, that's because they didn't pay you guys anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The deal for cheddar all in cash cash, but he's gonna buy some um, altice stock  Is altice the company that bought him?  Yeah, altice also bought cable vision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Nice cable customers. Well good for you  Mr. Mr. John steinberg cheddar executive and founder  Good for you  You know, I should have just instead of this week in tech. I should have named this network this week in tech for millennials  That was my mistake

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it doesn't help that you're old and people like me on the show are old

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, i'm i'm only gen x so i gotta say i love stacy out any more kids  I love our audience, but they're not millennials. I put this in the rundown just to get jeff's blood pressure up a little bit

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, no, why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You must love the new york times privacy project

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, it's just driving me nuts because it's it's full moral panic at least they mark everything opinion. Actually. I thought this was a clever idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What they did is they bought ads  Um using you know using all the traditional, uh methods  And but the ad didn't look like an ad it simply said things like well, here's an example of an ad  This ad thinks you're trying to lose weight and still love bakeries  Both things can be true. Absolutely. I'm i'm one of I probably would get that ad  This ad that they're both true actually. Yeah, this ad thinks you're male actively consolidating your debt and are a high spender at luxury department stores  They even said here's now  The people the ad brokers they were buying from would not say where the data came from these are aggregators who get data from a lot of places  Most data providers say the times declined to tell us where their data comes from or how they built their models  So the sources in the ads below come from the ad experts who helped us create the campaign  Um, and by the way, this experiment would be blocked on facebook because they ban most ads that say how you've been targeted  I think this is a good I don't I don't have you has anybody seen these ads. I haven't seen these ads, but  I run I run a brave browser, which is an ad blocking browser. So this ad  Says thinks you're a female registered democrat and are likely to vote for the sitting president  What what I don't understand this ad what where's the ad that would that's what the ad would look like they're buying they're taking  the ad

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's just what I don't understand this ad what where's the ad that would that's what the ad would look like they're buying

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They're telling you basically how you're being so they're buying ads that the ad says how you're being targeted the second page of the ad  Says you're being watched. Are you okay with that introducing the privacy project from the new york times? So it is  Subsequently an ad for the new york times, but but but the point of the ad is to say to the ad viewer  This is who we think you are  Yeah, it's offering transparency in a lot of ways I think is really interesting I haven't seen I would like to see these ads

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is this the targeting the times did?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, they bought these ads for moms who they bought people in the big deal  What's the big deal?  not transparent  And you can I mean because generally when you see an ad for like if i'm a mom who I think  I'm gonna vote for trump or whatever  Maybe a pack will target a specific type of  Trump really loves women ad towards me, right?  And i'd see that and I wouldn't understand why I was seeing that but now the only difference. Sorry stacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I thought you were done. Go ahead. I think it's a great idea. I mean, yeah, maybe you could say  Seeing that as so what but at least so you bought it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You bought an ad on all the family because you wanted to get liberals. Well, that's the point is

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, there is a difference. These are much more granularly targeted you because because it's possible. Yeah, but welcome to the future of media

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But people don't understand that they don't understand how quickly and closely they can be targeted  And I would say if you see something that says you are likely to be a credit risk who still likes to buy fancy goods  That's actually something you should be aware of and you may not realize that you fit in that group

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let me just go back to the old the old days  I'm old enough to remember when we used axiom and direct mail has done that forever, right?  Forever with more data on you than anybody has and with your actual name and actual address  I can go to actually I do this for my students. I can go to axiom now  I haven't done this in a while, but i've been in the past where I said, okay  You want me to creep you out students? I can go into axiom and get the names and addresses  of women within  Two miles who have this kind of car this kind of education and so on and so forth  And that's the way that business has worked for 40 years 40 years

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I was going to say that because i've been I interviewed them way back  In the in the 80s or the 90s  In fact the times quotes axiom  saying well  It's not a it's not a science we  We predict for instance whether you'll buy an suv by looking at people who did buy suvs  Then checking whether you live in a similar region. You're about the same age you share similar interests  So it's really kind of a predictive model a guess almost yeah, exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So a friend of mine started a company that was then sold to aol  where  He did advertising  Where if you came into the new york times to the travel section  And then you left to go to weather.com  That data point about you that you that you looked at a travel section, which is really makes you really really valuable  Carried with you. This is the beginning of retargeting everything we had before right?  So he was at the very beginning of helping to invent this  But the thing that he taught me was a lot of the the correlations made no sense  This is the argument that my friend david weinberger makes in his new book everyday chaos  where a b testing and machine learning and such  Comes up with a prediction as you just said leo of a behavior for which there's no necessary explanation  It's just yeah people who have bought suvs in the past have these characteristics we have no idea why we're not targeting those people per se  We're just taking data. We have people about suvs and trying to find similar correlations to get them to buy more suvs  Nothing really sinister about that. It's just the way advertising has worked for a long time. It just has more data now

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yes, I actually agree with you jim

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I still thought it's a great campaign put that on the rundown this is the time when no

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think it's a great campaign. I think it is good to let people know about this  It's good to let people know about this. It's not good to use that as a way of generating

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Clicks. Well, the times is just jealous because the times can't do it times has had more  Well, no  The times has had more data points on people than most any media company because they started the paywall of the registration rather  Right. Yeah, and they asked you certain things that they wanted from you  And they have a reading history and they've targeted ads to this. I don't I haven't read the story  So I don't know how whether they admit their own sins  But believe me the times maxes out as much of this as they can possibly do. Yeah  They just can't do as much because they don't know as much right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am still are you upset about this jeff? I'm very upset about this. I subscribe to the new york times  and  They want me to pay five dollars a month for their food site

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I do too. I pay but I do both

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I really resent the heck out. I know but you get a lot for the food site  You get all the recipes going back a hundred years and you get all their business  There's a lot of good things in that food site that you don't get just because you could get the newspaper

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but they still have some of the recipes. That's what drives me nuts. I'm like, yeah  If I click on this is it kind of it works. Oh good

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I say that is a problem  They want to come up with more of those things so when they when they tell you how many digital subscribers they have  It's not all to the new york times. It's to crosswords and food and such  I pay for crosswords, too. Actually, I don't pay for so also important news. I want to put it in the rundown right now  I'm running the rundown because I've learned my lesson now because karsten yelled at me  um  guardian breaks even  That's a big deal  The guardian was always as the joke the line was real because they do not have a paywall  Precisely so they did a couple things about this one  They always called themselves profit seeking just somehow they could never find the profit now  They've at least found break even  And I full disclosure as I worked with the guardian on their membership strategy and we've learned quickly in they learned quickly  It wasn't a membership strategy. It was a begging strategy  brilliant woman named amanda mickle basically runs it and uh  And kath liner the editor at the end of every story has a piece that says you should feel very guilty right now with a  With a foreboding english accent because you should all pay for this

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I see this every time by the way, I have not yet paid for it  But since you're here, you should we have a small favor to ask

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They did an off-site with readers sometime ago in this process in the strategic process and the readers said  Uh, you know, how many of you would pay for the guardian?  Oh, some number went up how many of you would pay for the guardian to be free for the rest of the world every hand went up  Oh, wow, they made the guardian into a pause, which is what it is  And so this is not a lot of people call membership another word for subscription  That's not what they're doing here because you're not buying access to content. You are supporting the guardian for the good

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of the world. It's like when you donate to wikipedia

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, which I do or npr. I give them a monthly donation to wikipedia

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  um  Yeah, give a donation. I should get because I use the guardian. We frequently use the guardian for our shows  So i'm gonna give them a buck. Yeah tax ride off

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, actually, I don't think it is  I don't know the us that might go to their foundation

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, it doesn't have to be a non-profit. It's a business expense  I deduct the new york times subscription. I deduct all the subscriptions because it's a business

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, no, I was just thinking as like wikipedia is to the foundation. That's a charity tax. Yeah  But no, we deduct them as taxes all the way it is now kind of then that that  Then there's just branding it as a cause. It's not actually a cause well truthfully

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Because of the tax laws of the united states you have to get so much in charity  To exceed the what is it two or four percent of the adjusted gross income that you really don't get to deduct charity unless you are  Really a big giver on the other hand you can deduct all business expenses from

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Dollar one so schedule c don't people donate 10 percent of their income to charity

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, they're supposed to  That's tithing says god. Well, I know but that's that's  Yeah, but they take what is it? Is it four percent? I think it's four percent  So the first four percent, you know to get to deduct you get the second six percent. Okay. I was like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait, no people donate more than two to four percent, right? No

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, you're very generous. You do not you really donate 10 percent?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We try to I don't know if we get we don't always hit that exactly. But yeah

Transcript:  And then microwave it later  Then then they assemble in microwave. Yes burger king cooks its burgers over flame grill  They use a broiler and you load frozen patties onto a tray and shove them in it's a flame grill inside if the broiler messes up  Then you have to count the entire load as a waste and cook more  Okay, if you see smoke coming out of the roof, then you know, they're cooking
