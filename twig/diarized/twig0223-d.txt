Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'll be back. I'll be back.  She's moving to Brooklyn and we're never going to see her again.  No, just going to take a couple of weeks off from having definite appointments.  Because I'll be couch surfing and living out of a suitcase there for a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As somebody who just packed and moved and I'm still unpacking, it's just horrible.  It's the most horrible thing that you will ever do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the quickest way to change your self-perception from minimalist to hoarder.  I just started packing and I hate myself already. Why do I have all this stuff?  Why do I have all this stuff? So having a big garage sale before we leave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good idea. Somebody told me that. Get rid of everything. If in doubt, throw it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, anything that's not worth trucking across the country, we're selling it and we're going to start new, which is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, anyway, good luck with the move. Good luck with the pack. It's hard with kids.  But you're at the right side of that. See, what's really hard is when you have kids like who are 11 or 12.  And then they don't want you to throw out anything from their entire childhood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Ed is still small enough that we actually still kind of control her stuff and we can get rid of toys and she doesn't know yet.  Right. Yeah, so we are on the right side of that. So hopefully that'll be easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody once told me, watch out, you'll be losing keys. You'll be bumping into furniture. You're more prone to accidents.  It's one of those life changes that actually discombobulates your brain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and the weather change and the time zone change, we're all going to be a little discombobulated for a while, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't wait when Gina arrives back in January that she's going to have the thick accent back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you have a Brooklyn accent? Oh, absolutely. I worked really hard to get rid of it. I did. I worked really hard to get rid of it.  Oh, well, you come on. You have to hear it sometimes. It comes out. No, I've never heard it. I want to hear it.  When I say ball ball water. Oh, no, you didn't. You know, five dollars for a slice. You're going to talk like Rosie Perez from now on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't quite have it that bad. Oh, that would be really great. I would love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, my wife made me promise that we would like actively try not like to for Etta to not get the Brooklyn accent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like, look, you can't. Yeah, I can't get it all. We're losing regionalisms. It's one of the things that makes this country great.  It's one of the things that makes the world great is regionalisms, unique, you know, geographic differences.  I hate traveling is not nearly as fun as it used to be when you had to, you know, get the Herald Tribune three days later to get the baseball scores.  Now everything, you know, everything you see, it's not easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a line between charming and a little bit like, oh, that's where you're from. I don't know. There's something about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know who did it great? It was Scarlett Johansson and Don John. Yes, she's pretty good. She had the I was surprised.  I thought she must be from there. She was snapping, snapping the gum. That is Jeff Jarvis.  He he also has eliminated his patrician accent. He used to talk like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have no accent. I am the standard for how to speak English, but fast. He's middle Atlantic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I'm the one with no accent. Oh, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kevin Marks has no accent at all. We're the ones who sound weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a theory that that since singing all sounds like American accent, that that is the natural way to speak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why is that? Why is that? Would you explain that, Kevin Marks? When the Beatles sing, they sound American.  What is that on your you watch Eurovision and ABBA, except for a few slight weird glottal stops, sounds like they're American.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, it may be it may be the stretch of the vowels. And that may be what it is. Yeah, you stretch the vowels.  Very sloppy vowels. Yeah. And you have to do that to sing. It's easy. You know, you're singing in Germany.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's quite hard. I'm where I sing this. It's our sloppy vowels that make us so lovable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you have these smooth out vowel sounds that are that are different in well, in many American, but in most American, it's a bit of that, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But instead of saying love, love me, do you know I love you?  But always be true. It didn't sound like that. It could have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In that case, it was because they would they'd listen to the American blues thing. They wanted to sound like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, I don't think you could. No one sounds like that. Yeah, yeah, they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you listen to, you know, Pink Floyd saying, oh, you listen to the Clash thing, they sing in London accents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A little bit more. Yeah. So where are you, Kevin? It sounds like you're at a conference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am at the Giga Ohm Roadmap Conference. Oh, fun.  You know, before in the Center for the Arts. So it may be a little bit echoey.  And there were some trombones playing earlier. So we may know it's fine. In fact, you sound great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just I could tell you're at a conference. So what is Roadmap all about? Is it a look to the future?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's about what's interesting to own at the moment, which is which is usually a good signal.  Absolutely. A bit of the old e-tech where he was trying to find a bunch of things that are coming along.  But this the theme this year is very much about the intersection of technology and design.  And that's that's that's sort of broadly what's been discussed here.  People talking about the different possibilities around that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ohm Malik is the Yoda of tech and we love him dearly.  Give him a hug for us. He's just the greatest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  E-tech. That's a blast from the past, man. E-tech.  I miss E-tech. E-tech was one of the better events.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is the speakers he's had. He had Jack Dorsey and Jeff Veen and Eric Spiekermann and Tony Fadal.  And so a lot of people who who've been working with design and engineering at the same time.  It's been quite interesting for that perspective on product design and thinking about it.  I've got a bunch of notes up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The I know there's so many big stories this week.  This is a big week for Google between the Google barge, helpouts, KitKat and of course, the Nexus five.  I don't know where to start. But since I have a Nexus five in my hot little hands, I thought, you know, we got to start with this.  This might be the good place to start. So I don't know.  You know, both Chad and I ordered ours and so does Kevin Marks.  I see his ordered ours within an hour of the beginning of sales, which about 11 a.m. Pacific on Halloween Day, the 31st.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did your IFTTT recipe work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It did, except I should never have mentioned it because a lot of people went on app.net to prank me.  So your phone was just blowing up.  Yeah. The other thing that I noticed, and this is maybe something to remember for future reference,  it does it in block and clumps. And I don't know if that's the app.net API or IFTTT.  If this then that.  It's polling. Yeah.  But it was the plan. The polling was not right.  We're not very regular. So this is probably not the ideal way to do it.  As it turned out, I think somebody mentioned it on Twitter or Google plus or whatever.  I was I knew it was going to be that day and I was watching carefully.  I bought a 16 gigabyte because when I first went to the site, that's all it showed.  And then the chat room said, oh, no, just modify the URL to 32 gigabytes.  You could change the black to white if you want.  You can get whatever kind you want. So I did that and I got the 32 and I have a 16.  I think maybe we'll have a raffle or something of the 16.  We'll figure out some way to give that away.  I used to do real hacking.  So a couple of things about it. It's yes, Jeff and Gina, I know both of you are Nexus four lovers.  It is everything the Nexus four was and better.  It's 1080p now instead of 720p. Very nice screen.  Although I you know, I complained about the Nexus four screen.  I felt it was a little washed out and this screen feels a little bit washed out too.  I've put a black wallpaper on it to give it more contrast and it's a little bit preferable to me.  But one advantage it has, whatever they're doing with this screen, maybe they're turning the brightness up is it's great in sunlight.  In fact, I've never seen a phone that looks better in bright sunlight. It's totally usable.  It could be the IP. It's an IPS LCD screen. It could be that's a feature.  Oh, and I just showed you another thing because it's Kit Kat.  It's our first look at what Android 4.0 and I'm sorry Android 4.4 does.  And one of the first things you'll notice immediately is the home screens are done differently.  When you slide to the left, you get Google Now.  I'm going to turn the I'm going to turn the brightness down a little bit here because it's it's over.  I kind of like to the swipe up swipe up still there.  Oh, it is. Yeah.  By the way, notice this transparency. Google Now actually now goes behind the buttons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Surprised they don't do the full screen on that. But yeah, that's nice.  Yeah. And I think we're going to see more of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the swipe up still works. You saw that.  And then you can you can still swipe up and, you know, tap Google or but it what it does is stay there all the time or they disappear.  They stay there all the time. Isn't that odd? But they're transparent.  The other thing is it's always listening when the screen's unlocked.  And you have to say, OK, Google. And it will work like that.  And by the way, notice the transparency behind it. I think you're going to see a lot more transparencies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, look at the translation. That's fast. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If this is good, I think they've done a very nice job.  They have changed a few things. For instance, you can no longer add widgets through the app door.  The app door is just an app door. There's no more of this widget tab to get a widget.  You have to have a free space somewhere on your screen. I don't. Oh, man.  Limited screens, I thought you do. But OK, so the only way you can get to a new screen is to is to slide it over.  And now I've made a new screen. Oh, yeah. How do you do that is a good question.  So this was not immediately obvious to me either, Kevin.  If you slide a widget or if you put it so here's I'll show you.  Here's how you get to widgets or apps you press and hold on empty spot.  And now we have wallpapers, widgets. And here's an interesting thing. Settings for Google Now.  I think this people have said Google Now is everywhere and I think this is the case.  So any time you if this is this is the this is the view of the home screens.  So you can reorder the home screens all except for that Google Now page, which as you can see, I can't get to and I can't reorder.  So I could take this and drag it around.  If I've created a home screen, if I want a new home screen, I can just drag a widget or an app over to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So how did you get into that mode? This mode? Press and hold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And actually, you know what? It works on a does it work on a widget? No, it doesn't.  So press and hold. And now I can. This is how you do it, Kevin. You drag it over.  And now I have more screens. And then if you press and hold to get the widget screen, you see, I see all of the screens and I can read.  I see. OK, so it creates a nice screen. Yeah, you have to actually ask for it.  In effect, ask for a new screen by moving something there.  It also that will work also with an app. So if you take an app and you and you drag it, you can put it on a new screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The other way the widgets. Yeah. It's kind of cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Other changes.  I think you'll see all of this. Oh, there's a big thing here that I think is actually a mistake.  There's two things that are that are really big changes.  One is you see here Hangouts is the new messages. You still have a message.  You still have a messaging app for for text messages. It's still there, but don't use it.  There's no reason to use it because Hangouts now does it all.  So we had heard that Hangouts will allow text messaging. It does.  All the text messages go in there. Google Voice messages and Hangouts messages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's an all in one messenger by default. I didn't know you didn't have to go in and say you hang out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, this was how it was configured was with with it already in the dock.  But you do still have, I believe, a message message.  Maybe not. I don't see it. I saw the dialer, but I didn't see.  No, that's another big change. The dialer is very different.  And I think a big improvement. I make sure I don't want to show any phone numbers here. No, no phone numbers.  It's very different. The search will now search not only everything in your contact list, but also searches Google Places.  And also caller ID comes from Google Places.  So if somebody calls me from an 800 number, even if they're not my contact list, there may be information about them from Google Places, which is kind of cool.  The phone number dialer does no longer now takes up the whole screen. It just slides up the contact list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have to be careful here. If you're in an SMS, then you get a little telephone like on there instead of the hangouts like on it.  It'll make it'll make a Google Voice phone call. Oh, that's interesting.  So I don't want to show any. I don't know if it will make us Google Voice phone call or it will make a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So here I'm in an SMS. And actually, this is a voice number because somebody sent me a text via voice.  So this is not a real number, but I can call.  What else I can add to people? This is all within hangouts.  Yeah, I got to be careful because I don't want to show any.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you see when it's a Google Hangout ID, you see the name and a little video camera and it when it's SMS, you see the name and a little phone icon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, or actually says SMS. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The chat room says, hold down the screen indicator area to get to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, OK. So if I've run out of room. Yeah, that works also.  So I was complaining because I didn't have any empty space on the screen.  You can also hold these little dots, the screen indicator that's empty.  That's considered empty space so you can get there as well.  Oh, I see. OK. One thing that's a little odd is there are two gallery apps now.  There is the traditional AOSP kind of gallery app and there's a photos app.  And this really is an interface to Google Plus Photos.  This is how you get all the new features of the auto, awesome, the video editing and all that stuff.  So this is really they've extracted out of Google Plus the app, just the photo page basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So those photos are on your phone or those are in the cloud?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ah, cloud. No, no, they're on the.  Yeah, so they give you both. See, so there's camera. There's camera.  If you look at it, Chad, if there's camera and then there's highlights.  So that's Google Plus and that's camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because there's sometimes a delay between the time you take the photos and they get uploaded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right. Yeah. This auto.  The backup settings are in here now and it does allow you to do full size.  This is all stuff that they added to Google Plus.  But this is I think it's a nice interface, frankly, to Google Plus Photos, but you might be a little confused.  You still have a gallery. Your gallery works as before, but there's also this photo app.  I think any other features I should mention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is there a new photo editor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not that I noticed. Maybe photos. Let me look. Let's let's look.  It's in the gallery now.  OK, Jason Howell, a host of All About Android, is saying it's in the gallery.  So let's take a picture and then I can.  Oh yeah, here's the here's a little pencil icon and I can edit this.  And I've got, you know, punch vintage, all of the all of the new editing stuff.  It's a lot like SnapStream. I've got frames.  I've got crops, including crops, straighten, rotate and mirror.  That's nice. This is going to be fun.  All the lies you can do in photos now. Yeah. Auto color.  Which is not very accurate. Exposures. You can change the exposure.  This is nice. This is you may not need SnapStream anymore.  You got a lot of the features of SnapStream built in, which is, of course, what you'd have seen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sorry, which is I get I get what you want to edit this with link like on the photo the first time.  Ah, so interesting is showing the original gallery and saying photo editor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it doesn't say the once or always. It didn't ask me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Huh? Yeah, that must be. I've got a lot of these features, not quite all of them.  It must have been sort of an incremental update to the editor because there is an editor in gallery right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What are you on? A Nexus four? I'm on a C1.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you got four for I know I not yet. I don't have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, so that's the other thing is some apps are being updated independently of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm seeing different things in the different ones. Yeah.  So in the photo editor in the gallery, I get the punch in the vintage and the we want to be Instagram thing.  But if I click on it and do the the photos one, I get a different subset of options.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's not going to work. Whatever you're doing, a different name.  Holding it up to the camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's also there's a unified file picker. Have you checked this out, Leo? Where would I get to that?  So I don't know in any in any app where you're opening a file, maybe in a.  Send someone a file. OK, let's try that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's go to Gmail and I want to email work attach to a new image and I want to.  Attach something attached picture attached video.  So this is the picture. Yeah, I like this. This looks more like the.  And then you also have and this is a big deal.  Not only do I have access to drive through this, but also drop whatever you've attached.  So in this case, Dropbox Astro file manager, photos gallery, downloads, images drive and recent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's that is nice. Oh, so you've connected your Dropbox account to your.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I had connected it before and so it now sees that in the picker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's really nice. Yeah, really nice. Oh, so I can open directly from Dropbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As well as Google Drive. That's really nice. And that's apparently that's a unified file picker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Any any dev making any app that involves opening a file can just it can just evoke that  and doesn't have to worry about writing any of that custom code, but also gets access to all whatever cloud sources.  That's nice. Which is really nice.  I'm so glad to see it's not just Google Drive that you can connect other apps like Box or Dropbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, if I don't have a box account, so I would guess box and all the other things.  It's the traditional share thing as you add those apps, they get added to the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I cloud probably doesn't work. I bet SkyDrive. I wonder if SkyDrive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I should buy it and see now a lot of us are going to get for for they've there's the list of phones that are getting for for is getting longer and longer.  And one of them is Moto X. Now I think for for is really worth getting.  But when I compare this phone to Moto X, I have to say that I'm probably going to still carry the Moto X day to day.  So advantages are that the the Nexus five definitely has a better screen, bigger screen.  It's five inches compared to four point seven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's also 1080p compared to which is 720, which is absolutely amazing to look at 1080p on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's beautiful. But I like many of the features that the Moto X has.  I like the trusted Bluetooth that unlocks it automatically.  I like the Motorola skip feature. I like the shake to take a picture feature.  I like the the Motorola assist is an amazing feature right now, for instance.  I said this before and I got in trouble.  Nobody can call me because I'm in a meeting, right?  Unless they're in a trusted trusted person.  Those things work really well for me.  There's a sense is when you're a car, when you're in a meeting, when you're asleep, the do not disturb features.  Great. I don't get bothered at night anymore, which is really great.  And these are all features that Motorola added and Motorola says the Moto X is going to get four four like soon.  They're going to skip right out right over four point three.  On the other hand, the camera, I think in the Nexus five is better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll show you some software. There was a software issue on the Moto X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They updated the Moto X camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody was kind of said the camera wasn't great to put the verge really seemed to have a hard on for the Nexus five.  And I don't know why.  I don't think I agree with many of the things that they said.  They were really nasty about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A lot of question marks. Yeah.  The ultimate Google phone question mark.  But it seems like Josh was took most issue with the camera.  Well, let me show you fixable fixable with software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And he said that in good light, it takes pictures that are that are really good.  But in some lesser conditions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'll show you a good light picture and I'll show you a bad light.  It does have optical image stabilization.  So I think that makes a big difference.  It also is slow.  And I think that's the biggest complaint I have.  Moto X is much quicker to get the picture.  On the other hand, when you get the picture, I think this is an HDR picture.  The crispness, the detail is excellent.  This is low light, relatively low light.  This is even lower light because while I'm on a set that's lit, chat is not lit right now.  And I think the low light performance is excellent here.  Colors.  Colors.  Very good.  The details.  Very good.  Some of it's HDR, some of it's not.  I wish I don't remember.  Maybe.  Oh, you know, it'd be in the details.  Let me go back here and see if it marks that.  It doesn't say.  I guess it doesn't say it does say the F stop, the exposure.  It doesn't look like it says.  If it's.  I think this is an.  I think I'm very happy with the results of this camera.  I think it does a very, very nice job.  And I think that the color is very accurate.  I think this rivals the iPhone 5, frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  So it's the Motorola features of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the Motorola add-ons purely.  And you'll sacrifice screen size and quality with some caveats.  I feel it's a little washed out compared to the Moto X.  And camera.  Camera quality for cameras.  That's on the Nexus 5.  It beats them on that respect.  But on the Moto X camera speed is much.  I can get to a picture so much faster on the Moto X.  I could just tap and it's and I've got a picture.  It's just very quick.  But the pictures are not as satisfying.  They're not bad.  But I think I think that the you know,  and it is the difference between an IPS screen and an AMOLED screen.  Exactly.  So if you, as I do, prefer the AMOLED color and the contrast,  you'll like the Moto X better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they're both wireless charging or no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No. Moto X does not have wireless charging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's a battery life like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Moto X, I think, beats it pretty handily.  The Moto X has this advantage of this X processor,  this external processor, whatever they call it, the X8,  that is on watching for listening for talking.  The other thing with the Moto X, you can talk to it at any time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's touchless. You don't have to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This has touchless, but the phone has to be awake.  Right.  And I think that the Moto X is getting better battery life than the Nexus 5.  Nexus 5 is not bad. It's maybe 12 hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the price difference now for the unlocked?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a big difference.  Moto X is almost twice as much.  Yeah.  That's a big difference.  In many ways, that's the headline on the Nexus 5,  is $350 for 16 gigs, $400 for 500 gigs.  The Moto X has wireless? Oh, I didn't know that.  I wasn't able to do it, but maybe I haven't been.  I thought it did not have wireless.  I don't like wireless charging.  I have a lot of cheap chargers all around the house,  and you have to position it just right.  This apparently now has magnets in it, and they have a new Nexus 5 charger.  And the magnets help position it, then that will make a difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Doesn't seem like something that...  I can't tell if it's that people don't talk about wireless charging very much.  I don't have it. I've never had it in my devices.  But my fantasy is that someday I'm just going to take my phone  and lay it down somewhere, and it'll just work.  But does it not just work in its current iteration?  That's the thing.  You've got to position the phone correctly.  You do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I bought, because I have my Nexus 4 and my Nexus 7,  I thought, oh, this would be great. I have wireless chargers.  I have Anker. I have the Google wireless charger.  And I have an Energizer wireless charger.  And at least with the Nexus 4 and the Nexus 7,  getting it into exactly the right position is tricky.  You have to look at the light to see if it's charging.  If it gets knocked loose, it's not going to charge.  It takes a long time to charge. It's not an efficient way to charge.  I ended up just plugging it in, because then I know it's in.  I know it's in. It's charging.  And it's charging at the maximum speed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's not good enough.  It's got to be... the wireless charging to be really worth it.  It has to be super easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was a little disappointing.  Moto X does not have wireless charging.  I don't know why somebody in our chat room said that.  But I don't think wireless is really a great form of charging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not getting... I haven't gotten it yet,  but I'm not getting buyers remorse in going for the Nexus 5 over the Moto X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good. I think you'll like the Nexus.  Look, anybody who loved the Nexus 4, which you did,  is going to say, this is the Nexus 4, and it's even better.  No glass back. Nice soft touch back.  It's much less fragile.  Feels good in the hand?  Feels good in the hand. It's a little big compared to...  You know, one thing...  It's sad because I think the Moto X is not getting much love,  and it deserves it because I think in many ways  this would be the most satisfying phone for most people.  This is a better size for the hand. It's just a little bit smaller.  On the other hand, I took both out in a bright sunlight,  and the Nexus 5 is easily the best in bright sunlight.  In fact, I've never seen a phone that's this good in bright sunlight.  It's really great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've got one here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is one that Nicholas Chabonnier showed me,  which is an E Ink screen phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He brought that to Twitter on Sunday.  It's very slow.  It's using the same screen technology as in the Kindle,  but at least it looks good in bright light.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And he's also...  Have you already seen the Android iPhone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. I guess he had more than one.  I bought from him the Android iPhone, the Android Nexus,  the Android Lumia 1020, and the fake Note 3.  See, he must have had more in his little peddler's pack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's an unholy marriage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's even weirder than that because half the apps are actual...  They look like the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The clock app is indistinguishable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the phone app looks like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's horrible. I don't know what that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you click on Maps, it goes straight to Google Maps,  but the weather one is like a complete clone of the Apple one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's an Apple one.  Look at the clock app. It's exactly the same.  And this is Android.  This company spent a lot of energy in making this indistinguishable  from an iPhone, except that it's clearly distinguishable.  And I don't know if you saw this, Kevin.  Yesterday, I got into some weird boot cycle  with a lot of Chinese characters going,  and I had to just guess what to hit.  It was all very strange.  How much was it?  Wow.  Yeah.  But it's really clear what they're selling these for is  not to fool the owner.  The owner knows it's not Windows Phone.  They don't even hide it.  I mean, they don't say Windows Phone on it.  This says something weird on it, Clot Cud.  But it's to fool your friends  to think you have a prestigious high-value phone like an iPhone.  This doesn't say Apple on it.  You know?  It says it's a digital audio player.  It should say Design in China, Assembled in China.  That would be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That would be really good.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's the Nexus.  It even has stitching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It also says some of them, they've changed the version string.  So they look like they're running higher versions of Android  than they are in things.  Oh, I bet.  This one's a version string.  Even though it's the Android settings,  the version looks like it says iOS version 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  They have some good programmers.  I mean, this is the iOS settings.  You know, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's got the bounce and everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody spent some effort doing this.  Anyway, isn't that fun?  So how much did Nicklaus sell you that for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no, he just, I saw him on the show.  He said, oh, I'll leave them here so you can...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, all right, yeah, I bought them all.  Charbacks.  I've got his full set here.  Armdevices.net.  Oh, look at that.  You do have the full set.  Oh, wow.  You got them all.  I guess he buys several because he's,  I thought he was selling me his only copies,  but I guess...  Well, he goes back and forth every month

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and visits the same people and stuff they've made.  Right, and Shenzhen, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because there was a Zeynep Tveki  who was grumbling on Medium,  I don't know if you saw this,  saying that she couldn't get a phone  that was the right size for her hands  because she's got small female hands  and all the Android phones are too big.  So I think we need to put her together with Charbacks  and say, okay, you know,  give him your specs and he'll have some  of my manufacturer Android phones.  Hey, there is, I think, good news coming your way, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I saw you posted on Google+.  According to...  I wouldn't call it good news.  Well, there's news.  According to Fandroid, Verizon says it's Google and Asus' fault  that they can't activate the Nexus 7.  These are systems issues with 4.3.  I smell a rat.  I'm looking for the tail.  Yeah.  Because they said there's some systems issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they said Google and Asus asked Verizon  to suspend the certification process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because Google is never going to piss off Verizon.  Well, good news is that,  the reason I say it's good news is that 4.4

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  will be available on Nexus 7 soon,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  like this week or next.  Who knows, Vlad?  Well, who knows, Vlad?  Of course it will.  Yeah, I filed a...  The funny thing was, just this morning,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I filed a continuing complaint with the FCC  that I was going to be able to get a phone  continuing complaint with the FCC.  Because they said that the certification  was going to go to four to six weeks,  started in August.  Hey.  That means somewhere between September 1  and mid-October, it should have been done.  It's now into November.  So I said, enough, FCC.  And we'll see.  So this afternoon, they came out with this.  Then also yesterday, of course,  they announced their own seven-inch tablet.  Hmm, am I competitive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, wow.  Oh, smoking gun?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They still haven't hooked it up.  So I don't...  The thing is, Google is never going to piss off Verizon.  Google has done the devil's deal with Verizon  about neutrality.  They just go to Google and say,  hey, just ask us to delay this, okay?  And Google says, okay.  Yes, Dawn, Verizon.  And so we'll never know what happened there  unless the NSA has been listening.  But now Verizon is hiding behind us.  I still question the certification.  I still say the FCC should get discovery  on what was discovered in the certification  because the certification alone  makes a lie of the notion of open.  Right.  The phone meets standards that are set.  Standards are what rule here, not certification.  So what happens when you get the Google,  the Motorola, rather, modular phone  that comes out and some hacker makes a module for it?  Is Verizon going to insist on certifying these things  and going through thousands of dollars of that?  No. If it's an open network, it's an open network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wasn't this the famous landmark decision,  the Carter phone decision, where Ma Bell was required  to allow third-party phones on the network?  They used to say you have to rent  Western electric equipment from us  because we have to have a reliable system.  In 1968, the FCC said, nope.  Carter phone, that was the specific device,  can be connected to the AT&T network  as long as it can be shown not to cause harm.  So that's what opened up the network way back in 68.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly. So the same thing going on now.  Open is open is open.  Now, there are some people who are complaining  and saying that I should add the Nexus 5  network on Verizon to this, but that's different  for a couple reasons.  One is that the Nexus 5 depends on the CDMA  networks of the frequencies, and those are not open.  Those are in fact proprietary.  The only thing that was open here, that was made open,  was the 700 MHz block C spectrum  because that was the condition of the sale of it to Verizon.  So Verizon is still not acting openly,  so I still call them on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, another good piece of information  that you might be interested in is it looks like  the Moto Maker site is going to come to sprint  in the next week or so.  I hope Verizon and I hope T-Mobile,  and I'm going to beg Kai Kawasaki  to let me order a wooden-backed phone.  So if I can use Moto Maker on T-Mobile,  I might have an extra Nexus 5.  I just want a wooden phone.  I like the Nexus 5, but ultimately you have to pick one phone, right?  It's not practical to carry around.  Well, not you.  Well, this is my problem. I only want to carry one phone.  Did you see the picture? I should have said there was a picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So a lot of people do carry two because they have a work phone  and a personal phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just went to a conference,  a fancy-schmancy four-square conference it's called,  not that four-square, but for Ron Rytle-Lizard,  and it's off the record,  but Sir Martin Sorrell was on stage and he had his BlackBerry  and he was being ridiculed for having a BlackBerry.  There was also a great picture I should have saved of,  I think it was in China, of a bus with like 25 phones in the dash.  Frightening.  I think it was actually driving that way. I think it was a joke.  I hope it's a joke.  It looks like something, the Leo car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My friends call it the booty phone and the duty phone.  Booty and duty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the work phone and the personal phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is which? Booty and duty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I definitely feel like Saul Goodman here at the moment  with this set of things here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You've got quite a few, yeah.  That's right, he opens a drawer on Breaking Bad  and pulls out a burner phone and says,  here, use this. Hello, Kitty phone?  Hey, it's free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Also, the other slightly weird thing is that these bootleg phones  have the actual Google Play Store on, which is surprising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know, I thought that was very weird.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So maybe Google's just turning a blind eye  because they want the market share like Microsoft used to do  with pirate versions of Windows, or maybe they just haven't worked out  how to enforce this yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, just to be clear, they could use the open-source version  of Android without any interference and fork it as Amazon.  Yeah, Amazon does. It's the apps, the Google apps that make it a violation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, but they are running Maps and they're running the Play Store  and they're running the core apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe Google's saying, hey, what the heck?  How could it be bad for them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Even the iPhone-y one, if you click the Apple Maps, you get Google Maps on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, I know. It's got the Apple Maps icon, though.  Even with Highway 280 and everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Whereas the store, they spawn something that looks very like the Apple App Store,  but I'm not sure what happens when I try and install something from it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What size SIM do these things have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. Let me look.  Which?  They look like big SIMs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I imagine. They all have the micros.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just to be clear, this is Android with an iOS-like skin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, these are all Android that are skinned and running on devices  that look like other people's proprietary devices.  And it's because they're too expensive in China.  These are all 50 bucks or less.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they're a bit more if you want 3G rather than 2G and things like that.  It's like a shopping list for what features you get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Google has announced a new tool to help you get things done.  I don't want to preempt the change log.  I don't think you have this in the change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's do it. Let's talk about it.  Helpouts.  Paid, but sometimes they're free.  Where I guess it's using Google Hangouts.  So a knowledgeable person is helping out on...  The video is kind of fun, Leo.  Should I play the video?  Yeah, the video is great. The video is really cool.  Let's watch the video.  This is the Google Helpouts advertisement.  Typing in photo retouching.  And these are helpouts for photo retouching.  $10 per helpout.  I'm going to tell you what to do.  And you get one on one help.  I want you to look for the curve tool.  See if you can soften your shoulders towards each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yoga.  Put your middle finger...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is teaching hand gestures.  On the guitar.  Oh, sorry. Yeah, yeah.  Be nice.  For the audio folks, they have no idea.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's an idea. Maybe I can do one on how to curse.  Just to really give them a little bit of extra...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, this is the one I need.  Makeup tips.  Seriously, I need an office stylist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's cool about this is that she's looking in the mirror  with her computer behind her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Behind her, right.  Cooking?  I'd be too embarrassed to use this.  I'm just shy though, I guess.  Oh yeah.  Real help from real people in real time.  Helpouts.Google.com.  It is a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a whole new market for skills, right?  So you have the Etsy's and you got YouTube.  But this is like...  I'm an expert in this thing.  And you notice their price.  So you can say $20 per help out.  I'll help you out. I don't know how you set it.  Like an hour or 30 minutes.  People email me all the time and just like,  hey, can we do a call?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can I just run some ideas by your whatever?  Could I charge $180 a minute?  I think if you set any price, they get 20%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They get 20%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So could I say I'll give you a half an hour of my time for $1,000?  Try it.  I will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have to approve you now though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so here's what you do.  You click the helpouts.google.com page  and you say I'd like to apply.  You have to have an invitation code right now  because it's early days yet.  And I guess you go through the process  of applying.  Pick your price.  Set your own rate for each help out  and get paid easily using Google Wallet.  Charge a fixed price per help out  or set a per minute rate.  You set up your schedule.  You decide when you're available.  And then I guess you get in the directory.  Now there's a button here  that says give your own help outs.  Yeah, I guess you have to get vetted by Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then there was also  there's a story on the next one down  from Giga Home saying that for now  for health, they're not doing it.  And this seems to indicate  they're not doing it at a price. They're making them free for now.  Health is free. So here's a couple

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  pet wellness information, nutritional counseling.  That's $65.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can add to this with insurance companies  or medical plans or

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This one's paid.  I can get a nutrition counseling for $65.  Pet stuff's free.  Here's a help with your medical  questions. $60 per help out.  $5 per minute. Dr. Rodney Samman.  He's a preventative cardiologist  in Los Angeles.  Psychotherapy on call  for $90.  Bill Zicca.  Dr. Bill, he calls himself.  That's an interesting idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Talk to a shrink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's an HBO show. What's her name?  But what's nice about this is it's less expensive.  He's got a PhD in psychology.  He's a clinical psychologist licensed to  practice in California. Now I wonder  Do you have to call from California?  24 hour note is required  or fees apply for cancellation.  So you set up an appointment next available  time 10 a.m. Just like a real therapist  really. $90 for 45  minutes though is maybe  half or  a little more than half what it would cost  for a real therapist.  I don't see any reason why a hangout wouldn't be  every bit as good as sitting on a couch across from  somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  categories are home art  and music computers and electronics cooking  education and careers fashion  and beauty fitness and nutrition health  and home and garden.  I wouldn't mind let's see fashion online personal  styling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That would be obvious one. Which one?  Sports coaching.  It's like OK let me show you how to hit that golf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a little hard to do it out in the field but  they don't have that.  You got phones

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that runs on these. Well they got fitness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's see if there's fitness.  Marathon training.  Party proof your weight loss from Weight  Watchers. So there's some brands  doing stuff here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's actually a good that makes sense  for Weight Watchers. Here's some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You want to use kettlebells.  $30 per help out of buck 25 a minute.  What the heck are kettlebells?  What? Oh come on.  You don't know what kettlebells are?  No.  Basically think of a giant cement  ball.  That you swing around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yoga.  I would be dangerous with that.

Transcript:  Hi I'm Melissa Trinidad with Optimal Health  and Performance Training.  This Google help out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This just came out a couple of days ago.  They've got a ton of stuff. So they've obviously been soliciting people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've cheated it with some  good start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Prenatal personal training. This is great.  But Gina's right too. What's really interesting  is that this is a spare cycle business too.  Not for Weight Watchers  but for just what the heck I got nothing going on  anymore. This is how like demand media works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you're a personal trainer  this is huge.  A nutrition counselor. A psychotherapist.  I think that's very interesting.  Here's a guy. $15  for an hour he'll work with you on P90X.  That's cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do they have educational stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. What would you like to  learn Kevin Marks?

Transcript:  Here's physics tutoring.  Tutoring. What a ball for  tutoring.  Free resume evaluation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What a ranking  rating system on top of this. Who are the good

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  tutors? That's what they need.  They do need a karma system.  Beginning and intermediate algebra  tutoring. Oh I'm going to have Abby do this. This is  great. Chinese language.  Science and math.  Rock computer science homework.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jake would love this too.  College internship.  What about programming or technical?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well there's getting started with the  Dutch language.  I'm sure there is.  Understanding Shakespeare.  Learn effectively. Take better notes. I'm going to send a link to this  to my kid in college.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was thinking that of Abby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fabulous. Here it is. Intro to  computer science.  This guy is  or if you have a general programming question  this guy is a PhD student in applied algorithms  and chemo informatics  at the Colorado School of Mines.  He's got a BS in computer science  and software engineering  and a minor in mathematics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they do have reviews.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh they do.  Five star reviews. This guy is amazing.  Just had a few questions and JK thoroughly  explaining me answers. Would recommend him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is great. Similar to  app reviews. In fact it's interesting.  Just like app reviews.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is amazing.  I'm loving this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's a whole marketplace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why do you use this instead of just advertising  the fact that you're available? It looks like this  system's like the 20% that you're  paying Google as somebody who's offering  it all out. It's for marketing.  It's for scheduling. It's for reviews.  It's for discovery. Payment.  This is really neat. They've got a front end.  I think 20% is high.  Look Leo, if you were going to do  an hour long tech cop out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If I'm doing it for $1,000

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and they get $200 that's not so good.  But I still get $800.  I'll charge $1,250  and then I'll get my money back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And if you have your own platform  somebody can Gmail you the $1,000  through wallet without Google  taking a cut. So this is about discovery  and also it's about  the ratings which ultimately is about discovery.  And it's about scheduling.  You know, booking times.  Which looks like there's some UI here for that.  Latin help?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  SAT prep?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the market. Let's let Gino  forget this. G, I need  to get some help with Photoshop.  Where am I going to go to start?  Google. I'm going to search  Google and see if I'm going to find people  who can teach me in Google.  So this is a search play  across this new field.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  How do I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  do?  Whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Clever. I'm going to take this one.  Speaking confidently and dynamically  without fear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I need this.  How about taking a course on how to sneak a soup slurp?  Shh.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, I should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Eating on air. I could teach  that course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. Kevin, what would you teach?  I can't wait  for this because I know  this is going to be, Kevin could teach the most arcane  things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Something you're like the world's leading expert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ah, no, the thing is I  am dilettante so I  run around all kinds of different things. I'm not sure  where I can actually sell here. It probably  would be, you know,  web standards and software  stuff I was actually considering to make money on it.  I should try that. I'll probably have to tidy up my office a bit  so I don't have to go in the garden each time the thing rings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's one for you  Gina. Chocolate. Everything you  need to know. Oh, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's the thing I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That doesn't scale very well.  So you're paying $20. I wonder if  they can also offer group classes.  Five of you  at the same time each paying $20.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. That would make  more sense for certain kinds of  teaching and things as well. I love this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For like classes you can do something like Khan Academy.  See, this is the thing. If I'm trying  to work with layers in Photoshop or I really want  to cut out the background behind something in an image and I can't  figure out how to do it. I'm going to go to Google.com and be like  how do I black out everything in the background  in Photoshop. If  Google returns, hey, get Photoshop help  by this expert.  I'm going to want to do this help out and be like  listen, here's my screen. I'm sharing my screen.  How do I do this thing I'm going to try to do? Like a very  specific question.  And that I would pay a premium  for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here on the cooking  section there are people helping you with culinary  crises.  Ever run into a kitchen crisis? Are you wondering whether to saute  stir fry or sous vide?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  me and my  Google Calendar we're trying to share  the company Google Calendar and get  right rights to it and it took us  together with two laptops and this is  what we'll do.  It took us 20 freaking minutes to figure out  how to make the calendar writable by both of us  on our personal accounts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sometimes you just run into a situation

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  where you're like how do I do this stupid thing?  Someone can just tell you  right there on the spot.  But imagine the high school kid in the middle  of Alaska who knows a lot about computers  and wants to make a little extra money.  You can be a remote geek squad.  I wonder how much help

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google gives you on your presentation  on what the shot looks like.  On how to do the screen sharing.  Or are you expected  or are you just thrown into this? It would be really nice  if Google had a team  and I bet they do know in Google  of people who work with you  and say okay let's fix that shot.  Let's get some lights in here. Make it  work better.  Because here's one. Confused  by wires? I can help.  Wanting to  gain knowledge in your home theater, home security,  landscape lighting and home automation. I'm the  guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I need different wires through my new house.  I might dial up that guy.  And I like that some of these are marked as available  for live help now.  I imagine you can just click on it and the person's going to  be there versus scheduling something ahead of time.

I just need somebody to talk to my finances with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It would be my guess that the more  specific you are. If you actually said  I'm going to do help outs on  is your kid coming out? Let me help you  with the transition. Would be much more effective  than saying I'm just a general counselor.  Yes. Agreed. Be specific.

Transcript:  He's great. We've had him on before and I  want to get, we're going to get him on again.  But I'm guessing that he, you know he's not currently  involved with the Obama administration but he did their  digital strategy for the  2008 election.  I think everybody's involved again.  I'm willing to bet and I don't know  I'll ask him that he got the call.  And they said  we need some techie people to go out there and explain  what's going on.  But I don't know.  We'll find out. He reached out to us.  Top Chef University  vegan vegetarian lifestyle  cooking, Caribbean cooking.  This is really a neat  idea. Anyway we could go on and on. This has  become an ad. But I think  this is where you really have  Google has really  built, I said this a while ago  that it's at Google I.O.  you really get the feeling that they've built a platform  and now they have the opportunity to really explore  it in so many

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  neat ways. Compare this to  the Kindle's new, what's it called?  Oh yeah, Mayday. The Mayday button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Kevin Rose did it and like screencast it just to see what it was like.  He did it and said how do I get to settings?  And it was a dude who looked nothing like Jennifer.  That's the problem. By the way her name is Amy.  We've been corrected.  Yeah, Kevin Rose Mayday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He tweeted it a while back.  He said it's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Man, Mayday as a name is genius.  I agree.  But if your product needs that, that tells you something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sure they debated that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, Jeff?  Just one quick note related to what we just talked about.  Google also announced connected classrooms  where classrooms can use Hangouts  to take field trips.  I'll mention that real quickly.  This educational push is really interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to see how they're using Plus to do that.  It's clear they're not pushing just in education.  They're pushing everywhere.  They're building a barge for parties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're all about connecting people  on their platform.  What's a barge?  We know they've been building this barge

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  in the San Francisco Bay Area.  We speculated it might be a floating data center.  Our local Channel 5 KPIX said,  No, we know.  It's a Google Glass showroom.  This sounded ridiculous.  Without Windows.  Now, finally, Google has said,  Sadly, none of the above.  They told USA Today,  although it's still in early days and things may change,  we're exploring using the barge  as an interactive space where people can learn  about new technology.  Well, maybe it is for Google Glass.  Not exactly a party barge.  More like a gadget barge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For us, that's a party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's the party deck up top  and showrooms down below.  This is what Channel 5 speculated.  I guess Channel 5 is the most accurate so far.  You know what I think this really is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Remember when Larry Page said at I.O.  that he wanted this country where he could do anything he wanted to?  That sounds more like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the barge.  I'll move in.  They're making four.  We know they've got one in Maine, one in San Francisco,  and there's two others which we can't pinpoint.  But really, maybe it's not four, it's 4,000  and they're going to tie them all together in the middle of the ocean  and it's suddenly Google land.  Yay, I'm there.  I would go.  Google, if you want me to move, we'll do the show from there.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It'll have good bandwidth.  Although, did you see this?  LA, the city of Los Angeles, is going straight up against Google  to create a fiber network.  They're asking for bids that would wire every one of the 3.5 million people  who live in Los Angeles.  What an interesting idea.  It sounds a little like the old days of cable  where somebody wins the franchise and then you're stuck with their monopoly.  They say one of the deals, it has to be open.  Anybody can ride on it.  Now, I'm going to go back to the old days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to go back to the old days.  I'm going to go back to the old days.  I'm going to go back to the old days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to go back to the old days.  I'm going to go back to the old days.  Anybody can ride on it.  Now, I don't know if anybody's going to go for it.  I mean, this is the thing.  The city says, we're not paying for this.  $3 to $5 billion cost of building fiber.  The company must offer free service of at least 2 megabits to every LA resident.  The company must sell access to the network to competitors.  Answering your problem.  So basically, they want that infrastructure.  They want gigabit wide, gigabit wide.  They want gigabit wide, gigabit wide.  They want gigabit wide, gigabit wide.  They want gigabit wide, gigabit wide.  They want gigabit wide, gigabit wide.  Gigabit wide, gigabit city wide fiber.  Oh, and the other reason it's not like Google, although I guess Google could bid,  is that it will be the business component is very important.  is that it will be the business component is very important.  They want to make sure businesses also benefit from this.  Google right now is consumers only.  The city manager, actually technology agency general manager  for Los Angeles Information Technology,

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Steve Rennecker told Ars Technica

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  he hopes to be able to build a new network  that will be able to support the business.  And he's going to be able to build a new network  that will be able to support the business.  And he's going to be able to build a new network  that will be able to support the business.  Steve Rennecker told Ars Technica  he hopes much of the cost of building the network  will be offset by selling television service bundles  with the internet service.  So they're saying you can come in,  you can wire it for fiber,  and you make your money by offering triple plays.  They can do phone service as well.  Right.  About a third of the city makes less than $45,000 a year.  About a third of the city makes less than $45,000 a year.  So there's a real concern they want to...  Part of what I think this is a great plan,  I don't even know.  I mean, they're asking...  As an RFP, they're asking people to say,  they'll do it.  If they can make this deal work for some company,  If they can make this deal work for some company,  it's great for the people of Los Angeles.  But this is the kind of thing Philadelphia did  and got immediately sued by Comcast and everybody else.  and got immediately sued by Comcast and everybody else.  Cities have been trying to do  free Wi-Fi for a long time.  Cities have been trying to do  free Wi-Fi for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The states passed special case laws  just to prohibit this  from being lobbied by telcos.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the same city, by the way,  that's rolling out iPads to each of its 650,000 students.  That's rolling out iPads to each of its 650,000 students.  And it messed that up royally.  LA wants the winning bidder  to make donations of home broadband equipment  to nonprofits.  Those nonprofits will then distribute them  to needy residents.  The city is going to take bids for three months.  I don't know.  If this works, it's great.  If this works, it's great.  Yeah.  But what company's got  three to five billion?  Maybe it's the kind of thing Google would do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What a market to have, though.  You got LA.  You got LA, you got all the showbiz there.  I'm disappointed Bloomberg didn't do that in New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you know.  This will be, I think, New York's looking,  everybody's looking to see if this works for LA.  I bet everybody does this.  This is really smart.  What do you think of your new mayor, Mr. Blasio?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't know yet.  My friend Chris Anderson, not that Chris Anderson,  not that Chris Anderson.  The third Chris Anderson.  The journalist Chris Anderson.  I had a great tweet this morning, he said,  trains late, only eight hours into the new administration.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No, he's not a mayor yet, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bloomberg's still the mayor, right?  There's a great picture today of Bloomberg

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and Blasio meeting, and Bloomberg's just looking off.  This is our moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Bloomberg's mayor for how long? 12 years?  Three terms, yep.  Whew!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think he did a good job.  It's not universally held, but I think he did a good job.  I like the bicycles.  And the technocrats.  We had an effort of the technocrat running,  Jack Hittery,  an entrepreneur here in New York,  was trying to run as an independent, but never really got traction.  And the Republicans certainly didn't have traction.  So we have an old-time liberal as our mayor.  Let's see how it looks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've been loving the Google doodles this week.  Have you noticed them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I actually, they were showing up on Google Now for me.  At least one of them showed up.  The train, the gorgeous train illustration showed up.  Which is like,  oh, I actually get to see the doodles now.  They're in Google Now.  They've always had graphics

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  where they would show something that's related to either your locale or the time of day, right?  Like right now I have a bay with a whale spouting.  I don't think that's the Google doodle.  Happy birthday, Tim Street, by the way.  Is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the headographic.  I get a San Francisco one because I'm in San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but sometimes you'll get,  and that's because there is no Google doodle today,  but I got the train.  That was a dude who did engineering things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A dude did a train.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He wore a striped cap with a bill.  And then the human calculator, they had the calculator LCD.  I didn't realize that.  I didn't know about her.  Yeah, I mean, I think that's a neat,  that's what the Google doodle should be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The first one, Leo, the maps, I found interesting.  Let's talk about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google Maps is more of a platform than we realized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To become more contextual to the time and the place and where you are,  and also to you personally.  And this is what I'm waiting for.  This is where Foursquare, you know, this is the competition of Foursquare.  When I ask for pizza, does it give me the pizza my friends like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Actually, were you at this talk, Kevin Marks, because this was at Roadmap.  Yes, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there was two of the Google guys on stage talking to Om about this.  They were basically saying, well, we can't tell you about future products,  but what we'd like to tell you about is what we'd like to be able to do now,  which is their way of saying we're going to do this eventually.  And the point for them was to say they wanted to use,  they said we want to make a map for every person for every place.  So each map is unique.  And it draws on information that we've got that we know about you.  So if there are places that are in your stream that we know about,  then we'll highlight those on the map.  And they'll use the recommendation field to spot things out,  which is also like another, oh, I see where the e-commerce bit comes in here.  But they said we'd really also like to say if there's a football match on at the stadium,  then it'll tell you the score of the football match,  and that'll give you a clue as to how many minutes are left in the game,  so you know that that's about to come out,  and you probably don't want to drive past it.  So they wanted to bring those kind of ideas into it as well,  making thinking of the map as a data layer that they're showing all their other data on.  And there was something they said was that to do this,  the reason they can do this now is because they've spent a long time cleaning up data,  and the time that you notice when you write the visualization,  that's when you realize that the data is bad,  because as soon as you combine two sources,  you see that things aren't on top of each other anymore.  And that was so, as they started doing that for their data validation  and overlaying things like that, then they realized,  oh, we should bring some more of this into the product as well.  So there was this interesting feedback loop between the two.  Definitely interesting talk. It would be worth watching that moment,  Giger, and put it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe some information also towards this supplied by the Nexus 5 design,  which has lots of new sensors in it.  They have an accelerometer, a magnetometer, a gyroscope,  proximity sensor, of course, light sensor, barometer, gravity sensor.  I don't know.  You'd be glad to know that gravity is normal here.  Well, I think that's probably, well, I don't know, maybe, I don't know,  linear acceleration, rotation.  Are you an airplane, maybe?  I don't know.  If it were a hard drive, I would say to detect a drop,  but I don't know what it's for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Try throwing it up in the air and see what it says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Take it on the phone, Tom.  Oh, yeah, gravity is...  See how it's microgravity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's step...  Can't bring the ladder out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a step detector, a step counter, a significant...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's important because you're going to be able to use this as a pedometer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Significant motion detector, game rotation vector,  geomagnetic rotation vector, and orientation.  These are all sensors built in to this device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What are you reading those with?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a nice little app called CPU-Z, or CPU-Z,  that I put on when I'm reviewing a product.  It will tell you what chip is on here, how many cores.  You can actually see the core speeds.  For instance, only two of my four cores are used right now.  The other two are stopped.  You can find out more about the system version and stuff.  It's like the old...  What was the name of that?  Bellarc Advisor that would tell you everything that was in your hardware, right?  Battery level, sensors, nice little program.  Free program, CPU-Z.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Imagine how that gets used in all kinds of other shared data ways.  By the way, Waze data has been spotted on Google Maps now.  Finally.  My beloved Waze.  Finally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you think about it, Maps has always been a platform  because back in the old days when you could do map mashups,  all the things people were doing with Maps.  But now, I don't know, it seems like Google made that harder to do  or they've charged people or something.  I don't see as many map mashups as...  True.  Maybe Google just wants to do more of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They started...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They started charging for heavy APIs.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But there's always open maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, open map data is very good too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They've deprecated the V2 API, so that's an issue at the moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It would make sense that this is the kind of thing Google would say,  well, we'll take it from here.  I don't know though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, if you click on the Maps thing, you'll see...  Incidents.  You can read that.  Right.  Incident reported via Waze app and things like that.  So those are showing up in Maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, even in Credits Waze, that's good.  Now you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that was part of what they were saying,  they were bringing more data in that way.  I did have a brief chat with them afterwards and said,  well, this is very nice, but what happened to Latitude?  And they said, yeah, that didn't really fit in with the new architecture,  and we still want to bring that back at some point.  But they felt that the way it works wasn't quite right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kevin, you and I were the only people using Latitude.  I always knew where Kevin was.  He always knew where I was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I used it with my family, because that's really handy  when you've got two sons who are driving.  It's like, where are you and where's my car?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I agree, if you can get them to use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the counterpoint was, before they were driving,  well, you know where you are, I can come and pick you up.  Right.  But yeah, that's not working now.  And the other one I grumbled about was Google Transit  not knowing when you're actually on the Transit.  So you say, how do I get to the next place?  It says, well, get off here and get onto the next bus behind you,  and then go to here.  And they said, yeah, but that's hard.  We want to fix that, but we don't have it with Ada yet.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Have you seen that problem?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's do a changelog.  You got the trumpeters here?  All right, get them ready.  Get them off their smoke break, because it's time for...  The Google changelog.  Gina Trapani has the latest from Google.  Well, of course, the biggest item on the changelog

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is KitKat on the Nexus 5, which we've already covered  pretty in-depth earlier with your review, Leos.  Thank you for doing that.  Sure.  Beyond KitKat, this is kind of an interesting Android change.  Google announced that app indexing in Google Search  will begin providing deep links into apps in search results.  So you're on your phone, and you search for, I don't know, Firefly,  and you get the IMDB page, and you get the Google Maps page.  You get the IMDB page back in your search results.  If you've got the IMDB app installed, and Google has indexed  all the content inside the IMDB app, there will be a little button  that says Open in App.  You tap that button, and it launches the native app  versus the website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is something the app developer has to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so the app developer has to make their content.  If you've got an app that contains a lot of content,  there are some guidelines to make that content discoverable  and indexable by Google, which Google has just published.  And Google's going to start slowly rolling this out.  I think they've invited a few test companies in there to try this out.  I think Etsy, IMDB, New Egg, OpenTable, Wikipedia, and a few others.  So this is pretty cool, because you know how it works now.  If you get a search result that's got a URL that Android recognizes,  it might say Open With.  Do you want to open this with the native app?  Do you want to open it up with Chrome?  What do you want to open with?  This just lets you go directly to inside the app,  which would be pretty nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I'm going to push back on this,  because I think this is taking a feature that we've already got  and then adding Google in the middle of it that spoils it,  because the way intense work is, any app can claim that URL.  So I can write an app that parses IMDB URLs  and displays something else, and you can install that.  And when I click on it, it'll get there.  Whereas this says you have to register with Google,  and Google will choose how to redirect you to where and so on.  So it's much more like the stuff that Twitter's been doing with cards  than it is the sort of cleanliness of the intents that's built into the platform.  So I'm less happy about this than you are, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It looks like, though, if you don't have the official app installed,  it won't show up.  And it also looks like if you just tap on the link,  that you'll still get the intents prompt of like,  what do you want to open this up in?  So I don't actually think you're losing the choice,  but I agree with you.  This is definitely a way for apps and for sites to push their official app.  And let's be honest, we're all so sick of,  I'm so sick of going to mobile sites and getting at the top of the page,  like, hey, do you want to install our Android app?  No, no, no, no.  Just bring me to the freaking page, right?  And so I'm hoping that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you're supposed to do that, then that's a win. Yeah. Okay.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if it prevents people from doing that on their mobile websites,  if this is an option, I think that that'll probably,  well, hopefully, fingers crossed, see less of that.  And then you still get the choice.  I think you can still tap the link and choose to open it in another app,  if you say have an alternate Wikipedia or IMDB app.  What else have we got? Oh, Google Now for iOS.  Got a big update. It's got parity with Android Now.  It's got support for notifications and reminders.  And when you launch the Google Now app on iOS,  you can use the OK Google Voice function as well.  Excuse me.  So yeah, you're getting the same kind of cards.  You can get the Google Keep reminders and that kind of thing all on iOS.  Of course, iOS doesn't have the widget support  and doesn't have the swipe up support that Android gets,  but still a nice update.  But it does have the voice support that Google Now has?  Yeah, well, right.  So yes, if you launch Google Now on iOS, you can use the OK Google hot word.  But from what I understand, I haven't actually installed this yet on my iPhone.  You have to have launched the app first.  Right. So it's not always.  That makes sense. Of course.  And Google brings the Hotel Finder to mobile phones.  Thank you, Jeff, for flipping this one into the changelog for me.  If you go to google.com slash hotels,  you can enter in a location where you're looking to find a hotel.  And there's a really nice way to search and filter and star  and get hotel rates all kind of formatted for your mobile phone.  This works in regular Google search results on your desktop right now.  This is just a nice mobile interface.  You can make reservations with Google Wallet in the countries it supports,  which I think is just the United States right now.  So that's really nice if you're looking to book a hotel on the go.  And finally, I Google rest in peace.  It was announced a year ago that I Google would be shut down.  And that has that has happened.  If you go to google.com slash IG, you just get redirected to the google.com home page.  No no blog post announcement even.  Google I Google has just has slipped off into the into the history books.  And that's all we've got.  That's all I've got for the changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's the Google changelog.  Thank you, Gina for panting.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What did Steve have to say about the latest NSA stuff of NSA tapping the connections between the servers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, he read that we read the two posts, the Google Plus posts from to the sensor himself.  He had to.  So we basically basically Google's two of Google's engineers responded to the revelations that that the NSA was tapping into least servers.  See what what happened was Google wasn't using the public Internet to transport this data.  It was transporting it over least servers, servers they owned.  Nevertheless, servers which had been compromised by the National Spy Agency, according to Edward Snowden.  And the response of these engineers.  Well, first, Eric Schmidt says that's outrageous.  Right.  And then the response of these engineers was a few, a few NSA about time we get to that.  Brandon Downey and Mike Hearn writing on Google Plus talking about this.  F these guys was Brandon Downey's pithy phrase.  I've spent the last 10 years of my life trying to keep Google users safe and secure from the many diverse threats Google faces.  I've seen armies of machines dosing Google.  I've seen worms dosing Google to find vulnerabilities in other people's software.  I've seen criminal gangs figure out malware.  I've seen spyware masquerading as toolbars so thick it breaks computers because it interferes with the other spyware.  I've even seen oppressive governments use state-sponsored hacking to target dissidents.  But even though we suspected this was happening, it still makes me terribly sad.  It makes me sad because I believe in America.  After spending all that time helping in my tiny way to protect Google, one of the greatest things to arise from the Internet seeing this.  Well, it's just a little like coming home from war with Sauron, destroying the One Ring, only to discover that the NSA is on the front porch of the Shire chopping down the party tree and outsourcing all the hobbit farmers with half-orcs and whips.  Suitably geeky reference there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The US has to be better than this, but I guess in the interim that security job is looking a lot more like a Sisyphean thing than ever before.  So what Google's response to this, besides the salty phrases, is to now encrypt that data on those least servers and encrypt every possible data.  Every possible data transport.  Once it gets to the public Internet, well, what can you do?  But they're encrypting everything they can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you heard any suspects yet? Is it level three? What kind of companies?  I don't know. Do you know that, Kevin, who this is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It wasn't clear, but I think that it needs to be an overseas connection for it to be allegedly legitimate for the NSA.  So it's probably one of the connections between the different overseas data centers.  And one of the things that Google does with a lot of the data is replicate it between data centers in different countries as the ultimate backup.  That was one of the things that before Gmail could lose the beta label, it had to make sure all the data was backed up in more than one country.  So this is a significant thing for Google.  Lots of the data is moved between countries in this way.  So in effect, that would have slurped down a lot of the transactions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So is it replication?  It looks like replication is what they're tapping into here.  Mike Kern, who's British, says, I'm not an American. I'm a Brit, but it's no different.  GCHQ, the British NSA, basically turns out to be even worse than the NSA.  We designed this system to keep criminals out.  There's no ambiguity here.  The warrant system with skeptical judges, paths for appeal and rules of evidence was built from centuries of hard won experience.  When it works, it represents as good a balance as we've got between the need to restrain the state and the need to keep crime in check.  Bypassing that system is illegal for a good reason.  And he says, thank you, Edward Snowden.  For me personally, this is the most interesting revelation all summer.  So, yeah, I'm glad that Google is allowing its engineers.  They both say we're not speaking for Google here, but allowing its engineers to speak out.  These are two of the guys whose job it was to keep prying eyes from this data.  So it's particularly jarring and I'm sure insulting and annoying to them that the U.S. government is doing this or their own government, in this case of the GCHQ.  Schmidt said it's outrageous. These guys spoke a little more candidly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All the security guys I know are really, really grumpy about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not OK.  It's not OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's people who want to get grumpy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there's not much they can do except encrypt everything, which is I presume now.  Yeah, encrypt your replication servers.  Yep.  By four to one, early adopters pick wearable watches over glasses.  Not that either one is really yet ready for prime time.  Do we care about this Rockstar lawsuit against Google?  Microsoft and Apple outbid Google.  Google bid four and a half billion dollars for the Nortel patents.  Turned out that wasn't enough.  A consortium composed of Microsoft, Apple, RIM, Ericsson and Sony operating under the name Rockstar Bidco beat the Google bid.  And now they're using those patents against Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  But at the time they said they were buying them as defensive measures to do a licensing pool and blah, blah, blah.  But now they've set up a patent-trolled entity as Rockstar and they filed lawsuits against anyone running Android.  So there's two clumps of lawsuits.  There's one against every handset manufacturer with a bunch of patents on bullshit things like.  The most shocking bullshit one was one that said screens are too small.  So we need to have a way of scrolling scrolling over a small screen.  So therefore, here's an idea for a floating cursor that you click on on top of the screen.  And then in the preamble, it says computers now have large screens that are six forty by four eighty pixels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's how old this patent is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's how old that patent is and how unlike any actual working thing it is.  But they're using that as a as part of the chain of going after all the phone people.  And then they've got another chain of patents that are a patent on searching a search index and searching an advertising index at the same time and displaying them side by side.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which is like, well, that seems like a really obvious idea to anyone who's seen a search engine ever.  But because it was before Google was founded, they're using that and a whole chain of ready ones to go off to Google and say, you're you can't do that.  So it's it's it's a sort of a gigantic pile of attacks again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If there were ever a question whether their patent trolls, you know, they're doing all the things patent trolls do.  They've got an office in Ottawa, Canada, where they have 10 reverse engineers going through every product they can find looking for somebody to sue.  They file these suits in the Eastern District of Texas, where both the judges and the juries are very much in favor of plaintiffs.  And she's isn't it sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think I think we Google fiber needs to put into why Eastern Texas.  I think that will be a really smart move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ah, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What I was told by some is that not only the judge is very pro plaintiff in these, but the jury is because it's essentially fairly poor.  You know, it's bedrock, God fearing, kind of hard scramble types is that they don't like big companies.  And so if you can position yourself is why the way why it's not Microsoft suing Google.  If you can position yourself as a little guy who had an invention going up against the big guy, they'll almost always rule in favor of the little guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. But I don't know how that works for this set of patent pools, which were no no tails patent pool that's been bought by a consortium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they position it. That's why interval never uses its own name.  They position it. The lawyer says, Listen, here is Mike Smith.  He invented back in 1997 a way to find advertisements in a database and match them to search.  You see, he just wanted to make a little money on the side.  And along comes Google. Now we've asked Google to to license his patent, but Google just says no, they did basically outright stole it from Mike.  And I think you ought to give Mike some money.  And the jury says, Yes, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we need some better storytellers on the on the.  I know far too much about this story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Kevin knows that.  Let us move on.  I think it's time for a tool, a tip, a number, all of that stuff.  Let's start with.  Huh?  Oh, yes, I always do this and I apologize.  If there is a story you would like to talk about, please go ahead, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Samsung have just had their analyst meeting announced a whole bunch of upcoming things.  They've also invented the term fondlet, which is their term for the things that dislike things that aren't quite phones and aren't quite tablets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's charbacks in back of you, by the way, he's spying on you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's got a steady camera.  But they've put the what they've announced is they've they said they're going to ship even higher resolution smartphone displays to 560 by 1440 next year and then 40 by 2106 in 2000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is there demand for this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How do you do that at this site?  So they ship with like a loop.  You know, I on this one, if I take my glass off and hold it really close, I still can't see the pixels, but I can, you know, it's got as many pages as the next seven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it is Moore's law, right?  Just as power processors or the number of transistors and processor doubles every 18 months, it's presumed that these displays the pixel size gets smaller and smaller and smaller.  But there's the question is, and this is I guess what you're saying, if you can't see it, what does it matter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not sure why you would want to do it.  Well, the only thing maybe so that then you can plug it in external screens because you can have a right external screen by then.  That would make a bit of sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or maybe or maybe it has to do with sub pixel rendering that kind of thing.  So you get crisper font.  So the fonts look pretty good to me right now.  Any crisper than this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's pretty great.  1080p on 2000 by 1000 on a five inch screen is pretty insanely crisp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's enough sub pixels for any renderer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is a dumb question.  I just got this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I just got this phone.  I got it.  I got a new Mac Pro with the retina display.  So and I already had the Nexus seven.  So all my screens and the and the Chromebook pixel.  So now all my screens have higher resolution than I can actually see.  Right.  I even got new glasses this week so that I could actually focus and focus better.  I've got you know, that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Think of the optometrists.  It's an optometrist support rule.  I think it's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was actually quite funny.  I went into the optometrist and I said and they said, can you read this bit of paper?  And I said, well, you know, can I read this instead?  This is what I'm actually going to be reading.  Can I actually check it against this rather than?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can't think of any.  They should work on color gamut, color accuracy, brightness.  I don't know if sub you know, the size of the pixels is really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Even more pixels is an easy thing to do.  Well, it's not easy.  It's actually a hard thing to do, but it's an obvious thing to do.  And they'll keep doing that.  It's the same with the cameras.  The cameras got more and more megapixels.  They said, oh, we're making these things too small now and wouldn't be nice to back off a bit  and get some better ability to capture more photons and give you better nighttime stuff.  Right.  Or we should we can I can actually do what you call it better dynamic range  so you can do the things you'd have to take multiple shot exposures with before.  So I suspect that the screen things may end up being the same.  But one of the interesting things for me is that it does change the design dynamic again.  So the design dynamic we've had for the past five years has been, oh, you should.  First, it was you need to design a mobile version of your site.  And then it was, oh, you've got to design a responsive version of site that works on both.  And then it was, oh, you design mobile first because most people are mobile.  But that and that that design center there has moved from you've got a sort of 320 by 480 pixel thing that's this big to I've got a this screen that has more pixels than the last laptop I had.  And it's this big.  Oh, and all my other devices are getting these super high risk screens as well, which means that instead of saying, you know, the oh, I just need to put more and more bigger bitmaps in gets less and less viable.  And I should just use SVG and use vector fonts and use, you know, use things that naturally scale much more in my designs.  It starts making more and more sense.  So I think that's going to be an interesting iteration as these screens roll out.  And we'll start seeing people doing designs that are much more print like because they can actually be rendered for a change.  And it'll be like the Edward Tough books where he has those ridiculous hairline things that are conveying huge amounts of information in tiny, tiny spaces.  But they're actually viable on these screens now. Right. Isn't that nice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Any other stories before we get our tip of the week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Quick one. We talked about how there was some backlash against Chrome for not prompting you to enter your system password before you can look at your saved passwords.  And, you know, the chromium engineers were like, look, if someone can get into your Chrome settings, then, you know, what's the point?  That's just sort of like security theater.  Well, they back down and they've actually added a flag into chromium.  This is a chromium build from Mac that will prompt you for your system, your Mac password before you get when you go in to save passwords and say, show me a password.  It'll mimic the behavior of Safari.  So it's interesting backpedaling on apparently in Canary to now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that means it will almost certainly make it into the final and the final build.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good point. Yeah, we talked about that on security now as well.  I guess we knew this would happen.  They justified it and they justified it in a sensible way.  But why not put a password in?  Doesn't hurt. Yeah, it doesn't hurt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. It does just sort of give you the feeling that it's secure.  Yeah. Security theater is still a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. It's just theater.  But who doesn't love theater?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It works the TSA. So, you know, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, what is what is your tip of the week, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So my tip is actually it's a new gadget that I bought.  I talked about this on the show a while.  This is a Kickstarter that I backed a long time ago and I just shipped in the mail this week.  This is this is the most useful thing I've ever bought on Kickstarter.  It's the flux mob bolt.  It is a charger for your devices, USB charger.  You see this USB port right here, but it's also an external battery.  I shouldn't say an external battery, but a portable charger.  So, Jeff, when you and Leo and I were at Google I.O. this year, my phone died.  And you saved my bacon with the with the Mofi juice pack.  This is just like that, but it also acts like a standard charger.  So I just kind of I wanted to kind of keep it plugged in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then how much juice does it have in there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It will charge your device or charges my HTC one fully once it's fully charged.  That's portable, which is really nice.  You can also charge your your iPad or your iPhone.  I also got the little three prong charger thing.  So you just plug it in.  But you know, you can use you can use whatever cord comes with your with your device.  But I love this thing because it basically replaced my charger.  But also when I'm on the go, I could just grab it out of the wall, throw it in my bag.  I don't need to carry my charger and an external charger.  It's all kind of all in one.  So I really dig it. I recommend it.  And they're for sale at the flux mob site now.  Flux Mob dot com.  You want to check it out? It's a fairly hefty battery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Three thousand milliamp hours, which is a decent sized battery.  That's that's bigger than the battery in your phone.  Yeah, it's not as big as the battery in this son of a gun.  This is this is Chad's anchored giant battery.  It's got dang twenty thousand milliamp hours in it.  Yeah, but you know who wants to carry that around?  It weighs a thing. Yeah, carry a charger around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is yeah, it does both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's good that that is a full charge for almost any phone on the market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep. Yep. Yeah.  And I don't know these guys.  I just I happen to back them because a friend of mine did.  And and and it was one of those things where it finally came and I was like, yay.  And then tried it out.  The thing I don't like is that you have to turn it on.  I sort of expected that you could just plug in your device and it would work.  But you turn it on and it tells you how much juice is in there.  You can see it's got an indicator kind of like what's on the Mac.  And what did you pay as a backer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, remember what that what did you pay as a backer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, that's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I paid like 50 bucks.  I think I got, you know, like, I'm at the site, but I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I went to buy now, but I don't there's no actual your mouse over the pieces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, my God. Can you hide that better for me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For me? No, that was not what.  So there's the argon, the graphite and the stealth.  They're all 60 bucks. That's just different colors, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a just exactly. I'm checking to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, they really got to work on the web design.  That's not good. I can't.  If you didn't hover over, you would say, well, OK, it says bye.  I don't where I don't normally just hover my mouse over strange objects.  Over strange objects.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I paid 30, 40 or 50 bucks.  I remember which it's a stealth purchase feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's there's too much design in web design, isn't there?  Yeah, you think?  Jeff, your number of the week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, let's go with this one because this news is fairly current.  Dish, which bought Blockbuster, just closed.  Now they're closing the last 300 Blockbuster stores.  Oh, it's over.  It even existed. Nine years ago, there were nine thousand.  Whoa, there's there were nine thousand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are three hundred. They're going to be zero.  Yes. Even though they rented DVDs, it wasn't just VCRs, VHS tapes.  That's sad.  That's sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Today on Howard Stern show, Sal, the stockbroker, Sal Gubernale went into Craigslist and read particularly wacky things there.  And one thing says something about, you know, I'll meet you at the video store.  And Robin Quiver said video stores are no video stores anymore.  Or Howard did. And Robin said, yeah, there are for porn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't even know why that exists, because if you visit my new Google help out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly. You won't need to pay for porn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm telling you. Huge. It'll be huge.  OK. OK. Do you have anything, Kevin, that you'd like to share with us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I have a set of bad jokes I made the other night, which is all Google products need to end in outs now.  So we've got Google Ventures becomes Google handouts.  I like it. I like it.  It's Google printouts.  Whatever I say, I have Google 20 percent time is Google layabouts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Layabouts. This is a good new parlor game. I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google Maps directions is Google Gadda bouts.  What else have I got?  Oh, and when they actually hire people, they use Google sellouts.  Sellouts. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think there's going to be more. Email them to Kevin.  Kevin Marks, thank you so much for. Oh, I was just my tip is so when I'm setting up, it's not I don't have a tool today.  I was setting up Twitter on the new Nexus five and I really apologize to each and every one of you for sending you at least one in some cases.  Many as eight emails inviting you to join Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no. The app desperately wants you to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Desperately wants you to do. I got to show you it is way too easy.  Way too easy. So just a word of warning.  Next time you set up Twitter, you know, you'll automatically be brought to the who to follow and find friends.  We will securely upload your contacts to help you find friends and suggest users.  They should be a little more clear that we will be storing that contact list forever.  And if anybody should ever break into our servers, they'll have access to it, too.  But OK, I'm a nice guy. I'm going to click. OK, there's some matches.  You know, I don't I don't really want to follow those people or maybe I did.  I'm done. Oh, wait a minute. Here's another page. Invite friends.  One thousand four to thirty one contacts. Oh, they're all checked.  But you know what? I'm just going to say done because I don't really want to do that.  If you click that done as I did all one thousand four.  And by the way, it doesn't just mail one to each contact.  It mails one to each address I have in the contact book for you.  Oh, yeah. Ouch. And the default is all selected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twitter. Of course it is.  My mailing list got spammed with people inviting the mailing list to to to Twitter,  my open source mailing list, because apparently it was in people's contact lists.  And they did that. Exactly. I mean, who wouldn't press done there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Done means I'm done. And it doesn't give you a warning.  OK, we're going to email everybody or anything.  It just you're done. Done men invite every person you gosh darn know.  My mom, I felt so bad, said, well, I joined Twitter.  Where are your pictures? Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There really should be an are you sure you want to send one thousand four hundred  and thirty emails right now? It's unacceptable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And if I could tank Twitter's IPO right now, I would.  So what do you think is going to close out tomorrow?  Did it when? When does it start tomorrow? Tomorrow's the day.  Nobody should buy Twitter stock ever, ever, ever.  Is that your official recommendation? I am not a registered stock advisor.  I don't have any standing for which to tell you this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can do it on Google Help out. So you can say, here's a help out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the name of my help out. Why you should never, ever, ever buy stock in Twitter.  What they're saying, 17 to 20 dollars was the range they predicted.  They went up, I think they went up. Of course, I'm sure it'll be very hot, right?  Because people like my mom go, oh, I love that Twitter.  I'm going to buy some stock with my hard earned dollars that are all I have left now that I'm in retirement.  Let me put my money into these tech stocks. I hear tech's a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I keep getting emails from them to join Twitter, so they must be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They went to 27 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you know, they're not, I mean, that only values them at what, 18 billion dollars?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Something like that, 19 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they've yet to figure out a way to monetize, but that's not important.  That's not what's important here.  It's your chance to get into this fast and exciting new technology business.  Social media is all the rage.  Oh, well, I'm sure I'm violating SEC rules by the minute, so I should probably just shut up now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Their penetration is still small enough. I wonder if they're not beatable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, gosh, yes. Any social media network is, any social media is beatable.  Yeah. Yeah.  Any social media is beatable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  MySpace taught us that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's plenty of lessons learned.  Yeah, and AOL Instant Messenger, another classic.  Just remember ICQ. That's the one I was going to mention.  I think Facebook might be, no, maybe not.  You know, we're going to ask Robert Scoble and Shell Israel next because there are next victims on triangulation in just a few minutes.  Their new book, Age of Context, just came out.  Kevin Marks, thank you so much from Salesforce.com.  He's been at BT. He's been at Google. He's been at Apple. He's been everywhere.

Transcript:  Well, there you go. Where are you now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am now independent and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you looking for work?  ...what to do next.  Are you looking for work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I'm not sure about looking for work. I'm looking for what to do next, which is a slightly different way of framing it.  Yeah, no.  There are some things I want to make. Let's put it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  At this point in your career, you don't need a job. You need an adventure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There we go.  Maybe you should join the Army.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Transcript:  I can see Kevin with a hard hat and one of those writing crops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is it? I'm sorry, Steeble Chase? Is that what you're suggesting? What is he doing?  What am I doing?  Writing crops.  He's got a whip and a hard hat. I don't know. It could be almost anything at this point.  I see him with Ninja.  A Ninja.

Transcript:  Business card. Yeah, Open Standards Ninja. I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I went to the... what are they called? Neo launch thing last night. They've just bought a big building in San Francisco, which is...  It's owned by Digital Garage from Japan and they bought Neo, which is a roll-up of a developer house.  But they had... they've done this huge over-the-top presentation of all this Japanese stuff.  One of the things they had was a video showing the East meets West thing, which was a samurai on a horse, an American Indian on a horse, a cowboy on a horse, and a dressage lady on a horse all merging and crossing the planes together.  And this was their symbolic, we're bringing the East and West together thing. It was very odd.  So I think I know where those Ninjas are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They support clients with lean UX design. That's all that I had to read.  They're the ones who invented the hover over it and click to find out how to buy this.  I want to thank Jeff Jarvis from the City University of New York, where he teaches journalism to a bunch of children who don't deserve him.  He's also the author of What Would Google Do? and his latest public parts, available in bookstores everywhere.  His blog is BuzzMachine.com. Thank you, Jeffrey.  Thank you.  Gina Trapani is at SmarterWear.org, but more importantly, she's raising money for ThinkUp.  If you go to ThinkUp.com, it's not too late to be a funder in the early stages.

Transcript:  It's not. In fact, we reached our goal of 1,000 backers.  Yes!  Congratulations.  Yes, we're really excited about it. We've got our first stretch goal, 2,000 followers.  If you missed the early bird rate, we have just posted, literally, right before the show, a late bird rate for procrastinators.  Do you have a dirty bird rate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You are a hard-to-find person.  So if 2,000 more people, right? Or no, if you get to 2,000 people, by November 15th, which is a week from now, every member gets a code for a free year of ThinkUp to give to a friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, coupon code for a free year. So we've got to reach that. We've got 10 days left.  That's awesome.  We've got to reach that 2,000 in order for that to happen.  But if you're thinking about joining, you missed early bird, you can grab late bird. It's only 50 bucks a year.  There is a bug on the front page of the website, which I'm going to fix as soon as I hang up.
