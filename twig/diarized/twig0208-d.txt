And so we'll have lots to talk about with Gina Trapani from SmarterWear dot org.  They did a changelog for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, massive changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Founding editor, lifehacker, host of All About Android on this show, on this channel,  and also of her show on 5x5, and just a wonderful person also here,  Jeff Jarvis, professor of journalism at the City University of New York,  author of What Would Google Do in Public Parts and blogger at Buzz Machine.  Kevin Marks is also here from Salesforce dot com.  He's also been at BT, at Apple, at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't keep a job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The guy cannot keep a job.  And we have lots to say.  Should we start with a changelog? Is that probably the best thing to do, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Honestly, I put a note in the rundown. No changelog today.  I mean, the whole media event.  The show is the changelog.  Yeah, the show is the changelog. But I think we should probably talk about the announcement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you. Without the trumpets, I just can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not a complete show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not a show. Now, now we begin.  So the event was built as breakfast with Sundar Pichai, which is cute.  It didn't look too crowded.  I saw the live stream and I think probably all of us watched the live stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Lots of bacon.  Was there bacon?  Pictures of huge vats of bacon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I feel like bacon, but not huge vats of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't even get an invitation actually to this event. I don't know why not.  But we did what we always do. And I think this is great.  Google streams it live so we can watch live.  So Tom Merida, as actor, Sarah Lane and I did sit and watch it live.  In fact, you can catch that as one of our Twitch specials.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can watch this great moment where Leo starts on one product.  We'll talk about it in a moment.  Leo starts, he's growling about it and he's going, I'll bet it doesn't do this.  I'll bet it doesn't do that.  And then it does everything he wants it to do. It just turns around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it was an interesting product that suddenly became a must have product.  We could start with that because I think we'll talk about the Nexus 7 and Jelly Bean 4.3.  But really, let's kick the show off with a bang and talk about this Chromecast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This stole the show. It did.  Last night at all about Android, we were talking about all the Nexus 7 specs had leaked.  We kind of expected Android 4.3. We found some new stuff about Android 4.3.  But the Chromecast was like, whoa, cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's interesting because they've had no secrecy on the Moto X.  They have no secrecy on the Nexus 7.  They have secrecy with you on the Moto X, but nowhere else.  Nowhere else. Everybody else knows more about it than I do.  But we only started hearing about Chromecast yesterday because of some strings in Jelly Bean 4.3 that somebody had uncovered.  And so this was unexpected.  There have been rumors that there would be a new Google Q.  And this is obviously it. It does have some of the features of the Google Q.  But this is so much more.  It looks like a USB thumb drive, but it isn't exactly.  It has an HDMI port at one end.  So it requires a television or a playback device with HDMI.  If you had an MHL port, I would presume it would get the power from that.  But for most people, there's a USB port on the other side, on the fat blob end of the Chromecast that you'd plug into the wall.  Or if you're lucky enough to have a TV with a USB port, you could just plug it right into the TV with a USB port.  And this thing is remarkable.  Now, at first I thought, oh, it's an Android stick. We've seen a few of those.  Roku even has a stick somewhat like this.  But it's not. What it's doing is very different.  It's got Chrome in it. Chrome OS.  And what happens is you aren't actually streaming to it as you are, for instance, when you use AirPlay on an Apple TV or DLNA with another device.  You're instructing it from your tablet, from your iOS device, from your laptop.  You're instructing it what to play. And it does the playing via Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Through Google's instructions. So now Google knows everything you choose to play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is where my concern lay, because the first thing they show is YouTube.  And I think, oh, great. Just we need a YouTube key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which was the Nexus Q problem, which was it could only pull YouTube or Google Play.  Right. So that was less compelling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then they said, oh, and by the way, Netflix. Oh, OK.  So they made a partnership with that. A little bit.  But now I'm thinking it's a shame because what I'd really like it to do is play, say, twit.  Why should it just be the big boys? Why should it be Google's own property and Netflix?  People that they can make deals with. And then they showed Pandora.  OK. Pandora is coming later, by the way.  And then they dropped the other shoe. And by the way, any tab in your Chrome browser.  So from now on, when you go to a site, I guess, with pictures or other media, including your Google Plus photo album,  there'll be a button in the it looked like was the browser address bar. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a Google Cast Chrome extension in the Web Store right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it's an extension. Yeah, it looks. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, it's there now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's let's install it. Is it the sender or the receiver? The sender?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's yeah. Yeah, it's the sender. So what that there's a receiver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the receiver is the is the hardware. But I guess it could be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, because there's a receiver API. If you look at the SDA API, it says you can develop a receiver thing.  And basically, they just looks like, you know, you know what that means?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Half page of HTML. That means any computer display could become a receiver.  Yes. Or if I'm going to design a smart TV, maybe I'm just going to say screw it.  Oh, yeah. And build in a receiver for Chromecast. Yeah.  Why should I bother designing anything? So this has it as Kevin said.  So you've looked at the API, Kevin? Yeah, I was just looking at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They just released that. There's a blog post on it.  And then there's there's the developers dot developers dot google dot com slash cast has the on the sender side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Leo, you could add this to twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't have to do anything. Our viewers would merely go to live dot twit dot TV.  And if they've installed the Chrome plugin, they'd say send this tab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So then you get the whole tab. Don't you want to just send your player?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Then you can do then you can do that separately. There's an SDK for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So we might want to slightly customize.  Yes, we would. We would. We already know for the third party developers that do our apps on Android and iOS.  I would expect them, you know, at some point to add that feature.  Is it is it Kevin Marks? Is it Web RTC? How is it working?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what is that's what's not clear. That's what I was wondering.  I suspect it's probably the same back end stuff as being as being used the Web RTC,  which is the infrastructure in the in the in Chrome for that because Chrome has that.  And that lets you do video and audio capture and also lets you screen capturing.  So it's probably the similar plumbing, but a different back end.  And there's a there's a receiver dot JS thing that they put up, but it's minified.  So you can't really work out what it's doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is YouTube built in Web RTC now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Kevin, is YouTube built in Web RTC now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not quite the same thing. So Web RTC is like a is a technology stack.  But part of the point of it is is to enable you to do peer to peer communication.  So from one browser to another browser without having to go through a server except to poke the ports on the way through.  So I suspect that we're using that that same model.  I haven't seen anyone say that it's Web RTC, but I'm assuming there's some there's some overlap between the two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google Cast is this is from the developer page is a screen sharing technology, which is not how I would characterize it, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That lets you're not really sharing your screen, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Structing the screen that lets a user send and control content like video from a small computing device like a phone, tablet or laptop to a large display like a television.  The sender may be a phone or laptop running Android or iOS.  A phone or laptop running Chrome OS, Mac OS or Windows.  A sender application running on the sender device uses the Google Cast API appropriate to its operating system to discover and transmit to the receiver application running on the receiver device.  They implied it was sending URLs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So here's my question. If you're logged into a site which requires credentials in order for you to watch a video stream, for example, or look at photos and you send it to the Chromecast.  Which, as I understood, it was a totally separate instance, a different computer running Chrome OS.  And I'm not logged into that site on the Chromecast. Does he get all my I mean, is it able to play that protected content?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It says device discovery, UX control and credentials are handled on the sending device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, so all of my credentials and cookie ever seen that?  So it's actually a tab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Try this on you, Gina. It's not like a separate instance.  It's almost like a tab on your Chrome browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, so it does sound like remote control, more like remote control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the chair I'm saying, and I think this is true, that during the demo, it showed a full page, say, of pictures from Google+.  But only the media was displayed on the big screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I have been sending YouTube videos to my TV for a long time.  Google TV has had has had this icon or has had this ability.  The Nexus Q had this right.  But it was such a bad experience because I'd have to turn on my TV and I have to switch to the output or the input, which was the Google TV.  I get YouTube loaded up on my phone and then I tap the like center and it would take a few minutes and you see this many or whatever.  It looks like the experience on Chromecast is way better.  Chromecast actually turns your TV on, switches to the appropriate input and then loads the.  So it really does. And this is the point that you made in your post, Jeff, that I thought was so good is that you can throw out your remote control.  Well, at least for Internet and stuff, right?  Like your phone or tablet becomes the remote, which I which I really like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's where it goes. The UI on a remote control is the stupidest thing on earth. Right. Right.  This is this is ridiculous. And every effort to to recreate this with a screen only makes it worse.  Whereas now if I'm what it really does is it turns the big TV into the second screen, the slave of your Internet connected device.  Yes. And what do you tell your Internet device to do?  Yeah, that's what the TV does. Right.  And so that's why you can control things. And then the whole notion of the remote control then goes out for anything you watch that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. I would imagine it says you can pause, rewind and play from your phone or whatever you started the playback with.  But you can still get email. You can still do other things with the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. Again, to me, the way to think about it, I think, is it's just another tab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. It's a background process on the phone. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's unclear. You don't see locally.  You see the tab on your screen and that tab operates in a certain way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just metaphorically, I mean, technically, think about it. Yeah.  Because in in Chrome, each tab is a separate process anyway.  So they've just right. Maybe the process communication with across devices.  Yeah, that's interesting way of thinking about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the Google Cast extension.  Let's you find and play content on your Chromecast device from your Chrome browser when on cast optimized sites.  That's a key phrase. That's where the API comes in.  That's why you want to optimize your yeah, like YouTube and Netflix.  You see new options. OK.  So the site would have to be cast aware and do something full functionality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I think there's there's more than one way of doing this.  I haven't I didn't watch the whole demo, but I think there is a screen sharing model.  But there is also a pull model, which is rather than share this, pull it directly from the source, which is that was the only thing they had on the queue.  Which meant that if you wanted to watch a YouTube, it had to it then had to pull it from there and you were trying to make control with your phone.  But the the difference is is shifting this from Android based to Chrome based gives them much more flexibility because Chrome runs on much more things.  So the queue was Chrome was Android based, which means you could only control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, really good point, Kevin.  And that's the Sundar. Right. Uber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Uber. Whereas the point of this is they've explicitly said this already runs on iOS, Android and anything that runs Chrome.  But the other piece that's in the SDK is you can create receivers and it looks like you can run a receiver or anything that runs Chrome, which means you could run it on your Mac or you could run it on a Chrome box or, you know, anything else that happens to have Chrome built for Windows 8, whatever.  So that's that's interesting. That's basically saying, OK, we're taking advantage of the web platform part of this rather than the Android bit.  And I suppose that means once that version of Chrome gets caught up on Android, you could have an Android device as a receiver to. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a lot of sense. I mean, that struck me. It was the thing that struck me the hardest was that this was a Chrome OS device that kind of left field for me.  And, you know, the Chromecast is successful. And how could it not be at thirty five bucks and people are buying three, four at a time?  It's already sold out. Won't ship till August 7th to be placed order now. If this is successful, this means that it's that that the Chromecast will have beaten out to Android based set top more than two.  But Google TV and the Nexus Q. Right. I mean, right.  I would have never thought I wanted the web on my TV in that way.  And this is what this is right. The web on your TV, which was the promise of Google TV. Right. This was the Google TV selling point.  You get the web on your TV. Any tab you can open your computer, you can open on your TV. That was the theory.  But the implementation was fell short. Right. Because ABC.com said, oh, no, we, you know, would, you know, block content and so forth.  So you really couldn't get the content that you wanted to watch on your TV this way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. And that was a question you discussed in the coverage, Leo. Is there any there's no way to block this, is there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yes. And we said we were talking about user agent and does have a different user agent.  Presumably, the Chromecast would say I'm a Chromecast. And the reason it doesn't have to say it's from us.  Well, but the reason it would say it's Chromecast is because Google's trying to make deals with these content providers.  They're not going to they're not going to intentionally bypass.  They don't want to screw Hulu as much as we would like them to screw Hulu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not sure that's true. I think, you know, I think what happened before was they tried that went down that path.  That was Google TV. Right. And Google and they got, you know, shut down because what they were trying to do was too much.  They were trying to actually take over the interface. We knew in the cable box. Yes.  They were trying to commodify searching across the different program delivery models, which is that they've done that by bypassing the cable box.  No, no, because they will control cable box, too. So what they're down doing is saying, OK, it's just a web device.  It's what I'm saying. You can already do this in effect.  You can already attach attach HDMI out to your computer and plug it into the TV.  You know, Mark Shuttleworth just launched his own version variant of a phone that does this, that it's a it's a phone that runs Ubuntu.  But if you plug it into TV, it becomes a computer. This is this is this is a commodified thing.  And it's it's going to be hard to prevent you doing that.  You know, I mean, maybe this will make it so I can take over the this will make it clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is from the developer page developing a receiver app.  So this is what the Chromecast device does and any receiver app you'd want to do applications running on the Google Cast receiver device are always web applications.  They are launched on the device after it receives instructions from the sender application to do so.  A Chrome browser on the receiver downloads the HTML, CSS and JavaScript and renders it.  A persistent connection between the sender and receiver is then created and a command channel is opened.  So that's how we maintain the relationship. But the playing is all done on the Google Cast.  The API exposes the ability to transmit commands between the center receiver provides structured ways of passing common media functions like play, pause, stop and volume, but also allows for app specific free form messages to be transmitted.  Wow, that's nice. That is nice.  Authentication can be handled, for example, by requesting an auth token from the sender application using these free form messages.  The API exposes status methods which allow the receiver to push its status to the sender application.  I can't get a signal. Whatever.  As well as to respond to explicit requests for status.  Universal remote controls built into Chrome and Android use this status to display and provide basic pause, play and volume controls.  Hold on. Hold on.  This is, you know, I have to say already the coverage from a lot of outlets is it's another Apple TV.  It isn't. It's not a Roku.  It is. It is a completely unique implementation that I Apple should have done this.  Well, I this is out of left field. I don't know if anybody's really thought about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's pretty awesome.  It's something that's been sort of latent in the implications of WebRTC because the point there is it.  Unless you construct browser to browser communication.  So that's something that has been people have talked about that in that community.  But that's that's still a that was still a oh well who's going to deploy this question until this.  I think this is pushing that front and center and saying, well, we've got a little thing that will create a browser window on any attached television and you can remote control it from your gadgets.  Awesome. It's a freaking brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's a question for you.  I didn't see anything mentioned with this.  What about games in this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, anything you could play in a Chrome browser you could play on your TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I'm reminded of I.O. when we saw the five devices together and the car racing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the issue is that this probably doesn't have a very heavy processor in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I'm assuming it's got it's Raspberry Pi like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look, what is a Raspberry Pi?  Thirty five bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In order to play 1080p video, you've got to have a reasonable size processor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Raspberry Pi can play 1080p.  So I would think it's something along those lines.  Right.  And it's interesting.  The price is the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I'm thinking about something different here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm trying to go to the idea that well, it's germane because the thing that's doing the rendering is the receiver is the Chromecast.  So that doesn't have enough power to render.  I guess you could do server side rendering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But what I'm saying, Leo, is a different question.  Remember how at I.O. they had the way that you could have five different devices, five different Android devices suddenly doing the same game.  So now imagine you have three friends with you at home and you each have an Android phone and you're playing and you're using your phones as your controllers for a single game on the big screen.  I think this allows that next step is not not not as presently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'd have to have server side rendering like a guy kind of.  OK, that's what I'm asking.  All right.  I'm going to go live because who's doing the rendering?  It has to be a third party and not the Chromecast because it doesn't have enough juice to do that.  OK, it apparently Web RTC is supported.  So what you could also do is use your phone as a camera.  Right.  And your television is your receiver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sure.  I mean, which is basically what Apple is doing with what they call it.  Airplay.  Basically just capturing your screen and sending it over as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's that's the point is this is completely not DLNA or Airplay.  Right. Those are taking the screen that you're holding and putting it on your TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you could do that with that with Web RTC. Web RTC has to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's why I'm saying this is important because in this case it isn't it isn't a mirror of what's on my iPad or even an extended desktop or anything like that.  It is the tablet is controlling a device which is rendering the video that Chromecast devices doing the work.  So it's not Airplay at all.  It is very different from Airplay and it's a very interesting kind of concept.  And you know what really is it's it's somebody said this on Twitter and I think this is exactly what we're going to see more and more of.  We always think of the computer as monolithic or even I remember asking Paul at Alini at Intel what happens to the computer.  This was years ago in this post PC world.  And he said, well, you always need the hub.  You know, you always need the smart brain and then the thin clients.  Google's the hub.  And what we're now seeing is really that what you're really doing is distributing processing power everywhere.  And you're having interoperative intercommunications and different things do different things.  So this Chromecast isn't good at a lot of things.  But one thing it can do is put a 1080p picture on your screen and you control it from another device.  There is no hub. And yes, Google's the hub in this one sense.  And this was Tom Merritt's observation this morning.  What is Google's percentage in this?  Because they're probably selling this thing at cost.  They get to see everything everybody does on TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, there's there's that.  And I think so much more, Leo.  This is what I try to go into is that is that imagine what this does.  This allows Google.  There's so many possibilities.  Right. Google Play.  Second run to Apple.  Now, suddenly, you're motivated to buy your shows and buy your movies and buy that stuff here because you can watch them on any damn device, including your big TV.  One to yeah.  YouTube. YouTube is trying to get all these new channels and figure all this stuff out.  YouTube is also going to go to a subscription based model for some stuff.  So it becomes the place where channels and shows go.  Three. You're right.  Google is going to be able to watch so much.  Know so much of what you watch that becomes an incredible advertising opportunity.  And Google moves past just Web ads to video ads, which are a higher value.  And if they're targeted video ads, they're explosively higher value.  Four or five. I don't know where I am.  The more they know, the better.  I think I don't know whether Google's getting a spiff sales spiff off Netflix for the number of subscriptions it's going to sell.  I wouldn't be surprised if it does.  Well, they get three months free of Netflix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Twenty four dollar value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you're sourced. And so you're sourced.  They know where the new new news come from.  And so I wouldn't be surprised at all.  So Google gets up getting into a whole new revenue stream here beyond advertising of subscriptions and right.  Not only selling its own subs, but selling others, subs becoming an agent for sales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, if you think about it, yes, they probably they're probably they can sell us at a loss because they probably make enough money on each new netcast subscriber to exactly to support the entire enterprise.  Yeah. So they're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now they can they become the agent.  So look at the what was the model for Apple?  Apple wants to send what's the model for Amazon?  Right. They want to sell everybody's content.  Right. Well, Google also wants to be in the advertising business and the sales business.  And now it's in both with this.  This just puts them in the middle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This works with Google Play.  So if you rent or buy stuff from Google Play Store, you'll be able to watch it through this.  By the way, just a quick note and thanks to the chat room.  Amazon does have this for prime free shipping.  Thirty five dollars ships in one to two days.  So if you haven't ordered this yet.  And it looks like Amazon says it has stock ships from and sold by Amazon.  So maybe it's friendly.  They obviously gave 20,000 units or whatever to Amazon.  I did buy another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I went to five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Lisa, Lisa, he's on crack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think I'm well, she's going to get she she you're not going to get any complaints on her.  She's going to get one.  They're going to be all over the place.  There could be a couple in the studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The other thing that starts for Google is it becomes sorry, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, I was going to say that the Netflix deal, the three months free, that's also for existing customers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is. Yes.  You're kidding. Oh, well, now I'm really saving bucks.  Yes. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But how are. Yeah.  Farhad posted this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What I find that hard to believe.  I do, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Farhad just tweeted that earlier and I'm saying offer valid for previous new and existing Netflix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Holy camole. Wow.  So now it's an eleven dollar.  It costs eleven dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So now I'm trying to find where it says that on the Google page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He is.  It's in the small print says.  It must be in the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. But that's I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, well, I just got 15 months free.  I'm buying three more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's it's your it's your Google Ponzi scheme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what's wrong with this?  Why would you I mean, for crying out loud, if I'm a smart TV maker, I'm just immediately removing all the guts of my crappy smart TV apps.  They won't because they make money on it.  They put ads on it and everything.  But, you know, you might as well support it, support it.  Bill to the TV.  Right.  Apple TV.  Does that look like it at ninety nine bucks at three times the cost?  Crappy deal.  Does it look like a good deal?  There are channels you can't you can't get on this that you can get on Apple TV.  Although how long that lasts, I don't know.  Like what?  Sky TV.  Crunchy roll HBO go.  There's a few things.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I think the thing is that Apple TV does something different and more complicated because it works the standalone box.  It has its own remote.  You can just use it on its own to watch things.  And that has pluses and minuses.  I've had stuff where I try and watch it on the Apple TV and Netflix coughs and splutters.  And I I try it on the Mac mini and attach the same TV and it works.  So there's you know, there's there's tradeoffs there.  But I think that's the thing.  This is instead of saying this is a standalone device, they're saying this is a special thing just for moving the web around between devices.  And the assumption is you have something else to road control it, which you know, Apple TV is nicer when you're using an iPhone or an iPad.  To control it or an iPod than that.  It'll four button widget.  But you still had to make it work with the four button widget.  So I this they're taking the nicer UX part of Apple TV and just just doing that part.  So that's it.  Here's the issue for Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think I think that Apple's model is so much built around selling content.  Google's model is built around discovery of the whole web.  And this is built on that.  Right.  I can watch anything on video on the web.  I can watch with this.  Apple wants to sell you their stuff.  And it's always in a closed world.  That's where I think it's brilliant move because it exploits that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not completely convinced because I think Apple's selling content business is not a huge part of their business.  I mean, it's something that's grown.  But they've they've mostly done those deals where they're not making a lot of turn on that.  And the Apple TV has YouTube on it as well and other integrations of Webster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. But Kevin, I think I think when it comes down to what another fringe benefit of Google knowing what we watch is Google's recommendations to us.  Google and fake Google now are going to become extremely powerful and recommendations from anywhere.  It doesn't matter. Google's going to find benefit in that.  I don't think Apple is built to find benefit in that.  Selling devices at a loss for Apple.  Not so much.  Apple TV.  Now you're going to buy a special TV that works just with Apple.  When? Why would you be limited that way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I still think that's a myth.  Apple is not the ship a TV set.  That's that's bonkers and never made any sense.  But I think the other thing about this is third party is going to make loans of this because it just out just runs Chrome OS, which is already available.  And it and it's a little stick with so lots of sticks are available that were on Android.  So I wouldn't be surprised if there are third party versions of this within a month or so.  And Google will be quite happy about that because they want more of them to do.  Because what else could it do?  Outlook for the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, so you could. OK, here's a question for you.  So you could then Leo put in a more powerful processor.  You could do. Oh, yeah.  A deluxe version of you could make your your PC could be a receiver.  So does that become I'm going to go back to the game thing.  Then find does that go back to the idea of that?  Number one, number two, conference room communication.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, somebody suggested our chat room.  They're going to put this on their key chain.  And that makes a lot of sense.  That doesn't care.  It was in hotels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hotels.  Post. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Except I said, I realize you know, it has to have Wi-Fi into the cloud directly.  Right.  There's a disadvantage.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's not a problem.  You just bring your little router with you.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have a hot spot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's go down to the company's implications.  So I was on this road trip where I was taking my son to visit universities and Cambridge.  We only had wired Internet, so I went and bought a Wi-Fi box and then carried that around with us and plugged it in the hotel.  So that we had so rather than like individually attach us eight whatever devices we have between us to the Wi-Fi.  We could just attach the one thing and then use that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've tried that, Kevin, and some hotels nix that they managed to block that.  Yeah.  They look at the Mac addresses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Um, oh, no, they limit the number of devices I used worked.  But yeah, cheaper hotels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I worked in hired worked in a club.  What's it?  The Howard Johnson didn't have a wire connection.  Didn't have you work with Wi-Fi either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, cheaper hotels always have better Internet than the expensive hotels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Isn't that weird?  Well, it's because they're made of wooden so they can put white.  Yeah.  They're made of sticks.  Help me out here.  And they said it's really hard for our expensive hotels because they're really well built.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You don't want it to be well built.  Whereas that's why they charge 20 pounds a day.  You can just chuck a few base stations in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Help me out here in terms of the kind of impact on the rest of the industry.  All right.  You know, that's what I try to do when I went through this.  And what interests me is the whole media industry.  Various oligopolies in TV have been declared dead multiple times and they're not.  They're still around.  They're still smart.  If you're Comcast, what are you saying today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I'm not sure how this makes a lot of difference from Comcast from people watching stuff on their laptops or tablets.  It improves cable, cable snipping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's yet one more way to snip my cable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  It's good for cord cutters.  The people who are really excited about this, I think, are content creators.  I think that's the most excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think channels as bundlers and cable companies as bundlers of bundles, they're hurt by this.  I think content creators are helped, though it's going to be very hard to find their audiences.  And gosh, who can help with that but Google.  So yeah, I think content creators should be happy that they can hope they can have more direct relationships with their audiences.  They can know who those audiences are.  Getting rid of middlemen in terms of revenue, getting rid of middlemen in terms of data.  That's the good news.  The bad news is there's no easy path to find a built in audience or somebody to write a check to make you to make the show.  You got to make the show go to the risk yourself.  Right.  Amazon.  Yes.  What does Amazon think of this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What does Amazon think of this?  I mean, this is another way to watch Amazon Instant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can't watch Amazon Instant on my Android devices.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't watch it on your Apple TV either.  I can't watch it on my Apple TV either, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, so it's just an easy way to watch Amazon Instant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You should be able to watch it on this, I think.  Yeah.  I should try and see, but I assume it will work with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the Google TV Amazon Instant app, quote unquote, just brings you to the website and loads a browser.  And it's kind of slow and stuttery.  If Chromecast is a little smoother experience, then this is great for Amazon.  It just means more people can be self-sufficient.  So Amazon's selling it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is that an indication that Amazon sees this as friendly and that they're going to use the API for that stuff?  It's like I don't own a Kindle, but I read Kindle constantly on my Nexus 7.  Same thing. We don't care what device you use.  We'd like it to sell you a device, but we don't really care.  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would be surprised if Amazon didn't enable, cast enable their instant streaming content.  I'd be really surprised. Why wouldn't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm surprised that they haven't shipped an Android app yet.  That's the pit that puzzles me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's true they haven't.  All right, Hulu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know why they haven't. I know why. I know, I know.  Remember how long it took Netflix?  Remember Netflix didn't have an Android app for a long time.  DRM?  DRM.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Which is what they changed in Jelly Bean, right?  Guess what's in Jelly Bean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, 4.3 they said they got new DRM hooks.  So that's like a licensing implication issue.  It's like you've got to placate whoever you're licensing the content.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was fascinating too that Google presented that as a way to get higher quality video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but they couldn't get 1080p from Netflix.  It's true.  Wouldn't give them 1080p. So it's true.  All right, Hulu.  The problem is Hulu's in a flux.  It's a moving target because the ownership isn't up in the air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, now they've said they're going to hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know, but they still don't agree on what kind of service Hulu should be.  Right.  Hulu notoriously blocked Google TV.  Right.  Right.  And now that I understand that you have to, as a web page, enable Chromecast,  I think you could pretty much, that's Google's way of saying,  Yeah, and you don't have to look at the user agent.  Just don't turn it on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you don't have to enable it, right?  I could still put a web page online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can send the tab. Yeah.  That's the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  How do you send a tab?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just using this Chrome extension.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  I got the impression the Chrome extension doesn't do anything.  So watch.  Well, I don't have, unfortunately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I thought if you could put a web page on it, then you could put it on.  I don't think you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Maybe it comes to what's to sound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, maybe my Amazon one will come Friday like it says it's supposed to,  and then I can try it and sell it, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can also cast any of your tabs in Chrome to your TV,  letting you enjoy sites, photos, or even videos from the best screen in your home.  Oh.  Yeah.  And know that this feature is still in beta and requires a fast computer and a Wi-Fi network.  Okay.  So you should be able to go to abc.com, cbs.com, or whatever,  and even if they haven't cast enable, just say, hey, send that tab to my TV, which is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're going to see it on the page as part of the page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which means you're actually doing it the painful way.  You're doing it like air-pay sending, where it's actually compressing your screen at 720p  and sending it over the wire to the TV.  Oh, is it?  Oh, I thought it was, it's not reopening the address?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it says you have to have fast, et cetera, et cetera.  That sounds to me like yes.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It says tab production quality, standard 480p, high 720p, extreme 720p, hybrid rate.  Yeah.  So basically the maximum they're going to digitize it and compress it at is 720p.  So it's not ideal.  So it's not going to give you the full resolution of your Chrome Pixel on the screen,  but it's going to give you a representation of it.  All right, all right.  So I'm getting this now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Presentations and PowerPoints.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It probably wouldn't be great for watching video because you're then decoding and re-encoding,  and it'll look a bit scabby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm sure Google Docs PowerPoints work great for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, winter is coming, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just don't go to any weddings.  I want this thing now.  I want this thing now.  I cannot wait to watch House of Cards on this.  I was like, when they start playing the music, I was like, oh my God, bye, bye, bye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You may not publicly distribute or ship your Google Cast application  without written permission from Google.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So yeah, in order to be a write a sender or a receiver, you have to have an app approved by Google.  So there is a they do have a hook there.  They have a Visa hook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I guess what we would do is go to the app developers for Twitter, for instance,  and say, hey, you want to put this plug-in in and be great because then somebody could launch the app.  I guess.  I don't know how this would work.  Launch the app.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And there'd just be a new button.  And there'd be a button on the app that says send it to my Google Cast.  And then it would just show up on the TV.  And you'd only see the video.  You wouldn't see the exactly the widgets.  And same thing on the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  On the web, it's going to be a lot easier.  I'm sure it's just a snippet of JavaScript or whatever.  If it's the Android, it's the native Android or iOS app, they're going to have to download the SDK  and find a place to put the button.  But it shouldn't be a problem.  Find a place to put the button.  But it shouldn't be that big a deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If I'm Pocket or there's a lot of apps that this would behoove you to enable.  The whole class of apps that would allow you to aggregate videos.  You can aggregate video into Pocket right now and then push a button and just watch your videos on your TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  It would make my to watch queue a lot more fun to watch.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the button on the Chrome browser appears just as all the other buttons do.  If you have Chrome on some devices that you get a lineup of buttons on the Chrome OS, you get the drop down.  So there's the Chromecast button right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ah, it's just I installed it on my Chromebook and it's just appeared on my desktop Chrome as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's one of the things I love about extensions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's kind of cool.  Well, I kind of love it.  And sometimes it's really annoying.  It's like, no, actually I don't like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Yeah.  I have a lot of A-bine on my browser here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That Twitter reading extension I put on the Chromebook has now appeared on my Mac.  And it's like, no, you're chewing up too much CPU going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can control that, though, can't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It seems to be like there's a way to I don't know.  Maybe not.  That would be a good tip for somebody to tell us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right, Gina. Classic.  My standard question.  What wheels does this turn your developer mind?  Anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, this I have been fighting with Google TV for so long that I'm like just so excited to unplug that thing and get to watch this stuff that I want to watch on my TV.  This didn't really you know, I have to say I haven't had a chance to really look at the API yet.  You know, the app that I build obviously doesn't have the kind of media you're not going to want for your to do list onto the onto the TV.  That makes no sense.  So it didn't it didn't really get the developer of me going, but it definitely got the TV lover in me going.  I'm pretty I'm just excited about I want to see that this user experience, you know,  how fast it is, how well it goes, who's going to block and who's not who's going to enable it, who isn't.  I mean, I'm excited.  I think I mean, I cover Android and all about Android every week and I'm and I saw a big Android enthusiast.  I'm I'm kind of a little bit bummed for Android a little bit that that Chrome became the thing that that sort of became or at least it looks to me is going to be the device.  The Chrome OS is going to be the is going to be the operating system that powers the device that makes TV watching better.  But now it all kind of makes sense that the fact that Google TV was putting the web on your TV is also this this Chromecast is putting the web on your TV.  I mean, I'm pro web, of course.  I like that it's open that anybody can enable it, that it works on everything.  It just makes a lot of sense.  Yeah, I don't know.  I think I think still still still processing otherwise on that point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I saw somebody a week ago speculating that maybe on our on our Google Plus group or someplace that Chrome maybe may win the day here and Android may become a subset run by Chrome.  No, I couldn't understand that.  I didn't get any sense out of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's a full operating system.  And by the way, it supports Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. Chrome runs on Android.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Android does not run around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's why I couldn't figure it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Chrome is a full OS.  And no, I think they're symbiotic.  I thought it was very interesting.  At first, I thought this is no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, you know, that's an OS with one app.  Right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And every app could have run as a web app.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's one app.  You can't you can't install arbitrary apps on Chrome OS.  You can install Chrome on it.  And then whatever Chrome will do, you can do.  Right.  Chrome, in a way, in that sense, is the OS, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  Actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it was interesting because when Sundar came out, he talked about Android and Chrome.  And I thought, you mean Android and Chrome OS?  But really, Chrome is the Chrome is the OS, actually.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In a sense, the Chromebook is just a rendition of that, a demonstration of that, of the power of the browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is so somebody in the chat room said, how is this better than Apple AirPlay?  It's just different than AirPlay.  It's different.  I think it's better.  It's more flexible.  It has AirPlay features, but AirPlay is deprecated.  Really, the idea of taking what's on your screen here and putting on your big screen TV.  That's what AirPlay does.  Well, I think it's two things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, AirPlay is two things.  So AirPlay is a stream sending API.  And then later they added the AirPlay mirroring, is what they call the grabbing the screen and sending it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it was originally...  But in both cases, isn't the content coming from your Mac to the TV?  Yes.  And that's what's so different about this.  You're not pushing content to the Google Cast.  The Google Cast is getting the content on its own.  You're sending a message to the Google Cast in most cases saying,  I want you to play this content and let's establish a link so that I can control your playback.  I have a way of saying stop, forward, back, that kind of thing, volume.  But the Google Cast is doing the work.  That's very different than AirPlay.  It does have an AirPlay-like screen mirroring feature.  So I can take an arbitrary Chrome tab, compress it, send it over to the Google Cast and it will play it.  But that seems like that's deprecated almost.  That's the last thing you'd want to do.  So DLNA, AirPlay is just a fancy version of DLNA.  DLNA and AirPlay are really ways that a device can put their content on the screen wirelessly.  It's a wireless transmission protocol.  This is not that.  And that's why this is interesting because this is...  Instead of the thin client-server relationship, this is the CPU everywhere concept,  which is you CPUs are smart devices everywhere and you're interoperating.  Nobody's in charge. You're interoperating.  And I love this because I think in the long run, this is where we're going.  This is the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So how do you tie this in then to the Internet of Things?  So if you've now attached a computer to your TV, now go to your car and to your refrigerator and your washer and dryer,  does this yield any kind of indication about the architecture of how that could operate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, exactly. It's the same thing.  I bet you the... I don't know. Maybe Gina or Kevin would like to look at the API.  I wonder how abstracted it is.  It sounds like it's completely abstracted.  That it is... What it really is, is aware of two devices to communicate.  It's a way to talk.  I wonder if it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I could do this in my car. I could go into my car and plug in a little dongle and make all the stuff mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. So push this podcast to my car radio, that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And I think it's even more abstracted than content.  Yeah.  Because what you're really doing, really all you're doing is you're sending a message to a device,  in this case say, play this content from this URL,  but really you're sending a message to a device establishing a control conversation.  So I don't know. You'd have to look at how abstract the API is, but at a sufficient level of abstraction, it's not about content.  It's about whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. And then once you get sensors involved, it can be things like when it gets hot in that room, turn the fan on or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it's Raspberry Pi.  Well, so your analogy before the old is not bad. It's Raspberry Pi.  It really is a Raspberry Pi. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So for instance, your smart washing machine, it's object-oriented programming.  Your smart washing machine understands a certain set of commands.  So instead of saying, play this video, you say, wash these clothes.  And then establish a link so that when it's done, you tell me it's done.  If you want me to pause, I could pause it from my phone, that kind of thing.  If it's at that level of abstraction, they've invented something much more interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Could I put this OS on Raspberry Pi?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. You're asking me for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Has anyone put a Chromium to Raspberry Pi? That's the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sure. Yeah. Linux is on Raspberry Pi, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So anything you can do there, now you can start to be rethinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The only reason I use Raspberry Pi is that is a device roughly $30, $35 that is a full computer, has memory, has an operating system, has storage, you know, all of that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So the abstraction goes to two levels. The abstraction goes to a display level and the command level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But don't use the word display. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And execution level. Am I wrong? Am I giving this too much?  So there's an execution level and a command level. There's a control level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, this is what ZigBee, this is what Z-Wave do. This is what home automation systems do, right? Yeah.  And okay, this is crazy. But what if Google's creating back in a back door into a home automation system?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's not that's not crazy. No, I mean, who is that? Who's that? Exactly? Who? Andy Rubin. Isn't Andy Rubin?  Oh, Andy Rubin back. Yes. He's all into this, isn't he? Yeah, this is his thing, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I remember Android at home and they've shown this kind of stuff. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So someone on Twitter, Greg Norman said, it seems like the Chrome Android differences are becoming clearer.  Android is an operating system and Chrome is a platform for interoperability.  Which I think is a pretty good distinction. I mean, I think we nerds all try to figure out, you know, what's Android's role versus Chrome's role.  And the more they blur the lines, the more we start trying to figure out what's going to, you know, is one going to beat out the other?  Can these two things coexist? Is there a tension between them?  That was kind of my fixation about this whole this whole announcement. I mean, yeah, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All operating systems are platforms. That's what an operating system is. Right. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This this pushing, this pushing and pulling the promoting the cloud print, this this idea that that Chrome is, you know, that you install an extension and it stalls everywhere, that it's a push pull, that it's aware and all tied to your Google account.  I mean, it really does feel more like a platform for interoperability more than more than anything.  I mean, Android has some of those characteristics. But but Leo, I don't think you're taking it too far with the Internet of Things, which Jeff brought up originally.  I don't think that this the API and its current incarnation is necessarily generic enough or addresses these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But no, I don't I don't think that you're going to. I would note that the API is not called Chromecast. It's called Google Cast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google Cast. I noticed that, too. Right. So it so it sounds like it's bigger than that product than the Chromecast product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or maybe they just want to distinguish the API from the hardware. Well, imagine to just the Chromecast API.  I mean, I don't know. They do say Google Cast is a screen sharing technology. But I just think it's it could be abstracted something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. Right. That's yeah. Well, but you know, I imagine now I said I go to a lot of places where they use Apple to just, you know, cast their screen up on the on the big screen.  Take this down to the business environment with WebRTC with all this stuff and imagine how you change the idea of a shared screen in a space.  And what you can do with that. Right. You can edit in a classroom. Anybody can can can share something on something that you can now use WebRTC and communicate across things.  And the next thing that gets me interested is can I remote. So now I'm I'm controlling actions on a local screen.  What about controlling actions on a remote screen or remote device? That's what the Internet of Things comes to them. That also becomes very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And geofencing, which is now built in into hardware on the new droids in this X8 processor that they're using.  Right. Imagine that as you walk through a mall, the screens change displays on the screen change to welcome you because it's aware of your device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can see you. You're talking to it. OK, right. Right. OK. So one of the important technologies here is just that notion of awareness.  When you turn on your device, it immediately senses the Chromecast and says, you want to talk to that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's well, and that's what's happening in the Chromecast extension right now. It says no cast devices found.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. So that's that's that's really powerful. So now there are Chromecast devices freaking everywhere.  They're in your hotel room. They're on the airplane in the seat in front of you.  They're in. Oh, I love that. Wait a minute. That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The airplane airline no longer has to provide content of any kind.  They just give me a screen with Chromecast. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, this is this we say about the cars. This is why I've just got a new car.  And so it became my job to try and connect everything to it.  It's a major pain in the neck because you basically have to download install apps and the cars doing its own voice recognition.  And I'm just sitting there going, I just want this phone to connect to that screen and to that microphone and then I'll be done.  But I can't do that. I have to go through an entire other OS running on the car, which is really annoying.  So, yeah, I can see this making much more sense down the line and down another product cycle of the car manufacturer where you just have a way to send stuff to the car.  Now, Apple has been pushing something like that. They've made some announcements.  I was seven. I was seven staff and they will have it that baked into some manufacturers.  But it's the same problem as like baking in the iPod connector.  You have this problem that, oh, we have this great connector that you can you can plug iPods into, except even Apple doesn't make those anymore.  And so you are stuck with this connector in your car. You've got to like daisy chain dongles into to attach other things to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I also see great hacks for it. I can imagine somebody hacking a Times Square giant display with one of these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As long as they can get a message in the HDMI port.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, because I better have one in the back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just get just get around plugging things to HDMI ports and bars and just taking over the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That'll be fun. Well, that's good. I like that.  Well, anyway, so it's clear that the surprise, the stealth part of this announcement was something completely unexpected was this Chromecast device.  Thirty five dollars. Again, the tip is go to Amazon. It looks like you can buy it and get it Friday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Basically, a USB stick upstage, a new version of Android and a new Nexus seven.  Think about that. A little stick with the Chrome logo.  Just as cool. Also, the other the other two major announcements.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is cool. There's something about it. I just like I only wish HDMI were powered so you wouldn't have to plug in the darn USB.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it is some some variants of it. Oh, I think it is an M.H.L. port.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's it was an interesting choice on Google's part.  So the Roku stick gets its power from the HDMI port.  But you have to have this special kind of M.H.L. port with some some TVs are starting to ship now.  I have it on my receiver. So I plug it in there and it's powered.  And I think I would be I'd be very curious to see if there is M.H.L. support built into this.  They may not have mentioned it. But what if it did?  Because, I mean, it would be nice not to have to plug in the USB power as well.  It may also be a need of more power than M.H.L. would provide. I'm not sure what the that's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Our specs is computer after all is a computer. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very interesting. Very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or Android was fun. Yeah, it was lots of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're going to take a break. Come back. That was part one.  There's more Nexus seven Jelly Bean four point three.  And I suppose there's also some news. I don't know.  Charm Charm keeps telling me. So I will say this.  A power dongle is provided with the Chromecast device.  But you don't need it because it's a micro USB port.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So anything you probably have about 800 of those cables and power adapters lying around.  It's the same thing that powers all the smartphones and so forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Now the Amazon order for Chromecast is ship is this is July 30th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I guess Amazon sold out of them to do you know whether they did they give away these things at the event?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They didn't mention anything. Did they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why they cut off the signal so fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Danny Danny Sullivan was saying, oh, I've got one with me.  I can play it to the TV. Oh, no, Matt, we should have gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I put on the rundown. There were there was some unboxing of both the Chromecast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are lots of questions. There are lots of questions about, you know, what exactly is this?  How exactly does this work? Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There you go. It's a box.  Did anybody here get an invitation to this event? No, no, I didn't either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What are we doing wrong? It's called this week in Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's very strange. Very strange.  Plug it in. Switch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess it doesn't switch the input. Somebody was saying it turns on the TV and switches the input.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I think Leo Knuttle set up. That's to get it set up.  Oh, just to get it set up. Maybe. I don't know.  I don't think most TVs. Well, wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, there are some TVs that you can control the TV from the they did talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought they said they said that during the announcement that I turned it on.  Yeah. OK. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not all TVs. You have to have what's called CEC.  Most new TVs have CMC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  New as in like last couple of years. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're looking. Yeah. Yeah.  You're going to want to buy a new TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This thirty five dollar device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you're a TV manufacturer, go back to them.  If you're a TV manufacturer, if you're if you're if you're a Samsung and Sony, are you building this thing in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mentioned that. I mean, I think that they make money on their smart TV products.  You know, my Panasonic Viera has advertising playing back and so forth.  They probably also do license deals.  I know Samsung approached us and said, for a small percentage of your total revenue,  we'd be glad to include your app in the Samsung TVs in Europe.  And we said, no, thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, what are the questions?  What happens to the manufacturers who are still pumping out Google TV TVs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're gone. Right. What does happen to Google TV?  Is it is it dead? It's dead. Right.  It's a it's a very different thing.  I mean, it's not it doesn't do the same thing at all.  Right. It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But the cell was the web on your TV.  And what do you need? This is what this is.  What do you need? Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. One of the advantages of Google TV is you didn't need a separate HDMI port.  It was a pass through device.  So you just plug your cable box into it and then into the TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But right. But then you had to have like a cable as remote control and a whole bunch of width.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Now, this is so far superior.  Andy and his chair and the chairman says my three year old Samsung has CEC.  He in fact controls it with XBMC on his Raspberry Pi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now that's showing off.  Cake. That is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yo, cake.  It's been part of the specs since HDMI 1.2.  So it's fairly common.  OK. I know.  I know all the TVs that I think all my TVs have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Maybe my oldest one does not.  I think my oldest one does not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Welcome. Let's get you set up and watching.  So this is if you go to the website.  Thanks for downloading the app. Verify, install, run.  Where do you find this chat? Is this on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So on the unboxing video, there was a URL.  Yeah, there was a URL that's so go to Google dot com slash Chromecast slash setup.  Yeah. So you would do this on your device as opposed to does this mean that I can like seriously airplay my computer?  Wait a minute. What's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's going on? There's a there's an app called Chromecast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Hey, a Mac Mac.  Yeah, this is a Mac Mac Mac app.  Yes.  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know. I know.  What's that?  Well, I mean, it's certainly in the API that anything can be a sender.  You don't receive her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They emphasize that this is works on iOS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but this is a Mac app.  So you still want the Chromecast.  What? It's looking for your looking for the Chromecast.  So this is an app that runs on the Macintosh that lets you talk to the Chromecast as opposed to the Google Chrome extension.  So this would be in lieu of an extension.  You could do both, obviously.  So there's a Windows app and a Mac app as well.  The center, we thought the center would be Chrome, but it's not just Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  And it's interesting. It looks like if you have a USB on your TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And that's what I that's what I will do because I do have a USB.  It's right now it's charging the eyes to do it.  It really glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I'll just take those off about a dead technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they're charged in case I ever want to watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's the security on this one?  If you know the old porn question, so somebody comes into the room and they want to stream porn to your TV.  How do you own your Wi-Fi network?  So that's what it is.  OK. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It just depends. Is it good porn?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, they could be on it.  Well, I see.  No, they don't, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google TV developers on Google Plus with the exciting news about Chromecast.  We're getting a lot of questions, mostly wondering if Google TV is dead.  No. In fact, partners are continuing to launch new Google TV enabled HDTVs and boxes.  LG, right, had Google TV built in.  As we announced at I.O., we're working with partners to bring the latest experience of Android and Chrome to devices later this year.  We believe there is ample room for both products to exist and succeed.  That's from the Google TV group.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK. What's your what's your what's your countdown?  How long before the announcement that Google TV is dead?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I give it six months.  Have they got more users than Google reader?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  At the rate at which Google's cutting products, the fact that they didn't sunset Google TV yet.  That's interesting.  Makes me think.  They've got contracts out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They got deals. They got deals with LG and other manufacturers.  They've got to keep supporting it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They've got to do it gently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gently, gently, gently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Basically, they want those guys to say, OK, fine, we want to be releasing this contract so we can use this other thing instead.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're going to talk about the retina iPad.  I mean, the retina Nexus seven in just a second.  But first a word from legal zoom dot com.  Legal zoom is not a law firm, but founded by lawyers about 12 years ago to help people get legal work done.  It doesn't require a lawyer.  Turns out there's lots of things you can do from wheels to LLCs that are just paperwork.  You just fill out a form, check boxes and you've got it.  That's how Twitter was started.  Very simple.  Cost me ninety nine dollars at legal zoom dot com to form an LLC or an S Corp or a C Corp.  Your trademark protection starts at one hundred sixty nine dollars.  Your last will and testament sixty nine dollars.  This is very easy.  Take it from me.  I'm a nitwit and I was able to go through the steps and answer all the questions and boom, you got the documents.  You got the legal paperwork.  You're protected.  And I it's it's such a great thing.  It really democratizes this kind of stuff.  And it's great for startups, for people who want to protect a brand.  You know, if you've got a blog that you've been doing for a few years, that that's your brand.  Don't don't let that go up for grabs.  You got to keep that.  By the way, the one thing they've added since I used them is you can now go and get a advice from an actual lawyer.  They have the legal zoom legal plan, pre-negotiated flat rate fees with attorneys in nearly every state.  You can see the unedited reviews of the attorneys, their profiles, to pick the right one for you.  That's just part of the total service provided by legal zoom dot com.  When you use the offer code twig, you can take ten bucks off.  So that means a will for fifty nine dollars.  There's no reason not to have a will now.  Really.  Legal zoom dot com.  Find out why more than so they've been in business 12 years.  Two million Americans in that time have used legal zoom for LLCs, wills, trusts and more.  Legal zoom dot com.  Please do me a favor.  Use the offer code twig.  We'll get credit and you'll get ten bucks off.  So the Nexus seven.  I resurrected my old Nexus seven.  What?  This was an amazing deal.  It's about a year old.  Over the months, it's you know, I've got all the apps on here.  I want I have to say in the early days of Android tablets back when we were running ice cream sandwich, it was not present pleasant.  It wasn't.  It wasn't.  In fact, even before that, what was the first tablet operating system?  It was it was a honeycomb honeycomb honeycraft.  And there was a there was a tablet before that.  The the same tablet.  The same tablet.  The same tablet.  The same tablet.  The same tablet.  The same tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The same tablet.  The same tablet.  The same tablet.  The same tablet.  And I remember that the the Samsung Galaxy Tab, which I had, but it was an awkward affair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that but in a few remember the zoom Motorola zoom.  But in a few years, literally in just a few years, not only has the tablet come of age, but I got to wonder why anybody would buy an iPad.  You know, somebody was saying, well, there's no tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are you going to get the comments?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm serious now.  I'm really sincere.  So this is two hundred twenty nine dollars for the new Nexus seven.  It's retina.  And I said, oh, we can't do retina and give you good battery life or a reasonable price in a seven inch.  Well, Google can somehow magically.  They claim nine hours watching HD movies, 10 hour battery life, good battery life, great screen.  They've claimed a big improvement in both processor speed and a 4x improvement in GPU speed.  They're going to need it to push all those pixels.  You know, something's weird has happened with the Nexus seven, also manufactured by Asus, the original one, is it's gotten a little sluggish over time.  I don't know if you noticed that, Jeff. It's just no, I don't know.  Maybe it's I don't know. Maybe it's the new OS.  Maybe I don't know. But but what I have noticed is absolute app parity.  There is no reason to think that you're giving up anything moving from an iPad to a tablet or giving up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You were giving up Netflix, but no more.  Right.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I, you know, I'm looking at all the apps I use. They're all there.  One thing people say, oh, well, there aren't as many tablet specific apps.  I'm not sure that's true. But be Android scales.  Oh, smaller apps, much better than the iPhone.  The iPhone apps on an iPad are ugly.  They bring up an iPhone keyboard.  They're scaled. Now, that's going to be a little bit better in iOS seven.  The scaling anyway, but they'll still bring up an iPhone keyboard.  Not so on Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is I have read a huge run about this just before the Apple Developer Conference, which is that there's still this weird fragmentation on iOS where you either write an iPhone app or an iPad app.  Right.  And you kind of pretend that there are only two screen sizes.  And then they launched the iPad mini, but they didn't change anything.  So you're either running the iPhone app doubled up or you're running the iPad app shrunk down.  And either way, the buttons are the wrong size.  It's exactly what Steve Jobs said. You have to find your fingers down because if you're running the iPad app and the iPad mini, all the buttons are just that half the size that they were on the as designed.  And that's that's that's a structural problem.  Now, I think they're going to fix that with seven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A lot of what they've said on seven is they're going to fix the resolution issues, but they're still going to have a phone keyboard on there, which I think is a bad thing.  I haven't seen seven running on a I've been told I don't have it, of course, because I didn't sign the NDA.  But those who have used it say, no, no, it doesn't change the keyboard.  It's the same bad iPhone keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I also argue that they may fix that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the thing is, what they are doing in seven is they are changing the layout engine, encouraging you to rewrite your apps.  So you get the shiny new layout possibilities and variable size fonts and things.  And that will give them the ability to create different size screens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, needless to say, let me for instance, this is an app that's called Glide.  It's very just suddenly got became very popular on the iPhone to iPad.  It'll scale. It's ugly.  There isn't a Android tablet version.  However, the scaling is great.  It works just fine.  It looks good. The fonts look good.  It's totally usable.  I don't have a two X button.  If I want a keyboard, I have a keyboard that is completely normal.  You know, I don't understand.  I think this to answer the question, they do.  I guess it doesn't rotate.  That may be that specific to this.  Maybe switched off. Oh, I do have.  I always switch it off because it drives me crazy.  Rotation locked.  So I have to say that in my opinion, I think it may just be app specific.  In my opinion, the tablet issue is no longer an Android.  So if you don't have a major app advantage on iPad, you've got features on this that the that Apple does not give you and may not give you this year.  And it's two hundred twenty nine bucks.  It's hundred bucks less.  Yeah, it's a strong argument.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why would you buy an iPad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Will you buy an iPad if you're bought into the Apple system and you like the Apple shop and so on?  And that's the trouble is that's the only reason.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The other reason I've said this before, but I emphasize it my way is mine dirty is seven inches versus eight inches is a big difference to me.  The seven inches is a huge benefit.  It fits in the hand.  It fits in the pocket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the right size.  I'm comparing this directly to the iPad mini.  So the iPad mini same size is a little different aspect ratio.  It's a little bit lighter, a little bit thinner.  It's in the same ballpark as the new Nexus seven.  But it's more expensive and it's not retina.  And I have to say, you know, Apple, it seems everybody said, oh, you just can't do retina and get the same battery life to keep the cost down.  Well, I think Google just said, yeah, you can.  Yeah, you can.  I think it's what is it?  Three thirty DPI on this.  I don't know.  Yeah, maybe the iPad screens a little bit bigger.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's well, it's physically bigger, but it has fewer pixels.  And so it has the iPad mini has fewer pixels than the 1024 by 768.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not even 1080p.  Yeah, it's not even 720p.  No.  Whereas, you know, this more pieces better.  And this is this is going to be nice.  It is 720, but it's not 1080.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's 24 by 768.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  But it should be 1280.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, because it's not wide.  You're right.  It's 43.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  I just I think that if you're looking if you're in the market for seven inch and here and  you want retina, it's just a no brainer.  A year ago, you couldn't say that because the apps maybe weren't there and so forth.  But I think you can say it now.  I know we launched something in a couple of months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, what the rumors are, and this will be interesting that there is no mini this year,  that they aren't going to update the mini.  So that's what that's what will be interesting.  I think they're going to have to do a mini.  Yeah.  But, you know, it's not the pipeline.  It's not in the pipeline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And their mini has sold really well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The iPad mini has been right.  There's no there's no issue.  There's no pressure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which is a form factor thing.  This form factor is a really good is a really good size.  Yeah, I like seven.  Amazon showed that with a Kindle.  We had it with a nook.  It's it's it makes sense.  It's a it's a it's a you can actually hold it in one hand on public transit, which you  can't do with an iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, and I think you remember when I first got this Nexus seven, it was a revelation to me.  I said, this is the right size.  Yeah.  Many, many agree, actually, that Apple may be starting to think that the mini is its future form factor going forward,  which of course, Charles made fun of Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're absolutely right.  When I see people now on the subway holding an iPad, it looks so big and horsey.  It does, doesn't it?  What is that thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can't hold on to the post on the iPad.  You're like, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The new Nexus seven is a little thinner, right?  They took they cut some of the size.  Yes.  It's got cameras front and back to which five megapixels.  It's not a huge camera, but five megapixels is pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's all the iPad speakers.  Wireless charging dual speakers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It has.  Does it have wireless charging?  Mm hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's two twenty nine for the sixteen gig Wi-Fi version to sixty nine for thirty two gigs.  That's a pretty good price for thirty two gigs.  It is.  It's got stereo speakers on the back.  It's got they call it frown Hoffa.  So I won't sound.  I always laugh when they when they make a big deal about the Dolby Surround or frown  Hoffer surround in these little cheesy speakers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But my problem is I want the LTE and I got to wait.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it's running a new version of Jelly Bean.  And we're three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'm still waiting for that update.  Four three.  What do you want to talk about?  The one thing I saw with four three in an unboxing is that if you go to the about page  and tap for three a bunch of times, you get a jelly bean game.  That's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Isn't that that's in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't that is that in this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's in.  Oh, I never saw it.  Yeah, I had never seen it either.  I just discovered a couple of.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, wow.  You're kidding.  OK, so I I tapped the Android version a bunch of times.  Oh, yeah.  Son of a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tap tap the bean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Click and hold or click.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, tap and hold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You all knew this and you didn't tell me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just found out a couple of weeks being cleaner.  Yeah, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How could nobody have?  So I see I thought there's a new feature for three.  So that's not new and four three.  What is new and four three restricted profiles?  I you know, I thought this was especially valuable for education.  Obviously, anybody with a kid is going to want this because you can keep your kid from buying stuff  and seeing stuff you don't want them to see.  But for education, having multiple users on a single inexpensive tablet makes these also very compelling.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  The restricted profiles.  It was interesting.  I'm not sure.  And I should look into the Android API a little bit if you have to tailor your app and say, you know,  and add the permission logic in your app.  It seems like maybe I mean, the example that they gave is if you have a restricted profile for your kid  and you know, you buy your kid a game and there's all these in-app purchases and you buy your kid,  you know, a couple of levels when your kid logs on, he only sees the levels that you purchased.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's got to require programming on the game, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, because it also got to be locked in with a player account.  So they're basically just blocking the player account for those things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you could, I mean, the least they would do is say, hey, you can't you see those levels, you can't get them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But to change the UI would require the game having some logic.  But you would just find the button doesn't work, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I didn't actually watch the demo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So at least the button won't work.  But even better, what doesn't even show those, the kid doesn't know they exist.  So the kid doesn't know, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because your kid's going to come to you and say, hey, can you buy me this level?  Right. The fact that it didn't show it at all.  That's fair enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't mind that so much as the kid buying stuff with your account.  You're like, what just happened?  Also, I do feel like there's an education.  It's like a month later.  It's like, why have I just been built $400 by Google?  I totally had that with iOS.  Did you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  iOS, it was in it was notorious.  In fact, Apple had to do a had a class action lawsuit and had to give people settlements based on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I know. I just got what they're in the mail.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You get what?  Five bucks or something.  Yes.  Yeah, thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This version includes NSA based security.  What?  Yes.  No, that's a good thing.  People say.  What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, now I got to find it.  NSA.  All right.  While you're looking, there's definitely education push for this.  They mentioned all the textbook partners that are offering textbooks for Android.  We know Chrome OS is very popular in schools.  I think that's a good one to punch that an Android tablet is right.  In some cases, if you have multiple logins, one classroom could share several tablets.  Textbooks make more sense on a touch screen, I think, than they do on a Chromebook.  It also solves a problem that Chromebook has, in my opinion of writing a paper on your Chromebook and wanting to look at sources and stuff.  It's not a windowing environment or not a very well done windowing environment.  Kind of hard to do.  But if you had a tablet and your Chromebook, that makes sense.  Your textbooks on here.  You're writing your paper on there.  I think that this is smart.  I think Google's making a lot of sense on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Also, 4.3 has lens flare.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is WebGL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OpenGL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OpenGL.  They mentioned JJ Abrams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, giving that lens flare effect.  And then like the dirty camera.  This is all inside games.  I don't know.  The camera may have been the dirty camera lens may have been part of it before, but the lens flare effect is kind of interesting.  I just thought it was funny that they were calling it the JJ Abrams lens flare.  I just put it in the rundown chat, Leo.  OK.  Now all I have to do is look at the rundown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Business Week Security Enhanced, Android NSA Edition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is intriguing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe a better write up, but that's the one I found.  Mark Millian.  No, Mark Millian knows this stuff.  Tech Giants listed as part of the National Security Agency's prying program, although prying program is probably also appropriate.  Prism have gone to some lengths to convince the world they aren't in bed with the government.  Skip, skip those first two sentences.  Skip, skip, skip.  Through its open source Android project, Google has agreed to incorporate code first developed by the NSA in 2011, known as Security Enhances for Android, isolates apps to prevent hacking, and it's a very interesting thing.  I think people don't know this, but the NSA has a very good page, number of pages on how to secure your stuff.  Really good security advice for Windows and Mac users and so forth at the NSA page.  And I guess they also offered some code to Google.  All new phones, tablets, televisions, cars, and other devices that rely on Android will include NSA code.  This doesn't have the same meaning it used to have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know.  The NSA tech guy is very good at top one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a difference between include NSA code and NSA contributes to your open source project.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  So this is open source code.  Yes, that's why it's seen to be okay.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you can review the code so you can know what it's doing.  And this is good.  They've decided to, one of the ways to promote security, U.S. security, our national security, is to make sure people aren't getting hacked.  Apple, on the other hand, does not accept source code from any government agencies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, how do they know?  Excuse me.  No, that's a statement from Apple.  They aren't contributing to WebKit.  Well, that's true.  It should just be some guy, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Apple takes code only from France.  It's only pretty enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  It is an open source project.  Darwin is an open source project.  It does get into the sort of open source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But WebKit is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I imagine that they may take WebKit contributions from other people too.  So hand wave.  I mean, yeah, there's a big difference between government demanding to inject code into your operating system when it's a closed source thing and government sending pull requests to you that you can decide to incorporate.  I love that, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why shouldn't the NSA participate in open source projects?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I'm waiting for the first idiot reporting to say, oh, my God, NSA is now on all your Android phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guarantee it.  Now, you in your Google Plus post, Jeff, and I took issue with it, says Google.  You said Google demoted your television set into a second screen, a slave to your phone, tablet or laptop.  I think I said it's a promotion.  It means you can do more with your television set.  It doesn't do less.  It does more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, but well, what I guess I'm trying to say is that the TV and cable box combo no longer control the world.  You control the world from this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's been true ever since we have, you know, yeah, it's certainly a good thing for cord cutters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely.  It doesn't give cord cutters more capabilities than they had yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  I carry this in my bag so that I can plug my laptop into TV sets when I go to a hotel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's more a convenience thing than it is a capability thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I carry lots of rubbish in my bag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The advantage is, though, that like it's going to like I think I think Jeff's point like if everyone has a Chromecast,  which why wouldn't you because it's thirty five dollars and it's the Web and people content creators like Twitter care enough to add the little,  you know, send to your Chromecast button, then suddenly that becomes an easy, cheap, standard portable way to watch the Web on your TV.  I think this is this is the difference between this and Roku or this and Google TV or this, you know, watching Netflix on your Xbox or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  So the second order piece of this is you'll be able to watch the Web on your Web.  So you'll be able to watch this on any other place that runs Chrome, too.  That's also part of that.  That's it's explicitly said in the SDK thing.  They haven't shipped anything that does that yet, but that's that's going to that's going to make sense, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think this is great.  I mean, yeah, I'm all for it.  And it is it does.  It's a lot easier for us as an entity to support this than it is to support a Samsung smart TV.  Somebody has to write a dedicated app for a Samsung smart TV that's unique.  There it is.  And complicated and proprietary, whereas we can add code to our I think my understanding is we could add code to our Web page or to our player that automatically understands this and handles it properly.  I think that's the case.  And of course, our third party apps can also be updated to do that.  I love it.  I'm excited. I just don't think it really it changes the landscape all that much.  It's just it's just great.  It's thirty five dollars is a big deal.  Well, you really know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know. That's where we do disagree.  Then I think it changes the landscape of the industry potentially again.  People have declared TV dead before.  But Gene is point exactly right.  If at this price with Google promotional power, this gets to critical mass.  And I want to watch the show X and I can't get it this way.  I have to go through all that old fashioned stuff, my cable box, that kind of stuff that potentially changes the business and and the TV as the center of things.  The TV is just another.  That's why I said to the slave.  Yeah, I can watch this here.  I can watch it there.  I'll put the show over there.  It's no longer that we all have to go and sit in the same room with the damn box and do the whole thing.  You know, and cable's been going that way where I can watch stuff from different rooms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like, yeah, and if you have a Roku or an Apple TV, you can do that.  I mean, I don't have to have a cable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How many people are fewer than Google reader?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How about Roku or Apple TV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no, no, I don't think so.  No, no, no.  Apple T. What was the last sales figures for Apple TV?  Tens of millions.  Really? Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And also is that promotional power of, you know, my sister, who's not in a tech at all, goes to a web page with streaming video and sees this button that says, watch this on your TV.  Yeah.  And she's like, what's that?  Oh, I could send this to my how do I?  Oh, thirty five bucks, you know, and that's a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is this button already?  Do you see the button if you don't have the plug in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's I mean, that's a good question.  I don't know if Google is smart.  You do. Right.  You want to know what's that?  What's this button?  Oh, I can watch this on my TV.  How do I do that?  Oh, I need this dongle.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, it's certainly low friction cost to entry.  But you also do need a device.  You need a computer.  Yeah.  So they've sold 13 million Apple TVs have been sold five million Roku.  So a total of 18 million Roku and Apple TV users.  And that doesn't include boxy boxes and all the other devices.  You know, maybe it's maybe it's 15 million.  I don't think Google is going to sell 15 million of these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, it depends.  I mean, it depends.  I mean, if the courses of surfing the web using Chrome, you that you you the ideas  imprinted upon your brain that you can just send whatever you're watching to your TV.  I don't know. That's like that's incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the barrier is it's people don't people don't know how to use their stuff.  Yeah, I think that's true.  You can't I don't care if it's 35 bucks.  I have to do what I plug in and where I have to do this.  The flashing 12 problem.  Yeah, I think that's the barrier.  It's not it's not price or functionality.  It's just that most people just want to turn on the TV and watch Oprah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. Right. Right.  But the discover ability, right?  Like no one's going to know about the Roku unless you kind of run into it.  The discover ability of like what's this button?  Hey, can you I could see my brother calling me and be like, hey, what's this watching TV thing?  Can you hook this up for me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it sounds like I can't see my mom, my kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can't see anybody in my family saying that if they saw the button and press the button and it said, watch this on your TV.  Really? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, first of all, my kids would just watch it on the computer.  They they they I mean, you want to talk about deprecation of the television.  That's what happened. It's people watching on their computer.  Yeah, they don't care if it's on the TV or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but your kids don't you can hang out in their living room and pass around phones and tablets watching YouTube videos when they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, Henry was mad when I took out the Google TV said, how can I watch YouTube on the TV now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly. Exactly.  It'd be cool if their friends could just flick a YouTube video or whatever to the to the TV and they could kind of watch the other.  Actually, that may sell it. That may sell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So he goes over to kids house and he says, hey, Dad, they all had this on their phone and they were just putting their videos up.  How can we do that on this TV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I could say, oh, I wish you could just text Henry right now and see if he's seen this and what he has.  Oh, he has. Oh, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the Nexus Q, right?  Like this was the self, the Nexus Q, the social media, you know, not social media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I made an alias on his Apple on his Macintosh.  I made an I set up Dropbox and made an alias for him.  He said, how do you know all this?  And that's not in any way a slam on Henry.  I think he's completely normal.  Yeah, we assume as geeks that people know all this stuff and then you go in a house and they go, how do you use a remote?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When I go to the house, how do you use it?  It's not a good thing. That's like remotes are really bad.  Remotes are terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I don't know if this is any less complicated than using a remote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's a browser. It's a button and a browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But Leo, as soon as it's built into TVs, which it's going to be more I think about it, Google's going to do deals.  This is going to be building the TV. So there it is.  So you have that you have a Google.  Google.  It'll take people to consumers 10 years to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, now they're now going to pull up another stat if I can find it.  How many people use these smart features in their television?  A survey says, what do you want to make a guess?  Fewer than half of people want a TV set that comes with apps to stream content have connected their TV directly to the Internet.  They haven't even connected it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I did it once and looked at this and said, why the hell would I ever do this crap?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and I plugged my plug the Internet into my TV is like, well, what did I just gain?  I don't see anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Eighty percent of people do not own a smart TV with software updates.  Smart TV penetration is tiny.  And of the four and five people who don't own a smart TV, only a third expressed any interest in buying one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want a dumb TV. I want my TV to be dumb.  I want to plug into it what I want to plug into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't even want a tuner. I want a monitor.  I'll tell it what to play. Damn it.  Is that the wrong attitude?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I think it's the right attitude.  There's a new thing to plug into my TV every couple of years.  I'm only going to buy a new TV. I'm cheap.  No, you're right.  Every 10 years, you know, so.  I don't want to look at anybody else.  Now, what if? OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Remember, Skype is being now introduced into every damn product in the world, including TVs.  What if this starts to have?  What if this has WebRTC and suddenly you can make video calls?  Yeah.  What if it what more features as a camera?  It doesn't have a camera or a mic.  But this does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes. OK.  And my Kinect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm holding up my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And your Kinect does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's what Microsoft's putting Skype into Xbox One for that reason.  That makes a lot of sense.  Right.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This changes conferencing in offices, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  WebRTC.  Well, that's I mean, that's I mean, that's basically already happened in office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because everyone has an iPad and we use Apple TV and nobody plugs anything anymore.  So that's that.  That's the transition has happened at Salesforce, where everyone has an iPad because they're doing presentations and things.  And the way you plug it into the into the projector is, oh, there's an Apple TV in the room and you just find it.  Bob McBob poses an interesting point.  He says he's got a USB point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you saying that the USB is only for power?  Maybe there's some other stuff going on there.  A camera.  A camera or mike?  Mike.  Oh, yeah.  Essentially.  Maybe.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.  We'll find out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're going to get one.  We're going to take it apart.  We're going to put it under the microscope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're going to get it to reveal all its secrets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're going to waterboard the damn thing.  OK, Chromecast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  Now you're talking.  You're right.  You put a Kinect-like device with a camera and a microphone, and now I can talk to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, there's this too.  OK, Chromecast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Play House of Cards.  Yeah.  That's what the Kinect does.  I got my...  What's that?  Oh, the lead.  The lead.  The lead.  The lead.  The lead.  The lead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The lead.  The lead.  The lead.  The lead.  The Kinect does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's that?  Oh, the lead.  So have you played with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No.  I just...  And of course it doesn't work with my Chromebook, so I got to go back to my antiquated Mac.  I saw your antiquated Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we got like five of them.  They sent us...  We got overload.  Have you played with it?  I played with it on MacBreak Weekly yesterday.  I'm told that I showed my lack of ability.  Maybe because there were so many lights in here that it wasn't super functional, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is that thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It lets you gesture at your screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, gotcha.  That looks really graceful, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe that's my problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All you need to do is wear your Google Glass while doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was a dancer in an earlier life and I'm too graceful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There is a valuable thing, which is the old classic Media Lab thing, I've put that there,  where if you can actually see what you're pointing at, then you can say, you know,  put that there and move the thing from this device to that TV.  And that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, let's...  That's part of what...  Pick some stories.  Any stories?  Yeah, there's some stories.  I don't know if we want to...  The guy who brings the...  OK, this is a joke.  Guy brings a Google Glass into a strip club.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What's the punchline?  That's the punchline, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The bouncer says, that's cool.  Let's go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Enjoy.  Enjoy our lovely ladies and our fine...  There's a video of it.  ...Hogelkreis beverages.  I don't know whether it's safe or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Really? He took a video?  There's a video on there.  Well, not of the...  No, no, of the bouncer.  Of the bouncer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, saying OK, come on in.  I think so.  I didn't watch it.  I just saw the...  Get him off.  Man gets in a strip club wearing Google Glass.  Doesn't that guy look like a bouncer though?  Isn't that great?  Hey, what do you want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He fascinates the doorman with his device so much,  he's allowed into a New York strip club wearing it.  He glamored the guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's all very steady.  Does it say what club?  Not that I know any of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Quick caveat.  How much is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it free to get in?  For a night.  Alright, great. Thank you.  What is this? What do you...  Google Glass.  Really?  Oh, it's...  You what?  Like a computer?  Yeah, it's a computer.  How much do you pay for that?  Right now, $1,500, because it's like a special program.  He's actually...  He's a reporter following me around.  Yeah.  Oh, no, yeah.  No, he's got...  So it's like a... pretty much like a laptop.  Yeah, yeah.  My email, my text messages, everything.  It's connected to my phone, Bluetooth.  Oh, it's connected to the phone?  Yeah, yeah.  But you can connect it to Wi-Fi too.  You have to be...  We're going to find out this guy's a developer.  ...in a contest to be able to buy them.  Right now.  But when it comes out for the regular public,  it's going to be like $500, $600.  It's pretty expensive, this shit, huh?  Yeah, no more than...  You know, maybe the AT&T will subsidize it.  With an iPhone or something.  Pretty cool, though.  That's cool, right?  So you don't have to pick up fucking phone or nothing.  No, everything's right there.  Hello.  Yeah.  Also, you can watch movies, double-edged sword.  I don't know about movies, but you can...  What does it look like in the front?  This thing?  Right here in front.  Oh, that's a camera.  So you can do video chatting and stuff like that, take pictures.  Yeah.  So they see it from your eyes, from what you see.  What do you think?  It's pretty cool.  That's good, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thanks, man.  It's good, man.  Go in there.  He has no...  The guy doesn't speak English.  I don't think he...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Leo, I just had a terrible flash of Scoble getting a lap dance.  Oh.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh.  It's romanticized.  That's hilarious.  The guy's like, oh yeah, cool, man.  Enjoy your night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, just shows you the high security environment that a New York strip club is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's like, oh, you must have a lot of money to spend on the girls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Come on in.  That's right.  Would you like to visit our champagne room?  Come on back.  Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Transcript:  Are we going to see Nexus 10, a new Nexus 10 now that we've got a new Nexus 7?  I wondered that.  No, that's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I wonder how well it sells.  It looks horsey.  Yeah, horsey.  It's horsey.  Horsey.  Wouldn't it be amazing if Google goes primarily to the 7-inch and Apple goes primarily to  the 10-inch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think everybody's going 7.  Let me check my updates, see if 4.3's out yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nope.  No, I'm not either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Grrr.  We haven't even mentioned Google's second quarter results.  $14.1 billion in revenue, net income in a quarter in three months of $3.2 billion.  They missed estimates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They missed estimates.  And with all the announcements today, hold on here, where is it?  By the way, just to show you how...  Google stock.  Yeah, Google stock's down.  Down 10 cents, and Apple stock is up 5%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because Apple exceeded estimates.  It has nothing to do with anything except that...  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're friggin' estimates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How did you do compared to the estimate?  I don't understand it myself, but that's why I don't buy stock.  I'm not going to talk about the Moto X once again.  Because you can't.  Once again, I will say nothing.  But this is the last time I don't have to say anything.  No, that's not true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, that's not true.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  It's not Thursday.  It's August 1st.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's the first day.  Speaking of which, I tried to...  I sent Guy Kawasaki, who you'd think is Mr. Google+, a message on Google+, never got  a response to see whether I can get an invite to the New York event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's right, because the unveiling's in New York.  Yeah, you should be there, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me send a note to my friend Guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See if I can get you in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, we got to get Twig invited.  Will you wear Google Glass?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How much that cost you?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We don't have a time, and it's a Thursday, so...  Are you going to be in New York?  Dang.  No, no, I was just wondering if I could be around the show.  I may not be around the show.  I may have a family thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sadly, I won't.  If I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, here's a headline I love.  I'll CC you there, Ria.  Oh, thank you.  Mr. Jeffrey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  NSA says that it can't search its own email.  Only ours.  That's under other.  Wait a minute, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait, wait, was this the onion?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's the onion?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, these were FOIA requests, and they asked for searches of email.  We don't have that capability.  We have to go to the NSA to have it search the NSA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We saved it all into our AOL file cabinet, and we cannot search it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's just bizarre.  Isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They have no sense of irony.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's no central method to search an email this time with the way our records are set up, unfortunately.  Oh, that's intentional.  Actually, I would guess that that is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's, you know, if you can't do it, you can't respond to your FOIA request.  I don't have the capability, so they intentionally flipped the switch.  You saw, we talked about it on Security Now, the memo that went out to all the Department of Homeland Security,  staffers.  Did you see that?  It said, the Washington Post has published a top secret slide on its website for the PRISM slide.  This is the one that they published, the new slide that nobody had seen last week, I guess.  Whatever you do, do not click on that link, because if you do, you will have upgraded the security clearance of your computer,  and you'll have to report it, and you could get in trouble.  So even though this has been published by the Washington Post, and everybody's seen it now, it's still top secret.  And so by looking at it on your computer, you would be triggering a whole thing.  You don't want to know. It's a mess. So don't.  That's weird technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because the computer would automatically detect that that's content that was marked top secret.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, of course not. But you just have to tell them, because you did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a protocol. It's just nonsense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I thought there was some kind of crazy invisible layer of technology.  I was like, do pixel matching for top secret classified documents? I mean, how would they know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it does say top secret on it. You know, the way this was written, I should...  Bruce Schneier had this on his blog. Let me see if I can read it to you.  And you tell me. Schneier on security is at schneier.com.  Let me scroll down to that story.  Bruce Schneier.  Oh, he's wonderful. I love him. And he's been all over this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, like it's too late in the... too far down, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, here it is.  Sent Thursday, July 11th, 2013.  I have been advised that this article is on the Washington Post website today  and has a clickable link titled, The NSA Slide You've Never Seen That Must Not Be Opened.  This link opens up a classified document which will raise the classification level of your unclassified workstation  to the classification of the slide, which is reported to be top secret.  This has been verified by our mission partner and the reason for this email.  If you opened on your home or work computer, you are obligated to report this to the SSO  as your computer could then be considered a classified workstation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Honor system.  Honor system.  Let's report it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you could be subject to administrative or legal action from the government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a threat to your systems.  Your tax dollars at work.  Oh, unbelievable.  It's unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, so there's all our stories.  Verizon Fios rolls out a 500 megabit tier.  Tom, you're getting the 500 megabit, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Half the speed of Google and four times the price.  $299 a month for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are we paying for it, Tom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, apparently we are.  Why not?  You'll enjoy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, we should pay for it.  We're using it.  We'll pay for the amount that we use.  Just send us a bill.  And David Cameron has announced in the UK that everybody in England is going to be banned from porn.  You have to opt into porn.  Now, talk about a privacy violation.  You have to identify yourself as a porn user?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, this by the end of the month, he says all the major ISPs in Britain are going to be filtering your feed for porn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if you want it, you have to say so.  They're going to give you a little switch.  But the default is no porn.  That's what the argument is about.  So what the government is going to do is they're going to give you a little bit of a switch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what the argument is about.  So what they have previously done is what they call active choice, which means you've got to say, filter me or don't filter me on sign up.  And now the government is arguing that the filter me checkbox should be checked by default.  So if you do nothing, you will see no porn.  And there's a whole bunch of other nonsense wrapped up in this as well.  This is much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The funny thing is that the home safe porn filtering system that one of the ISPs in Britain uses is made by China's Huawei, which is owned by the Chinese military.  But they know they're porn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They know when they see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's right.  My my my colleagues at the Open Rights Group in the UK have been very strong on this and do well over the media explaining why this is stupid.  But it's still a challenge.  And I think a lot of it is actually just there was a leaked letter from the prime minister's office to the ISP saying we're going to make this announcement.  We don't have to change anything.  But we're going to say that this is this is a new policy and that's OK.  Right. And that somebody leaked that like two days before the speech.  They're basically trying to get the Daily Mail to pat on the back and get the Daily Mail started a campaign to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Exactly.  I think it's mostly because they don't want people to see Page three of the Sun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, no, he's asking that said no, the page through the sun is still fine.  It's like what?  There are good breasts and bad breasts.  You got to decide which one is the truth.  Wait a minute. Very strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  David Cameron said I will never support a ban on topless images on Page three of the Sun.  I will never. I cannot support that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So there's a lot of stupid conflating going on here.  So there's there's some structural stuff that they that tracking down images of child pornography and prosecuting people who create them and all that that is going on.  And as you go for a while and all the all the Internet companies cooperate with interpol and people on that that is being conflated with blocking children from seeing pornography.  Right.  And they bounce back and forth when they're talking about it and make it very, very confusing.  And this is one is this is evidence of a crime scene.  And then the other is these.  This is adults behaving consenting ways.  And can you limit people's access to that?  Yeah, that's that's much harder.  And then the third one is, oh, and then we want to turn on filtering by default on the Internet so that children don't accidentally stumble across things, which is, you know, there's there's a sort of mythical piece of that.  But they're all being like tied up in a in a incoherent not by the media.  Did you follow?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is going way off our topic, but that's what we do.  Louise Mensch, former MP, New York.  I caught one part of a Twitter conversation where she went, I get to be wrong and don't sue me, Ms. Mensch.  But it seemed to be saying that you can't eliminate rape from the net because it's a common fantasy of women.  It was it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So.  Well, there was there was a part of this was saying already.  And child abuse photographs is are banned because they're crimes.  We should ban video of actual video of rape from the net.  And that's that's that's fair enough.  That's also evidence of a crime with if that's what's going on, you should use that to prosecute people.  That's reasonable.  But then it was.  And then there's and you should ban depictions of rape.  And then it gets then it gets into like dubious territory.  Then you're banning, you know, part of the collection.  The poor point was fantasy.  Right.  But that's the but the argument I think this came because there was a rather horrific child abduction rape murder that happened in the UK.  And the judge said and he was watching these videos on the Internet that inspired him to do this, which that old argument.  Right.  So then there are a bunch of people in the UK saying we need to make sure there isn't videos that show this this kind of thing.  But then you get into the problem of which of these if they are actually children, then it is already illegal.  If they're adults pretending to be children, it's legal.  But OK, it's kind of sorted.  But there's there's lots of that out there.  And it gets into a very messy conversation very, very quickly.  And it's not no one in the UK has been having a very coherent conversation about this.  Now that they are trying to put on censorship by default.  And this has been a problem already with mobile phones in the UK.  Mobile phones by default have some kind of filtering on because I bought a SIM when I went over there and found I couldn't get to flicker because it was built it out.  And you have to ring them up and say, can you turn the filter off, please?  So, yeah, there's there is some some structural idiocy there.  And it needs to be shown up for what it is.  But it is very hard because they are using their conflating.  You know, they're using these horrific child rape cases as their hope that they hang the rest of this off.  Don't they know the Puritans left England?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is why it's so difficult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As soon as you start censoring, it just becomes a mire.  That happened before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So there is there is a censorship list in the UK that was designed to block images of child pornography.  There is a blacklist that is that the ISPs sign up to use run by the IWP, I think.  And last year, there was a court case where they were trying to block a pirating site and they were forced by the government to add the pirate site to that list.  So they've already done the well, you're already blocking the porn.  So you should be able to block the pirate site. Right.  So that slippery slope has has slipped. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The slippery slope has slipped.  It's slotted.  We're all sliding downhill now.  Let us let us wrap things up.  It's time for Gina Trapani's tip.  Jeff's number, my tool of the week, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Gmail, people who use Gmail's Web app, if you don't like the new compose window, which is that kind of that small window that shows up in the bottom right hand corner of your of your screen, you can now expand it and go full screen with it.  You'll see that there are little arrows to expand the the window and it'll fill your page.  And then if you want to keep that your default, that you can set it as your default as well.  There's an option there in the bottom right.  So for those of us who don't like typing into a tiny little compose window, this is a nice upgrade for for Gmail users.  I think this is rolling out now.  I see it in my account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Full screen compose, full screen compose, whereas it's an old technology new again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who wants to see all those windows in the background, all that?  Little I don't listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can't constrain my emails, man.  I need full screen to express myself.  No distraction.  Jeff, do you have a a number of the week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I got one, which is Google is going to pay six hundred thousand dollars to provide free Wi Fi in 31 San Francisco parks.  And we've got Google was going to try to provide Wi Fi across the city.  They never got a contract.  It's a mess.  So it's a step in that way.  But I say, why San Francisco?  Why don't you go to New York?  We're nicer.  Isn't doesn't everybody have one pocket?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was in Washington Square Park.  Have free Wi Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We got some.  We have some brand park.  Brand square.  Yeah, that's good.  And then I was to a shout out friend of many tech folks, Jeff Pulver, who helped start the industry, who does the one forty conference.  Other things founded Vonage show exactly decided that he wanted to bypass the bypass.  He was going to gastric bypass.  And he reports now he's lost 93 pounds, 10 inches on his waist.  He can do one armed push ups and he can actually play basketball with his kids.  So I just want to give a shout out to the nicest guys on earth and give him a shout out to Jeff.  Good for Jeff.  It's great.  Yeah.  Everybody go to congratulate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's got a new startup.  Yes, he does.  What's that about?  Is it under what's the group?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's some kind of group company working thing, but I think it's still stealthy business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Business to business.  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Meaning I don't know what tip I should I should do.  I found a program.  I thought this was kind of cool called CPU Z.  This is a free program that will give you I was I was trying to remember what was in the what was the process.  In the in the Nexus seven CPU Z is a very handy little app that we've had on PCs for ages.  But we'll tell you all sorts of internal stuff about your hardware iPhone.  I'm sorry Android phone or Android tablet manufacturer motherboard display and hardware IDs Android version.  But also information.  Oops, it crashed.  Information about battery life screen resolution DPI.  It's a it's a very handy little program and it's free CPU dash Z.  And you can even see a processor which processors are working.  I kind of like this the sensors thing.  It's really cool.  The sensors I don't know how well you can see this in a Galaxy S4.  But remember the Galaxy S4 has all sorts of weird sensors.  You can see the sensors respond.  What did I do?  Did it crash?  It went dark.  You can see the sensors respond.  You can see it here too.  As we move things around and so forth.  I guess this is a little bit of a crashy progress.  Funny because I've been using it for a while and haven't had any crashes.  But the Galaxy S4 has humidity sensors.  It has the weirdest set of sensors ever.  So I can see for instance that it's five hundred forty nine lux of light in here that the relative humidity is thirty three point eight percent.  It's twenty five point five degrees centigrade.  As I rotate things it shows you the real time rotation.  The magnetic field we are it's thirty seven point two micro tees.  Whatever that is.  Isn't that what?  Look at all the sensors on this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The NSA thanks you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  This is all stuff frankly they could be gathering.  They could know that it's thirty nine point five percent relative humidity in my armpit today.  So just in case you want to know what they know.  Here's all that information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right.  Well you tie that into Chromecast and it's going to target the ads and give you a deodorant ad.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On the TV.  Oh your humidity is very high Leo.  Yes.  Yes.  CPU load.  You can see how each core is operating.  It's actually kind of fun because you can see the clock speeds go up and down as the CPU responds to demand.  The CPU clocks down and all these all these arm CPUs are responsive to the amount of work that they have to do.  Sometimes they even shut themselves off.  CPU Z.  It's free.  All right.  All right.  I've got one.  Yes.  Jeff Mark.  Kevin Marks.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Go ahead.  So my tip is very simple one.  There's a site called defund the NSA dot com.  Yes.  There's a vote today that's amending the defense appropriations bill to remove the funding for the NSA to collect telephone call records under the Patriot Act.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It would just be the phone records.  But hey that's a start.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well not just the phone records but all the stuff that they like their giant fishing expedition expedition stuff.  No I thought it was just the phone.  Wasn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because he's not defunding the NSA which by the way has a massive top secret budget.  Right budget.  Yeah.  I think this is sunset.  It's one of the it's only sunsetting the domestic phone surveillance.  I don't know what it is.  But yeah go defund the NSA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So basically what you need to do is go there put in your zip code call your congressman and say please vote against this.  And you've got to do it on the phone.  No emails no no twitters no emails no twitters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gina, you could have hacked this out in 10 minutes.  Admit it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's pretty simple.  But, you know, it does take some time.  It's all you need.  Hey, you know, you could watch TV or you could make a name generator, you know?  You just need a linked list of names.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's easy.  All right.  Fabrizio Smash.  Hey, thanks for joining us.  I don't know how we got to this loop.  It's your fault.  It's my fault.  We appreciate it.  We'll be back next week.  And that's your Google Change Log.
