And today we are going to cover Google, but also some other stuff because Stacey Higginbotham, IOT guru is here.  Hello, Stacey.  Hello.  From Stacey on IOT.  And you are like going crazy because there's some big news coming out here.  And I know you're trying to cover it for your newsletter and your blog at stacey on IOT.com.  But we're going to get to that real soon.  And I do want your opinion on all this.  Also sitting next to me, Ant Pruitt.  Yes.  From Focus on Photography and Hands on Photography.  That's correct, sir.  Yes, our photography guy and our twigger.  And also here, Jeff Jarvis, professor of journalism at CUNY.  It's great to have all three of you.  Let's start.  Three and a half. We have three and a half.  We have three and a half.  Karsten now has his own light and camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's the Karsten.  He's coming to us from the Karsten Fort.  The Karsten Corner.  The Karsten Corner.  It's Karsten's Corner.  I was going to say the Karsten Cave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We should do a little Karsten's Corner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That would be a fun bit.  And now Karsten's Corner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's all this about Facebook and politics?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  New segment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's not Andy Rooney.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Come on.  Oh, he kind of is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's kind of a young Andy Rooney, actually.  He is exactly what he is.  Yeah, that's exactly what he is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's exactly what he is.  So what happened?  Zigbee, Google, Apple and Amazon walked into a bar.  This is something you would never expect in a million years.  And said, we're going to work on a standard for home connected IOT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I like how you're getting this in right before I fall asleep from having worked all day on this.  Yeah.  This is a huge story.  It is.  Well, it's a big story for the industry.  And what they're basically saying is they're going to create an application layer essentially for the smart home.  And it's going to be called Connected Home Over IP.  Which, by the way, is Chip.  Chip, yes.  Which I didn't realize until we were actually recording our show.  And I'm like, it's Connected Home Over IP.  Hey!

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Project Chip.  There will be a logo.  But this is the thing that's a little bit disturbing.  It won't be till 2021.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it won't be until 2020.  So they are not.  So what they said is they're going to build this together all as a group.  And there's great people in this group, including Samsung, IKEA, Signify, which is the company behind Philips Hue.  They're all going to make the devices.  Well, they're going to make chip certified devices.  The thing about Chip is what it looks like it's going to be for sure.  And then there's some maybes coming up.  For sure, it is going to be device schemas.  So a way for devices to identify a device.  So if it's a light bulb, it'll be like, I have a light bulb.  I can turn on. I can turn off.  I can dim. I can change colors.  Whatever a light bulb can do, right?  Right now, you have to build that individually for each company.  So if you want it to work with Amazon schemes, you build you basically build the software for Amazon.  Then you build it for Apple HomeKit.  And then you build it for Google Home.  What they're saying is they're going to create all of that is going to become standard.  This may sound really familiar because we actually already have something that was trying to do this created by Qualcomm.  And then it was co-opted by Intel and is called the Open Connectivity Foundation.  But this is but Amazon, Apple and Google never really signed up for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This was historically the problem with home automation going back more than a decade.  I would go over to the home automation pavilion at the Consumer Electronics Show.  And there was Zigbee, there was Z-Wave, and there were a half dozen kind of smaller players.  Nobody talked to anybody else.  And it was apparent to anybody who was looking at this that no one's going to do home automation.  If if there are competing standards, but you've all seen the XKCD cartoon about standards.  I'll pull it up.  But I think the is this just going to be another standard or are these guys really going to finally solve this tower of babble?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes and no.  So yes, that this is a way to solve a lot of the issues that plague the smart home.  I do think that this is going with all of these players.  I do think this is real this time.  Now we finally basically said, oh, this is how we want it to work.  We want all of these low powered devices to have access to IP networks and talk to them directly.  But mostly they're going to go through a hub, whether that's a Google Home or maybe it's a smart things hub, whatever.  So that's that's the core of what they've decided is it matters.  This is radio agnostic.  So it's going to there.  They've already shown this sort of thing working over like thread over Bluetooth, thread over Zigbee radios.  So this is going to be radio agnostic all at the application layer.  The question then really becomes.  If you're like a manufacturer of devices participating this, where is your innovation going to come in?  Is it going to come in on the like dumb on the light bulb or the door lock side?  Because the software experience, the basic how things work together, that's now going to be taken up by the standard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's what people sell right now.  Here's the CD. How standards proliferate.  I should point out this is 10 years old.  This is this is nothing new situation.  There are 14 competing standards, 14 ridiculous.  We need to develop one universal standard that covers everyone's use cases.  Yeah, soon situation.  There are 15 competing standards and that's that's the risk here.  The other question, Stacey, is why would Google and Apple and Samsung do this?  They up to now they've been siloing their own efforts because they didn't want to interoperate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because they realized that it sucks.  Right now.  We've been telling them that.  They're finally like, oh, we can't build this just like the mobile ecosystem with the two players and people getting control and us making lots of money.  We're going to have to redo this.  So that's that's basically what happened.  And I think getting Apple on board was a big deal.  And I don't know. Let's see if you've seen it.  But basically, Apple this morning, open sourced home kit.  What? Wow. What is on?  It is on GitHub.  So let me let me pull my GitHub thing and drop it in the home kits protocol.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it their own thing?  Well, it or is it not even at the protocol layer?  It's not it's really a way of managing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, they call this a protocol, but it's technically not a protocol.  This is actually going to be it's a data schemas.  It's open data schemas.  So for people don't know what a schema is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a description of the it's like a protocol.  It's like a protocol.  It's the description of how you describe things so that we all agree that this is how you describe a switch.  Is how you describe a light so that you can understand one another.  XML is a schema.  So there are HTML is a schema or has a schema.  It's not a schema by itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's a good step forward.  I have to say I am highly skeptical.  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I well so I and I just stuck the Apple the GitHub repository that was loaded uploaded last night.  So that's a big step.  You don't see Apple just like throw in their stuff around usually.  This is stuff you used to have to pay for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What you know, why would you be skeptical on this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, because these companies are hereditary enemies and they've never worked together up to now.  And as soon as you know, this is how standards processes work.  You get these big companies in the room.  They think they start thinking all is going to be great.  We're going to it's going to be benefit everybody.  Customers want it.  We want it.  Then it starts to let's write the protocol and Samsung says, well, you can't know.  And then Google says, well, wait a minute.  And then and in a year and a half, they're all going to go screw you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they want to do their own thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They don't buy it that they really want to work together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess. So let me ask Stacey, let me understand before you get all skeptical, which is your your mode, Stacey, if this actually if Chip actually works, what's possible that wasn't possible before?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I could buy like, yeah, so I buy a light bulb today.  I have to choose like if you're a light bulb maker, let's let's do it this way.  I can buy.  If I buy a light bulb today, it's a dumb device.  And if I wanted to work with Google, Amazon and HomeKit, I actually have to build a hub to handle all of that.  Right.  And so I have to buy the hub for those light bulbs.  Right. Now, if I get a chip certified light bulb, the idea is it will work with HomeKit, Google or Amazon's ecosystem, any other chip.  So what does that enable for the companies?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. So consumer.  Absolutely. For the companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The companies they don't have to.  They well, so here's the thing.  They won't have to spend the software development effort to make things for each individual ecosystem.  So there are like three or four.  Like there's the three main ones, but there's also like Samsung SmartThings or IFTTT.  So now you no longer have to work to that.  You just work to one standard.  It should theoretically.  This is kind of like the flash of IOT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, God.  Why would you do that?  Why?  All that promise back in the day.  No, no, no.  Okay, I'll give you a really simple example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When you drive up to a gas station, you have a full expectation that even if you go to Esso, Esso, am I dating myself?  Sitgo, Sunoco or Sinclair.  Or if you go to a gas station, no matter the brand, that the pump nozzle will fit into your gas hole.  Right.  They will work together.  That's a standard.  That's a standard.  In a way, the schema would be the description of, well, the nozzle should be this wide, this long.  The flow should be this fast.  This is right.  And that's that's called interoperability.  And you have to have it.  And if somebody like Shell came along and said, well, no, we want we're going to make a deal with GM that only their cars will work with our gas nozzles.  Both GM and Shell like electric cars.  Would suffer electric cars like Tesla.  Yeah, right now there's multiple charging centers.  Well, charging centers, but we're moving towards a standard CCS that everybody will adhere to eventually.  Right now there are a few outliers like Tesla and Nissan, but everybody's going to be CCS.  But so for some reason in home automation, this never happened.  And I mean, people have tried smart things.  Wasn't the smart things hub designed to get through Zigbee and Z-Wave and everybody?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it was designed to bring all the radio protocols together.  That's where we thought this was going to happen.  We thought this was going to the hubs brought the radio all the different radios together and the application layer was going to be handled by all join way back in 2012 when that was created.  Then it was going to be handled by IOT.  Then Google when they did weave and thread, that was their hope there.  You see the problem here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And Apple has their thing right home kid is their own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They never said that home kit was going to be for anyone other than Apple.  But that was actually a big deal when they launched home kit in the MFI program for like home devices.  They they went through a very gradual process of being like at first they were like there must be a hardware chip inside and all the people building for this.  We're like, Apple, we love you, but that's just impossible for us to build.  That's that's crazy. I'm not going to make two light bulbs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So they moved to a software format, which is much more doable.  Now, I got to point out what Apple has posted here on GitHub is merely a way for people to build home kit compatible devices.  So it's not chip compatible devices.  I want to point out it's it's to get people to make their light bulbs work with home kit.  So I don't know if this is maybe they've never put it on GitHub before, but this is really this is just a development kit.  This is an STK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you had to buy that first for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So they're giving it away with something that they bought before.  And by the way, you have to do it on a Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you don't. Well, I was like, you have to do it.  And so you can only see this in Safari, just like their keynotes.  But what they're doing here and this is again, they just announced this.  So talking to people who are involved, there is no Windows version yet to point out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I don't know if there ever will be.  And they use homebrew for Linux and Raspberry Pi, which is not kind of how it works.  So that's a package manager not commonly seen on either platform.  So it's a Mac ish. So yeah, I mean, this is it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're not promising the standard yet.  They're promising it for later in 2020, you guys.  So that's like so far away.  And getting these guys in the same room in agreeing to do this.  Apple issued a press release, which is really rare for them, especially for not having something.  So they're serious. But getting all these guys together was hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's going to be the laggard, by the way, that promotes this the most.  They have the most to gain. Amazon and Google have the least to gain.  So, of course, Apple's going to be, you know, I would I think you could argue home kit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I look at it. I'm looking at your skepticism and I get it, but I don't necessarily want to be totally skeptical about it.  But the first thing comes to my mind is the revenue share.  Is this going to be a quarter, 25 percent, 25 percent for each person?  Oh, no, no, no, no, no. This is all open. This is just a standard.  There's no revenue. This is this. There's no revenue. There's no company here.  Part of the problem. Well, no, but even everybody can make it.  There will be a time. But far as the amount of time, R&D wise, going into the standard from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've already did the R&D. So that's also really good here.  This is I'm a little optimistic because they're taking pieces that have already been built and they're trying to shove them together in a way that works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And everybody agrees. Is it more Zigbee than Z-Wave?  Is it more home kit than Zigbee? Is it more thread than that's what I'm hearing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My hunch is it's probably dot dot and the thread stuff that we've seen.  So thread and Zigbee got together to create something called dot dot.  And that is a schema associated with devices.  And so I think most of that's going to be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you're this is you've been covering this field for a long time.  So are you optimistic about this, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm optimistic that we will come up with a standard.  I'm very concerned about what this means for innovation and business models going forward and how I mean, on one hand,  creating a standard is good because it does make things interoperable and it sets it gives you a baseline to which to build on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like having an operating system. It's something everybody agrees on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, yes, because that drives us forward.  It's not the way I thought it would look or I hoped it would look.  But I'm like, OK, fine, let's do that.  And now I'm I'm trying to see how it's going to affect the different players.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's kind of like VHS Betamax. We're now saying, OK, we're all going to standardize on VHS.  The money, the revenue opportunity is not in making VHS tapes.  Actually, there is an opportunity there because there's a standard.  There's more of an opportunity if there's different standards.  And it's much better for consumers, but also better for movie companies, because we now have an existing platform.  So when you build that Hue light system or the Signify light system or you build a doorbell or something,  you make sure it's compatible with the schema that's chip compatible.  Right. But this is that scheme is going to be pretty high level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is very high level. And that's the next thing.  We had been competing on like if you're a door lockmaker, you've made a connected door lock.  Most of them look pretty much the same. Right.  You've been competing on your software and you X layer and what this could do.  And we're not sure yet, though, because, like, for example, in home kit, you have to be able to add a device to the network,  to the home kit network without having to download the app from the original device manufacturer.  Right. Apple did that to make it easy. It's unclear if this will require that.  Right. So you may never have to make an app, which means there's going to be tons of really like low value kind of devices running around out there.  And maybe the innovation all happens like at the the AI UX level above that.  But that's where Amazon and Google have a pretty big stranglehold.  So it's that's where I'm like, they have an ecosystem stranglehold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that's the problem. If you go Google, then you're going to get a Google Nest Hub Max and you're going to get a Google Nest camera and you're going to get a Google home doorbell.  And you go because it's the ecosystem. If I can mix and match, that's not good for Google.  That's not good for Apple. That's not good for Amazon. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you will be able to mix in. Well, you'll be able to pick what you'll be able to do whenever your assistant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. But that means they don't have a lock in. So now, well, there's another way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They have a lock in at the assistant way. So here's where the value lives now.  The value now lives at like, hey, if you have all this state data from locks and blah, blah, blah, what can you do with it?  So maybe Apple innovates around privacy and security. Maybe none of the state data your devices share goes beyond Apple.  Maybe in Amazon, you say, OK, I'm going to get take that state data and I'm going to offer you, I don't know, weird product discounts based on it.  So there's plenty of area for innovation and different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, here's another question. But is it innovation for everyone or is it just innovation for those guys?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK. And now Jeff's question. So to try to deal with Leo's chronic skepticism, what's the I'm almost always right, by the way.  You didn't know there was a threat emoji because you're not on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So see what you lose out on the way after you told me, oh, the threat emoji, everyone knows that I've been looking for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nobody uses that. You're still not on Twitter enough to see you still not on Twitter.  You jerk. I beg you. Anyway, it says anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You read here, show this thread. You don't need a thread freaking picture of thread.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It says also a newspaper emoji. It's a nice newspaper emoji. I use that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm looking. There's a newspaper emoji. What does that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What does that mean? I discovered it from their spiegel. OK. Of course there's a bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I'm looking at the Germans showed me. I see no emojis.  There's a question. Yes. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The hack need heart. Hearts are everywhere.  So here's my question. Stacey, what's the what's the market penetration of smart home stuff?  Are people holding back because it's just too confusing, too much? Right.  Do they all is it is it a rising tide question that they're at a point where they're hitting the wall just on penetration?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They are. That is the the reason why they've hit a wall or one of the reasons why is it's freaking difficult.  You do not know how many times someone says, Stacey, I want to buy a video doorbell.  Which one should I buy? And then I have to follow up with, do you have an Amazon Echo or do you have a you have a template out?  Yeah. So it makes me really glad I never built the utterly impossible flow chart that Kevin and I have talked about for years.  Like if I have this, what should I buy? Because it was just too difficult.  And this does away with all of that. Maybe not all of it, but a lot of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I miss Stacey Mitchell. You and Mr. Kevin alluded to this.  I can't remember if it was here on Twig a couple of weeks back or if it was on your show station.  But are you surprised that this standard is in is is actually coming to fruition?  It seems like you sort of leaked leaked it or maybe just sort of hinted that, hey, this is probably coming down the pipe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We said we've needed one.  And every time they put one out, we're like, yay, let's let this be the one.  But we always noted that we're like, oh, this one has Samsung, but it doesn't have Apple or this one has, you know, yeah, it's very frustrating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it's why it's why the ecosystem play works, because at least you know, if I get it all from one vendor, it's all going to work together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think also we've just hit this point where everyone thought this was going to be amazing.  And even the big vendors, when you listen to the executives at Google and Amazon talk, they're like, we are not finding compelling use cases to get people on board.  That's exactly the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You could say it's the Tower of Babel, but which I've always thought it was.  But honestly, once you start to do this, Stacey, you're one of the few people I know has really done the automation thing.  You're one in a thousand. Most people get some light bulbs and they go, that's a lot of work.  I'm one in a million. You have you just out of curiosity, though, you moved, you disassembled that whole thing.  How much of that has been put back?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Probably 20 to 30 percent. That's it.  And it was it was because I didn't.  Well, I was like, I'm going to be here for 12 months.  Why would I spend three or four days?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's fair, which is to say it wasn't vital to your life.  It was nice to have an environment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it was also my job.  I do not like I have become very aware that I was like, God, this is my job right now.  Kevin and I are doing something.  You guys are going to love it.  Everyone's going to love it.  I'll just stage it. We're testing.  We're putting all of our IoT devices on a guest network so we can actually definitively say for a bunch of classes of devices what it means to make that sacrifice.  Because everyone's like, if you have IT devices for security, put them on a guest network, not your main network.  But that breaks the functionality.  First of all, everybody's wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That is actually in besides breaking functionality.  It is no way to protect you. Most guest networks on most devices are not VLANs.  They're not isolated.  So you are gaining nothing by doing that.  And you're making it hard for yourself to access your device.  And really, the only way to do this is to VLAN it.  And then the good news, you have to put your phone on that IoT LAN so you've gained nothing.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Basically, you should really have three networks.  Even then.  A guest network.  Well, I'm sorry, three actual.  Three routers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The three router solution.  Or you can buy.  Jesus.  We tell people.  No, but that's a dumb.  The way to do it, there's a $50 box from Ubiquiti called the Edge Router X.  And it has four ports.  Each of those could be a discrete VLAN.  We do it here.  VLANing is isolated.  You can't cross from one VLAN over the other.  So, but here's the problem.  All my IoT devices are on LAN 1.  How do I control them?  I have to put my computer or my phone on LAN 1.  LAN 1.  Now you're right back where you were.  You're the guest.  By the way, I have two networks in my house.  I don't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  And we're doing it so we can show people.  Why it's dumb.  Well, not just why it's dumb, but if you really want to do it, here's exactly what you're  going to lose.  Because sometimes that is hard to figure out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why do you have two networks in your house, Leo?  I have Comcast Business and Comcast Consumer.  Oh, just okay.  In our fine neck of the woods, I don't know where it is.  The Comcast Consumer has a one terabyte per month cap.  Yeah, I know.  Do you know how long it takes me to use a terabyte of data?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Finding that out the hard way myself, sir.  It's awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  These guys are so messed up.  And then, so I have a business class, which is a lot more expensive, but has no cap.  Right.  And so I try to, you know, to V stuff up.  Why not just have the business?  Well, I probably should.  It's nice to have two networks.  Yeah, back up.  But the same company though.  You know when Comcast goes down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's not as awesome.  Yeah, when Comcast goes down, they both go down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it doesn't really help anything.  In fact, it just adds to Lisa saying, which network should I be on?  Well, right now I'm on one.  Maybe you should, it's just not a good, I'm lazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why.  That cap surprised me.  It really did.  Oh, isn't that awful?  Really?  It's like a magic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, like 50 bucks a gigabyte.  I can't remember what it is, but they end up getting their money out of you.  That's for sure.  So, all right.  I'm only skeptical because it's easy.  It's like a marriage.  It's easy when the romance is, the love is on the bloom and the blossom.  But you get these big, it's like a marriage with 10 people in it.  You know, it's not good.  You get these people in the same room and they start saying, well, wait a minute.  No, we're going to do it this way.  We're going to do it that way.  I've seen these kinds of standards committees.  This is a tough thing to get done right.  And especially when each party has their own economic dog.  Depends on how much motive they have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who has the most scan-in and who's going to, you know, come out on top?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think this is a different animal.  I do think we're going to get a version of this that will work.  And I think we're going to get a version of this that will work with a lot of smart home devices.  I think what it is going to drive is innovation further up the stack.  And I think we're also going to have to redefine our stacks.  Will this help security?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Will this help security?  Will this make it?  Because this is, and I'm going to get, I want to take a break and then get to this ring story, which I think is the biggest BS story of the year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh my gosh.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank you.  I feel like there is a concerted effort.  Some PR, some dark PR company is saying, and I bet you it's financed by Google.  Let's take down ring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, because Google had this happen to them.  We'll talk about it because I wrote about it and I even wrote about a fifth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Biggest BS story of the year.  It really is.  And Vice, shame on you.  But okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh wait.  Maybe we're talking about a different BS story.  Well, there's two BS stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a police story, which I think is little more legit.  That's more nuanced.  Okay.  I was like, that's legit.  There's the one about Santa Claus talking to the eight-year-old in her room.  Vice just did a big article today on all the security flaws with ring.  The biggest BS story of the year is pissing me off, but we'll get to that in a moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't wait.  Is this going to help security?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The answer is maybe.  We don't know what they're going to put in enforce here.  So it's hard to say.  Originally, Google, Google's contributing weave to this.  And originally, we've had some security implications or aspirations, I should say, where they would say, hey, if you're a refrigerator, you never have any business talking to the front door, which means if it saw, if the hub saw a refrigerator trying to talk to the front door, it would quarantine it or flag it.  Right.  So it's possible.  And then I will also say, even if it doesn't have baseline security stuff as part of, I'm going to say the word again.  I'm sorry.  Everybody drink schema.  Schema.  What it what it will do is it establishes a coherent way.  Things are supposed to work that you can secure to, if that makes sense.  So now we've basically said, hey, all doorknobs are going to be this size and look roughly this way.  So now you can build locks that work for them.  Right.  That was kind of a weird analogy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because that is a problem.  It's certainly now thanks to all these stories about the ring door, the ring cameras, I think on people's minds is who IOT insecure.  And that's that's got to have to be kind of directly addressed.  So I would imagine that'll be part of what chip is all about project ship.  You know, maybe I've I've been around too long, Jeff, but I've seen this.  You remember IBM and Apple were going to do an operating system company called Taligent.  Remember?  I mean, I think this is a million.  We've been around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was going to think through the the hit parade of standard settings.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's I just we'll see.  I hope one can hope.  Because I could tell you right now, in fact, Stacey, I want to set up a time with you at CES so we could spend and I could spend some time.  You could show us the IOT stuff.  I bet you that'll be big.  That's still the big problem is these guys.  You know, you can get that, but you got to get that because that will work with that.  But this won't work with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I'm curious to hear how those conversations are going to go in the booth.  I you know, or if you're getting strong, armed into make sure you only buy this one here and this one here because it's all in the same booth.  Don't buy next door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sitting with about two thousand dollars with a hue stuff in my Amazon cart.  I'm just waiting because I was.  Whose fault is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're going to be so you're going to be fine with the hue stuff.  The real.  I'm all in on hue because I got hue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  So that gives Phillips a big or signify a big leg up.  Because I already have the hub.  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so in that hub, many people miss this.  But back in April, hue said it was back.  Yeah.  This last April, hue was like, hey, everyone, by the way, your existing version one hub is going to break next April.  It won't work anymore.  And then they also said as part of that.  And any hub we sell you is only we're only going to support it.  It guarantees support for the next three, three to five years.  I can't remember if it was three or five.  And I was like, well, that's so short.  But that's just the hub, not the gear.  Although they're making no promises on the gear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. What if they change the protocol and now I have to get all new lights?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if a device in the connected, the chip people are not making any promises, they do say that your existing stuff will continue to work.  They many devices should be able to work with this.  They're not saying this officially.  They're just saying, hey, we've got a standard really goes to die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Doesn't it, Stacey?  Well, that's where the scenario of Samsung say, no, you can't do that.  Then we'll work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know it's possible.  So if you have enough computing power, it works over the existing radios, which are the hardships to put in there.  If you have enough memory and processing power, which you will in hubs, what's going to happen is you'll see the hubs likely happen.  Obviously, this is so new.  You'll see the hubs be updatable.  Right. So your echoes and whatnot, because they have the processing power and memory.  And then when you buy new chip compatible devices, those will work with that hub, with your existing hub.  Your existing gear is still going to like, especially on the low end, low power kind of stuff that may not make the transition.  Some of it might like thermostats have a lot more computing power than you might imagine.  So they could theoretically do it.  Does that make sense?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what I think the reason that these companies are doing this is because Leo has twenty two hundred dollars with a few lights in his basket and is is willing to push the buy button because he doesn't trust that this stuff will all work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, that's the key here, I think.  Yeah, Stacey, what are the numbers on on on penetration of a smart home?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Depends on who you ask. And it depends on what you're measuring.  So if you're measuring digital assistance, the devices that you add in to want to control.  OK, talk about something for a minute while I look at the latest data because it seems like everybody's just one in lights to automate.  That's the most the most prevalent smart home devices, actually security stuff.  So security cameras are the number one.  And those are actually pretty high penetration in terms of sales and because people tend to buy more than one.  So in households, that's what I don't recall off the top of my head.  Smart home security systems, I think, are around 30 percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, the second most include doorbells as well as cameras indoors and cameras outdoors.  Right. And that's makes sense. I have a ton of that makes complete sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Lighting is actually like number three behind things like energy efficiency.  So I would have switched that around.  Oh, now this is saying let's see what they're measuring.  IDC says 69 percent of U.S. households now own at least one smart home device.  That does include that's IDC data from September.  That includes AV stuff like speakers and even smart television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So smart television, smart TVs. Yeah, that's a pretty broad brush.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can't buy a dumb TV anymore.  So the penetration of speakers is at 26 percent.  Monitored security 17 smart thermostat 14 percent. Video doorbells 12 percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's interesting.  I mean, I would love to have I get why he was great.  I have a motion sensor control on my I can when I go to bed, I say turn off the lights and the whole house goes dark.  I love that. I want to put them everywhere.  The big expense here is outdoor. We have 11 outdoor lights around the house and I want to replace those with Hughes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because half of them are working anyway. That's going to really add up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's it's fifteen hundred bucks. A lot of their price, $129 each.  So it adds up. Yes. And then I want to get the sink with the TV.  Uh huh. The toy that Kevin, the Kevin, it's cool.  I want the color. So when I'm watching. Oh, the when I'm watching the ambient lighting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I thought you were talking about a kitchen sink. I was like, yeah, I thought so too.  So we have these lights that go behind your TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then when you're watching Westworld, it all goes the color of the scenery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That ambient lighting would be changes to be pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Kevin had a video is pretty cool. He likes it, right?  He does. He still loves. Do I have to get I'll get the light, the bar lights.  But do I have to get the sink to how do I get the TV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't see the sink. The sink. You need the sink for the TV.  Oh, you can't buy the sink on Amazon. I had to buy it from Best Buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh my God. Again. Oh, and standards. Again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Standards. Again. And by the way, it'll be on Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I don't understand why it's not everywhere where you buy one of these.  It says works with Amazon's Echo.  I mean, that's that's part of the cell. Also home kitten home.  But that's part of the cell is that you could talk to Echo.  Actually, I love it that I could either I could choose Google or Amazon to talk to.  And now you.  Let's take a break and then I'm going to talk about the biggest BS story of the year.  I want I got a few candidates for that.  I didn't bring my popcorn, but you can and you guys could talk me down if I'm wrong on this one.  I just there's something doesn't smell right.  Maybe it's you. I don't know.  I'm doing a shower. Doesn't smell right.  This came from the gym. Our show today brought to you by Metallic.  I always think, oh, I love Metallica.  No, not the man that the band Metallic from Commvault.

It also fixes poor backup performance, which can slow your whole network down.  Metallic offers default storage available through Azure, but you can also bring your own.  It's very flexible. It could do backup recovery and migration on prem.  It could do it to the cloud.  There are a number of different products, including Metallic core backup and recovery, which protects physical drives, virtual servers on premises and in the cloud with comprehensive backup and recovery for VMware, for file servers and Windows and Linux, even Microsoft SQL databases.  If you've got an office and you've got to protect that data, Microsoft Office 365 backup and recovery protects your mailboxes, your contacts, your calendar items, no matter where they're stored, whether it's OneDrive or SharePoint Online or Exchange.  Or, you know, and you have unlimited Azure storage, unlimited retention.  There's Metallic endpoint backup and recovery, which backs up desktop and laptop data to protect against deletion, corruption or ransomware.  You need this now.  Secure data with encryption, with geolocation, with remote wipe capabilities.  You'll be up and running because it's SaaS. It's so easy. There's no installation.

With a one year commitment, your first three months are free. But act now. That trial is running out.  Metallic.io slash twig. We thank Metallic so much for supporting this week in Google. I don't know.  You know, I've been covering tech for a while and there's just something weird in my opinion going on.  Starting, I think, with the Vice article, how Ring went from Shark Tank reject to America's scariest surveillance company.  Moral panic.  Today, we tested Ring's security and it's awful. This, of course, with all the news stories everybody saw about the Ring cameras in a poor little eight year old Alyssa's bedroom and some jerk posed as Santa Claus.  Played Tiny Tim tiptoe through the tulips and said, destroy your room. Destroy your room.  So if you read Motherboard's article, and I like Motherboard, but I think somebody just got to Vice and said, it'd be nice, it'd be convenient if you would destroy Amazon right now.  They basically say, well, here's what's wrong. Ring doesn't tell you if you're using a password that's been uncovered in a breach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does anything do that?  Google's Chrome now does, but that's about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Chrome has a plug in and now they've put it in Chrome.  That's the only one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that is the only one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a pretty high bar, Motherboard.  Okay, it doesn't require you use two factor.  Does anybody?  A lot of things don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Most things don't. So this is, keep going, but I'll get to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I feel like they're setting a higher standard for Ring.  Now, admittedly, and this is what Motherboard should be writing instead of this.  Listen, if you're going to use any IoT device, don't reuse a password.  Here's the have I been bone database.  But even then, get a password vault.  Doesn't have to be our sponsor last best, but get a password vault.  Generate a unique password each time.  And for crying out loud, turn on two factor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would be more helpful for readers.  I've been saying that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why are we blaming Ring for security practices that are universal?  Right.  Yeah. And these stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, don't say moral panic because I might have to throw something at you because this is not really a panic.  I have a visceral reaction to you shouting moral panic.  It's like me shouting.  I don't think this is moral panic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think this is actually aimed at Ring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's not just aimed at Ring.  So in April and then again later in the year, NEST had the same thing.  A bunch of what this is, is I feel like I blame local news.  What is it?  It's very easy to come in and do these scary stories.  And it has a good visual of sad parents that they have a visual of their kid getting yelled at.  It's scary.  And every community has one because everybody reuses their passwords.  And they pick the hackers are going to pick the most popular devices because it's going to give you the highest ROI on your investment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's great if you can get into somebody's camera and watch them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the best thing about these like the NEST cameras, they've got microphones and speakers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you're really messing with people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.  So that's one.  This is I hate the reporting on this.  I have and have yelled about it for years.  The other thing, and this is where I want to take the story forward because this is what I do.  We actually have hope on the horizon in the form of California's new privacy rule SB 327.  Now, we may not have it doesn't have to go this way.  But in that rule, they say two things.  One, you can't use a default password on devices.  Great. And to any connected device has to have reasonable security features.  Do they find that they don't?  But they do say, well, they don't define it because they don't want to say it's one thing when it's when they want it to evolve with the times.  But you can't prosecute somebody if they don't say because it's too vague.  Yes, you can. So the AG is going to make a case.  So this is how laws work.  This is how this works.  All right.  In with reasonable, they're taught they say that you need to be cognizant of the type of data that the device has access to and how the impact of it basically if it got out.  So I argue that the California AG could make a really strong case that all devices going forward that involve a camera in the home have to have multifactor authentication required.  Because you may not need it for your light bulbs, but for a camera where you can see what's happening and people can talk to your kids, that feels like it should be required.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you know why companies don't do that? Because it's a grave inconvenience and people will hate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People will hate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A lot of calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or it.  Yeah, a lot of calls to tech support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the way, there's one other thing motherboard complained about.  And you've seen this with Gmail.  If somebody logs into your camera from an IP address you don't normally log in.  They're saying Ring should let you know.  Now, Google does this, but most things don't.  Most people don't.  I've never seen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, but here comes the next part.  This is what's great about regulations.  I know Jeff will talk about this, but it sets a baseline.  And once we start getting that baseline, companies are going to be incentivized to make this easier for people.  As long as everybody does it, then they're not at a disadvantage.  So what happens if they do face authentication, which is already on your phone.  You're trying to log in.  So one of the multifactor things could be free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, you don't.  You.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I know, but I'm just saying in the PR standpoint.  No, you authorize it also.  Well, OK, they could do a fingerprint.  A lot of LastPass does this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A lot of my most secure apps now, including the Brave browser, if you want, will if you've got biometrics on your phone, will give you an option.  My bank does that, too, to use Face ID if you're on a Face ID phone or Touch ID if you're on a fingerprint phone.  I think that's a great feature.  It's a very low.  It's easy for consumers because they just hold it up or they touch it.  But it gives you much more security.  It's easier than passwords.  And it's easier than it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's easier than an authenticator.  So I feel like once we start to see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But a lot of people don't have these phones, right?  What if you don't have that phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you don't have that phone, you're going to have to go for a password.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But we just talked about how the industry wants to increase the market share out there.  And then we're now talking about a huge dampening on it by making it more difficult.  And I'm not disagree with you, Stacey.  I think the industry needs to do this together.  But you know why they're not doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they have to be made to everybody's head.  Yes, it's a pain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the rules will make it so they get to do that.  Because once you say everybody has to do this, then they're like, okay, well, they've been incentivized right now for like features like ease of use.  But once you force people into like security, then you're being forced to make security less painful.  And we're going to see cool stuff.  I promise you.  I have faith.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  So in a way, Jeff, what you're saying is kind of what Stacey's saying.  She'll get mad at me when you say moral panic.  It's what it really is, is this is link bait.  This is this is this is this is this is a great article to write today.  But which is everybody's aware of it.  And we tested ring security.  It's awful, which is actually a completely terrible headline.  If they hit, but it's link bait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If they posted a story that said Ring Central has all of these security features that could help you out.  Let us walk you through setting it up versus put in this actual story down.  Which one are people going to click on first?  That's right.  By the way, it's not Ring Central.  Not Ring Central.  So our sponsor, our former sponsor, Ring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sorry.  Yeah.  I mean, I always turn on two factor and I certainly try to educate people to turn on two factor.  And I also try to tell people not to reuse passwords, but plenty of people in my family reuse passwords.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In fact, they also I have a you should maybe phone them and be like, I don't want to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a friend that works for a security company back in Carolina.  And I asked them about it.  I said, are you all mentioning two F.A.?  Are you mentioning VPNs and things of that nature to these customers that are buying these security systems around the house?  And they bluntly said, no.  Why not?  Because people just don't really care to listen.  Yeah.  They just don't.  They just give up a real hard sell.  Yeah. They just don't care to listen.  They are a security conscious company.  So, of course, they have all of the signs in the yard and, you know, you want to protect people from coming in.  But we also want to talk to you about securing your network and securing your devices.  And they have tried.  But people are just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I go on the air almost every day, every week on the radio show and say this.  But you're right.  It's probably going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And we have to internalize that our online lives are is worth protecting as much as our physical lives, especially as our physical lives move online thanks to IOT.  So we're still like I think in probably 10 years, people will finally have internalized it enough where they will.  And we'll also have easier things than two factor or than the current versions of two factor.  But yes, it is right now.  People people who think nothing of like my in-laws, they think nothing of not going upstairs after dark because their alarm system's on and there's a motion detector and they're like, everybody stay in your room.  It's more secure that way.  But they won't actually do like two factor to access their cameras.  Right. And I'm like, I joked with someone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I said that if I have a conversation and mention VPN to someone, they will look at me as if I talked about using a slow shutter speed.  Yeah, you should just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What every conversation I have like that.  Yeah, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, the good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I guess it's also what's that's kind of what makes me mad about this vice piece.  Just as you said, here's an opportunity.  People are suddenly aware, thanks to local TV news, that something's going on.  Here's a chance to say, well, here's this isn't a problem with ring per se.  It's a problem in general.  And this is what you need to do.  And I don't see people doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've done it for years.  Well, everybody on this panel asks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I know.  Here's here's a source of always good reporting, good journalism.  I'm a big fan of Jessica Lessons, the information.  And I have to say, Amira, Friday and their team always get the get the goods.  Here is a scoop that says that Google's brass has set as twenty twenty three a deadline to beat Azure and AWS.  They want Google Cloud to be number one in three years doable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the way I saw this headline right under a headline that said reports are that Google is cooling on the cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, well, or B.S. I trust the information.  I'll be on. They got great sources.  I wonder how you do that.  You know, I think it's a smart target.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just throw money in it. You got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the kind of thing that it's like the New York Times saying we're going to hit 10 million subscribers.  The only time saying we're going to have 300000 subscribers.  It's something you try to motivate staff with.  We're going to be the biggest. It's something Steve Ballmer would have said loudly.  Right. Right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's it's your rallying cry to motivate your staff or to demotivate them and be like, do this or else.  There's nothing wrong with this, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just no. It's just it's just motivation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's an impossible goal because Google is just that's right.  I'm sorry. Did we not want me to opine? No, that's exactly right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's an impossible goal. You said it. That's what I was thinking.  All right. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's also maybe it's part of the Thomas Currian era now at Google Cloud.  I mean, this is he's from Oracle.  This is the first time we've really had a hard driving enterprise business person bringing Google's cloud ever.  So maybe I don't think they'll make it, but they're in a better position to deal with some of their stupid googly things that bite them in the butt when they try to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Now, now that Paige is kind of taking a backseat, Sundar's in charge.  Here's the time where you want to say, OK, let's get this stuff.  We can get more serious if you will.  Here is a great command. I wish Siri and Amazon had this.  The Echo had this. It's a Google command.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I didn't know about this. I didn't either.  You didn't either. Oh, OK. It wasn't me. I tried it out and it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you have a Google Assistant and it gets triggered by accident, which happens to me all the time, not just with Google, with everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It happens to Jason Howell quite regularly. On the show.  Oh yeah. Poor Jason. I sent him this link earlier today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But also it happens with Apple. Siri to me an awful lot.  If you say after this false trigger, hey, Google, that wasn't for you.  It will stop and delete the last thing you said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I didn't realize it deleted it. That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Isn't that cool?  And it's frictionless. I saw that first, but I saw that follow this link and I thought, wow, this show is so great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I learned all kinds of useful things. That's a great tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. So you're in the throes of love making.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wait a minute. And something sounds like, hey Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you say, spank me, spank me, spank me. And Google starts talking.  You say, hey Google, that wasn't for you. It will delete that.  I'm sorry. I do not understand that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It wasn't for anyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. I wish I could just, hey Google, delete those last few memories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wish you could out of your own mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey Leo, that wasn't for me. Delete.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That wasn't for anyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Alright. Was that a bad image?  Facebook says it is going to comply with CCPA. CCPA is going to end up being a very interesting.  It goes into effect January 1st.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How different is it from GDPR?  If you're already complying with GDPR, are you ready for CCPA?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No. That's the short answer.  The short answer is no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me look it up. I want to actually look up the essentials of CCPA.  I don't know all the details of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And by the way, before we pat this California assembly on the back,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  there's also AB5. I don't know if you saw this Jeff, but SB Nation has started firing California freelancers because,  hey sorry, but AB5 prevents us from hiring you.  We entered the gig economy for my journalism students. It's hell.  Ant was going to be at CES not for us, but for, can I say this? Tech Republic.  Lost a lot of money.  Wow Ant. I'm sorry.  Vox Media cut, so Tech Republic, same thing, because you're in California now.  Vox Media to cut hundreds of freelance jobs because of AB5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And to Tech Republic's credit, they did not want it to go down this way.  Tech Republic clearly wanted me to cut them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But we've gone to our HR, we use ADP for HR, we've gone to them saying, because the laws are constant.  California is tough.  So their job is to keep track of all this stuff and advise us on what we can and cannot do.  My son wanted to be kind of a freelance employee of Twit and we said, you can't.  He's a full-time salesperson now, but he wants to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The impact on journalism, just to pick one of many, many fields that use gig economy stuff, is horrendous.  Yes, it would be nice if we went back to the days when we all had worked for the same company and the company was good to us for 40 years.  But we are not in that economy.  And it's making it up and it's demonized a structure of work.  We're looking at the journalism school.  We have to prepare students more and more for being independent, resilient journalists who are going to make money through freelance, through YouTube, through Medium, through Kickstarter, through Patreon.  Through books, through all kinds of stuff.  They're going to have to catch together a living to support what they do.  And this cuts off a huge piece of that and might make it impossible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I look at this from both perspectives because one of my former employers is a PEO.  So I was able to see a lot of the professional employer organization, which handles small to medium sized businesses, administration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I see. So you're actually employed by them, not by the company you work for.  Oh, TryNet. That's how I do my business.  TryNet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Microsoft does this with a lot of its employees. They're working for a third party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Really?  Yeah.  Even big Microsoft?  Yeah.  A lot of companies do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When I look at it from both perspectives as the business owner and also as the IC, independent contractor, I get where the business owner is trying to cut their costs because they have to pay that FICA, FUTA, SUTA and all of that.  All the benefits.  That's a ton of money that they have to spend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like 25% of what we pay you.  Right.  An additional 25% is going to be benefits or more.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a lot of money.  But then on the other side, you have that independent contractor that was saying, man, I really need those benefits.  They should have me as a W-2 employee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I think that was the intent of this is for Uber and Lyft drivers mostly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. So I see it both ways.  But my point of view was, man, I really like being able to just say, hey, I'd like to write for Tech Republic.  I'd like to write for ZDNet.  I'd like to write for whomever because I'm a gun for hire, if you will.  Right.  And you were making the living doing that.  And I was making a nice wage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The problem is that Tech Republic doesn't want to employ you as a freelancer because you're now living in California.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're like, man, we got to make you a W-2 employee.  And I'm like, no, I don't want to do that.  You know, I'd said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, so that's interesting.  So they would have continued to employ you as an employee.  So where a lot of people are losing their jobs is companies like Vox don't want to do that.  That's most people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why I said I give Tech Republic credit because they wanted to work this out.  It's just that you didn't want to be an employee.  I didn't want to be an employee here.  Right. I'm here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's already got a W-2 job.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And so what happens is a lot of money.  So at my school, because they're so scared generally with the IRS about trying to get around employment stuff, we can hire somebody to write a piece for us.  And we get required to put them on the payroll.  And what that means is we've got to pay 30, 40 percent of whatever we pay them to benefits they'll never get.  That's correct.  If I could food a Suda.  If I could food a Suda.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've never heard it sound like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm like that's fun.  I know what they are.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Social Security.  What's food a Suda?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Those are the state unemployment and federal unemployment.  So that's the bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's the good.  This is AB 375.  The California CCPA, the California Consumer Privacy Act.  These are, according to Wikipedia, the intentions of the act to provide California residents.  This is somewhat like GDPR to know what personal data is being collected about them.  Know whether their personal data is sold or disclosed and to whom.  By the way, those are those are the first two points I've always said these companies need to be very clear about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And those are both in GDPR.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You need to be able to say no to the sale of your personal data.  Now what they don't say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Define sale is the problem, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But what they don't say is if you say no, do you continue to have the benefit or service?  And I think it's also reasonable for the company to say, well, sorry, but that's how we monetize.  So you can't have Gmail or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  GDPR actually says that you can't denigrate the service quality if someone says no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I think that's not recognizing the exigencies of business.  If I can't monetize you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is Europe versus the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it is.  Point four point four.  And this is a GDPR point as well.  Residents need to be able to access their personal data.  I presume that means access the data the company has about you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  GDPR also allows you they like to access and have a process for correction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Correcting it.  And that also point five request to business to delete any personal information about a consumer collected from that consumer.  That's GDPR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which is kind of ridiculous in a sense in the sense of can you tell Amazon to delete all the things you bought from Amazon?  It's a hard one has a legitimate business reason to have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. It's a hardship for companies because yeah.  And finally, and this is one that's a little bit like what you were saying, Stacey.  California residents cannot be discriminated against for exercising their privacy rights.  Does that mean you have no it actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is really interesting because this this reminds me I don't know if you remember AT&T used to say hey, we'll charge you less if we can monetize your data and we'll give you a gigabit service.  They're saying you can't do something like this.  You can't basically you can't turn privacy into a luxury.  Interesting. Good.  Which I think is it.  I mean, that's very pro consumer in really weird that it made it in there.  And that is not in GDPR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I cannot disagree with any of those six points.  It applies only to businesses with gross revenues, annual gross revenues in excess of 25 million or and they or these are any one of these three buys or sells the personal information of 50,000 or more consumers or households.  I presume that's California consumers, but I don't know.  It is.  Yeah. Earnings more than half its annual revenue.  How do you know?  Well, probably it's in the law.  I'm just reading a summary by Wikipedia.  Earnings more than half of its annual revenue from selling consumers personal information.  Oh, you mean how would the consumer know that?  No, how does the company know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If the consumers are in California?  Yeah.  They don't.  That's what makes this law so interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and that's why Facebook is saying we're not going to change our web tracking in response to this law because we're already compliant.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The attorney general just last, was it last week?  I think it was last week they had one of their last information sessions where the California attorney general is having these information sessions where people are welcome to come talk to them about enforcements.  So it's important to say that nobody knows how exactly California plans to enforce this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just like GDPR. We were waiting for the other shoe to drop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And we don't like GDPR created these data authorities.  This doesn't do anything like that.  So like if I were a consumer, I would file a complaint with my local data authority here.  I don't know if I file a complaint with the company, if I just call the AG's office.  So it's unclear how like this is going to like how a Californian can be like, I want to see my data and I want it all deleted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, so Facebook is saying, well, we don't sell the data.  So we're exempt.  Well, they don't sell the data.  They don't sell the data.  They sell ads against the data.  Yeah.  So maybe that was a that's a loophole.  The law needs to close.  I know it's no longer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We go back to bad reporting over all the years is that they've always been portrayed as selling the data and they never have.  That's their secret sauce.  And neither does it.  I mean, actually, Time Inc. would sell the data on you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  AT&T sells the data.  Yeah. But but people who sell advertising like Google and Facebook keep the data and use it to sell ads because that's their that's their that's valuable.  They're not going to give that or sell that.  That's Facebook.  So also, starting January 1st, get ready because websites will have to start putting a button on the front page saying, don't collect my data.  Do not sell my personal information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is this the same thing as the we now accept cookies?  So you must click here.  Well, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, this sounds more dramatic.  It says you may not sell my personal information if a consumer clicks that button.  According to the Wall Street Journal, the site is barred from any transaction that sends data to third parties and selling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Probably. That's just so.  So what's that?  You know, that's good.  That also could have a huge impact on the LA Times.  Mm hmm.  So programmatic advertising.  Right.  How is that going to be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it doesn't send.  Does it does it send data out about users or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  In a sense, yes.  When you go to a product programmatic trading floor, you say, I got somebody who likes shoes.  And the trading floor says, OK, I'll pay you this for them.  OK, they're yours.  Right.  That's an exchange of data.  I mean, who knows how this interpreted in GDPR.  Your IP address is considered personally identifiable information.  That's how ignorant the lawmakers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's ignorant because, of course, it's public information.  Right.  And it's necessary information.  Right.  Yes, by the way, Facebook has told advertisers its trackers data collection doesn't constitute  selling under California law.  So it doesn't have to put that button on.  Facebook maintains publishers can adjust settings to block its web tracker called Pixel from  transmitting the data of users who have opted out.  Because, of course, a lot of publishers live on Facebook and they would then have to somehow  do the same thing.  Businesses already have the ability to manage whether they send data and how they send data  to Facebook through Pixel.  OK, so I get the Attorney General's office has declined to discuss enforcement regarding  particular companies.  So I presume.  Well, you got to think Facebook's counsel has had some conversations already.  I would expect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I guess that does make sense, though, if Facebook is just presenting a data set  and not actual individualized data points to advertisers.  I guess that's the thing.  Yeah, I mean, they're just sending over pie charts.  We had this many impressions today from this group of 20 to 40 year olds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff, you said you sounded like you thought that was selling data.  Well, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, is that what the law is it really selling data to do targeted advertising?  No, no, I don't think so.  It will.  Will they will the law consider it?  Well, that's a chance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, fair enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Danger, danger.  Are you involved in this oversight board?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I have been at full disclosure time.  We raised money for my school from Facebook.  I received no compensation from Facebook or any platform personally and independent of them.  And full disclosure, I got invited to with many, many, many people.  They did. They did huge sessions with other people to input sessions about the oversight board.  And I know the people who put it together.  And it's I've got to say, I'm very impressed with the structure.  I've written about this at some length, saying that I think they've got to go another step in terms of having a North Star for why the company exists.  And what the oversight board is going to tie its oversight to.  But in terms of thinking through the independence, the organization, the operations, they've done an amazing job.  And most every critic they come against does give them that credit that they've really done a good job of this.  Proof will be in the pudding.  We shall see.  They haven't named they've got to name two important groups.  They've got to name not only the oversight board members, which will amount to about 40.  They're going to name the first 10 to 20.  And then that board is going to recreate itself and name the rest from then on out.  But they're also naming a trust.  So the trust got one hundred thirty million dollars from Facebook to fund the work of the oversight board henceforth.  So Facebook will not be writing any checks to the oversight board or anybody on it.  They'll be paying. Oh, that's interesting.  That's out of the trust. Yeah.  And the trust is set up.  This is what they really thought this through.  I mean, think about Facebook.  When you get down a couple of levels, you pretty inevitably deal with really smart people who are trying.  They get they get frustrated by some things their company does, but they're really pretty amazing at that level.  And so the trust is set up such that it is an independent body and it could accommodate other companies wanting to do the same thing.  If Reddit came along and said, we want to have an oversight board,  then Facebook has already set up an independent legal structure that could do it for them.  So it is it is a separate entity.  And then there are bylaws within that that say how this operates.  Now, the bylaws say that once the oversight board makes a decision, no one, including Mark Zuckerberg, can overrule.  So I'm fascinated.  Well, you know, could Facebook say, take down that Donald Trump ad?  At first, they're not going to do ads, but it is going to expand to that.  The bylaws also say that Facebook can't fire anybody.  The the the trust can fire somebody.  And there's a set of cause for that.  And so it's a really interesting experiment in a form of Internet governance.  And it's kind of in loco regulator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Good. And one hundred thirty million is not an insignificant amount.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they already spent tens of millions on this process of study and outreach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We don't know any anybody of the first eleven on the board, do we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that nobody been named? No, nobody's been named publicly yet, nor have the trust.  He's been named the there, the a a an accountancy firm or a trading company.  The BBM, not a BBM, that's the other one, is acting as the trustee as a as a  corporate entity right now, hired until the trust is in place.  I had lunch with two people who were doing all this work just the other day.  So I was hearing the latest.  Again, people I like, people I respect.  Once the trust gets going next year, they're going after other tasks at the company.  They were there to set it up and to get the input of academics.  Well, if you're really interested in this person, I would follow his woman named Kate  Klonik, K-L-O-N-I-C-K, who was a law professor at St. John's in New York.  She has been independently embedded in this process and she's writing about it for the New Yorker.  She's going to write about it elsewhere.  She's she they gave her access to the entire process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's see. What else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What other stories?  Stacy is seeing anything you really want to talk about.  I'm just looking through here.  I feel I've been overwhelmed by the things we've already talked about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So yes, I was giving you a chance to recoup all of the apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They spoke.  You had it. You had it.  You had major work at the beginning of the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stacey, really all the heavy lifting after a major day.  All the apps.  Well, I'm sad.  I'm sad that on top of everything else, you know, so Trump has a trade deal coming along with China,  which, you know, the nick at times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In the nick of time, saving Apple a considerable amount of money.  The three days before the Sunday, those tariffs are supposed to go into effect.  Fifteen percent tariffs that would have been a significant amount of money on Apple products, including the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But we just found out the USA USDA has taken Wakanda off as a free trade partner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wakanda was on the list.  Wakanda was on the list.  It's one of those. I put it on the list because it's kind of those geeky moments where they're testing out the software.  They're trying to get in countries to see how it works.  And they include somebody included Wakanda.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wakanda!  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Isn't it?  It is awesome.  They're all doing this.  Wakanda!  Wow. That's of course the mythical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We no longer have a free trade deal with Wakanda.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The mythical land in the Black Panther comic end movie.  No vibranium.  New Orleans hit by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A short vibranium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  New Orleans hit.  We don't know by what by some sort of cyber attack.  It's kind of I shouldn't make it.  I shouldn't laugh.  But on Friday about 11 a.m.  In City Hall in New Orleans, the PA system came alive and said, turn off your computer, unplug it and step away.  They were so worried.  Apparently they were under attack spear phishing attack.  It's unclear whether they got hit by ransomware or not.  Although I did see a story that said that there were there were fingerprints of Rio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Rio ransomware virus is very, very popular these days.  And emanating.  They were being submitted to virus total, which is I think it's Google's virus repository.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Doesn't mean they were infected.  The fact that it got bit by ransomware means they were getting re-accent to City Hall.  It looks like City Hall.  It's sort of continued on.  Officials said crucial public safety services were up and running, but City Hall offices will fall back on to pen and paper.  But again, that might just because they turned the system off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're like, ah, what's happening?  You know what?  That's that's my daughter's response.  That's actually what we trained her to do when she was younger.  You see weird stuff on your computer.  Run and just stop what you're doing and get us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would say unplug it right away.  Anyway, that's what they did.  They said this is what our federal law enforcement told us.  Our federal and state partners said that's what we should do.  And that's the way we've been trained to respond.  So we just unplugged.  Shout out to them for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They might have saved.  They actually might have saved something.  You know, there's been dead silence ever since.  But as far as I can tell, they've been able to run as normally this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You remember how pet you?  I mean, not just bread.  I mean, my goodness, they saved themselves from something like that.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  So I've got a fun story here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  So Greta Thunberg was on was on a train finally going home.  Her slow boat to Sweden and she was on a German train and she posted a picture  just saying finally on the way home, she's sitting on the floor of the ICE train  going through Germany.  That's all it was.  Right.  So then, by the way, I see sure she's looking at the window.  The Chinese food there.  It's great.  She's just the most amazing.  So then the German Rail Company posted.  Well, you know, you were in the German Rail Company.  Well, you know, you were in first class.  I hope they took care of you.  Well, they first they apologized.  First, they apologize.  But then they then they deleted the tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And first, they tweeted, Thank you, dear Greta.  Thank you for supporting us railroaders in the fight against climate change.  Right.  We're happy that you traveled with us on Saturday.  But it would have been even nicer had you reported how friendly and competently you  were looked after by our team at your seat in first class.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So then she came back and she said, I wasn't complaining about anything.  And she wasn't.  She was absolutely right.  Oh, she said.  One of my trains, two of my trains got rerouted and there weren't any seats on those two trains.  And then I did get a seat and I didn't say anything.  So then it's just the perfect German story now.  It's the perfect German story.  So now the privacy regulator is looking into this to go after the train company for revealing  that she was in first class.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Isn't that just perfect?  The Germans, the Germans.  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nice transition there.  That was nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I enjoyed this flag.  Oh, get ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now that Kevin's on the board, anything can happen.  Fellow passengers also, by the way, violating German's privacy laws, said she had been accompanied  by her father and that the Deutsche Bahn staff had given her little slabs of chocolate with  the word Lieblings Gast, which means favorite guest, favorite guest, which are normally  given to passengers in first class as well as second class passengers in the event of  long delays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's a Liebling Gast.  I want to interject.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There was also a journalist along.  And so the journalist confirmed her.  And by the way, last week, this is really minor, but Dietzeit, which is which is phenomenal,  the smartest publication in Germany and really innovative, really great.  So they had one of their staffers take off their Twitter, take over the Twitter feed  last week.  And he was hilarious.  He was talking about the Germans.  The Germans are arguing about sugar.  They always argue about sugar.  Now the Germans are finished arguing about sugar and they're getting along again.  I want to interject.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was a little hand there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know what was going on.  What was that?  That creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Y'all, y'all aunt is trying to interject.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it was this my second episode of Hands On Photography.  I ended the show by saying it's not about the megapixels.  It's about the story.  And when you look at this, this image right here, what story is this image telling?  Hold up here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I had the.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Took it down.  So that's why it came off.  That's why they reacted to her.  I said, Hey, yeah, you were in first class.  That picture is telling a whole different story.  Well, but then she was she responded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I wasn't in first class the whole time.  This goes back and forth.  She'd only been able to sit in a seat after Göttingen more than four hours into her journey.  Göttingen.  Göttingen.  After and for two hours before having to change in Hamburg for a further connection towards Scandinavia.  So she did have to sit on the floor for four hours.  But she said, that's not a bad thing.  It's a good thing.  People are using.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She was glad the trains were being used.  She was fine.  She wasn't complaining.  And and the old white men lose to her every time, every time she is pretty good, isn't she?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, she's just great.  Don't mess with a ton.  Don't mess with a.  Edward Snowden has been told you can't make money on permanent record his new book because the NSA and the CIA didn't clear it.  A federal judge in Virginia ruled yesterday that Snowden should have gone.  Oh, yeah, this will work.  Should have gone to the CIA and NSA and asked for permission before he wrote the book.  He was a previous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you see whether the advance went to him already or not?  Because the advance is where you make your money.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you know, this is a different thing.  I mean, I bet he sold a lot of copies of this book.  So he argued that I didn't put anything in there that wasn't already public.  And I don't like to be.  Thanks to me.  Thanks to me.  And I want the CIA to edit my life.  So they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So do they do do they do like a lien against his earn?  Do they garnish his earnings?  He's in Russia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What are they going to do?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they go to the publisher and tell the publisher you can't pay him.  That's right.  OK, so they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They garnish his earnings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that is a longstanding policy, not just for security officials, but, you know, tax evasion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why you've got to put your money in the foreign accounts before you piss off the government.  It sounds like the voice of experience there, Stacey.  But have you never planned to like not pay your taxes?  I just got my bill from the IRS.  I know.  So I'm like, oh, I'm so sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See, that's the freelancer's curse.  That's why AB five.  They want you to be in the system so that you have to give them money all the time.  You know, I'm OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a curse, but we have great sponsors like FreshBooks to keep us squared away.  That's right.  So is that who we're doing next?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, I was like, wow, what is happening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was a good segue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's too bad.  Wasted, wasted.  I don't know what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know what's going on.  I was like, I'm sorry, you guys.  I have very little to contribute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's do the change log.  Oh, it's a test.  It's a test.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that was good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Change log.  That was several millisecond latency.  It was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was latency.  Google had a little problem with Chrome 79.  We talked about it rolling out last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And apparently there's a bug on Android that wipes data out in some way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a bug on Android that wipes data out in some apps.  It's a complicated bug having to do with Android's built-in WebView.  A lot of apps use WebView to display web content within the app.  And apparently changes about where the location was stored.  That was updated.  And so moved data from local storage in WSQL.  And it wasn't migrated properly in some cases.  And so Google has just paused 79 for Android.  Not clear which apps got hurt.  But just something you should be aware of.  That's the opposite of a change log.  It's not going to happen log.  Google Maps is a nice feature for Stacey.  She drives an electric vehicle.  You can now search within Maps for electric car charging stations by plug type.  We're talking about the Tower of Babel with electric plug sockets.  I don't know if you can say.  Let's see.  They do have Tesla.  Chesa, Chattamo, CCS, Type 2, CCS combo 1 and 2, J1772.  You just choose your plug.  And then you'll be able to find compatible charging stations.  That was what we were talking about just minutes ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, is that a visual thing?  Because I don't know the...  I know what the other...  Because your Tesla usually comes with at least two adapters.  And I'm trying to figure out.  So they have pictures of the plugs.  Ah, OK, good.  So you recognize that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you're right.  Your Tesla has everything.  J1772 and one other.  Chattamo is the next is most common.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Could you explain this to me, advanced people.  How many different charging stations are there out there?  And can you get a plug for every one of them or no?  Tesla comes with adapters.  Can you do that for every one of them or there's some you can't use?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's some you won't be able to use.  See this CCS charger.  There's a fast charging option, which you won't be able to use because...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then what if I'm a non...  What if I have a non-Tesla?  A bolt or something.  Can I use a Tesla one?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  Tesla does not let anyone who is not Tesla...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a restraint of trade or something.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They built them.  It's their things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there's also...  I don't know how much of this is real or not, but there's voltage considerations and step  downs that you have to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, that's true.  They could fry your vehicle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  So I don't...  Tesla...  Like the superchargers, when those go, they go.  They really hum.  So I don't know if a volt could take that kind of power.  Actually, the volt can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The volt's made to use CCS fast charging, but it's a different plug.  And this is exactly what I was talking about with the gasoline nozzle.  All of this sounds German to me.  Yeah.  But I think it's all going away because as part of their settlement, Audi, VW, remember  they got Dieselgate, they have been required to build $1 billion worth of charging stations  in the US.  It's something called Electrify America, and they'll all be CCS fast chargers.  So that's the new...  I think that's the coming standard.  Obviously, Elon's always going to go with his, but the coming standard...  Let's say you have USB 3, and Elon will be lightning.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, but that's...  Yeah, it is kind of like that actually, isn't it?  There is a new button on Nest Hubs.  They're going to get a home button.  I like my...  In fact, I have my Nest Home Max here because it was one of my picks for the best...  It's my favorite smart display, one of the best products of the year.  There it is.  There's the home button.  Now, normally what we have to do, I think, Stacey, correct me because...  But I think you just say, go home.  You say, okay, move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought you swiped up or something.  I have a different one in front of me.  I move my other one downstairs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everything else is gestures in that OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, so now you'll have a home button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's kind of nice.  I mean, because some people look at that and they're like, what do I do?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's definitely the case with Amazon Echo that you can be in a state and it's not your normal home state.  You have to say, I know with Echo, you say, Echo, go home.  You're drunk.  Whoops.  And it will take you back there.  And now the final...  Oh, no, second to final story.  All US users using Android and Google's messages should have RCS enabled.  It's built in.  Okay, this is where I need your help, guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't figure it out.  I don't have it.  And hard hit.  I don't even know what you have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm so happy about that.  Really?  Hard hit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, is this why all my texts are suddenly dark blue instead of light blue?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't remember it changing color.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you, Kirsten.  I knew Kirsten would know.  Yeah, they change color like not this morning, but maybe this morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See, I don't know because I still use Hangouts because it's on the desktop.  It's on my iPhone and it's on my Android phone.  I would love to use...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, so I just got this message.  Chat features are ready.  You can now use chat features with others who have them too.  That's it.  You can turn these features off anytime from settings.  Got it.  So what are the features?  The problem was that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When iOS people text you, they can see it.  The problem was that this was something that was supposed to be implemented by individual  carriers and the individual carriers just dragged their feet.  They didn't want anybody.  They didn't want to use RCS.  So Google finally just said, fine.  Fine.  We're going to run our own RCS server and we're going to do it ourselves.  So they have now completed this a little bit earlier than they had promised.  It updates to both Google Messages and the carrier services app may be required to enable  the new chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How do I do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So wait, so Kirsten and I have a...  Update one.  What do I find carrier services?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, the fact that you see it means you're up to date.  Right, you're done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I don't see like...  You know how all your friends on iPhones, they like your text and as an Android user,  you get so and so...  Love your message.  Yeah, or did whatever.  But I don't see any cool like hearts or...  I mean, I can heart something, but I can't like heart a message.  Or maybe I can.  Let's see.  If I highlight the message...  Long press it maybe?  Yeah, I'm long pressing nothing.  I'm assuming...  And I'm doing this with Kirsten.  Kirsten, you're there.  Turn it off and back on again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We should point out that this isn't designed to have feature parity between Apple's iMessages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait, you have Kirsten's phone number?  I don't have Kirsten's phone number.  I'm not on Kirsten's need to know list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Actually, Kirsten wants your number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll hit you up, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm assuming this is Kirsten.  It might be someone else.  Kirsten is this you?  Kirsten bot.  You have Kirsten bot.  Yes, I sent you a message saying, are you okay?  Why didn't you just send me Ruak?  That's so much faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that what the kids say?  Are you okay?  I'm not well...  Ruck.  Ruck, ruck, ruck, ruck, ruck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you ever watch LA Story?  The billboard does it.  Oh, that's right.  The billboard does it.  Are you okay?  And then he's like, that's my favorite movie in all the world, you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll tell Steve you said hi.  I just said I like the movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'll amplify it for you.  I got a message from my son.  I think it was Sunday.  I was out shooting and he sent testing.  I'm like, what do you want?  You know I'm not shooting.  I don't want to answer my phone.  Testing.  And he sent another one and he says, I got the update.  I got the update.  I'm like, really?  You couldn't test that with people in the house?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got to step out for just a second to do our secret Santa, but I'll be right back.  Okay.  I don't even notice I'm gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, all right.  We're doing it.  If you want to go, you can go too.  I'll do an ad secret Santa time.  Yeah, I don't know.  There's a lot of there's encryption, which is good.  It's not end to end encryption, but at least it's encrypted in transit.  You can't you still have to do it on your one phone.  And this is why I don't use it because I want to have it on my iPhone.  I don't use it.  And I guess there's you know, there's chat bubbles and there's group chat and stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That stuff doesn't really matter to me, but you know, I get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's desperate for the small ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Honestly, this is a I think a holding action, hoping that Apple doesn't release messages for Android.  Because the minute Apple does, it's all over.  It's done.  Everybody else in the rest of the world uses WhatsApp.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I use I use all of them.  Or LINE.  Well, it depends who you're talking to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. That's the problem.  There's no one app that everybody uses.  I wish there were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I'm kind of OK with that because I've set my notifications.  So if I like I know who's on WhatsApp and I'm like, I can ignore that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it mostly Europeans?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's actually we made it.  This is actually a great pro tip for anybody who's like for schools and stuff.  We made a parents group chat for my kids class.  And it's great because you can add as many people as you want.  You don't have limitations.  And it's vendor neutral.  And we like hang out and talk about our kids and plan things and do things like you get WhatsApp's like, hey, I'm running late.  Can anyone pick up my kid at school?  It's really handy.  I wish I had friends.  I use LINE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I use LINE for my friends back home in our fantasy football league.  Because that's a Japanese app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How did that happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We started out with WhatsApp, but we enjoyed LINE a little bit more because of some of the great things that we do.  And we started out with LINE a little bit more because of some of the googly bubbliness while some of the other members did.  I didn't really care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you should probably both know then about the WhatsApp bug that wipes completely wipes out group chats with a single message.  Oh, nice.  Outstanding.  It's such a it's a causes a sweet, a sweet, a swift and complete crash of the entire WhatsApp application, which is so severe.  This autoplay has got to stop.  This is so severe that you can't return to the group chat or access any of the chat history.  So all of that all that conversation would be lost.  What's that? What's that?  Yeah, I should say, yeah, right.  You got to update.  That's the that's the bottom line.  Update your WhatsApp was discovered in August.  But they're not aware of anybody actually taking advantage of that.  What's up?  One and a half.  Thank you, Chance, the rapper.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Excellent.  That's the new end to well, and that's the Google change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's up?  That's what's up.  It's good.  I like it.  Lots.  Well played.  Stacey was out here for or down here for our best of a tweet episode, which will air, I think, the week after week, the Sunday after Christmas.  And, you know, it's a shame, Stacey, because we recorded it early.  Since we recorded it, there have been dozens of articles about the best games of the decade, the best apps.  There was a great article about all your favorite memes of the twenty teens.  And we didn't have the advantage of any of that.  But we did. We managed to cover most of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, my God. If we had more content, that show would have been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You want to know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, Mary, Mary Jo and I had to sneak out during an ad read for a bathroom break.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's why we're astronaut diapers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  GMI.  GMI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That sound was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. All of a sudden, I look back at the top apps and games of the decade from app Annie, which has been counting them this whole time.  The most downloaded apps of the decade.  Yes. Now, you guys watch it.  Yeah, that's a good guess.  But you were looking at it.  Did you know or did you guess?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's up? Oh, my God.  All four of the top ones are owned by Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All four.  It's Facebook, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp Messenger and Instagram.  And that's worldwide.  Twenty ten to twenty nineteen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look at Tick Tock coming up at the end of the.  Yeah, because Tick Tock didn't exist until last year.  Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or maybe it did, but it wasn't.  It wasn't.  Ended the decade and now it's already up there.  Snapchat, Skype, Tick Tock, UC browser, which is, I guess, used in China.  That's from Alibaba.  OK. YouTube and Twitter round out the top ten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got sucked into a Tick Tock black hole this morning.  It was fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I deleted Tick Tock because of Tick Tock black holes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I installed it and I've watched maybe two things for about 10 seconds total.  I don't even know why it's still on my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's easy to get in that thing where you just scroll and scroll and scroll and scroll and that black hole.  But they're just they remind me of my kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what I love about them.  They are like, oh, my God, it reminds me of Vine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I never really had an interest.  It's just like Vine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is Vine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And I've been trying to think about content to create for it.  And I just can't.  You guys are doing stuff.  I saw a pig in a round hole.  That's how I feel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You all did one about throwing away the puppet boxes.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a Tick Tock, which I think is a very clever handle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is a clever marketing team doing Tick Tock.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what we need?  We need Ant doing dances.  I need you singing and doing dances.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're not a dancer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am not a dancer.  I'm not either, but I would Tick Tock dance.  I know my limits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think at the Christmas party, there were a lot of people Tick Tocking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We should have done some cheesy Tick Tocks because really what you need to do is layer on the cheese.  Layer on the cheese?  Layer on the cheese.  You could do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I will try to work on that over the holidays with the family because I am clearly cheesy, according to them.  I got in a lot of trouble, by the way, with Wisconsin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Really?  Yeah.  The state?  Yeah.  Yesterday we were talking about iFixit's teardown of the new Apple Mac Pro.  Cheese grater.  Well, that's the problem.  The original Mac Pro was called the cheese grater because it looked like a cheese grater.  Right.  And this new one is even more cheese gratery.  And iFixit grated cheese with it.  Oh, boy.  Which is disgusting.  Oh, boy.  And I said, oh, that's probably cheap Wisconsin cheese.  Oh, dude.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How dare you?  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was dumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In my defense, I'm not saying all Wisconsin cheese is bad, but when it's that bright and  orange, in my opinion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's American cheese, not Wisconsin cheese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How dare you?  Orange cheese is dyed orange.  There's no such thing as orange cheese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's Wisconsin cheese that is cheap, not...  Cheap Wisconsin cheese.  What's the diff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a big diff.  They got beta-carotene infused cheese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If cheap modifies Wisconsin, ergo all Wisconsin cheese is cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, man.  I heard from Wisconsin, babe.  As you should.  I apologize.  I love Wisconsin.  I love my Tillamook.  Is that Wisconsin?  Tillamook is not here.  Tillamook's Oregon.  That's Oregon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Come on, man.  I'm going to say you like the cheese curd in the Packers and you're fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do have a cheese head.  That is bright orange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a Packers hat.  I'm sorry.  The squeakers.  Are you zooming in on me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Shame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can we get a badger running across the screen for the badgers?  Shame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That would be awesome.  Top 10 apps by revenue.  2010 to 2019.  Netflix, number one.  Tinder, number two.  Oh, wow.  Pandora, music number three.  But that's because it's been around for the whole 10 years.  Tencent Video.  LINE, your app.  IQYI, which is...  What do you pay for on LINE?  LINE is a Japanese...  I know.  What do you pay for?  The thing about LINE is you can...  You get little sticker packs and things out of the way.  You can buy a lot of stuff, including like in China where you can buy WeChat in China.  You can do e-commerce there.  Oh, so I didn't know that.  So there's a lot of money to be made.  Didn't know that on LINE.  Spotify, YouTube, YouTube.  HBO now, Quay.  That's just because HBO is so expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  15 bucks a month, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  YouTube fascinates me, but I guess that's from people running movies and shows or what  have you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's just so huge.  Well, you have the YouTube Red.  Oh, Red, duh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually have that.  Yeah.  Yeah, so I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, but I'm confused now because I got YouTube Music because Google says they're phasing  Google Music out, right?  They are.  They're phasing it out.  I'm still holding on to it.  In favor of YouTube.  Now, if you buy YouTube Music, I think you also get all the other Red and everything,  right?  You get premium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They don't call it Red anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What happens to my YouTube Music, my Google Music stuff then?  Good question.  Am I going to have to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, geez.  I tweeted them about that a couple months ago and never really got a definite answer  because people uploaded a lot of their stuff to Google Music originally.  I bought stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't want to scare people, but that's the story, right?  That's coming.  And I just reacted proactively.  Yeah, you enjoy scaring people.  Well, you enjoy scaring people.  I love scaring people because that's...  I'm a slinkbait guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't like the YouTube Music app, so I'm still holding on to Google Play Music until  it dies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's gotten better, actually.  I should have put this in the changelog.  The YouTube Music app has now added Discover Playlists like Apple and Spotify do with stuff  that they know from what you've listened to in the past.  So I think actually it's gotten a lot better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wanted to roll the family over to it, so I warned them and said, hey, go ahead and  start installing the YouTube Music.  What did the hardheads say?  And I got to them before they got to me.  I said, no, it's crap.  Don't even bother.  Just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, look.  How to transfer favorite tracks from Google Play Music to YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Connect, Google Play Music, select the recommended...  Playlist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Playlist.  They got moods.  They got live performances, new releases.  I think they're actually starting to curate this.  Okay.  That's looking bad.  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's the best way to transfer Google Play Music Playlist to YouTube Music right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Outstanding.  Is that the playlist?  I'd like to have my playlist over there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would like to have playlists twice.  What about the stuff I bought?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.  That will count.  You'll have all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Interesting.  So we were talking a couple of weeks ago about ISOC, the Internet Society.  They had owned the rights to the .org domain, the nonprofit domain.  They had initially said, well, get ready.  We might raise the price a little bit.  Then they sold it to a third party.  They eliminated price caps and then almost immediately sold it to a third party.  ICANN is now weighing in.  And this is actually good news.  They have 30 days to weigh in.  Of course, what they're concerned about is that essentially this is going from a nonprofit  equity firm, which might try to raise prices to make more money.  I like the might.  ICANN apparently is still an overseer of all this.  They initially said we don't have authority to stop it.  But now they noted that the .org registry agreement between PIR and ICANN requires the  public Internet registry to obtain ICANN's prior approval.  Somebody looked at the contract.  So thank goodness.  Somebody looked at the contract and now they're going to take a look at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So hey, that's Andrew's company.  Sorry.  Right there.  As domain name wire noted in a news story, that's Andrew.  That's Andrew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Andrew Hubbin in the news.  Whether ICANN can block the transfer using that standard might to quote Andrew.  Is it Higginbotham?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's Solomon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Andrew Solomon.  That standard quote.  To quote Andrew Hubbin.  Might ultimately have to be determined by the courts.  And that's what's up.  That's what's up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So just so you know for later use, Chance did it for hockey and then he did it recently  for esports.  It's his new catchphrase.  So after this, you can go look for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's what's up.  That's what's up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I'm going to end with this happy one.  The far side is back, baby.  Gary Larson, who very famously retired in 1995 saying, I don't want to do this so long  I become a mediocre cartoonist.  For 24 years we've been living without new far side comics.  He is set to release his first new work in 24 years.  The far side.com will feature previously unseen sketches.  But Gary Larson says there will be new content.  So I don't know if you're a far side fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am a huge far side fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This one's from 1994.  This one's from 1990.  Still no new content.  But let's hope someday.  I think Gary Larson is one of the greats.  So the far side and Gary Larson are back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Expect cows, dinosaurs and wars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is one of those things I've seen in passing but never really knew what it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it might be.  Maybe it's the Jeffs and My era.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, because I grew up with those.  I had all those when I was a kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He had just a twisted kind of great way of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My favorite is probably one of the most politically incorrect cartoons you would ever see, which  is the two alligators sitting on the riverbank having just eaten a baby.  It was like, perfect.  No fur or claws or anything.  Like one's telling the other about its feel.  I mean, yeah, it was pretty wrong.  But in a good way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But in a good way.  Sometimes I look at Gary's cartoons and I just don't get them like this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why, Gary, you've always had the power to go home.  Just close your eyes, quack three times and think to yourself, there's no place like home.  There's no place like home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's just weird and fun.  I mean, you know, there's cows watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, in the far side, everything's like there's another.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is part two.  And so he's going from a color world with Glinda the Good Witch to black and white and  had Zelda.  All the women looked like you and Uncle Bob, all the cows looked like you and Ernie.  There were cavemen that looked like you.  And there were these nerdy little kids like you, Billy.  And there were monsters and stupid looking things and animals can talk.  And some of it was confusing.  And oh, wow, there's no place like home.  I'm thinking this might be the last Gary Larson cartoon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  1995 might have been his retirement.  Anyway, welcome back.  This is this is really great news.  Oh, you you like the real reason dinosaurs became extinct and the Simpsons parody of it.  I'm going to have to do some research because I don't think I can pull it up.  One day, Wilson, I'll be sitting at that desk.  Cross the room.  And let's do one more mention of our fine sponsors.  And then I will let you guys make some picks and we'll be out of here.  What do you say?  Sure.  Our show today brought to you by the browser I'm using right now.  Love it.  Brave Brave is based on Chrome.  Actually based on the open source Chromium project, which Google's Chrome is also based  on.  So it has all the Chrome deliciousness you love.  But with none of the Googling bits, you might not like so much.  Just a few months ago, Google announced, yeah, we're going to turn off the ability for you  block origin to work.  Our ad blocker won't work anymore.  And I said, thank goodness I'm using Brave.  Brave is faster because it's privacy focused.  So it's like it's like you get this benefit.  See, it turns out if you don't let download all that extra JavaScript and the bad ads  and all the extra images and all the privacy, you know, trackers, any privacy trackers,  much better performance up to six times faster than the competitors.  Brave gives you unmatched speed online privacy blocks trackers.  It's a better user experience.  It's free.  You can have more than one browser on your device.  Linux, Mac, Windows, iOS, Android.  Get brave.  Just try it out.  It's easy to use.  You can set it up with one, you know, click of the mouse and port all your bookmarks.  Users could switch browsers efficiently.  Saves you battery life and data costs too.  Because if you're not downloading all that stuff, you also save on battery and data.  All your favorite Chrome extensions still work, although you'll need far fewer because  in fact all I've got installed on this is LastPass because Brave does everything else.  And I love this because one of the things I always feel guilty, we're an ad supported  network.  I don't want to take money out of the mouth of Tech Republic or iMore, all those great  sites I use, but I am blocking their ads.  So with Brave basic attention tokens, you can give publishers back their fair share  of web revenue.  You can earn tokens by looking at privacy, respecting ads, and then automatically easily  tip your favorite content creators in Brave.  So they get paid even though you aren't seeing the ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They don't want to bog you down any more than you want to be bogged down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can trust Brave.  It includes so many great features.  In fact, my suggestion is download it now, brave.com slash twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Immediately go to the preferences and just look at all the things it'll do.  It's just fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm using, by the way, a private window that's really private and it uses Tor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you absolutely are anonymous.  You can't say that about the private browsing in any other browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Brave.com slash twit.  Yesterday was about big tech, today is about us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Use Brave.  I do.  And I think you're going to love it.  And it's just all the benefits of Chrome without all the baggage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Stacey, what's your pick of the week this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I've got something you guys are going to like.  This is Smart Dry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Smart Dry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Smart Dry.  One of the more common questions we get on the show is I have a washing machine.  Sorry, I have a dryer and I want to know when it's done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought it was for my astronaut diapers.  Okay.  Nope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nope, it is not.  Although there's a company called Monit that is actually doing that for adult diapers and  it's a very important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, I was being facetious, but it is an important thing.  I will suck the fun out of everything.  In fact, Father Robert came back from CES and he drank a ton of water.  I remember that.  I remember that.  And his Monit said, oh, you better go to the bathroom now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I remember that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the other one, that's actually for kidney stuff?  The new one at CES will be actually detecting when they're damp so they can notify a caregiver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Will you take us around CES a little bit?  I'll pay you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would love to.  That's highly improper.  I'm just not, I'm going to pretend you're not.  A stipend.  A stipend.  No, you're a freelancer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're a freelancer.  Because we're going to be down there and not going to be down there.  We'd love to meet up and we're going to meet up with Dicty Bartolo, the Gizwiz, to show  us all the crappy stuff at the Sands Expo.  Sammable Samet, our car guy to go to the North Hall.  We're going to have a visit with, what else?  We're going to do TVs with Scott Wilkinson.  And then I would like to see Miss Stacey.  Yeah, Stacey or Kevin.  One of us will do it.  One of you would be great.  Okay.  So tell us about dry heats.  Smart Dry.  Whatever.  Yes.  So this is a sensor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's got a strong magnet on the other side and that goes into your dryer.  It sticks to the drum and it sticks really well.  I was kind of surprised.  And it detects when your clothes are dry.  And I was, this doesn't sound like a problem that many people have.  Most dryers do that, don't they?  So mine does this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But not well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My clothes are still damp sometimes when it says they're dry.  This actually dries.  And a lot of times it will tell me before I can set it up so it will warn me, for example,  if my delicates are too hot.  That's pretty cool.  That's good.  And I get a notification.  And usually it's about 10 minutes before my dryer actually says it's dry.  Oh, that saves energy.  Yeah, I can use less energy.  Lisa likes to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She has a thing, and I've never quite figured out, where she takes some of her stuff out  before it's fully dry.  I do that too.  And hang it up so it doesn't have wrinkles.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And also so it doesn't shrink and it extends the life of the clothes.  Okay, you do that too.  So this helps with that.  It's because my clothes are fancier.  So this is the full product.  There's a tiny little hub that this time is a little bit more compact.  There's a tiny little hub that this talks to this via Bluetooth.  So this needs to be plugged in close to your dryer.  And I'm going to say the one thing I hate about this, and it's because it's a it's kind  of a it's a very small company that does this.  This sticks out of your wall and it's ugly and it's big.  But they'll figure this out because basically all this is is a generic USB converter.  Right.  So they're going to get there.  But it's fifty dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you can ask Echo.  If your clothes are dry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  And it also turns your notification ring on your Echo's yellow.  Oh, this is awesome.  Yeah, it's I mean, it's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Could I set it like to do what you do you and Lisa do where it's there's still damp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  So you could set a little lower alert.  Yes.  If you set it on delicates, it will make it so they stay most like slightly damp.  Yeah, that's what she wants.  This is I mean, I don't know.  I think this is kind of I love it.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because the dryer is not nearly that smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  And it's not going to be smart unless you're crazy and you want to go out and buy a brand  new dryer.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So do Laundry Smarter dot com smart drive.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's that's my my pick for y'all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Will the Echo say Stacey, your clothes are getting dry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It will not.  But my next now that I've got this and I'm playing with it, I set it up on the Echo.  And I'm pretty sure I can do a routine where when that notification comes, it'll turn a  light.  And if so, that's going to be my effort.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good.  Pretty cool to turn my old beat up dryer that is probably about 10 years old, turn it into  a smart device.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Then the hackers can hack your dryer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yes.  And your dryer is a Faraday cage for people who are asking.  And that's part of the fun engineering they did and why they are.  This has to be within 10 to 15 feet of your drive.  OK, close.  But it's not it's not undoable.  And it sends a signal every minute, every minute, every 20 seconds.  I can't remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sorry, Dave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Your clothes are dry.  Jeff Jarvis number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What the hell?  I'm going to be sleeping with this tonight.  Jeff, your hair is dry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is that for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff is bringing the weird devices.  Micah loves this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is this better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is a sleep apnea detection thing.  Oh, nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I had to wear one one of those recently.  This is cheaper than doing a sleep study in the hospital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So now this is your nose and I got to figure out how to put it up there.  And then there's three sensors in here.  Is this the better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mine would have rubbed my chest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This one's a sleep apnea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, for sleep apnea, because it was measuring my heart.  And do you have a pulse oximeter or they did away with the pulse oximeter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they have three they have three sensors on my forehead.  Maybe that's what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's where they're getting the oxygenation from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, this was actually Micah Sargent's pick of best gadget of 2019.  One of them better B D D E R.  I don't know if this is the better.  No E R.  No E R.  No E.  There it is.  There it is.  But it or we saw that's the one you're using to the hospital or a doctor provides you with  that one.  Oh, yeah.  God knows what it costs.  Yeah, this is different.  This is less expensive and smaller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the only saw at pepcon here in San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Huh?  Cool.  Well, good luck, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thanks.  I'm not looking forward to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't want to know.  I just don't want to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you have sleep apnea, you should know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is something that takes years off.  No, I do not.  I just snore.  It's what killed Princess Leia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Isn't it?  Isn't that what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think a life of drugs and hard living and other things helped.  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I read it could be just Hollywood gossip, but that the proximate cause of her death

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  was it does create wear and tear on your heart.  It also is an indication or helps lead to dementia.  There's a lot of things you should probably get it checked out if you suspect you might  have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.  I'm just tired in the morning.  Isn't that normal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That might just be age.  I'm old and tired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just wearing down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  Six months after Carrie Fisher's sudden death, the Los Angeles County Coroner has identified  sleep apnea as a factor.  Me in the corner like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And by the way, I just want to let you know that I set Gina Trapani up with Steve Martin.  I could do the same for you anytime.  Stacey, just let me know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that he married?  No, it wasn't that kind of a setup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  His wife is human.  I'm considering it.  And I have a whole pass for Steve Martin.  She's quite right.  I had an app that saved all your tweets and he was writing a book which he eventually  put out on Twitter of all his very, very funny tweets.  And she worked with him to get that database.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't have any useful skills for Steve Martin.  I play the harmonica.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's good.  He plays the banjo.  It's a match made in heaven.  That's awesome.  Oh, King Tut.  Steve Martin.  Buried in his jammies.  Ant Pruitt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My pick of the week is advice to be mindful of your holiday lights.  Why?  Well, for in the mind Captain Jeff of the Airline Pilot Guy podcast, he flies for a  specific airline and he happened to be on a news station here recently talking about  those Christmas lights shining up and hitting the pilot cockpit.  No.  Really?  I know lasers are terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And a lot of people are using these lasers for part of their decorations now.  Oh.  So I wanted to just give a shout out to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Look at this.  When you see this, you got to think some of this is going to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Some of that stuff just pops in.  He talked about you're going in on an approach or whatever and then all of a sudden you get  flashed.  It's pretty scary and pretty disorienting.  I never even thought about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's by the way a great podcast.  I love that podcast.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I used to live right next to Charlotte Airport probably within six miles.  I always saw the airplanes coming over my home and I never even considered that right  next door to me was called Christmas Town USA, McAddenville, North Carolina, where they  have some of the largest display of Christmas lights in the country, yada, yada, yada.  I always wondered about how is that seen from above?  Then his video comes up and he's like, yeah, some of those are great but not so great if  they're shooting us in the eyes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff says that 7,000 laser hits on pilots in planes in 2019.  Insane.  Airline pilot guy show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can find it on YouTube, youtube.com slash apg show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This show is longer than ours.  It's like three hours.  Really?  I didn't think that was possible.

Transcript:  It's like three hours.  It's a coast to coast podcast.  But it's so fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love listening to those guys.  It's wonderful.  Shout out to you Captain Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think we could wrap this up.  What do you say?  Sure.  Did you have anything to contribute, Neil?  Not really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have fresh baked Christmas cookies downstairs.  Yeah, go down and get some cookies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
