Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Hello, I'm here in HD today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thanks to All About Android.  So you do All About Android, now you get a good connection.  Is that it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I know, that's it. Exactly.  Love and all about Android, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, thank you for hosting that with, of course, Jason and Ron Richards.  And yeah, you look good.  We got a special dedicated connection to dedicated hardware, and it looks much better.  We're really happy about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Much, much better.  Now I actually have to do my hair, as I was saying in the previous show.  So that's the bad news.  No, you look great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I do notice a strange object with a twit-fes behind you.  I never saw that before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, you never saw it before?  No, I'm just kidding.  It was that thing.  It got a cut.  It's my little smiley face.  It was just blurry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I didn't know what that was.  Why do you have a plastic smiley face head, I guess would be the question.  Is that for wigs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, it was just something that I had, like, as a kid.  I've had it, like, almost my whole life.  Oh, you're kidding.  It's a coin bank, actually.  It's just a yellow smiley face.  And then, you know, I thought the fez fit on it perfectly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It feels like it's haunting us.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It wasn't meant to be creepy at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You don't find the noseless smiley face a little creepy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, you know, it's just the yellow smiley face, the sort of classic cartoon.  No, it's not working for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, Jeff Jarvis is also here, journalism professor at City University of New York.  He's at home and apparently he's got a lampshade with the fez.  I'm glad the fez is being put to...

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's the Gorken fez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Such good use.  That's why we sent you...  What did we send you?  An Amazon gift card this year.  We figured, ah, we're not sending him any more garments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, we got the awesome twit mug.  The mug, that's right.  We still have it in the kitchen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We still want to do the lab coats.  Also with us, we're so glad to have him from searchengineland.com  and marketingengineland.com.  Danny Sullivan is here.  I don't have a fez.  All I have is this.  Oh, he's got a...  What do they call that?  Jane hat.  A Jane hat.  Thank you.  Wow, where'd you get that?  Android hat.  Comic Con.  Oh, Comic Con.  Yeah, I have one.  Actually, there's a long story about my Jane hat, which I guess I could do with a brief  version.  It was made for me by Kat, who had a knitting podcast for many years.  She did a show on how to make a Jane hat, made me one.  And then when Colleen left to go to Google, I said, you can have any hat you want.  And she took my Jane hat, which was fine.  And then Kat the knitter came back and gave me a new one.  Excellent.  All on Jane hat number two.  But I need a fez, clearly.  Well, I think we could arrange that.  Fezorama.com.  Item number one, Jeff Jarvis demonstrating.  I think this is an example of...  This is how people know you're in the 1%.  He bought a Google Pixel, a Chrome.  I almost did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I ordered it.  Oh, then you backed out?  Well, here's the story.  So I'm so trained now when Google comes up with a product, if I have any desire for it,  I immediately go and try to get in and get an order in because it's going to get away.  It's going to be gone.  Right.  Nexus 4, everything before that Chromebook.  Everything you wanted to get before it sold out.  So I just I'm going to get it.  I'm going to get an order in and then I'll figure it out.  I said, I want to go see it.  So I was actually at a conference, I think, last week when this came out.  And so I came back and on Monday morning in New York, I want there were there were only  11 designated Best Buy stores in the country that have them.  I go trooping across town to go to the best the Best Buy store and get in there and say,  Hi, where's where's the Chromebook?  See, they have them hidden, which is odd.  Then I say, where's where's the Chromebook?  Oh, no, no, no.  Google won't let us put it out unless the Google rep is here.  What?  So where's the Google rep?  We're not sure.  They don't really tell us when he comes in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You usually Google takes out show up when you want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I growl and I tweet nasty.  So then I called downtown to the other of three Best Buys in town supposed to have it.  And they say, oh, he was in Sunday.  You mean he's not coming in.  They are usually maybe Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  We're not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now you know why Apple, which also had Apple stores and Best Buys, I guess was CompUSA.  But now you know why Apple has its own retail presence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So so so then I go back to the office and I'm thinking, it's a lot of money.  I'm not so sure.  It is just a browser.  So I cancel the order.  Not my usual spite.  But I cancel it.  I say, I'm not I'm not.  I don't think about it.  I don't want this thing to arrive.  They have to get rid of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So good news is Biggity bong points out this cool Chromebook pixel will never be out of  stock.  That's true.  There's some really good news.  It's that I do go back.  I do go back and I meet a nice man named Roy at the Best Buy, the first and before Mission

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Best Buy when he came in.  Actually, actually, I call I call that afternoon.  I said, is the Google guy there?  Oh, yeah.  No, he's one of the lunch.  And it's a movie right here.  I'm searching for Google guy.  So so then I delayed myself considerably with meetings in school.  Would you call me?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm not going to call you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm not going to call you.  I'm not going to call you.  I'm not going to call you.  I'm not going to call you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not going to call you.  I'm not going to call you.  So then I delayed myself considerably with meetings in school, which you can do very  easily and wandered back over and Roy was there and I saw the pixel.  It is gorgeous.  Oh, yeah.  It is a solid.  It's a beautiful screen.  It's fast as can be.  You know, it's really quite nice and impressive.  But I don't know.  You know, it's thirteen hundred to fifteen hundred dollars for a browser, as they say.  But I'm using my Chromebook all the time and my Chromebook is my my old Samsung is slow  and it's kind of plastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You would be a good candidate for this if you do.  I mean, if that has become your as it I think it has your main computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it has.  And Kevin Marks was at it was at a conference last week and he said that they talked to  Google who said that I was the ideal customer for it.  They decided for you, Jeff.  Yeah, right.  That bad marketing decision.  So of course, the ideal customer can't get the damn machine, can't see the damn machine.  So I finally do.  I finally look at I'm still undecided.  I said, I want to talk about it on Twig.  So while I'm in the store, I go to Twig to test it.  And Gina, you didn't have your fine video yet.  But Leo, you look just marvelous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, well, now I want one.  The video was amazing.  Anything that makes me look good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It did.  It made you beautiful.  Marvelous.  And so and so the Roy, the Google guy is saying, was that a whole show about Google?  Really?  And so he took a picture of me doing it and all that kind of stuff.  And so then I get back and then the first time this ever happened, because I've had  other issues.  A Google PR representative came and said, Oh, I'm so glad you got the Chromebook.  It's actually no, I didn't email that she just emailed and said, well, would you like  a review?  Yes.  So I said, yes.  Good.  So you'll have that soon.  I'm still very tempted.  It is a limited machine.  It is kind of absurd, but I do use it most of the time and it is very solid.  It's heavier.  The battery is lighter.  You know, five hours on six and a half hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Who's the market for this?  It's I think it's cloud user.  I think our cloud user.  Anybody with a watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they're going to make something like 200,000 and probably give away 100,000 of  them in IO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, you think you'll get one in IO?  Maybe we should go to IO.  Pretty.  Gina, you're going IO, right?  I'm sure Dana, you're going IO.  Yeah, I'll go this year.  It would be nice.  I would.  It would be worth going IO for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know if they'll give the pixel away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They've given away Chromebooks every year, though, haven't they?  First CR 48, the prototype.  Last year you got the Samsung and the Chromebox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And the box.  And the box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think the Chromebook, I ordered one and it came on Monday.  Dana, you have one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you beat me, Dana.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I ordered it kind of as soon as it went online because I.  Which one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got the with LTE or without LTE?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, without because you can't get them with.  You can't get them with the without.  But I don't want that because I have a phone and the phone has a hotspot.  So I don't I never really understand wanting to then have it in my device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anybody who buys the Pixel should have his own LTE.  I have I think you're missing the point, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've got an iPhone and I've got a Nexus.  Have another.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Help yourself.  I think you're missing the point.  The Pixel is a no compromise solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Clearly, Leo loves it and can't wait to get his hands on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I don't want one.  You know what?  I bought same price and you're going to laugh at me.  This is a Windows 8 notebook from Acer.  Same price, very much the same hardware touch screen.  It's 1920 by 1080, not quite as high resolution.  Beautiful screen.  And I love it.  And it's Windows 8.  But so golly, I guess I could turn it into Chrome.  Well, this is the question.  Somebody said, no, no, that's not a Chromebook.  If I just promised I will never use anything but Chrome, would that be a Chromebook?  Sure.  That'd be the same thing, right?  Here's what I took on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I said that if you can't afford if you can't afford the thirteen hundred dollar Chromebook,  good news.  You can run Chrome virtually on any computer.  The difference is instant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, yeah, if you if you.  OK, you want to see how fast this turns on?  This is this is from zero to zero to full in nine seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Chromebook boots very fast.  My MacBook's boot just as fast.  My Windows 8 laptop boots just about as fast as well.  So it's not.  And the touch screen actually the Windows 8 touch screen has more support than the Chromebook.  Like if you want to if you want to pinch and screw and take something on screen and make  it larger, you can't do that on the Chromebook.  You can't if you change the flag, Danny.  And enable it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's weird.  I've been trying to do it on Windows 8 and I didn't explore on Windows 8.  It's great.  I can zoom in on anything.  You know, in fact, if you show my screen, Chad, you see I can just pin.  This is all pinching.  It's very easy to do all this.  But I have to use IE when I use Chrome.  It's not it does a little bit of it, but not the old.  There's a flag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Turn on.  Yeah, if you do do Chrome flag, there's a flag to turn on pinching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, let me turn on pinching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Touch is definitely I mean, we're going to get a map once you've used a touch screen,  as I'm sure you have, Leo, you know, you realize it's nice being able to interact with your  screen.  And I'm sure that the MacBooks are going to get there as well.  But you know, the the Chromebook for me, that one one audience is especially designed for  is everybody at Google.  It was remarkable going to Google over the years when first everybody had iPhones, right?  And then they got Android and it was almost like, great, now we can start carrying around  our own stuff.  We don't have to have somebody else's stuff that's out there.  And yet you would still go to Google meetings and the MacBooks would come out everywhere.  Oh, yeah.  Or the PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So now they'll have pixels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're going to see Chromebooks everywhere.  Yeah.  And everyone could.  But it's a good machine.  I was the biggest surprise for me really was that you couldn't change the screen resolution.  So like I have a MacBook Retina and you could take your you could use the full retina quality.  You can give up just a little bit of quality and you can actually see more things on the  screen.  You can go up to like 1440 or 1680 by 1050.  And the Chromebook is just locked down to that.  If you decide you want to see more, you kind of have to do this weird zooming thing with  the browser.  And that that kind of threw me off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But one other thing that's intriguing, you can't put Linux on it.  You can either use Kruton to do a virtual Linux on there, right?  Or you can just make it a Linux box.  And then it's not.  I mean, that's a nice Linux box.  If you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That is nice.  I didn't realize that you could do that.  I'm having a hard time imagining being an engineer at Google and working on a Chromebook.  I just I can't imagine it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's a guy in the chat room who claims he's on the Chromebook team.  And he says, I understand, you know, if you don't want to use it, it's not it's not for  everyone.  And I guess I understand Google has the resources.  You know, the problem with the current Chromebooks is they're they're basically netbooks.  They're very low end.  They're priced right.  They're 250 bucks, but they're very low end.  You know, Jeff, somebody like Jeff, a classy guy gets manicures.  He's well dressed, lives in a mansion.  He shouldn't have to use it.  250 dollars warehouse sale did very well this time.  Barney dresses himself at Barney's.  You shouldn't have to use a cheap notebook.  So what if you still want to use Chrome OS?  Why not have the best hardware?  It's not for everyone.  But well, you could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's here's the thing, Leo.  So fine, I could run Chrome on an air.  Yeah.  It's not a machine.  I've got to deal with updates.  I got to deal with other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But that's the argument is that it's complex.  There's security. You know, there's icons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, also, you end up buying software for the other machines and there's no software  to buy at all for the Chrome.  So it saves you money.  Loaded Mac is two grand.  By the time I'm done with the stuff I need, whereas here it is, it is the price of the  machine. That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And like, I mean, you know, Leo, you sent me a clean a clean Mac Mini just because nothing  else I could do the show just so that my my my my MacBook and granted, it's a couple of  years old, but it sounds like it's about to take off.  You know, the fan and the CPU is just because, you know, over the years you install stuff  and then, you know, backups and you've got all these icons, the status bar and things  are just kind of running in the background and their updates.  I mean, machines get crafty even when you're vigilant, which I consider myself to be vigilant.  So, I mean, that's that's a nice sell about the Chromebook is that it's just not your  money is going to.  You know, for me, the big sell on the Chromebook and this was the sell that that that the ad  campaign was about, right, was that it's this really cheap notebook that you could absolutely  destroy. I mean, do you remember that that that video clip of them basically let your  dog use it when your dog is like your kids like run over it, throw it into the to the  ocean and it didn't matter because all your stuff was in the cloud.  The idea of this sort of disposable everywhere device.  And it really didn't matter what happened to it.  You could buy three of them and whatever.  So the pixel to me, it just doesn't make sense because it's so so expensive.  The same time, it sounds like it's beautiful hardware.  I mean, I mean, it sounds amazing.  Touchscreen sounds amazing.  I've never taken a touchscreen laptop seriously until now.  I know there have been plenty of them out there running windows, but now I'm like, oh,  OK, this makes a little sense.  And that's just my Google Microsoft bias.  Here's what I was going to write to you right before before the Chromebook was

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  officially announced. And by the way, we did have it on the show and said, no, it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  not true. We ran it.  Actually, it's funny, Genesis, because we did run it uncritically.  We ran that silly video.  Then the next week I said, I apologize.  Right. You should have never run that video.  Clearly a scam.  And then the third week it's out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But here's the thing, Gina.  So I use my Chromebook, right.  And you're exactly right.  Two hundred fifty bucks. What the hell?  It's amazing. It's light. It's fun.  I show it off to people and I'm cool.  They wouldn't sell the Barneys, but otherwise it's good.  But then I get I get addicted enough to it that I do lust after running it on a  better machine. And and that's the problem because the Chromebook is slow.  It's plasticky. It craps out the pages.  I have to change settings thanks to a wonderful twig reader who taught me how to  do it. It's not a great it's a good experience.  It's a fine experience. It's not a great experience.  You don't expect it to be two hundred fifty dollars.  But then you can have a great experience.  Now, if this you know, then I would quibble.  Would it would a really solid eight hundred dollar Chromebook be better?  Or do they have to throw on the razzle dazzle screen or something else?  And it's now worth thirteen hundred.  Right. Here's my question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why? Why do they do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Because all you need is the Web, Leo.  That's what Google has to want to get across.  All you need is the Web and the Web can be a premium experience and it can be a  premium experience through Chrome and beautiful hard, you know, hardware.  I think this is this is the message that Google wants to get across.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But now I have to say, I mean, I've used Chromebook since the CR 48.  And the first time I was using that, it was like I can't deal with this machine.  The this latest one that came out, you know, I was able to plug it into my  external monitor through DisplayPort and it worked beautifully.  I was able to sit there and actually compose and write and screenshot and do  an entire article that I would have just thought was impossible in the past.  There are things you still couldn't do.  I couldn't hand this to my kids, let him play Minecraft.  And that rules it out for them, as would rule out any Chromebook.  But, you know, for someone who really loves Chromebook and has really gotten  into it, then it makes sense if you really like Chromebook and you're like,  I'm using this all day long, then paying the premium for that better screen  makes sense in the same way that if you're already using a laptop all the time  and you're thinking, should I pay the extra for MacBook Retina?  Sure, that might make sense with it as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But how are you going to use this machine versus the other machines you have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll probably use it like, you know, once a week.  It'll probably be the machine that I use before I go to sleep or get up in the  morning that I have in another room that I open up and take a look at it.  Although I'm going to give it probably a day to a week where I'm going to try to  substitute it and use it as my main machine.  And, you know, I try to do the same thing with my Windows 8 laptop as well.  How did that go?  We'll see how it goes.  With the Windows 8 laptop, I did a whole thing I wrote out on CNET, which did  what disappointed me is I bought it because I wanted to be able to, I got the  yoga and I wanted to flip it over so that I could then use it as a tablet.  Right.  This is great.  This is what I've always wanted a full fledged computer that it's also a tablet.  So I remember the whole thing, I was talking about how I was in line to get  boarding my Southwest flight, I had everything opened up and out looking, I  was all in desktop mode and I, I flipped it open and I got in the line.  I'm kind of like looking around as everybody go, Oh my God, what's he doing?  What's, what is that?  Right.  And I started to, I started to like reply to email and everything and  there's no on screen keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, wait a minute.  That's a mistake.  Mine has mine isn't even a tablet.  It has an on screen keyboard keeps popping up in fact,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  because you're, because you're probably in, um, you're in metro modern UI or  whatever, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh look, here I am in desktop.  I tap, there's a, in the, uh, in the status bar, there's a keyboard.  All I have to do is tap it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, right.  You get that, but that's not, think about whenever you're using an actual tablet  and you need to do input, you don't have to then say, Oh, you know what?  I want the keyboard.  I got to go tap the keyboard and then have it take up half my screen.  You just start tapping and the keyboard comes up naturally.  And I just found like in desktop mode, that really killed it for me.  But what I will say is even though it's this weird hybrid and I can't wait for  windows nine, when we finally get to where we probably need to be, it needs a  little polish.  Yeah.  The touchscreen aspect.  You really understand when you're in windows eight, that that  touchscreen makes sense.  This was the most, the biggest revelation.  I'm doing this stuff.  And the Chromebook touch screen, it's much more of a novelty.  It's like, Oh, I can push this and get rid of that.  Maybe if I'm on Google Maps, I can pinch and zoom, but I can't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't you think they're going to change that pretty rapidly or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sure that they will.  But windows is windows itself is clearly ahead in terms of understanding.  We're going to build a touch oriented, real desktop computer operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, let me put a little context on this because I, Microsoft for 10 years  sold tablets, just like the yoga that converted and there were laptops and  they flip flop, but they were using XP and it wasn't a touch enabled OS.  It was layered on top just as it is with Chrome OS.  It was kind of like here's a slap, some touch in there.  And it was always unsatisfying.  It wasn't until the iPad came out that touch and the iPhone, I guess first, but  then the iPad, the touch made any sense.  And I think you have to design the OS from the ground up.  That's why windows eight succeeds in touch where windows XP, Vista, and  it's the successors did not.  And I wonder if they could just slap touch on Chrome OS and  suddenly make it a touch.  I agree with you, Danny, as soon as you start playing with a, even just a laptop  that has touch it, you know, people say, oh, it's confusing.  You don't want to touch the screen.  Yes, you do.  And as soon as you start doing it, it's just so natural.  It gives you just a natural way to pinch and zoom and move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you think that would have been the case, Leo?  I didn't.  Oh, well, and also, so I got this.  I didn't think it was the case.  You got so used to touch with tablets and with touch pads and all that.  Right.  That's what changed our view.  And suddenly it's like, it's like the, you know, the famous, probably  apocryphal story of the kid trying to turn the page on the screen.  It's exactly right.  He's conditioned now.  Yeah.  That's how we are now.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, but also the original windows touch was stylus and that that's not a good  idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's, there's, you know, well, but you have a fablet.  Well, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By the way, my note just to die today.  I couldn't turn it on.  Just die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What are you going to get now?  The HTC one, I think you're going to wait.  What do you think about the same as long for Gina?  What do you think it's going to be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Looks good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know this is a good time not to have a phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It really is a good time to have a phone.  The one is really cool though.  Looking as well.  Yeah, I don't know.  I'm, I mean, you know, I'm still sort of married to the Nexus line, but yeah,  a lot of good stuff coming out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I feel weird because I went from as having a Galaxy note two and a Mac book  retina in one day to a Windows eight laptop and an iPhone.  It's a little disoriented.  So your, so you, you, your yoga experience just wasn't enough, Danny, to,  to convince you to stick with eight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, no, there's all sorts of things that also come into play.  I mean, the, one of the biggest issues is this never knowing when I'm on the  desktop or going into metrics, kicking me back and forth.  And I'd rather it be one way or the other.  The other thing is, I mean, I use three external monitors when I'm working,  right?  So my laptop and I'm running out, look down below, and then I've got my browser  here and I've got something I'm reading over there and something I might be  reading on my other mount.  You can't see them, but I I'm seeing my, my monitors.  And when you go into windows eight, well, it supports the external monitors.  It doesn't support the Metro portion of it.  I can't put things up there and it was kind of freaky and weird.  And I've actually, I've been thinking about writing another thing about how  I've actually found now that for a, a like 20 year windows user, having shifted  over to the Mac finally last year and, and giving up on running bootcamp and  trying to do everything, it actually feels really natural for me.  Now I, I, I, I appreciate that I can do all these things that I'm not in one  world or the other and the supporting my external monitors really well.  And you know, there's just little things with it, but I, it, it windows H was not  enough to make me want to kind of stick with it and go with it.  Um, and because the other thing too, is with there's so much that is touch  oriented that when I get onto the external monitors, it's like, you're  trying to hover your mouse and get that little start thing to come up because  goodness knows we can't have a start button anymore, right?  And you're, you're having to do all these things that, that are really designed  more to use your, your, your fingers, your touch, you know, you want to pull  something in from the side, right?  And you know how you do that gesture to open up the Charles window.  And I find that when you're using a mouse and you're looking at an  external, like, yeah.  So it's not worth the effort for me and not with the external monitors and all  the other things that are going with it.  Um, but like I said, I, when we get to windows eight point five or windows  nine, I think that's when we finally get rid of desktop and you're have to go all  in, um, maybe it'll be more attractive to me then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, uh, I don't, we got into this from the pixel.  Yeah, it's interesting that Chrome OS led to windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, there's kind of the opposite ends of the spectrum, maximum complexity,  minimum complexity.  And I kind of, for a debt, for a laptop, I mean, uh, the iPad is even less  complexity, I guess, arguably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, actually, no, I would say, no, I would say in a way a tablet's more  complexity because you think it's like file structure and all that.  And then you have apps.  Just the web.  Period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And, uh, you, how's your experiment?  You have been using the Samsung.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, I've, I've, I've made it right about this and I haven't, I am happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm living entirely in the cloud.  Um, I've had to go to windows like, like today I had to go to windows to, to  create, I'm going to India and so I had to create a letter on letterhead, uh,  which probably I can do in docs, but I didn't know how and I just have fine.  But I swear I haven't had to go to windows to, to, to my, to my, to my  I haven't had to go to windows, to, to Microsoft products at all.  In the last three months, I've lived entirely in the cloud.  Um, the weaknesses I would say, uh, the Chrome, when I'm on the Chrome  book, it's a little slower, um, docs.  I haven't found the way to find a spot that I've left off in a really long  document, so I've had to cut up, you know, the, the next long thing I'm  trying to write into pieces.  Um, uh, I think I told the story that Evernote, because it's not native to  the Chrome book, uh, when a page refreshed, it killed all my notes.  Um, you know, not fully Evernote's fault, but, but that's the way it was.  But generally, no, I found it to be extremely successful and I'm, I'm living  entirely not because of fanboy reasons, because it just kind of became easier.  Uh, in Chrome and Android and that's it.  That's, that's where I'm looking.  I'm not using any applications of any sort.  And so the argument about, you know, apps being the future, it has to be in the  future when we talk about tablets.  Well, I think it's the past when it comes to desktop and laptop.  And I think that informs some of the thinking about apps when it  comes to tablets and phones.  Uh, yeah, we're going to have some because it's going to be appropriate to the  device, but I don't think it's the future at all.  I think you can do a lot on the browser and the browser is going to be a better  place to do most things and it works just fine.  Uh, I, um, Google docs, uh, I, I've got to get, I've got to sit down and I'm  going to fly Gina out and have a tutorial, uh, in terms of rethinking  how to organize my world.  I haven't put it into folders and stuff.  So it's as bad as my desktop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  Mine is too, actually.  And I'm pretty, I'm hyper organized about those things, but my, my Google  drive is just kind of a stream.  It's just a stack.  I'm trying to be unorganized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've been organizing my drive, you know, I've been like putting stuff in folders

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and I need to do that because if I now, now, if I buy the Chrome, the pixel, I'm  going to have a terabyte of storage free for three years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's another selling point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's, that's, that's a nice selling point.  I mean, Jeff, you are the target audience for the pixel, right?  This is like power Chromebook users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Literally the target audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you're in the chat room, don't remind me who I believe the salesperson is

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  directly heading to him right now.  The storage, what is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's three terabytes of storage for three years.  Or did I screw that up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  One terabyte for three years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When I, when I did my claim, they only gave me two, but it's supposed  to be three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So Jeff wrote a book called What Would Google Do?  Google's actually been saying, what would Jeff buy?  And they, and they found it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But that storage deal, I mean, it's a good deal when you account for the price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How much would a terabyte be at Google's existing Google drive prices?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh-uh.  I think that it's $1,800 is what it works out.  So some people, people argue, well, it's just cheaper than that.  It's a good deal.  But I don't use a terabyte of storage anywhere.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I mean, if I, if I uploaded every single thing on my hard drive, I would  get close to a terabyte.  I've got a terabyte backup drive.  Um, I just don't have any interest in uploading every single thing I've ever,  you know, every photo I've ever taken since 2000, when I got my first, you know,  uh, digital terabyte.  How long would it take you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, that's a lot of data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it is.  But the other issue then, and you could handle this, Gina, but, but the problem  is then you really do want to pack it up.  Even Google's Google, but I want to back it up.  So I looked today, uh, uh, back upify has, I think it's $3, uh, I don't know if  it's a month or a year per user, uh, for up to 35 gigs, something like that of  data where you could back up your Google, uh, uh, apps account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So now we're backing up across clouds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You shouldn't have to back up Google drive.  Come on.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was a very, there was a very brief time when I had my, cause I, I have, uh,  you know, I have a set of folders and things that I always want backed up on my  computer.  And then I was having both Google drive and, uh, Microsoft's cloud drive, uh, or  sky drive use the same folder.  And in the end, it was too complicated.  It, they didn't play well together using the same set of folders, but yeah, you  couldn't do that.  You could have Microsoft back, back up your Google one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, there's always just like, you know, look, I trust Google to do better  backups than, than, than I'm going to do.  And I trust that their drives hard drives are going to be around a lot longer than  mine are, but there's always have this sort of worry.  I mean, I'm just big on data liberation.  I want to be able to get to my data.  I'd like to be spread across, you know, a couple of different places, including,  you know, a drive on my desk and you know, what if something goes wrong and someone  hacks my account or Google decides to shut it down for some reason that I don't  know, like I don't have any recourse.  I mean, I have this show, like I have better recourse than, than most people do.  But I just always feel like, Oh, you know, that that's why I'm not going to upload  every photo I've ever taken and just trust that, you know, it's always going to  be there because you just never know.  And I just liked the idea that I could switch to something else if I wanted to.  I don't see myself doing that because Google's products are great.  And I trust that, you know, I trust them.  I think their security is great, but you never, you never know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So what if your account got deleted or hacked?  I mean, that's more likely not that the drive is going to die, but right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Exactly.  Right.  It's more that your account's going to get deleted or hacked or shut down  for some, no reason or whatever.  I mean, we, we get, we get emails from, from listeners who have these, you know,  stories of how they got locked out and they couldn't do anything about it.  And you know, Matt Honan happens to be a wired writer.  So when he had his whole password thing happen, which wasn't Google's fault, but,  but it happened, you know, he, he was able to write a feature story about it and  get his stuff back, but not everybody has that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Speaking of which, we were talking about using two path authentic, two,  two step authentication.  He suggested turning that on.  You did see that the, my, yeah, my, my, my qualms about that all along were  this, um, the application specific password, so called application specific  password, which is not application specific.  And in fact, until Google fixed it, cause a security researcher pointed out, you  could use it to get into everything.  Anytime.  So all you have to do is get this low security.  I mean, it's, it's not as secure as my password because it's just all lower  case alphabetic characters.  Um, you could get into anything with that, including until Google fixed it, which  they did this week, uh, get into the thing where you change the, uh, security settings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, this was your point Leo all along, like authentication, as soon as it's not  two factor, which is not in the case of application specific passwords, right.  Cause it's just one path, one password.  Then, then if a whole thing breaks down, it's not even application specific.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a lie.  It's not, it's a generic password to your entire Google account.  12 lowercase letters.  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't we have to kill the password?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  But then people will kill us as they cut off our thumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and I think Google two step works great when it uses authenticator.  That's when it's really two factor authentication.  Right.  Uh, cause that's the difference is not two factor.  It's two step because two factor means something, you know, and something you have  in this case, my Google authenticator running on my smartphone.  So to log into my real Google account, I put my password in, and then I have to  run on my smartphone, Google authenticator, which gives me six, six digit code,  one time use code.  That's good.  But because, because, uh, you know, smartphone apps and all these other  things that are using Google don't know anything about that.  Uh, they had to offer this back door and the problem is the back door is a back  door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right.  The back door is as insecure.  So the, uh, the resolution here was that Google fix it.  So it is truly application specific that checks the referral or no,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  they just, they just meant they just make it so you couldn't use it to access  certain critical Google services anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Like security settings, because you know, you could use it until this security  researcher pointed this out.  You could use your application specific password to get into, you know, where you  set the cell phone that you use for the backup and the backup email, you could  change that.  So a guy gets into your account.  Now he's got everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Cause you can't change the security settings and then log in anything.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was kind of a flaw.  Well, I'm glad they fixed that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So back to the terabyte for one second.  It just occurred to me.  Yes, sir.  That, um, I know what's going to fill up the terabyte real fast.  Google glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, now we know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Video recordings, direct to Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, that's why that exact window.  Take pictures and videos you and no one else will ever look at again, but they  are in the cloud, but they're in your life.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you want to have Google glass, it'll only sync with your Chromebook pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you are really, you're the one, you're the nerd quarter of the 1%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's the instant upload of Android.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Google will probably use the same way.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Didn't you love the tech crunch article that says because of the cost of Google  glass, 1500 bucks, even more than a pixel, uh, it will be for at least the first  year, it'll be a record of the 1%ers jet style, jet, jet center lifestyle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm waiting next next year.  I'm a daft.  There's era Ted.  You'll have a glass.  Here I am a Ted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Did you, uh, did you hear what Sergey said at Ted today?  No.  He said that smartphones are emasculating and that's why we need glass.  Oh yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's so masculine to wear those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, no.  Yeah, right.  Torquey glasses.  Smartphones are emasculating because you're staring down, rubbing a featureless  piece of glass.  It was a weird, weird moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's almost, I don't, I'm befuddled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it's from the playbook.  No, you got to understand the playbook.  He knows it's stupid.  He just knows if he says it enough, maybe people will start to believe it.  That's why he and his wife went to the vanity fair Oscar party wearing glass.  The whole goal, they understand the problem is you look like a dork.  So what do you do?  You'll, you just, it's the big lie.  You just say, no, you're not a dork.  It's a dork to use a smartphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You look like a dork right now.  You look like you're somebody who has one of those weird Google glasses.  They're able to get their hands on.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, you know, that's pretty awesome, but I, you know, I suppose what I thought  was interesting was the, the thing Joshua had done where he talked about going out  and wearing them and, you know, in sort of real life and it, there were some  references he made to where, you know, you didn't know if people thought you were  going to be rude or whatever.  And that's one thing I wonder is how it's not that people think you're dorky as  much as sometimes people just feel like you're being rude when you're looking at  your phone or people are being rude when they're looking at phones.  We're constantly doing that.  And what is it?  What does it do to us when we kind of have, is it better?  Is it better that we'll have this thing?  Although, you know, you're looking up in this corner, right?  So it's going to be pretty obvious when you're not talking to somebody.  I don't figure it out.  We always figure it out.  Right.  Oh, I know.  I mean, it's not going to be a crisis, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, we came up with norms.  We answered the phone.  We didn't say ahoy.  We said hello.  Right.  We figured it out.  We agreed on everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is this is a particularly challenging one because you'll have people walking  around with devices that could be unbeknownst to you recording your every  move all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Well, actually, there's a cartoon in the rundown at the bottom of the of the  Google Glass section about just that for for for our visually for anybody  watching audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Although the idea that it's going to be constantly running and I mean, if I  remember correctly, I don't know that it has that much on on device storage and  it can interact with your phone so then it can be storing out onto your phone.  But just a phone doesn't have that much storage.  And then I suppose it could be constantly streaming your video back.  But and if you just paid fifteen hundred dollars for your your Google Glass, I  suppose you'd be constantly streaming along that way as well.  But, you know, I suspect that we're going to constantly stream.  I think you're going to say you're going to say turn it on.  What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you're going to say turn it on at certain points.  I don't think you're going to stream because you're going to be overloaded  with that.  And I think there probably will be some signal that we'll have to put on.  It's the red light equals equals camera recording, as someone says in the chat  room. I think we'll do that.  But we'll figure out these these norms.  The other thing is we presume now that it's rude to talk to someone on your  phone instead of the person in front of you.  But I argue who's to say that the person in front of you is any more interesting  or any more important than the person on the phone.  And that's something we have to work out, too.  And young people are working that out.  Sometimes they say, I'm sorry, this is more important.  Just because you're here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So rude when you're talking to somebody and the phone rings and you say, excuse  me, and you answer the phone.  That is so rude.  It was so rude.  It still is.  It will always be rude.  If I'm standing talking to you face to face and somebody says, hey, Leo, and I  go, Jeff, excuse me, I'm going to go talk to this person.  He looks more interesting.  That's rude.  It will always be rude.  What makes it different on the phone?  Because it's it was an emergency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And he was the one who said that you'd go to talk to him.  You'd say, I understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You could say, oh, I'm so sorry.  I really apologize.  I have to take this.  But you have to apologize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think if you go back to when if you go back to when we, you know, I mean, I  don't remember when we first had phones, but there was a time when getting a  phone call was a really special thing.  Like getting a telegram.  It was a big deal.  And I don't know that that has ever gone away, that somehow, oh, there's a there's  a call coming in.  It's almost like getting, you know, a package delivered to your house as  opposed to just getting your mail.  You don't necessarily run out and say, oh, the mail's here.  But, you know, the UPS guys come in and you're like, oh, you know, so the idea  that that phone call is coming in, I guess maybe that's just some remnant of  this is sort of important.  But to me, what tends to be really, really rude behavior is that, you know,  you're you're with someone and then suddenly you're like going off to your  phone. Right.  Not that you're talking to somebody else.  Right. To somebody else.  Or there's some remnant of it.  You've literally decided at that point, look, whatever they're doing, this thing  probably has something that's more interesting.  I have never done this because I'm doing what I love is when somebody brings out

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  their phone, that's then the excuse for you to bring out yours.  So I'm happy when they bring up their electronic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the electronic equivalent to a smoking break.  It really is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is. I can't handle human.  You got to understand this all comes with the fact that everybody in this room,  probably everybody listening and certainly everybody in Silicon Valley, are  introverts who don't like people and would far prefer to be interacting with  hardware. That's why they're in the technology business.  And it's it's pathological.  It's not normal. It's a pathology.  It's not something we should celebrate.  And it's the I think if you start making this be the norm of a bunch of people who  would far prefer to interact with a machine than a human, bad news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not a machine. You're interacting with other people through the machine.  That's the point. We're figuring this out.  Listen, not very long ago, it would have been rude for you not to respond to  someone's letter. They sat down, they wrote out the letter, they sent it to you  and you don't respond. How rude.  Right now, it's rude to expect someone to respond immediately to your email.  Right. These things just change.  But I'm I think the pathology comes not in that, Leo, I think in terms of the notion  of the machine, I think the pathologies with the stream is with the oh, my God,  there's something going on. I constantly have to see.  That's where I feel.  Well, isn't that the implication when you do that, that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  something's more important than the person you're talking to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, it's that you're missing something in another world, which is more important

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  than my conversation to you with you.  But Grandpa, you're just hey, what do you mean, Grandpa?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I missed out this conversation because the chat room was more interesting.  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Bravo, bravo, Gina.  Well played.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, not that this is just me.  I mean, and I agree with you, Leo.  I am look, I'm phone phobic.  Like, I hate taking voice calls.  So I generally keep my ringer.  I don't answer voice calls when they come in.  But if I get a text, I will glance at it and I will do that even if I'm in the  presence of someone else, because it's kind of an asynchronous thing.  Like I can multitask.  I mean, I try not to in the middle of a conversation do a deep dive into my into my  Twitter stream, you know, because it's rude and you know, it's rude and yeah, and I  agree with you.  But if I'm in a situation where I'm in a group, a group situation where, you know, a  few different people are talking and I'm only peripherally in the conversation or  if I'm in a lecture where the speaker just hasn't kept my attention, I don't feel  like it's that big a deal.  I kind of agree with all of you at the same time.  But but voice calls don't I just don't do them.  Incoming voice calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I started writing a medium collection.  I have two pieces that is not quite a collection make on redefining rude, right,  which really is this process of rethinking our norms.  And you're right, it's rude today.  But if everyone does it and agrees about the way we do it, then it's then it's not  rude. That's the whole point.  You redefine it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I will say I love introverts.  I'm in this business because I don't want to talk to anybody and talk to people all  day. And yeah, I know, but not face to face.  And and I understand being an introvert.  And I think that that's cool.  And I think that that's why people get into Silicon Valley, they get into technology.  And that's a lot of what's going on with this Google Glass.  But I don't know if it's I mean, don't you think it's already a bad scene that  everybody you walk downtown, everybody's Google Glass buried in their phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is what Britain's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is what Britain's trying to say, that we will stop a world where people are  staring down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it doesn't stop it. It just means you're looking there instead of there.  It doesn't stop it. It hides it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It hides it exactly.  Is that better?  Well, look, with the heads up display, you can see both at the same time.  You can see the person that you're talking to and you can also see like, oh, hey, I  just got a text message from my you know, from my wife, for example, or, oh, I  should turn right here.  And it doesn't break the conversation or come across as rude the way that it would  if you if you pulled out your phone and broke eye contact.  I know, Leo. I see what you're saying.  It's just enabling people to do it more surreptitiously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And of course, this is what would come out of Silicon Valley, because it's what we  want. And by the way, did you see the eBay price on it was a phony Google Glass  that's to turn out, but it went well over fifteen thousand dollars.  That's so I'm wrong.  Obviously, people desperately want glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, my mother is upset at the moment because you can't get it.  But I mean, to go back to the emasculating thing, I think that.  How was it emasculating?  I think that what it and I'll guess and I'll go out on a limb to maybe get more into  the mind of what he was perhaps thinking.  But, you know, there is an argument that we would like to have all this knowledge  like we have knowledge in our heads.  We we walk around, we interact with people.  I see you. I think who you are.  I think about the things that I know about you, what you've been doing, what  your interests are. Nobody considers that when I interact with another person that  I'm consulting, my brain is somehow rude or somehow inattentive to them.  That is what you expect.  That that's what you expect somebody to do.  And if somebody doesn't have a good memory, what was your name again?  They're an idiot. Right.  Or, you know, they've been really rude to you when, you know, for whatever reason,  they just didn't twig on it and they didn't pick up on it.  Right. So we now have this ability to enhance our brains.  And the way that we've been doing that is when we're on the move to use this phone,  that, you know, we pick up this thing and we're like staring at this thing and poking  away at it to try to help us enhance our own head and what's in there to do the things  that are already natural to us. Right.  And this is that kind of enhancement.  And that's like you're almost like I could see what he's saying that you're almost  pleading with this phone to give you information.  Can I have this? Can I have that?  And Google Glass, I suppose one thing is, first of all, it is getting closer to being  what we're we're normally doing.  We're seeing things the way we normally see and we're getting this sort of enhanced  vision. It doesn't it doesn't put things up in front of you.  I used one briefly and I wrote a little piece where I talked about it being like a  rearview mirror. You know, when you're driving, you use your rearview mirror.  And at first, the rearview mirror feels really weird.  And you're like, I remember never wanting to use it.  I'll never get used to this. And now I can drive and I use that thing all the time.  It's just part of what I do.  And I think that that's the idea with Glass is that you're going to be able to use this  and not feel like perhaps you're pleading with your telephone to enhance your brain,  to get your brain to do more of what it already does.  And the real step further is, of course, naturally the Google brain implant, which  sounds like a joke, but that's where it all goes, right?  That's where it all goes to at one point.  And any of the science fiction novels you want to pick when people read about this,  it just gets it back into our head.  And then all the rudeness starts to go away.  You meet somebody, the information is coming up, you're tapping into all these  sorts of things. And it probably isn't that you're feeling like you're either being  distracted from them or that you're having to plead for the information because the  information is just part of what you already do.

Transcript:  Danny, we're going to take a break.  Danny, I want you to unplug and plug in your headset because we're getting some  crackle out of it. And Chad, you can work with him while we take a break and talk  about LegalZoom. How about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cool. So you can sue me for taking pictures of you with my Google Glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Son of a...  Yeah, just don't wear that in the locker room.  That's all I could say.  Well, I wouldn't want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  LegalZoom needs a glass app that'll just be able to activate the NDA like the record.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I suspect in a year from now when we do our LegalZoom app, we'll be saying, and now  with a new form, don't shoot me, bro.  Don't glass me, bro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Glass-free conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is going to be a glass-free conversation.  Would you sign here, please?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And you can sort of wave your hand and sign with your finger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like in the Sopranos, I got to search you for a wire.  I got to search you for glass.  I hope... don't take this personal.  My lawyers have informed me.  I shouldn't be speaking to you without searching you for a wire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is going to be good for the feds, though, right?  If everybody wears glass, they, you know, who needs to wear a wire?  Yeah.  I can't take these off.  This is how I can't see.  I am... are you there still?  I'm blind without my Google Glass.  Our show today brought to you by LegalZoom.com.  Not a law firm.  This is an interesting idea.  LegalZoom was born when some lawyers said, wait a minute, you know, you don't really  need to pay a high-priced lawyer for some basic stuff like a will, an LLC, a trademark  patent, there are lots of things you can do just by filling out a form.  And that's when LegalZoom was born.  And I got to tell you, in the last 12 years, over 2 million Americans have used LegalZoom,  me too, for LLCs, wills, trusts, trademarks, and more.  I can vouch for this.  It's very easy to sit up your LLC with LegalZoom.com.  And it's just $99.  Twits and LLC.  Now, if you fill out that form and you get to a point where you go, gee, I'd like some  legal advice, LegalZoom even now has attorneys that you could talk to.  Their legal plans are available in most states.  You could search the online profile and unedited customer reviews before you talk to the  attorney. They've got prices, fixed prices that they've set with LegalZoom.  So if you, you know, you're going through the form and say, gee, should I be in Delaware  or California LLC?  This is one of the things I was a question for me.  You could talk to an attorney at a very affordable price.  LegalZoom is really brilliant.  If you're a blogger and you have not yet trademarked your blog name, you do it.  You need to do it.  Patents even, NDAs.  And soon Google Glass disclaimer forms.  LegalZoom.com.  I want you to check it out.  Start your business or protect your family.  They do wills trust too at LegalZoom.com.  Not a law firm, self-help services at your specific direction.  Or, and this is new, you could speak to a legal plan attorney to get your questions  answered and get ongoing advice at a very affordable price.  To receive a special thank you for using LegalZoom and giving us credit.  We'll give you 10 bucks back when you use the offer code TWIG at checkout.  So go to LegalZoom.com browse around, see what you can do with it.  Or just keep this in the back of your mind for when you do want to, you know,  do that trademark.  OMG Chad.  Trademark.  Done.  Isn't it a nice feeling to be able to put the TM next to the OMG Chad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it takes a lot of weight off of my shoulders just to know that's mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We did TWIT and we did the logo.  We wanted to make sure that was trademarked.  So that has a little trademark.  It's really, I think it's, it's not expensive.  It's very simple.  Wasn't hard, was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, no, not at all.  And in fact, pro tip, go, you can search the trademark database and look for  trademarks that are similar and just kind of cut and paste.  Cut and paste, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's God made cut and paste.  You can't trademark the trumpets.  You can't trademark the trademark description.  Isn't that interesting?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Plagiarism is okay.  Lee, maybe you ought to ask a legal zoom attorney before you do that.  Legalzoom.com use twig as the offer code.  Bring your dreams to life.  Did you know it's national start your own business month?  Everybody should have a business.  So we're all fixed with my good friend, Danny Sullivan, searchengineland.com.  Danny is such a great astute commentator on the scene.  And we just always love having him on.  Somebody was saying in the chat room, Danny, you should be a regular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, well, thank you.  Yeah.  That was really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Um, I think we were going to do the change log now, but I think we'll do, can we, can  we begin before we do the change log with a visit from Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, let's do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Cause this is one of the items on the change log.  Um, you want to fill us in?  What is this?  This is a new Google plus sign on capability, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  Google launched Google plus sign in this week, which is kind of the  equivalent of Facebook connect.  So what it does is it enables developers to add a sign in with Google onto their  mobile app, onto their website.  And you get a few things with that.  Um, you sign in with Google, you, the, your user will need a Google plus account.  And then you can say, allow this app access to, uh, any number of Google apps.  So this is kind of cool for developers, right?  Cause there's tons of products and, and Google's, uh, the Google sphere, the  ecosystem, you got drive and Gmail and maps and all kinds of different user  data that you're at, that your app can interact with.  And what happens is when you sign in with Google, uh, you can share  your activity on that particular app.  So if you're listening to music, if you purchase something, if you left a  review for something, if you, if you checked out a restaurant and wanted to go,  uh, you can share that activity to your Google plus stream.  Uh, but what's interesting about Google's approach to this, unlike,  unlike Facebook, which has that kind of frictionless sharing feature where it  just kind of shares out to everyone, uh, everything that you do, you can choose  what circles get to see your activity.  And, um, and if I understand this correctly, users only see your activity  if they go to your profile and then look at it, right?  So, so they're saying, so Google's saying, this is kind of a, a spam free  solution to recording your activity, uh, and Google plus and other, other  nice part of the feature.  If you, if someone signs into your, um, your website with Google plus, they get  it, they get a link to install your mobile app, your Android app directly  from the play store without a website, which is really, really quite nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, we've got from the Google plus engineering team, David Glazer's on the  line with us, engineering director at Google plus and Seth Sternberg.  He's a project product management director at Google plus Seth.  David, welcome.  Thank you.  Thanks.  So that was Gina's description.  Say again, I like that product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like that product you just described.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You guys should do that.  Is that an accurate description of what the G plus, uh, sign in does?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  So how is this different, say that OAuth or some other way of using Google to sign

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  in that there, there really just levels of the stack, you know, OAuth is the  foundation technology underneath Google plus sign in and a bunch of other  APIs from Google, it's kind of become the, the, the both de facto and de jure  way that people do, uh, do, do delegated trust and we like it.  Uh, but what's different is when you do Google plus sign in, we pull together a  bunch of different capabilities into one easy, simple to adopt and simple for  users way to get at a whole range of the capabilities that Google offers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And how does it differ from, I mean, it's basically  Facebook connect is the same thing for Facebook.  Is that right?  Or is it different?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I think they're, they're, they're in the same category of extending  identity across one location into many locations, but I think there are a bunch  of places where we listen to users who had started to have some experience with  what does it mean to use my identity from one site and use it across a bunch of  different sites and, uh, and, and listen to those users and say, Hey, what, what,  what did they like and what would they like to see more of and see less of, and  try to, to incorporate that in.  So, you know, some, some of the things that you, you covered very well in your  intro about letting users really have control over what they share and how they  share it, helping users feel safe, not only safe around their security and know  that they're building on a trusted login and identity, but also safe around, uh,  what happens to their information and what happens to their social interaction  that they won't be talking too loudly or talking too softly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you did in launch, you partnered with a number of companies, USA Today and  other, and I, I'm on tune in radio, which is one of my favorite, uh, radio apps.  And they're now in addition to connect with Facebook, I see sign in with a  Google plus, so that's it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, there's sign.  It depends on how a developer chooses to use the functionality.  So at a base, there's the sign in functionality, but then for users, I  think there's so much more, right?  A lot of times users have websites and applications that they really love,  but they don't know that that, that website has an Android app that's available.  Right.  So all of a sudden the user can just really easily find that Android app, right?  If you're using tune in.com and then it's like, Hey, you might want, you  know, tune in on Android.  I think that's a really great user benefit.  And then at the same time, we put a lot of thought into sharing because we  heard, like David was saying, we heard from users two things that sounded like  they couldn't, you know, they were, they were conflicting, right?  Users said, when I share, I really want to make sure that my friends  see what I share to them.  I want to know they get it at the same time.  I don't want to spam my friends.  So we put all this thought into how to do the sharing model, right?  And we came up with a model where if a user explicitly goes to share  something like they share, Hey, I'm listening to KQED on tune in.  Then when they share that to David, if I put David's name in, he will get a  notification through all Google properties that says, Hey, Seth just  shared this and it's not just a notification.  It has a listen button on it so that he can be brought right to tune in zap to  listen to KQED with me.  At the same time, we have this notion of activities inside an application.  And those are not just printing onto people's stream, right?  Every time you listen to something on KQED, you don't want to spam your  friends with all this activity, right?  That looks like spam.  And so rather it's available on my profile for David to see if he  wants to come look for it.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I'm doing the tune in radio log in here and immediately one thing that's  different is make your app activity and listens available via Google visible to  you and, and then you can have your circles or you can have individual people  or you could have only you, you get the choice.  So that's, that's the kind of fine control Facebook does not give you right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was one of the things that we heard from our users.  They really wanted, and that's why we surface that, that level  of control right up front.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, we even gave users the ability to change which of their  friends are sent to the app.  So if they're using an app like Fitbit and they only want their exercising buddies  to be visible inside Fitbit, they can do that.  So really it's just a ton of user control in, in Google plus sign in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And here's the second part that you were mentioning because I'm on tune in radio  and there's an Android app, the next page says, Oh, would you also like to install  this on your Android device?  And I now is it going to, when I, when I add it to mine, you see a few  Android devices when I add it to my Android device, is it going to in any way  know who I am or am I going to go through the same login process through Google plus  on the app?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it will remember your settings.  So if you created, you know, like only my music lover circle can see what I've done  inside tune it, it will remember that, but you will have to re-consent on the mobile  side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That sounds just right.  Actually that's convenient, but I also want to reauthorize and the, and the  Google plus sign in is available on apps as well on the Android apps as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  We launched it for web iOS and Android.  That's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Gina, you're the developer.  Any questions for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I do.  So, so the update that went out to Android, it added this green Google settings icon  and everyone's Android kind of app drawer that, that let users kind of control, you  know, what apps it had, it had allowed access to their Google, their, their Google  data.  I was curious to know why that's a separate thing.  Like why that's not just in your regular Android settings or is this just kind of a  first iteration?  I don't know.  I could, maybe this is too detailed a question, but I was like, why isn't this just  under my Google account settings, you know, in, in the native settings app?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's the, it's a, it's a good question with a fairly boring answer, which is  technically the mechanisms of updating different parts of the UI smoothly and in a  way that we were sure could provide a consistent user experience across a range of  devices meant that it was a lot more straightforward to put all of those settings  in one new place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then it had the other side benefit of making it really visible to the user where  they can go.  Cause we want to, you know, you can see in that dialogue when you're first connecting  with tune in all that user control.  And so we've done the same things with settings, right?  Lots of user controls that they know where they can go to change their settings in a  given application.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right, right.  And I had one other question about the kind of the interactive sharing bits where you  said, you know, and I like this, I think this is the right approach where if you do share  a bit of activity that there's often an action button associated with.  So I listen to the song, you should listen to it too, or I really like this product.  Here's a link to buy it.  And I thought I read somewhere and correct me if I'm wrong, is there a way?  So say I'm giving a product a negative review and I'm actually not telling my friends to  buy it.  I'm telling them not to buy it.  There's a way to say, like, don't show that buy button or there's a way to specify what  the action should be, like based on what the data is being shared.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So what happened there, I think it was Beautylish, one of our launch partners.  They, you know, they can do that on their own side.  They invented that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we built it, but we didn't quite realize how that use case and they came up with it.  It was nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that's actually a design point of something we've done here is we're trying to walk an  interesting line where we're building hopefully really great stuff for users, but also really  powerful capability for developers to let them just imagine things that we never would.  And that example that Beautylish came up with, frankly, we did not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And technically the way it works is very simple.  When Beautylish writes the pop share dialogue now code, they pass in parameters.  And one of the parameters is what action button do they want to include?  So in their case, they could simply say if the user is coming from the context of loving  a product, let's include action.  Let's include the buy action.  And if they're coming from a context of dissing a product, let's include either no action or  a different action.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, that's really nice because there are times when you see, you know, UI buttons that  just make absolutely no sense.  You know, a friend of mine on Facebook or wherever on Google Plus is like, I'm having  a horrible day and that's like, like this.  And it just doesn't, it doesn't make no sense at all.  So I really like when developers get that kind of control to say like this is the appropriate  call to action here.  So I like that a lot.  Someone in the chat room asked about the API for this.  So I imagine an SDK for this has dropped for the various platforms and is available now  for developers to try out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's all up there.  developers.google.com slash plus.  And you'll find documentation for Android, for iOS, and for web access with client libraries  and sample code available for all of the above.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And we found it takes about a day to get an initial working like a simple sign on and  then for really great integrations, only about two weeks.  But, you know, it really depends what, again, what people want to do with the tools we put  out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You got a sample app right there on the page and everything.  That's cool.  Nito, Seth, David, I want to thank you for joining us.  Awesome guys are coming on.  So are most Android phones going to get an OTA update to enable this or how is that going  to work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  And I don't know exactly the progress of that rollout, but it's pretty far along now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I got one on my Sprint Galaxy Note yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It sounds like you have enough that you can sort of watch the progress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Everybody with ProYo and above should be getting an update that'll enable all of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's available for pull earlier.  If someone were to install an app that deep fit, it would get pulled.  It would just pull it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, cool.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nice.  Leo, before they go, can you ask or can I ask what's going to happen with Google accounts?  Because, you know, we have had this existing system we can use to log into websites already,  which was Google accounts.  And I got the impression that that's going to go away and now it's all going to be Google  Plus accounts.  So are you going to be able to use both types of things or is Google account sign in?  Is that going to go away down the line?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, what we are encouraging people to use the new sign in with Google Plus that  we just launched because we think it's a better experience for users and developers.  But we're not making any changes to the existing capability.  We don't want to break any existing sites.  You know, just cold turkey.  And we are saying, hey, you ought to check out this new stuff.  You're probably going to find that it does more for you and for your users.  But no changes today to anything existing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And importantly, with the new Google Plus sign in, developers can call any existing  Google Scopes.  So if they're using the current Google sign in to get calendar access or email access  or drive access, they can do the exact same thing with the new Google Plus sign in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Good, because I'm using the Google.  Well, now this is interesting.  This is Disqus.  I think we use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's weird because you can't tell on Disqus.  I think it's still using your Google account.  But it's still using Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's got a plus next to the G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, you have one Google account, whether or not you've created a Google Plus file for  it.  Right.  So they're not adversity.  They're a enhanced would be.  But, guys, while I got you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But with Disqus, you get Disqus is showing you a Google Plus icon even though the login  that you're using isn't the Google Plus sign in.  It's actually the Google account sign in.  So we'll do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Call those guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  People have already made the transition before you even got to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, because I just did it.  I pressed it.  And I think it was just Google, just a regular Google sign in.  I don't think it was a Google Plus sign in.  Hey, Seth and David, we want to thank you for.  One second.  One second.  Yes, go ahead.  Jeff has a question for you.  Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Rick Byers, who's on the Chromebook team, sent me an email saying he was going to watch the  show just because.  He is.  He's in the chat room right now.  If I had a computer made for me, now I want a Google Plus fix made for me.  OK?  I'm having problems, guys, with the fact that I'm a loyal Google Apps user.  I go immediately on Google Plus.  Now I have two identities.  It's driving my world crazy.  Yes, I know I'm my great.  I lose all kind of stuff and I'm all kind of confusing.  I just want to put them together into one and just be one person with you.  I'm too schizo.  OK?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Please.  I think they're gone.  Oh, no, they're there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're just looking at you like.  Home back with the insanity of it.  Yes, he checked.  He checked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We actually just lost them.  They just hung up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's see you later, guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was a very confusing time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But didn't you, Gina, also think for years you've been complaining about this.  Didn't they solve it a little bit for you merging the two or something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I actually went around this week again.  I was trying to go around and you lose stuff along the way and it's complicated and it's risky.  And it's just complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There are ways to migrate.  You do lose stuff along the way.  I never move my Google Plus account over to my apps account because I just have so many  circlers that I just don't want to lose them.  And I just switch.  I just use the Google account switch, which is annoying at times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And which by the way, you can't use that on a Chromebook.  Oh, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, you can.  On the Chromebook Pixel, you can totally switch because I have two accounts.  I use one account for Google Plus and my calendar and all that stuff.  But you're not going back entirely.  I have a Google Apps account for the only reason, which is I wanted to have email my  own domain name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But you can only use one at a time.  You're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you can switch between.  There's a little option.  You can switch rapidly.  It works pretty well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jeff, gotta buy a Pixel now, Jeff.  Gotta buy a Pixel.  Well, we thank David Glazer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can you do that on a regular Chromebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know.  Go check, Danny.  We thank David Glazer, Engineering Director at Google Plus and Seth Sternberg, Project  Management, Product Management Director at Google Plus for filling us in on that new  feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It was great to have them on the show.  Hopefully we weren't too hard on them.  We'll get more Googlers in the future.  I think it was just a scare of them all.  We didn't scare anybody off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, it was a Skype issue.  Yeah, we had a Skype issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But they do have to rest as well.  As long as they're gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can do that on a regular Chromebook.  You can do it on a Chromebook or...  Just click a little thing at the top corner.  That'll be in the top right corner and look down.  You should see a thing that says Add Account and you should be able to do it.  Well, Danny, you just replaced it in my heart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, replaced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's it.  Not replaced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Enhanced.  Enhanced.  It's my Danny plugin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right, we're going to take a break.  When we come back, the full Google change log with Gina Trapani and a lot more.  Danny Sullivan is here from Search Engine Land.  He's the new Lifehacker editor when it comes to Chromebooks.  Oh, no.  No.  He's always great to have you, Danny.  Jeff Jarvis from the City University of New York and BuzzMachine.com.  Gina Trapani from SmarterWear.  Oh, he's pulled out the Samsung Chromebook.  Breaking it out.  You know, that just looks so cheap compared to a Pixel.  I think you should get a Pixel.  You'd be so much happier, Jeff.  You're a drug dealer, aren't you?  I just don't.  I want to buy it.  I don't want it.  It was good.  I want you to buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  After the break, I'll grab mine and I'll show you the best part of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, so we're going to get a special show and tell with Danny in just a moment.  But first, a word about backup.  You were talking about backing up your docs.  Maybe you don't trust Google Drive enough.  Add Carbonite.  Now you got it all interlocking.  Interlocking backup.  This is the 3-2-1 backup rule.  My friend Peter Krogh, photographer, wrote the Digital Asset Management book.  He's an expert on this stuff.  In fact, there's a great website you could read that he created with the  Association of Professional Photographers in the Library of Congress.  It's called DP for Digital Photography, dpbestflow.org.  Among other things, he's talking about all the different workflow things that  photographers should consider.  He talks about backup.  Of course, that's important.  If you're a photographer, you can't lose those images.  Take a picture of a wedding.  They're not going to stage the wedding again.  If you lose the pictures, you cannot lose them.  So he talks about something he calls 3-2-1 backup.  Three copies of everything.  That could be an original and two backups.  That's fine.  Two different media.  So a disk and a USB key.  I guess that'd be all right.  Better would be a disk and the internet.  And absolutely one of them needs to be off-site because you're not backed up.  If you've got everything sitting next to the computer and the house burns down,  it's all going.  Or somebody steals your stuff.  There's all sorts of disasters.  You got to get stuff off-site.  3-2-1, this is the easy way to do it.  Carbonite.com.  Create a backup with Carbonite.  $59 a year for everything on your computer, Mac or PC.  And they do have different versions for small business,  the external drives and all of that.  But the basic plan, $59 per computer per year.  Less than $5 per month per computer.  The backup is automatic and continuous whenever you're online.  And it's backing up to the Carbonite cloud.  You can...  It's encrypted on the way using SSL.  But if you want further encryption that only you hold the key,  you could do that too.  Carbonite enables that.  It is a very good solution.  Now you can try it free with...  You don't need a credit card.  Just go to carbonite.com.  Click that orange Download Free Trial Now button and use our offer code TWIG.  You get 14 days to try it free.  That's usually enough to get your first backup set up to the Carbonite cloud.  And then if you decide to buy, you'll get 14 months for the price of $12.  Two free months.  But you got to use the offer code TWIG at carbonite.com.  You got to back it up to get it back.  So do it right with Carbonite.  All right.  What is the special...  Before we do the change log.  What is the special sexy, sexy Chromebook Pixel feature?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is your...  Sexy.  This is it there.  And if you see up here at the top...  Yeah, that indentation there.  We have the light bar.  And when the laptop is open...  The light bar will start to glow.  Oh, it's pulsing.  But then the best...  And it will pulse.  And then this...  The best part, it only lasts briefly.  And when you shut it...  You get the green flash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google colors!  Rainbow.  I saw a rainbow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hang on.  I can repeat it.  It's really easy.  You just have to open it and shut it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'd pay $1400 for that.  Buy it.  Buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The odd thing is what you want is for that to keep going when it shuts.  No, no.  I don't care about my battery at that point.  It's cool.  And I want it to keep glowing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it's like the green flash at a sunset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You shut your Mac and it's glowing.  That little white thing's going.  I want the little bar to keep going.  It doesn't do that.  So someone needs to write a hack to make the light bar go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The only thing missing on that...  And I can't understand why they left it out.  And so does our buyers in our chat room who designed the damn thing.  Where's the USB 3 port?  It's got two USB 2 ports.  That's odd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Is the light bar the battery indicator or it's just for fun?  It's just for fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just like when it's open, it's glowing.  And when you shut it, it flashes and it turns off.  When you go to the website, it even says light bar just for fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You've really digested the marketing on this, Danny.  I can tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But our buyers...  Wait a minute.  Our buyers...  Rick in our chat room, he's the guy.  He works on the team.  He says it also is a battery indicator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't have any idea how it tells me what it's doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe we should call Rick and get him on.  Does it just go down when the battery goes down?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not doing anything.  So I don't have any indication from it.  And there's no button that I push to do it.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You got to go up, down, up, down, left, right, left, right.  And then it will do it.  It goes to red.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It goes to red below a certain battery level.  Okay.  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you just never let it go.  I'll run it down right away.  Rick, we should come on because I want to know...  What was the mission statement?  Larry, come in and say, look,  Price is No Object Design, the most beautiful Chromebook you can think of.  It must have been, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Come dive into the shark tank.  This isn't the most positive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The funny thing is now all of us are staring at the chat and not talking to each other,  which just proves we're all being rude to each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, see?  Our buyers is so much more important than the rest of you.  He says, bring it on, guys.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I love it.  I love a Googler's Game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Awesome.  Game Googlers next.  But first, it's time to play the trumpets for the changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Google changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Put that on your Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And smoke it.  Every week, Gina Trapani tells us what's new with Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, we got a few new things in Gmail, Search, and Chrome.  Let me run through them.  They're all kind of minor, but also kind of neat.  First, we have brand new arrow key navigation in Gmail.  So this is for folks using the web interface for Gmail.  You like your keyboard shortcuts.  They just got better.  If your thread list or your list of labels is in focus,  you can use your arrow keys to go up and down.  And if you've got a screen reader,  a screen reader can read to you where you are.  So just a nice little tweak there.  I've talked before about there's a Gmail field search trial for Google Search.  So you have to opt into this.  It's google.com slash experimental slash Gmail field trial.  This is the field trial that adds your personal information  to your Google search results.  So we talked before about how you can, if you've booked a flight  and there's a confirmation email in your Gmail and you search my flights,  that'll show you whether or not your flight's on time, when it's departing.  It'll show you files from your Google Drive.  It'll show you recent receipts if you bought something, say from Amazon.  Well, they just added upcoming events in your Google calendar to this list.  So if you enter this field trial and you search for something  that shows up in your calendar, that'll also show up in your search results.  Chrome has gotten a few new things that I'm kind of excited about.  First, we've got new better spell check in Chrome.  Google says we've refreshed the dictionaries for Chrome's default spell checker.  They've added support for Korean and Albanian and Tamil.  I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly.  But this is a really cool feature.  Chrome will now sync your custom dictionary across your devices.  So if you add a word to your dictionary, like I always have to add life hacker,  I don't do that once.  And then Chrome, if I'm syncing that, if I've got a custom dictionary sync set up,  that'll show up on all my other devices as well.  And users can enable that Ask Google for suggestions feature.  That's that did you mean?  Google's constantly kind of monitoring the web for how people spell things.  Google's rolling out support for grammar and homonym and context sensitive spell checking in English.  So that's using the same technology behind Google search.  And understands proper nouns like Bieber or Skrillex.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's quite a wide range from Bieber to Skrillex and everywhere in between.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Skrillex, Google Chrome has a better spell check.  So users on Windows, Linux and Chrome OS will get these enhancements in the coming weeks.  Google says Mac support is coming soon.  Also, Chrome is got the web speech API in the latest stable build.  I think I brought this up in the change log when it hit the beta build.  The web speech API basically means you're going to see more web apps that take voice commands,  which is which is really, really cool because it's in the latest stable build.  Google's also sort of merging Chrome OS into regular Chrome.  Google just ported the Chrome OS app launcher, which is kind of the start menu,  into the Chrome browser dev channel.  Right.  So and that's happening on Windows right now.  Mac and Linux is coming soon.  That means there'll just be a little button that launches your your web apps, your Chrome apps menu.  Fear not if you don't use Chrome apps that will not show up at all.  You have to install you have to install a Chrome app in order to see that menu at all.  This is the thing that I'm super excited about.  It's far downstream still.  It's not going to not going to hit the stable build yet, but I'm excited about this latest.  Canary build of Chrome has a new feature that shows what tabs are playing audio.  Even if there's a slash going right.  So what you'll basically have to see this little audio throbber in your fav icon.  So if you got a bunch of tabs open and one is playing music, this has happened to all of us.  And it's happened to us even on the show.  And something is playing music.  There's an ad or something.  It's making you crazy.  You don't know what tab you can just look at your fav icons and close it.  So I'm excited about that.  This is the Canary build of Google Chrome, which is separate from Chromium.  So we're not guaranteed to get this, but I think this is something people want well enough.  I think this is going to hit our desktops eventually.  Finally, Google Finance added Singapore, Korean and Israel stock exchange.  For those of you following international stocks.  So that's kind of update there.  And Google plus sign in.  We just talked about.  So that's all I got today.  The change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's the Google change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It was a lot of little things today, but good stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm trying to find the menu, the app menu.  Where does that where would that show up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So it's windows only.  Oh, so you're on windows right now.  And you know, it's interesting.  This screenshot here, the next web had a screenshot of what it looks like in Chrome OS.  But that's that's kind of in the dock there.  So I'm actually not sure how they're going to the beta channel one, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is not right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right.  It looks like Jeff, do you use this this app?  This app drawer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I use it.  It's on my Chromebook already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  It's on your Chromebook.  But so it's this it's this button with the grid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, the bottom of my Chromebook, it has, you know, five buttons, one of which is the  button with the grid.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  Now, I'm looking I don't know.  I don't I don't have a leo because I'm on Mac.  Yes, it should be a button with a grid somewhere.  Maybe in your footer in a new tab in Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I don't see it, but that's all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You might not have gotten it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Chrome is auto updated with better spell check spelled the same way you did it.  I thought that was you.  You going B-E-T-T-A-R.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, that was their headline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm a Google guys.  They're funny.  Funny, funny, funny.  I don't know where it is.  I don't see it anywhere.  I mean, here's all my apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It says that you'll get the launcher in the Windows task bar the first time you installed.  Oh, maybe it's all windows.  And windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And it's the it's the dev channel.  So I suppose you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Liam Laporte.  I'm in the dev channel.  Dev or beta?  Beta.  Oh, that's dev, not beta.  There's a difference.  Oh, no, I'm in beta.  Never mind.  So, yeah, so to be in the taskbar.  So it's not in the taskbar yet.  OK, good.  Cool.  I'll look for it.  Nice to know.  See what else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think, Leo, that I need to give an update.  I need to give the weekly update.  The rant.  We could even have a we actually have a rant theme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  After you're done, we'll play the rant through Jeff Rantz theme.  We have to do, of course, the Leistung Schutzrecht update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know you've been waiting for that, right?  Yes.  So it's been going through the Bundestag and there's been an effort to find a compromise.  Still dangerous.  But it's the funny thing is the one of the parties proposed amendment that said  there was OK to do one word quotes or small snippets.  One word.  Yeah, so nobody can own a word that says.  And that ridiculous, right?  One word you can.  How small is a small snippet?  You could never.  Well, that's the thing.  They didn't define it.  So one party defined it as 160 characters.  Convenient that it was nearly Twitter.  Twitter saw that a tweet would be OK.  And now they just really say small snippets.  The irony of this, as I understand it through my hazy, awful bad German,  is that what it means is the publishers went crazy, saying no, Google, you can't quote snippets.  You have to pay snippets, which was the entire purpose of the law.  We try to blackmail Google in a pain.  And now if that's out of the law, then what does it mean?  It just means that it's basically a copyright law again that says you've got to pay us for content,  but they don't define what's too small to pay for.  Right.  So it's going to be just as Larry Lussack would say, it's just a right to hire lawyers.  It's a fact a mess right now.  But that's my license should track update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do we have a rant theme yet or is that we're working on it still?  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  We're putting it in the queue.  That's from the same guy who did the changelog, right?  Yes.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  Jesse Wiener.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jesse Wiener.  We want to give Jesse a plug because Jesse's trying to make a career out of doing just that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just that.  God knows there must be somewhere that needs that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Somewhere.  Jesse said, I learned how to do this at Harvard and this is how the internet,  they have this people getting to know me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what Harvard is all about.  That's an Ivy League education for you.  Why did they launch a Nexus One into space?  It's the first phone.  To get to the other side.  All done.  Let's see.  France is going to, I want it now as bad as France is because I guess they're talking now about  data tax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is magnificently absurd.  So they want to say that now they're trying to go after it another way.  Trying to go after Google another way.  If you gather data about people, that has value.  So we should tax that.  Now, of course, the government should get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not us.  The government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What they're saying is, cut this down, then we're going to tax knowledge.  When you acquire knowledge, we're going to tax that.  How offensive can you get?  Mad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Mad, quoi.  Maybe that's how they're going to pay for the 20 billion euro high speed internet that  everybody in France is going to get.  This is Francois Hollande's idea.  If you're a smaller country, France is small geographically compact.  Not that small, but small enough, I guess.  What a great idea for jump starting economic development.  They say it could generate directly, generate 10,000 jobs, but it also creates a nation of  knowledge workers and you can tax that.  Yeah.  High speed broadband in the densely populated areas would be about $7 billion.  Telco is likely to bear the funding of that.  $20 billion, $13 billion to come from the federal government in the more rural areas,  the low population density areas.  This is what kind of a Google gigabit, right?  But done by the federal government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He said that it wouldn't all be paid by the government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  13 out of the 20 is government and $7 billion comes from.  They didn't say what speed, but what they define as high speed broadband is 50 megabits or better  down and 5 megabits or better up.  I'd like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have better than that now with my files.  Do you?  I'm jealous.  I got 50 down and 25 up.  I would move to France to get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And a few other things?  And a few other things.  Stinky cheese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How do you say this week in tech in French?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So classy.  Welcome to the set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm Leo Laporte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Kickstarter at the Oscars.  That's nice.  The that was pretty.  Academy Award.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Pretty amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  For what was the best short documentary?  Short.  It's a very nice short.  Yeah.  Was partially funded by Kickstarter.  There were a number of nominees.  I think if I'm not mistaken.  Kickstarter funded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have Perry from Kickstarter coming to speak to all my students on Monday.  We're really looking forward to any other guy we have coming to my class on Monday  is the founder of three doodler from last week.  Three doodler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, the three D doodler.  I will get yours yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, it's not gonna come for a while yet.  I went to the Kairos with a K conference at the New York Stock Exchange run by the son  of Navin Jane, an entrepreneur I've worked with many years ago.  And he just said, oh, yeah, I saw him at DLD.  You have to come.  Amazing 50 really great college entrepreneurs with another 350 college students there.  And then mentors read old people like me hanging around.  And there was really just amazing, amazing young people.  Well, so so Max, the guy who started the the co-founder of the three doodler just  happened to be there and there was an empty table.  And so he put down and I saw I saw the Eiffel Tower.  They made.  Wow.  A three doodler.  I said I bought one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You didn't buy one, Jeff.  You look kick started the project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's drawn the project.  So he looks around and he says, well, what was using the table?  So he opens up his notebook, shows me some stuff.  He pulls out a earlier prototype and he's like, they hit it to plays.  Every time he goes, you know, upwards making the 3D stuff, people go,  ooh, and they're all making that stuff.  It was great fun.  I can't wait to have it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm doing something wrong because I ordered stuff on Kickstarter,  but the stuff I get is not cool like this.  Well, this is.  I ordered this on Kickstarter.  It's called the you're wearing the ostrich pillow.  I swear to God, this is a seventy five dollar.  I've only received two things.  One's a bra.  You got your pebble.  You got your pebble.  It's the one I've had pebble even on open because I'm selling it.  Nice selling it.  What?  I'm selling.  Why are you selling it?  What are you wearing?  This is a Kickstarter project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You look like you you belong in like the Star Wars bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then you put your arms in the hole and then you put it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That needs to be on Sky Ball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why are you wearing that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Leo, what possessed you to buy that?  You got sucked in.  It was the heat of the Kickstarter video moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The same thing that convinced me to buy the Joey bra.  I don't know.  I lack Kickstarter taste.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The Joey bra for your man boobs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I was hoping to find a woman by then that would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gina at HD and she's just on a roll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So the idea of the Joey bra, see Joey is a baby kangaroo, right?  So the idea of the Joey bra is a brassiere with a pouch for your phone.  Now how much would you pay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, I love that.  Hey, I clipped my Fitbit to my bra.  I mean, you know, when you're built a certain way, there's lots of room for stuff there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you got a bra, you know, flaunt it.  But it was too small even for me.  Excuse me, my breasts are buzzing.  Anyway, next time I'm going to invest in a movie, a 3D doodler pen, something useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I finally get it.  So what is it?  You're giving it back?  I'm not going to sell it on eBay and make money.  Yeah, you probably will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The reviews are all saying, well, of course they are.  So how does this good if the phone rings?  Oh, my watch will ring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The reason I like it.  You can't go out face to face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You cannot walk around with a Chromebook pixel and then not have a pebble.  Why you got to have them both?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, what?  Oh, my goodness.  My watch says I'm getting a call and then you pull out your phone.  Of course, of course, you don't want to answer.  I hate phone calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can you can you respond to a smart watch back when they were called spot watches?  Yeah, it's the Microsoft radio on MSN.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a Microsoft spot watch.  All right, we're going to take a break.  Come back with your tips, your numbers, your tools.  Jenny, if you want to prepare something to talk about, please.  I have a number.  Oh, good.  Jeff, I'll have a number and you'll have a number.  You all got numbers.  But first a word from Podio.  This is, you know, it's great.  They have great faith in our ability to explain a product.  Citrix, we love Citrix.  They love us.  And I'm a little challenged by this because it's so open ended.  But the idea is when you're working in business, you have a lot of disparate sources of information.  Your email, you've got your Google Docs.  Maybe you use SkyDrive and you've got contacts in LinkedIn or Facebook.  You've got all these places.  It's spread out.  Podio is designed to create a workspace for all of this stuff so you can work the way you want to.  It has collaborative features so that you can have an information stream with your co-workers.  Now, the thing is, this is free.  So I want you to just try it.  What they ask you to do is go to podio.com, just sign up for free and create a workspace.  And that's the idea.  They have workspaces for all different kinds of things.  Project management.  We're going to do information feeds, CRM as they say.  So there's a lot of different things you could do with it.  So get in there, sign up, set up your first workspace, invite your team.  That's really important.  And we use it for show preparation.  We're going to absolutely use it for live events like when we do CES.  This is what we've been waiting for.  Something like this.  We use Google Docs, but don't worry.  It integrates beautifully with your Gmail, your Google Docs, with everything that you're using.  It's very flexible.  And I invite you to try it.  Podio, P-O-D-I-O.com.  If you're in business and you're trying to manage information,  trying to work with a team, podio.com, please try it.  It's absolutely free.  You don't have to pay anything to try it.  And the workspace, just pick one that you like.  It works the way you want to.  We've had some really interesting ways of using Podio that I've been very happy with.  Podio.com.  Sign in with your work email.  Then it'll be easy to invite your coworkers to get involved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  My favorite feature is you can make your own apps.  There wasn't really a perfect way for me to book guests.  And I could just-  Did you make a guest app?  Yeah.  Dude.  Yeah.  Share that with me.  That's awesome.  And so you can say, well, I need people's names to go here.  I need what show they're going to be on.  That isn't on any other guest app that I've found.  So you just design your own.  Make it.  Isn't that awesome?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And Podio let me create that.  There's a range of apps created by Podio, but also by third parties.  And you can put your app on the Podio app store as well.  So it is really cool.  P-O-D-I-O.com.  Give it a try today and let us know how you're using it.  Maybe we'll use you as an example in our next Podio commercial.  For triangulation in just a little bit, Corey Doctorow is going to join us.  He's got a sequel to his little brother book, Homeland.  It just came out.  We're going to talk about that.  Love, Corey.  Always lots of fun.  But we still have to wrap up this week in Google,  starting with Gina Trapani and her tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  My tip of the week is a pretty cool site.  It's called Secret Door and it's got a weird URL.  It looks like it's by a UK windows company, which is like glass windows,  from what I can tell, which is a little strange, but it's a it's  safe style dash windows dot co dot UK slash secret door.  And what it does is you click on the, you know, it shows you this door.  You click on it and it basically just brings you to a random but amazing street view photo.  Wow.  Leo just clicked on it and wound up in an office somewhere.  It's completely random.

Transcript:  With a duck in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's horses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  And then you can click on the door and go to another place.  Like I wound up at SeaWorld at one point and I wound up at a carnival at another point.  They're just completely random, but absolutely gorgeous street view images.  Oh, wow.  Leo, you keep clicking and we'll keep winding up indoors.  That's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Actually, that's Chad doing that.  I think they're all indoors.  Oh, it's Chad.  No, no.  I have one that looks like, I don't know, this is the boardwalk in Santa Cruz or somewhere.  I don't know where this is.  Yeah, it's just like outdoor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But they're all really like close up and kind of interesting places.  I'm not sure how they're picking these photos.  I'm not sure why a UK based windows company is hosting this,  but it just was really, it was really fun, really cool.  And I just spent, I spent some time just kind of clicking around and checking out places  and you can embed it into your website.  So the secret door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, look, I found rubble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, did you land?  Oh, nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  From the Fukushima area earlier.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I want to find out where this is.  Why would somebody map rubble?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  On the upper left.  Yeah, look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It doesn't really tell you, does it?  Yeah.  Kind of upper left hand corner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It just says address is approximate.  It doesn't give me a...  Because that's a nice looking bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's probably in Amsterdam or somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That is a really neat place.  But yeah, good place.  And I want to thank someone at Twitter.  I don't know if it was you, Chad, actually put this in the rundown and that's how I found it.  So thanks for saving me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Chad, click the Google logo in the lower left and that will open Google up in that spot.  Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There we go.  What a fun way to discover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Then you'll know where you are.  But how do you get back to the bar?  You can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I can't.  I'll just have to stay.  I'll have to keep secret dooring it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Never know where you are.  You could have gotten directions, but no.  Whoa, dude, you're in Siberia or somewhere.  That place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wow.  And is this...  Paisie.  Oh, it's during the...  This is Northern Lights or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Wow.  That's spectacular.  I've always wanted to see the Northern Lights.  So that's a strange address.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's a strange address.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't know.  Whoa.  Hurricane?  That's my garage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Damaged?  Well, why would they have an inside view of that?  I don't understand why they have damage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why it's not street view per se.  I think it's other...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It must be that backpack camera.  Actually, I mean, but why do they go in there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What are they thinking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is interesting.  In the side, there's levels and I believe that is...  What?  That's Japan.  Yeah.  Well, what floor I'm on.  Oh.  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So...  Ah, so you can go up a few floors to the roof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The secret door is at safestyle-windows.co.uk  slash secret-door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's really easy to remember.  I tried to make a bitly in time.  I apologize.  I didn't get to make an easy one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  People could find it.  They just Google secret door.  Yeah.  Why don't we give Danny a chance to give us a number?  Yeah.  My number is 10.  Very nice number.  Very nice number.  Particularly elegant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is today the 10th anniversary of AdSense.  Oh.  I'm sure you saw all the celebrations over there at Google  for something that's generating like $3 billion in profit for them per year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It must be their primary source of dough, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh.  Actually, the search ads are probably still making them the most of their money.  But it really has developed a lot more.  But the reason you're not seeing the celebrations is because Google actually  originally rolled out something that was called Google Content Ads.  And you had to pick out small partners and they deliberately worked with people.  But it was those contextual ads that down the line became AdSense.  So that actually happened 10 years ago today when the first kind of ads were out  and the program first opened up.  On I think it was March 3rd, they actually formally said,  hey, now we have Google Content Ads.  Then they bought a company called Applied Semantics in April of 2003.  And by June, they took a product that Applied Semantics had that did a similar thing  called AdSense, used that name and used some of the technology to go apply to their own product.  And then they relaunched it and called it AdSense in June.  So that's why you kind of have an early birthdate that's happening.  The product really was out there today and it really is 10 years old.  But it got its formal renaming and it opened up to the world.  And people could start doing all the self-serve stuff that is known for in June.  So heads up that when we get closer to June, you're probably going to have a big,  huge hurrah going on over at Google as they actually celebrate it properly that day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Awesome. Jeff, your number.  This is so much more fun than Ted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What are you? Were you invited?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'll never be invited to Ted. Why not?  I did a TEDx talk once on an education thing in New York.  And so I got up on stage and I raised my hands out.  I just said simply to begin and I'll censor myself.  This is BS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You have a knack.  That's all I got to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Lecture is wrong and they've come an education.  That's the whole point.  Yeah, it is. It's a Ted.  That's a lecture.  So I'll never be invited.  Plus I make fun of them in Twitter.  Did you see the great hashtag?  Oh, maybe I'm going to change my number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ted's going on right now in the...  I'm changing my number.  I'm changing my number.  It's just up the street for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it?  Yeah, it's up in Long Beach.  I used to go, but...  It's $8,000.  It is expensive, although, you know, most of it's tax deductible.  So, you know, if your company's paying for it and you could do it.  I had a conflict last year with our own show and then it kind of dropped off my radar this year.  Now they're moving back to...  They're going to move to Canada.  So...  Canada?  Yeah, they're going to go up to somewhere in British Columbia now because they want a new venue.  So anyway, but yeah, no Google Glass experience for me today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What I was going to do...  I was going to do...  Analysts saying that Google stocks going to hit $1,000 for the reasons that were just presented.  But instead, I'm going to do a hashtag.  Five is the number.  Look up the hashtag spelled out.  Five word Ted talks.  Oh, I like it.  Yes.  Yeah.  Mine yesterday was, I'm here, you're not.  Yeah.  That's pretty much it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I see Al Gore.  You don't.  Right.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Well, I don't know, you know, I mean, there's some neat Ted talks.  There are.  There are.  There are.  To their credit, they publish them for free after the fact.  That's all true.  It's all true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No pants is the new pants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's Annamarie Cox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's Annamarie's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That really?  That...  Wow.  She's talking about Anthony Weiner or is it something else?  What's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think you're talking about working at home.  That's what I assumed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  What about, hey, we didn't mention it, but Marissa Myers decided if you work at Yahoo,  you kind of come into the office.  That seems a little retro.  As I think it was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That was an interesting story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  ...Raf Raleigh said it was just bad PR.  Probably what it really means is it's all hands on deck, folks.  We got problems here.  Some of you are slacking off.  Some people were...  So fire them.  ...starting businesses while still on the payroll  because they were working at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It was data-driven.  She looked at the VPN access of remote workers and saw that they weren't putting in the time,  they weren't logged in and putting in the time that they should have been.  Of course it was a data-driven decision.  We're talking about Meyer here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So instead of firing them, she just said, you better come in.  It was customer service reps and stuff.  It wasn't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When you read some of those other articles,  the first thing you're like going, are you crazy?  Our company has 24 people.  We don't have a headquarters.  We all have to work at home.  I was like, really?  Wow, that is retro.  But I can't remember if it was a Business Insider article.  Maybe it was another one.  But it really did talk about this idea that there's apparently this culture  very unique within Yahoo where people...  Hundreds of people just aren't working.  I kind of got the impression after reading that, that this was really like,  we're going to pull it all back.  Everyone's coming back into the mothership.  And after we feel like we've got things sorted out,  maybe down the line, you'll get back into that with some more kind of control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, this is totally her saying, we mean business.  We got to get this company back together.  And I agree, Leo.  I know that these workers...  This was, I believe, management for this guy.  But bad management of the workers that they're not getting their work done.  I completely agree.  But I bet that once she just wanted to rein back in,  get competent management in place, and that this won't be a permanent thing.  But this is just her way of saying...  Horrible PR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was a really obnoxious kind of Ted pretender called the Wisdom 2 Conference.  Just the title sends my teeth going crazy.  And so I forget who it was, but was on stage,  was just railing at Marissa for being anti-women, anti-feminist, anti-this, anti-that.  She's got to run a company.  I get that, that it's not exactly forward thinking,  but she's got an issue with her company and she's trying to get it back on track.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It betrays something, though, because it would just as easily have been easy to do this.  Go to the managers, say who's not performing.  Yes, you're right.  One by one, call them back in.  To put out a company-wide memo,  which Kara Swisher will of course immediately publish and did.  Yes.  Is just kind of tone deaf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You would think that, and it sounds that way, but  but the scale of it, first of all, it wasn't,  obviously it was going to leak out there.  And if they had gone through it a different way, realized it was going to leak,  they could have done it.  But you probably don't want to be going out there saying,  hey, our company is really dysfunctional.  We don't even know if people at home are working,  therefore we're going to do this sort of thing.  That's a point.  That was one thing.  But the other thing is that it's difficult to go and say to somebody,  is somebody who works for you but doesn't work with you actually working.  I literally don't know if I have,  I have like 12 people who work for me in different ways,  because our company is divided up and I'm on the editorial side.  I literally don't know what they're doing.  I don't know that they're actually spending eight hours a day  doing all the stuff that they're supposed to be doing or whatnot.  That's largely by trust.  The good news is I feel great about all my remote workers, right?  And I am a remote worker and I never get into the position  where I don't feel like someone's pulling their weight.  But if I really was in that kind of thing,  that'll be a hard thing for me to document, much less just say,  I'm going to reach for my binder and pull out and say,  well, yeah, okay, well, that one hasn't been doing it or whatever.  So, I could see this coming into this.  We're going to pull back.  We're going to get back to a baseline and then we can see what we go with it from there.  But it certainly did blow up into a PR nightmare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And she knew that that would happen.  She knows that Kara is going to publish her internal money.  You know, that's what Kara does.  I kind of gave her kudos for making an unpopular decision  in the service of getting the company back on track.  And regardless of what other people think,  it really could go either way.  And one of the articles about it said that she's been really frustrated  watching the Yahoo parking lot being really kind of slow to fill up in the morning  and very quick to empty out at 5 p.m.  I mean, if anyone says anything about her,  it's that she'll work anybody under the table.  I mean, she works.  She's a complete workhorse.  So, I can see how seeing that would be so frustrating to her.  And I think this is just about, hey, clean house, we mean business.  This is what's happening.  And, you know, here's your iPhone, but you better show up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, but then that's to me a symptom of something which is a bad thing,  which is she lost her temper,  did something that was a PR mistake in a fit of pique.  And that shows a lack of control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, no, I don't know that that I mean, I didn't get any impression.  This was like some sort of I'm really angry type of thing.  It's not I mean, there was this impression that I got that impression.  The article gave the impression that she didn't like the people weren't coming in,  but I didn't get the impression that she suddenly snapped  and said this is what could have happened.  I mean, you know, the way she seems to have gone at things is I'm going to come in here,  I'm going to assess these different things.  And I could see her saying, all right, I don't like that this is happening.  And I see all this other stuff going.  Therefore, our solution is going to be we're going to all pull it back.  So maybe it is that kind of thing.  It just I didn't I didn't come away with the impression.  She came in one day on Monday morning and said, where the hell is everybody?  I had her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Damn it.  Everybody better show up.  Listen, this was a layoff.  This was an easy way for her to do a layoff without it being a layoff.  Ah, oh, right.  Some people are going to leave.  Yeah, a lot of people are going to leave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All those losers who are working at home are going to leave.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Although some people did say, you know, the reason why I work at home is because I can't stand  the constant cheerleading and parties and water cooler chatter.  And I get a lot more done at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So and they're also saying then and they also say, and for those of you who occasionally  have to stay home for the cable guy, please use your best judgment in the spirit of collaboration.  Like, don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah, well, be judicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, don't.  Hey, I've wanted to send out this memo for years.  Are you kidding?  But I don't dare because I know Kara Schwisher will publish it.  You know, we have to go into the office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, that's it.  That's it.  We're moving to Petaluma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Gina Tripani, you stay in San Diego.  You used what it is.  What does he say in Anchorman?  Stay classy, San Diego.  Classy Gina Tripani.  Well, something like that.
