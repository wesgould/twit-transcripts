Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Find like 20 more things new at Google every week. So good. Thank you for everybody who participates  we have a wonderful community and I I  Appreciate it. So again this Friday 10 a.m  If you're not a member of Club twit you want to attend go to  Twit TV slash Club twit. Wow. This was a very busy week. I kind of almost want to start with the Facebook stuff  Facebook was down of course on Monday  Which I know it's the timing is a little suspicious  Given that it was the next day after Francis Haugen. We now who the know who the whistleblower was  Went on 60 minutes and then the day before she testified in front of the Senate  And I think fairly damning  testimony  Facebook  The verge said took a page out of big tobacco by instead of addressing her accusations  attacking her  And that you know, I think is a little bit frustrating  Facebook's very common. Yeah, I mean, that's how you take out a whistleblower. Yeah  And so I think that's a little unfortunate Kara Swisher asked Alex Deimos

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What they should have said and he had a wonderful  Statement saying  Basically, we brought in people like her to work on these issues and it's too bad. She's not still they're working on them  But we're trying to do this and that they could have they could have done it right. There was nothing they could say

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There was really nothing they could say  That definitely would have given him a little better light though

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is basically saying hey, we acknowledge these are our concerns and we want to make this better and she is clearly qualified for this  She is clearly qualified for this and but nope

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you can't just start being evil start hard to stop isn't it? It's it's part of your mo you're like, uh,  How do we do this discreditor today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Facebook wrote a senate sub  Commerce subcommittee held a hearing with a former project manager at facebook  Who worked for the company for less than two years had no direct reports?  Never attended a decision point meeting with c-level executives and testified more than six time  What the heck is that? Yeah, I don't know six times to not working on the subject matter in question

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But she had documents. Yeah, and the documents were sufficient. Yeah, they're they don't play these things  Well, they they they don't know how to I was thinking all week. This is a very much a stacy moment  Of well, we need a conversation  And this is caused conversation and to me what's more interesting than than even what she said  Is the conversation around it right and and a lot of people are afraid after the testimony what I heard from  people I trust like  Maznik and and Jeff Kossoff and  And and nate pursley and kate clonick and daphne keller and all those folks  Is we could be heading toward kind of a government disinformation arm, which in the wrong hands could be really scary  And so there were things about it that might have the wrong way  But there were there were things that need to be discussed nate pursley had a great op and I put in all kinds of  Takes on this everybody had a take on this  um  Uh and and was suggesting legislation around  Transparency of data. I think that's the my hope is that's what comes out of this  Is a structure for transparency of data so researchers can find out what the real impact is  And and that would be the conversation. I think they need to ban finsta right here right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then it'll be okay. This is the reason I understand why will you commit the banning?  Have they been running finsta, sir?  I really understand why people are reluctant to let congress  Weigh on in this and I think francis haugan proposed the whistleblower proposed  Something that doesn't necessarily involve lawmaking they that you know dick blumenthal and others really pressed her  Well, should we make a law?  Well, she and she kind of had to say well, yeah, you should make a law but really  I thought what she said about moral bankruptcy was interesting  She basically said the right thing is for facebook to do at this point would be to say  Yeah  We screwed up more we declare moral bankruptcy. We did something wrong and we don't know how to stop it  We don't know how to fix it, which is completely legitimate. It's a tough  I think which I think is where it is. Yeah, and so it's a what facebook should say is it's we we don't know how to fix it  But we would like your help and I don't mean congress should make a law  She said change section 230. I think that's exactly not the thing to do  Uh what what facebook should do?  You know facebook's defense was well, we did all this research  You know, we do care  But we didn't do anything about it facebook should a release all the research in full  You're hiding the results of the research. Yeah, they did it, but they don't want anybody to know how damaging facebook can be  and then b  and stop blocking legit researchers like nyu  From doing their own research on facebook data. Let's look at this. Let's put light in here

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was thinking about this before the show and and and how to how to tackle this  and and  There's a lot of talk about algorithms being bad and I hate the demonization of algorithms and I even hate the demonization of targeting and

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, she she did say which I agree with her put it in chronological order. That's what everybody wants

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's where I disagree. That's where I disagree. You have that option now and it's and it turns it off every time  Um, let me let me it's all sort of crappy feed. Let me turn on when you go back. It will be off again  Let me ask the question  I think the real focus that comes out  Is and it's the same problem with media. It is the attention economy  And metrics based on engagement. Yes  so  if you're going to rebuild if you if tomorrow you own facebook all the three of you you are the new board of directors of facebook and  Engagement metrics are decided to be corrupting  What metrics would you use to decide what a good feed is and what a good business is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, she said something I think important which is you might in the short term make less money if you turn off  I'm fine with that. Well, she said in the long run  I believe facebook will do better because it will be less damaging to its users

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think I think that's simplistic and I think that's that's wrong. I think that's my question  Isn't though what facebook is about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's what facebook said when they their promise when they came along was  Follow your friends and family  See what they're up to and share what you're up to with them. That is not what facebook does anymore because of algorithmic

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's because it wants to sell ads

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't understand why it does it  But it could still sell ads against what it promised to get lied to us  It said give us give us your content follow your friends judged what we liked based on engagement

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And if i'm going to go back to my question if engagement is a bad metric, let's just go back to what you promised  But then even then you have too many posts in a day as as I think it was  Casey newton said no, you're only going to see the random little bit of fine. That's what twitter is too

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know it's up to you. It's up to you. That's not true. By the way, that's not true  Look if I follow my mom my kids and my high school sweetheart. I am not going to see too many posts in a day

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, I don't want to follow those those three people  I want to follow and find more interesting people, but I also want to I want some prioritization  That's not facebook. You're dodging my question, which is if you could redesign facebook around a better algorithm  You follow what you're interested in

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what twitter was until recently

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What what if you bifurcated it into personal so leo you will only be you'll be kind of like a freeloader on facebook in the  Sense that you're only going to follow your close friends and family jeff might be someone who's willing to  Follow a wider assortment of people and see different ads. I mean the issue is  There's not a large cut

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the issue. It's whether facebook's in control of what you see or you're in control of what you see. Yeah, that's all fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want to make those controls more obvious, but I go back to my yahoo  We had control of my yahoo and nobody went back to it because it's a pain people don't do personal though

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They don't do dials. What are you talking about? My yahoo? I don't know what you're talking back in the day  We all set up a my yahoo that was a news page that wasn't about following friends or family never went back to it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, that wasn't just saying when you say people want more control and I agree philosophically. I'm not sure people it's not complicated

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're already doing that when you join facebook you follow your friends and you do it  You go through this wonderful facebook feed by the way, a beautiful facebook feed  You go through this dumb exercise that facebook wants you to think you're going to get to see what you ask to see  And instead they tell you what you're going to see and if you even if you follow your mom  You will not see all of her posts  You may not see any of her posts, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I get nice surprises in facebook that I wouldn't have seen if I just stuck the chrono when I go in every three days

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're gonna have to throw that little serendipity thing out  That's the mistake is that facebook and you've returned to mass media. No, you haven't just it's exactly the opposite  You've returned to personal media. You're following what you want  Not what facebook tells you you want that's the whole problem in a nutshell  And by the way, they make plenty of money doing that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could you could put a dial for more or less serendipity

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I guess

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. It seems like it does a bad job with the serendipity. Yes. That's the things that are suggested

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How many people clicked on well, that's because their metric was engagement  And if you are going to show people if you're going to surprise people with stuff  You can't surprise them with anything. That's less than like a six or seven on the oh my god scale

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know exactly it has to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're gonna have to stop right now the  I my facebook's fine thing. That's people say that all the time about all of this stuff. Yeah  Mine's fine. What's your problem?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What are you starting? No, why are you telling me to stop that because it's not useful  That doesn't solve the problem  Yes, it is because because it's because the presumption in the narrative is that every single feed on facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because it says cool crap. I'm gonna tell you why your experience isn't useful. That's what i'm saying. Thank you older white man  Who has a very different experience based on the types of things you're interested in the types of people you follow then  A lot of other people and your experience is going to also be different because of the fact that you're you know a guy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, I i'm all true, but I also choose I I ignore people I don't like I get rid of them and it makes life perfectly pleasant

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, so you ignore people you don't like are those people being served up to you by the algorithm or is that someone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I unfollow them. I I get rid of them. It's not hard. Well, then there's no problem. Facebook's fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's the problem? Jeff facebook's great  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Facebook is great. Okay, but if there's a way so clearly my local bar is great  So clearly my neighborhood is great, but i've got some a holes here in it and I ignore them jeff if you're in the facebook is great

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  camp  Thanks. Anyway, we'll talk uh to somebody else about it because you're in the very small minority that says facebook's great  You say nothing needs to be show me the data. Are you saying that nothing needs to be changed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So two billion people are miserable they're all there because they hate it and they're miserable and they're forced to be there every day

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is also this is also instagram and whatsapp  And I think that's worth noting because some of our most vulnerable people are not on facebook, but they are on whatsapp or at this point

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  At this point jeff, you're just saying there's no problem. So move on. No, i'm not saying that at all leo

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've just spent time saying that there's a problem and i'm trying to get to a more helpful  Constructive way to rebuild facebook from scratch saying that there's a huge problem with their business model built on attention  And on engagement so your but your feed is perfect. I agree there's a problem here, but your feed is fine  I'm just saying it's possible. So the problem is in facebook. The problem is people not doing a good job with their feed  Well, you're the ones who are saying it was more control and I use that control your

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Your argument is my experience is good so we don't need to change anything that is like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just argued for huge fundamental change in facebook  All i'm saying is number one if you think that every single facebook feed is awful  Then you're basically accusing how many people now three billion people are being the idiots

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're just saying they're at all facebook's putting its thumb on the scale and creating huge problems with their algorithms  They they know that there's a problem and they bury the research  When somebody comes out and says i'm agreeing with all of that when someone comes out with a research and says here's the problem  They say well that person really doesn't know what they're talking about

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But what i'm disagreeing with you on is go to chrono and everything is okay. That's that's ridiculous  Uh, i've seen pure chrono facebook and i've seen pure chrono twitter and I don't like them very much

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh, I think that's what facebook promised facebook did not promise us  That they that we will show you what you want as opposed to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Very big the news feed promised they were going to be be selecting what would you would find interesting but very beginning  Now again, i'm saying there's a fundamental problem there. I'm not i'm not arguing with you guys on that  I'm just saying that the simplicity of twitter got better when you break them up or that stuff is too simplistic

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And there's a harder question here. So facebook shows you things you don't follow right? It picks stuff for you, right?  Does twitter do that?  twitter does too

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, twitter shows you stuff happens because a friend of mine followed something a friend of mine liked a friend of mine did something

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then it comes in right feed but always comes to you as a retweet from a friend, but you don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Twitter doesn't inject stories. Oh, yeah twitter puts. Oh, no twitter does sir twitter will put a post right there on your screen  That says so-and-so replied to this  Whether I was interested in it or not

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They it only put it there. Oh, I don't see that I turn it off. So twitter's fine

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm trying to say that there's a more fundamental problem slap him and it's fine  You can scream about how the world was awful. Well, I just disagree with you. I think the problem is the problem is algorithms

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the problem. That's that's the problem with youtube. That's the problem with facebook. If twitter's doing that  That's the problem with twitter. It is the algorithms are not optimizing for anything except engagement  And I think this is what francis howgen said when you optimize for engagement you optimize for extremism

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what else could you optimize for is what i'm trying to get you to address?  Engagement is meeting that's what we're doing right now is going for engagement people can say hey  Listen to them and they yell about this and that we're going for engagement right now two and a half hours worth  That's what we do too  So what is the alternative to I do you I still believe it's good for people to talk with each other and find a way to  Connect online let me ask you this. So how do we do a better job? Let me ask you this then is facebook a media property  No, you've heard this before no

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, but  So media media optimizes for engagement  Because that's the job

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What is facebook facebook and twitter and google took on media's business model? Yes  Because the ad industry that's what the ad industry buys  You're going to get back you can't have it both if you ask me you can't have it both ways either facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is a platform for people to share with one another which they would like to pretend they are or they are media  Which optimizes for engagement you can't have it both ways. I don't think

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's fair what you just said  That is a pretend going on here. Yes. They want us to connect. Yeah, they want us to connect  That was their mission way back when but they also want to profit make a crap ton of money  And all the way to do that is to algorithmically  Show us stuff that's going to have people more engaged on it  Whether it's great content or really really horrific content something that's going to make people hit like something  That's going to make people hit reshare and comment on it over and over and over again

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's that's where they want to win. So what would be a better job? What would be a better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you want to start a whole new by the way jeff i've told you four times what my solution is and you just reject  It out of hand  You say let's not you can't do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, no, I do because if I want to follow more than 10 people it's going to follow anybody  I want some let me I want some mechanism to help choose that no facebook should not put it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No facebook should not put its thumb on the scale  Because facebook cannot be trusted to do that because they're going to optimize from for profit

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're doing it to the wrong metrics is what i'm trying to get to  No, no, i'm trying to imagine they're doing it to the exact right metrics. You're just saying that any choice any jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, just as we optimize for engagement any media business should optimize for engagement  They're doing it to the exact right metrics if they're a media platform if they are a sharing platform  They shouldn't put their thumb on the scale at all. You should follow who you want and see what you want  Period. I don't see why that's so complicated. Let me turn they try it this way

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So jack dorsey in his talk of was a blue sky or whatever it's called  Uh, right  Um, you you envision a different architecture where where speaking is the commodity platform  But there's a value added layer where people find the stuff that's worth listening to  I want that service. I want someone to go as I did with my  I put the thumb on the scale with my cobit twitter list. I chose 600 people  I am god and I found there's value in it, right and I offered it to others and you can take my suggestions  You can reject them  But I did put my thumb on the scale to that extent, right? I chose I want that as a service  But if it's done to what you did is human to human though one more one more if it's done to  Pure engagement and attention. It will be corrupted. So what are other mechanisms?  There is jeff. I'm gonna say it one more time

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you're really thick on this. There is only one mechanism which is to optimize for profit  That's the only mechanism a for-profit company will will use  That is optimizing for engagement. They are equal  And the minute facebook puts its thumb on the scale in any direction  They're going to optimize for profit. It would be dumb of them to optimize to make less money. Why would they do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  um  Their argument there I want to hear from stacey here because i've been talking the three guys been talking too much  But i'll answer your one question  their argument there is  um  That a bad experience is not profitable in the long run  Right, and if this is such a cesspool and such a miserable experience and if people come here and all they see is hate  Um, and and that we force them to do that. That's bad business now. That's  glib  But I think there's an underlying point there that says that if this thing is so miserable to so many people  Then it's not in the long run going to be a good business  so  are there other  measures of quality and value to people in their lives  uh  That yes may not be as profitable as augan says but we're trying to end up at the same place there  We're just trying to get there in different ways. You see only i'm not gonna say this is all facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Some of some of it is the users too we we do have a choice to not use these platforms and not  engage on the stuff that we  See pushed up through the no

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you know if you're a q anon fan and you want to follow all q anon stuff on facebook  You should absolutely be allowed to I think facebook wants to be a media company but pretends  It's a platform for sharing  And it's in it. That's exactly how they got into this problem  And as soon as they put their thumb on the scale in favor of profit  Aka engagement they're equal  That's when you get this problem and youtube's done it and now twitter's doing it and in all three cases  That's when extremism gets pumped up  I don't think you should see anything. You don't follow on any platform  Then you would solve it  Yeah, and if you think your your friends family and the news sources you want to follow are boring  You're not saying that you're saying it's too much  So you're gonna let facebook curate it. Well, that's a media platform showed you some new york times and some washington post  No, no, I can find the new york times wash. I can find all that stuff myself that becomes a media platform  That's a curation platform  inherently problematic  Curation from a company optimizing for profit is inherently problematic stacey you agree we do disagree

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you can't do anything at scale when it comes to  To moderating or if you're going to pick  And this is this is actually this is common across all  In anything technological anything that requires computation whether it's using like sensors to optimize factory production or  Trying to optimize for engagement if you're trying to optimize for profit, which people are  At a large scale things are going to  People are going to gum up the work so maybe it's people being jerks  Maybe it's people slacking off on their brakes or getting rsi  Injuries because they can't work as hard as you would like to optimize them for the point is we have faith in technology  To solve these problems  But we can't apply technology uniformly to people in any way whatsoever  To do otherwise is to break free will right you end up with this horrible dystopian place  So knowing that all of our companies are going to use technology to optimize right now for profitability if they're publicly traded  That's cool. They're fiduciary duty in most of their cases. We have to figure out how to price in  All the externalities that they're ignoring. So if it's social media also, we have to figure out what our harm  What are the externalities that we're ignoring?  What are the harms and how do we mitigate those and that's kind of what you're asking jeff?  But you're saying it it's not what do you optimize for it's how do you  Price in things knowing that you they're like that a lot to optimize for profit. So I like that a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that and that goes to the you know  When I was on my my transatlantic high level working group on content moderation freedom of expression  Where what we came to was where I think the discussion heads now  Where nate personally from stanford heads is we have to get the data out of facebook to understand what the impact is  to then  Uh, I used to say create those interventions, but I think you're right to then identify the costs  And and now facebook just says we're gonna throw through 40 000 people getting rid of of crappy content. Okay. Okay that that's that's not it  Meanwhile people who are getting um harassed have nowhere to go  Um, because that's not valued because there's no cost put to that. So I like that a lot stacey. I think that's a great mechanism  To look and say there's cost to everything right there's cost to cars and so we add in the seat belts  We require every manufacturer to do that. We all agree. We're going to spend money on that, right?  So that's an interesting thing to say when you have people online, which I celebrate  What are the costs that end that we now know?  End up coming and what do we do about that? What do we demand as investment against that? Is that a fair summary?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is but you have to also be aware that you know  Everybody's externalities are going to be a little bit different like some people think  The cost of like a cheap consumer good is  More valuable to them than the cost of preserving the environment, right?  Right because they're thinking short term versus longer. So, I mean this is hard  This is this is why i'm always like we need a nuanced discussion and we need to decide what we want to give up  And what we don't which is how you get the policy. Yes  So, okay. Hey, let's talk about failures because  y'all  This is no, I don't want to talk about failures  Can we talk about do we want to talk about bgp and dns or do we not care about that at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think we've actually talked about it quite a bit on  On security now and other security now. We can talk about something  We could do the run. We don't have to do the rundown if you're doing it to change the subject. I don't mind if  You're if you want to change the subject or are you really fascinated? I would like to talk about anything other than this. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hate to tell you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the top this is the top story of the of the week though. This is really I know the top story  I mean, I guess you're right. We're not going to make any progress at this point

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  y'all are just going y'all are getting real loud and cranky and  Oh, no, it's just

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Structure of problems just passionate

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This this triggers all kinds of craziness i'm a bad punted I can't even listen to you  I  Need you to hold my hand through this

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I got you. I got you. I think in the long run

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think in the long run what's going to happen if you add all the data and you do all the research and list stuff  Is you're just going to come up again and again with the problem that  Facebook it says it's a platform is a media company is optimizing for engagement because it's profitable and there really isn't  there  Either it's a media company, which case you can say it's fox news. I mean like i'm not saying fox news  Uh should be stopped  They're engaged. They're optimizing for engagement. That's fine. And your choice is not to watch it or watch it  Whichever you please. I don't think that is an issue  I think it's a much bigger issue that facebook promises  Something and delivers something else and it does it in a very sneaky way  I think the real reason they don't release this data is they don't really want people to understand  A how much they're algorithmically massaging your feed and b the consequences of that whether it's instagram or facebook  whatsapp doesn't really come into this conversation because  It's just a messaging platform. In fact, what's app I would say there's a lot of damage going on

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, which your algorithmic goes out the window there. No, I agree whatsapp. You're only talking to people that you actively talk to

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Um, what I don't know what you're gonna do about that. So what so jeff? That's the same thing. It's a common carrier problem  There's all sorts of horrible stuff going on in the telephone company, but it's not their responsibility

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I hate to throw children since we're gonna if we're gonna keep talking about this we have to focus less on  the jeff's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Situation and more on how the kids I agree. I thought it was interesting congress really focused the senators really  Focused it about kids and I think that's politically safer and easier than saying well, it's important

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have to protect our kids and like and i'm not saying this like it's some sort of pearl clutching crazy lady  I'm just saying this from the standpoint of here's here's here's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What instagram and facebook tell kids?  Put your pictures on here and and look at the pictures of your friends  Mm-hmm, and it's very simple and and you know, you know, I think there probably are issues with adolescent girls  Looking at their friends pictures and getting you know, bad body image messages and so forth. That's a societal problem  I don't think that that's instagram's problem  I don't think instagram should be required to somehow  And I don't even know how they would fix that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think that's fixable you can you can also see like and I don't know where instagram falls on this  But like, you know how tik tok prioritizes certain  uh  You know, they they what's the word i'm looking for brings to the for you page things like white people tik tok is a perfect example

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  of the opposite of a totally algorithmic feed  I follow the my son for instance and he never shows up when I look at following  They are not they are literally not showing me his content because they've decided algorithmically. I don't want to see food content  So that's the tik tok is the actual worst of the thing. I mean  That's as bad as you can get and I i'm i'm not going to slam tik tok because henry's getting to a million followers  He's doing very well  But honestly, no tik tok tik tok is a perfect example of what's wrong with this stuff  And you know what? That's the next one where you're going to hear i'm surprised you're not hearing more of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh my god, they're not a us-based company. Right? What are you gonna do about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, well they can they could ban it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Um, yeah, that's gonna go I think honestly  I I think algorithm is the problem and I think the promise facebook gave us  No, it is. It's absolutely the worst you're demonizing algebra

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, i'm not demonizing algebra. He's not demonizing algebra

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's demonizing the people who use out the fact that you can't scale an algorithm  You have to pick something to optimize for and if you're optimizing for profit  You're going to optimize for engagement and it's just not nuanced like add

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's no way you can say well, I think we're gonna make this algorithm a little bit better  So it doesn't hurt children. You can't nuance it you can't  It's an algorithm and i'm not demonizing the algorithm. I'm demonizing the people who use it's the same thing in world of warcraft  You when you're playing world of warcraft. Wait a minute. What no no listen when you play world of warcraft  No, no, it's there's a very this is clearer. So it's less  Charged when you play world of warcraft you bet you team up with other players to go on raids, right?  And when you go on raids you get loot drops. So the the people who do world of warcraft watch  Very closely your engagement time in world of warcraft and they tie it to the loot drops. They can tune the loot drops  To make sure you engage more  There is a loot drop. It's just stuff you get from the raid. It's all made up  Stuff you get from the winnings and just like it. Well vegas does the same thing  You think vegas doesn't pay very close attention to what payoffs make you play  Slot machines longer. It's all all of this engagement stuff is all the same  They are feedback loops and the problem with technology is a very rapid feedback loop  And pretty much the humans don't get involved. They can they can tweak little factors, but they it's a it's what jeff bezos  Calls the flywheel that gets faster and faster and faster and it happened with world of warcraft became very addictive  Because they knew exactly how to tune it for optimization for engagement  And I think that's exactly what's happening on facebook. It's exactly what's happening on youtube  And when you optimize for that kind of engagement you let you lose control of what's happening  There's no way to tweak it to make it  Safe that would that's a fool's errand

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's fascinating is as much as sometimes the instagram algorithm pisses me off  I look at youtube and i'm like how what is youtube doing different?  To make the algorithmic experience much more enjoyable for me

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Instagram can't instagram is interesting because they don't show you at the top of your feed anybody you don't follow  They save that for later

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  After you've gone through all of the pictures i've gone through my current stuff  It'll say i'm caught up now other stuff you might like this other stuff out and then i'm like, yeah, i'm out  Yeah, that's the algorithm. I'm like, what are you doing wrong here?  YouTube doesn't do that for me. Well, it might not work for you, but it might work for others, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Remember they're not optimizing for you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, right, right  How selfish of me self-centered?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Anyway, i guess shutting up because he doesn't want to get in a fight but uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, come on throw him another date. I tried to start to have  You're saying that i'm trying i'm trying to do something otherwise and you say it's simply impossible  So we disagree about that. I think the I the internet is young and if we say the internet is finished  And these are the only owners and we're screwed  Then we give up the responsibility and the agency to build the internet that we want what would a social network look like?  Where people can connect you have one answer, which is a you follow all the people you get you got all of that  I don't think that's a very good experience if you want a media experience

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We've said it already  Um, you know mastodon you only see what you follow  It's a very good uh social experience that's social i'm seeing the people I follow they see me we have conversations  I don't see what's so bad about that. Jeff. Your only argument against it is it's too much  We'll stop following so many people

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But do you have the one you want and i'll have the one I want and why can't we have that because

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A media platform pretending to be a social media platform  Is problematic well, let's get to the real basis wolf in sheep's clothing  There you go. Thank you. It's a wolf in sheep's clothing. Thank you. It's using the engagement  Let's go further. It's using the engagement techniques of a fox news on a what purportedly social site and that's not what you're getting

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's why it's problematic. Well, let's talk about at&t and oan not to change the subject yet  I'm sure we'll get to it, but the same problem. No, i'm not going to even do this story

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't even know why this story is in here. I know exactly why this story

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I find it fascinating. It's a roiders. It's a major roiders story  It's not it's not some made-up thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So one big company

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  funded another decided that to get their merger through and for other other other motives and reasons and to engage certain parts of their  Audience so they get more subscribers. They basically created oan. So what? Oh, no, no, no at&t has always been super

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Super conservative just as a company. Yeah, I don't even understand what's wrong with that  They're like the coke company but the cave yeah, yeah, so what's wrong with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what businesses do they create thing is that's a media company

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't have to watch oan and they own it. Yeah. Yeah, they own up to that. You don't have to watch face book

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I don't as a matter of fact, I don't yeah at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But but I would love it. So you're the opposite of me you're so you're saying that my experience doesn't work  Well, neither does yours because you want to deny everybody the experience and say this is so awful  So we're a different size of the same coin  What if you want to keep this discussion going don't we can keep it going or we can move on you don't think face book is awful

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You don't think face book is awful

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He clearly does not okay. No as a whole

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What if you said you had to be 18 to participate on any of these platforms

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that makes some sense. However, try to enforce that  It's going to be hell and age verification and lots of other problems. Actually kids don't want to go on go on

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, they want to be on instagram

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can't keep focusing on face book and it's algorithm. We have to talk about instagram and others too. You're right

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think instagram is as bad to be honest with you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Instagram is horrid  It is horrid for kids. They sit there and they tag each other because they're in parties  Then you feel left out. That's because we're because that's where the kids are. That's a that's a kid problem a society problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. I don't think that's an instant. It makes it easy for them to see it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's all it is. It just makes it and then it glamorizes bad things

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It glamorizes a life people don't how would you prevent that? Would you not allow your kids online?  Because anything that they do online is going to end up being that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's I mean the bullying and things that go on via instagram. Well bullying goes on online in a lot of ways

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a social problem. That's a kid problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you can go away from it without like if you're all of your friends are communicating in this one place  You're gonna go to that place if they're all at the watering hole and you're gonna be at the watering hole with right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, if they all went to the mall and they were bullying at the mall, would it be the mall's problem?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but at the mall, it's a lot fewer people can go find you at the mall  It's a higher it's a higher friction experience to bully someone at a mall than it is online  And there's a there's limitations on the number of people who can

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See you at a mall. Well, this is where i'm going to be on jeff's side, which is  This is a feature of the internet  And yes, and it's a I agree. It's problematic, but I don't know if the problem is the internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you're marketing it to kids or society

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Um, yeah, but kids are good. Even if you didn't market it to kids kids would use it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, but we were just you know the problem with the age limit that's it's it's harder for kids to buy cigarettes  Even though kids do still smoke because we implemented laws against it, right when I was a kid  You know, you could still smoke if you really wanted to but it was kind of a pain in the ass

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So even in china where they are pretty effective laws and they even make you sign up with a driver's license for your internet access

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somehow kids under 13 are getting some people are going to break through. Okay, but some people are not I mean that's we can't just say well

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This law is clearly doesn't bullying happen through texting as somebody's pointing out in the chat room. It can yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So but again, you're not you don't spread it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As far you don't you can't like oh, I imagine there are group. There are group texts that are

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there are group texts  But those group texts are I mean being bullied on something like twitter or facebook is a lot different than being bullied by friends in your  Text thread, even if it's 200 people

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Look i'm sympathetic. I mean, it's horrible when a kid's bullied and the consequences can be devastating and even life-threatening  But I don't know if you can  I mean that's turning off you say well, you can't go to the mall. You can't turn on the internet  You can't turn on texts. You can't have a phone  In fact, why don't you just stay home and you won't be bullied?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So let's bring in dana boyd now who says we try to over protect our children  We we harm them terribly and they can't find people who feel like them right and right and you lose they lose  They're they're growing up. Yeah, because we lots of kids are bullied on the playground at school. Mike my son was

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's definitely a balance in that because yeah, the instagram can be quite problematic. But at the same time  We hope that these children have some  uh sensible adults in their life to tell them hey none of this stuff is is  What you think it is people are doing a lot of phony below i'll give you an example make themselves look better and  And and you know  They have to try to draw the line and let them know what reality is and what really matters in life and stop buying into the  Body shame and stuff. I think it was  2017 or 2018  There was a kid that committed suicide at the hardhead school  And that was a really really big ordeal to talk to them. You know, they were much younger  and  Just seeing the  Just seeing how they reacted to it because they just assumed  everything was about  Instagram and snapchat or whatever the apps were at that particular time and I had to tell them look there's more to life than just  These apps right here. There's there's other things that are going to take precedence and we got to help find the balance still  Enjoy your time with your friends on these mobile apps and whatnot  But you do have to understand look i'm going to draw the line on the stuff that I catch you posting  I can't stand these kids posting all of this braggadocious stuff because  That's what it leads to it leads to other people feeling like everybody is is leaving them out and it's not even  Factual, you know just  Again, just have some sort of sensible adult  Around for these children, but I don't even know if that's a guarantee

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Unfortunately, so can I can I use it?  It's not so so there's an example today from tik tok  Where we see all kinds of stories out there  Um  Alerting to a trend on tik tok that you should go and slap a teacher  Now, yes, I would think that any sensible student  sensible parent  would  Already have taught their kids not to slap teachers your teachers  And so i've got a dang gum email about tick tock's going to cause this rash and if it does  Isn't there to an's point a different problem that we've got to grapple with

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  with

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yes, but so to these kids having social credibility  It's like you know when you're that age and you're like if all of your friends ran off a bridge would you run to?  Yeah, they would they would do something incredibly stupid because peer acceptance is way more important with them at this stage  right  A lot of other I mean slapped a teacher

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean just because it's just I would like to think that it's face

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would like to think that my kid wouldn't either it but there are other kids who are very easily led  Yeah, you know what make them horrible people

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what happens is you become so desperate to get peer acceptance  And if it looks like the only or best way to get peer acceptance is by having a viral video on tik tok  Then you might it might be worth it to you to slap a teacher just because that peer acceptance is so important to you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can understand but that's when I step in adults who do that. Yeah, that's that this is the answer point  Yeah, yeah, but that's when I would step in and say look that that peer acceptance  It's it's you know, there's a fine line to it, you know  Yeah, I know you want to have friends and this and that but you can't go out there and just do stupid crap

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The problem is you're gonna say that after it happened because you're not even going to know about it until it does happen  You know what i'm saying? Right? Unfortunately, especially as our kids get older  Their lives are now out of our purview. We don't see what's going on and it's all about their peer group  So you're going to know about it, but it'll be after they slap the teacher. It's not going to be before  Yeah, right teacher, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Miss stacy, I looked out most of the dumb crap I did was in my adult years  Not so much in my well childhood years because I I was scared of my mom's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's good to be scared. I was I was terrified of my mom, but my brother totally different person

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah  Yeah  My sister the other thing and this is the substantial difference. None of us grew up in a world where everything was online  And that is a huge difference. We're and that's kind of what we're grappling with here  Is that this generation is growing up in public effectively?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow, just I just had this conversation with queen prud yesterday just said that man  We didn't grow up with everything being connected and having the  The challenges of of following the likes and stuff like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff is totally different take their stuff offline when they turned 18. I've been i've been telling my daughter

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Take everything down you've ever posted start  Wipe it all

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've been telling her that for years

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's very hard for the same reason even as an adult  Peer, you know your peer acceptance your peer group. This is you get value. This is where you get value  Did you read jeff ben thompson's piece in strata?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't get through it. No, I didn't have time because it's ben thompson. It takes forever. I didn't find it before

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's essentially defensive facebook in a nutshell  Uh facebook's value to the economy giving small businesses and so forth  uh  parity with big businesses  It's so valuable to the economy that it's it's really important that facebook continue as it has  That you know all of that engagement stuff does go to advertising which is all about giving, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So let's stay there for a second. Let's stay there for a second. So imagine that rather than trying for  Cpm based advertising and programmatic based advertising that facebook said we're going to rebuild  Around local which is it's not about engagement. It's about local and trust and other things  There are way and it'd be a smaller facebook, but it's a way to imagine an advertiser supported facebook  That uh, well next door is trying to build that right next door is doing that on  on real  Identity and there are a holes on next door too  Yes, it's probably gotten over two of them off there forever similar problems though with next door because our problem is people  Yeah, problem is there are a holes in the world, right?  And and so the question is do we protect do we expect the platforms to protect us from a holes?  Well to an extent yes, and that's the other side of the algorithm by the way the algorithm also  Demotes a lot of stuff  And take stuff away that you're not going to want to see because it's crappy  Now the problem is they're demoting the wrong things and promoting the wrong things and that's part of the problem here  Is that they haven't defined why they exist and what the experience should be  But there is a world I can imagine where  social  Can be better  Uh, and so i'm not ready to give on up and neither am I ready to give up on algorithms and curation and and choice  I don't think that's a bad thing. I think that could be value added

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is what ben writes if you'd gotten to the end you would have actually enjoyed this  he says  that I acknowledge  A prop some of the problems at facebook particularly the first one about facebook internalizing the fundamental flaws inherent in humanity  In other words to argue it is not in facebook's interest as an ad platform to have angry political discussions  Doesn't change the reality that having people interact more will entail more angry political discussions  amongst every other discussion that humans are liable to have  but this also makes the case for why I don't think the world would be better off if  Facebook were a much smaller company its political problems both the company in the world are irrevocably tied to its size  he's he's arguing that  Facebook has now become a behemoth and that is inherently problematic and in fact  That facebook ultimately will be used for political power  He said james madison predicted this in the federalist papers  Facebook presents a societal problem not a competitive problem moreover per political problem three politicians don't want a smaller facebook  They want to use it. They want a compliant facebook  So the most likely outcome facebook doubles down on information control perhaps with some regulation  which  I you know, I don't think there's any possible regulation that could actually solve this problem just without mucking it up  He says that it's far more likely to hinder new startups stricter limits on data for example or increasing liability for user generated content  Than it is to materially harm facebook not much will change at least in the short term  Uh, he makes it's a very strong argument  That's one I don't like but he makes a very strong argument. Kevin roos also argued today facebook is weaker than we knew

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mike masnick, I think also was smart about this that that that we're we're this is the messiness of

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is facebook weaker than we knew is facebook weak at this point you think this is a body

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  To fix its problems. I think that's what kevin's point was  I think that's what that's a lot of what i'm seeing is that  Is is that is that they put themselves i mean here's here's the most dystopian vision  Right. I think I think the congress looks at this and you're right by the way  Some of the senators who were going after facebook have spent a  tons of money on facebook  Uh, but but people look at this and think that there's a solution  And if facebook you could solve this right and probably what you're saying leo is no they really can't  The part of all this that they really can that's the that's the question does is this is this  Has this train gotten out of facebook's hands and they don't know what to do with it now  I think that's the more dystopian view here and that's why  I hang around with academics even though i'm not one. I want a lot more research to understand  This better because what we're doing is having a huge discussion and a policy discussion on presumption  And and I want to know more about this and facebook is the only path to getting that knowledge because they have the damn data  That to me is the essence of this entire story right now now others might say too late. Forget it  It's it's it's it's ruined the world. It's awful. We should just turn it off, but that's where I think  um  Strategy is really interesting to say well, no not only the advertising piece, but also the george floyd story  Also the the my students who worked with people who were food poor  In the midwest during the pandemic and facebook was the mechanism by which they did that, you know, I think you all you would agree  It's not all bad  What would we all solve if we just turned it off? So the harder thing that's why is but i'm not

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  These are hard problems turn off the algorithm. So but well his point russ's point is facebook is actually a dying company  Not because of political problems  But because young people aren't interested  Uh, he says tiktok is you know, it's or something like it's going to take over. It's my space. I would I would submit  That if tiktok takes over we have not seen the worst yet that that tiktok is so algorithmic and I love tiktok  But that's part of the problem. It's very very addictive. It's so algorithmic and so cleverly done algorithmically  That it would be worse than facebook  Musicals will solve the problem. We won't know for some years yet, but I think russ, you know after after reading what he said  I think you're right  Kevin often gets things wrong, but in this case he might be right. I agree with you. I think tiktok's down right now  I just try to go to tiktok is down on the web for some reason. I did the same thing and it says too many concurrent

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Connections. I was I was I was going to try to find a musical to solve so this is not our soul. This is not the same

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  problem that uh  pgp problem ddos  Yeah, that looks like it that looks like either ddos or misconfig a misconfiguration it does seem to be working on mobile  So i'm not sure exactly what's going on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, wait tiktok's on the web. Hold up. Really? Yeah, you don't have your facts

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's a here's a nice tip  You don't even have to have an account to watch tiktoks. You could just go watch them  In fact, if you wanted to watch somebody who's about to have a million tiktok followers

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I guess yeah, we watch we watch hank on the web. I just never thought about yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's on instagram, too  In fact, he just told me he's going to start a youtube channel, which is kind of a relief

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was just wondering that today whether you're advising or he's advising himself to branch out i've been telling him for ages here

It's kind of jeff. It's kind of an interesting  Yeah business. They're venture capitalists  And of course the phrase venture capitalists use all the time kevin rose said this he said you should be an angel investor  You've got deal flow. I said what the hell's that? He says you can you know what's happening?  And so this is the thing if you wanted to invest in pre ipo startups, you know  Buying a stock is no big deal  But if you want to invest in startup early before they have the exit, of course  That's when you make the most money is when you you get in early  That's how kevin made all his money you get in early and then you get the eggs of the ipo  You need deal flow. The problem is you and me. We're just you know  Doing our thing. Where do you get deal flow?  That's what our crowd's about these guys are venture capitalists guys and gals who are doing constantly doing the research  They have deal flow because they're constantly investing they have both individual investments and they have a fund  Well, i'll talk about that in a second  And because they have deal flow they can introduce you  To new companies starting up pre ipo pre exit get in at the ground floor  Now i'm going to tell you that there's a limit on this you have to be an accredited investor  This is this is due to the laws in various countries  I think they think they're to protect innocent people from investing in stuff. They don't understand  So if you go and you can find out right now if you qualify at ourcrowd.com  Depending on which country you'll in you'll see what the rules are for being an accredited investor  But once you're an accredited investor, and by the way, there's no cost to this.

It's not just us global private market  Selecting those with the greatest growth potential and then they present them to you  So you get deal flow from personalized medicine to cyber security or robotics?  It's a great way just to see what's going on in the world in quantum computing  In state-of-the-art labs startup garages and anywhere in between our crowd is identifying innovators  So that you can invest when the growth potential is the greatest early on  Our crowds and credited investors have already invested over a billion dollars in growing tech companies many of their members  They've already had 46 ipos or exits  So that's a lot of people who have benefited a lot from these ipo and exits and you can see some of these  On the page at our crowd.com slash twig  This is for somebody who's already doing all the right things. You're saving up for your retirement  You know that you know, you're doing the right conservative things  But if you have some space in your portfolio, you really want to diversify it  And invest in early and innovative private market companies. This is really the only reasonable way you can do it at our crowd  Accredited investors can participate in single company deals. Let me give you the deets for as little as ten thousand dollars  You can actually if you prefer you can buy into one of our crowds funds  That's a little more expensive. That's fifty thousand dollars, but a minimum of ten thousand is required to invest  I want you to know that and the investment terms will vary depending on where you invest  So you want to find out what it takes?  To become an accredited investor if you qualify you actually don't have to do anything  Just see if you qualify and you can find out more information when you go to the site  Just put the country you're investing from in and you'll see what the requirements are  Join the fastest growing venture capital investment community. This is a really great way to give you deal flow  Our crowd.com slash twig our I thought you know when they came to us I said, oh, I don't know that  You know, this is for big shots. They said no, actually it's not  Uh, it's it's you know, a lot of people are  At the stage in investing where they are accredited investors. I think you have to have I can't remember  What is a certain amount of income?  A certain amount of discretionary income you just want to protect the little guy, you know, but if you qualify  Now you want to look at the next step. Well, how do I find out about this stuff?  Our crowd.com slash twig. You don't have to be a millionaire or a billionaire to do it our crowd.com slash  Twig we thank them so much for their support. I think it's an interesting idea

Transcript:  Yes, and they are very experienced investors  So, I mean they know I mean they take the meetings with all these companies  You're only seeing the stuff that they they've they've gone through hundreds of companies  You're only seeing the stuff that they've looked at and they've taken the meetings  They've done the thing a normal vc would do  Or angel investor would do and then they present you as if you're you know in the room you present you with that information  It's very interesting. At first I was like, oh, I don't know this  You gotta be richie rich. This is uh, but I you know, I trust our audience. All right, it's knows what they're doing  Uh, and they have you know, i'm not gonna take a lot of money in this no  Well, you gotta put at least 10,000 but yeah, right if you've already especially you and me we're you know, we're  We've been saving we're at that age  You know, maybe have a little disc the kids are finally out of college

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I already have the z flip which I like by the way  That is a folding phone that makes sense because it's a little thing. That's the clamshell one  So yeah, and then it opens up and it's a normal size phone in every respect. I love this phone  That's part of my problem is I have too many phones now. I don't want I uh

Transcript:  Wait, I mean there've been enough leaks that we know they're doing it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I meant the samsung phone. Oh, I love that. I so well you can look at the pixel. So the  Camera on the samsung is good. Not as good as the top of the line samsung phones

Transcript:  Jack or not. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is from the german retailer saturn, uh pixel six costs a huge  649 euros launch october 28th. So the events of the 19th that would make sense  That you could pre-order on the 19th delivery on the 28th. They're also offering this can't be right

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A pair of 269 euro boh's headphones when you pre-order between the 19th and the 27th

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, that's weird. Oh, this does not look like a mistake. I mean this doesn't look like a mock-up. This is real

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wouldn't say that trade ends

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google will for sure  Full ht plus display  You're gonna have to do some math here  Uh 6.4 inches. That's that's pretty good  pretty big phone  But what is 649 euros? How much money is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  750 bucks out of sync says in our chat room  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Transcript:  Good I will this is with the streaming that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The google chip, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's why I ended up thinking i'm not going to  I'm not going to use this microsoft phone because the google phone is just more interesting  You know, it's a better android experience android 12 did come out this week, but not for the pixels

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is very strange. I swear my my pixel 4xl. It's just it's just been weird and out here recently the pixel launcher  just  Freezes. Oh have to go and man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or my 3a or whatever the heck it is google

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not only confirmed the date rumors have already started about what other devices the company will announce. This is from notebook check  uh according to apple  Le 257 on the twitter google. I don't know who they are google may be planning a bumper launch event with lots of things  Maybe a pixel fold pixel watch

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have a smart home event on the 21st. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So they would save then probably the new nest speakers for that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That'd be my guess. I mean they've announced  Like basically that whole week is like all google devices all the time is kind of how i'm feeling it's going to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that tab is interesting to me. Yeah, the pixel tablet nexus 7

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh boy, that would be great. Wouldn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But do people want android tablets lenovo just had a tablet come out and um, there's one other one

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Android is notoriously bad at tablets. Unfortunately, my mom loved her android tablets. I know jeff and I love

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love the nexus and I enjoyed the chrome tablet makes no sense. Yeah, why oh, yeah. Yeah chrome tablet. I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Other rumors say google scheduled that fold release well after this month  So it might not be right away  I have to say stacy. I really get the idea of having it a handkerchief pocket handkerchief size phone that opens up to a normal size  That really works. It's a great experience

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's holding up well

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, i'm not using it all the time. But yeah, it's gonna hold up  I think they've they've they've gotten pretty good at the folding screens. It's well protected when you fold it up get a case  Uh, they sell a case that then hides the gap and all that  Can you star trek it?  No, it's not like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When you're scrolling does the does the bump you can feel it bother you you see it but it doesn't bother you  I don't think i'm gonna get a callus from going through twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, the bigger issue to me is these folding screens aren't they don't feel like glass  They're a little softer. So it's a little bit less of a glassy feel  Last year's was real. I didn't like this year. They've gotten better at it. They're putting a layer of glass on top of it  So I think it's pretty good  All right, anyway, yeah, well if you want to join us for that event you can  We'd love to have you going  Yeah, well, you know what all right the 19th tuesday 10 a.m  Anybody wants to join us, please we'd love to have you  It'll be for sure jason and I will be here and all three of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Um  You put in all these stories i'm gonna let you uh talk about them

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I wanted to hear you see if you could explain mirror to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  decentralized mirror  Is this something to pay attention to it's a publishing platform  a decentralized publishing protocol  Um, okay  It's on it's apparently on the blockchain

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This sounds a lot like what isn't this morning's blockchain isn't automatically bad you guys

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, I I understand the point of blockchain. It seems like that was less to you. It's more like jeff like it seems like over  Over complicated  When you use mirror you log in with your ethereum wallet. You got one of those, right? Yeah, I actually do

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh my god, some of us do you guys are way ahead of me. We cool kids got them

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You don't use it as a username or password. You use your wallet. That's kind of interesting  And you're which means your account is owned by you and lives on an open blockchain instead of a centralized database  All data published on mirror is cryptographically signed by users  And stored on permanent decentralized storage  Okay, so there is a server reason are we've

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, decentralized storage. What does that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me look that's what i'm trying to get to understand here. Well in theory the blockchain some stuff you can't you wouldn't want to  Put whole blog posts on the blockchain that seems

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's see here is people have whole mechanisms for storing chunks of data in different like yeah, maybe ipfs

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the idea of ipfs  Our weave arweave store data permanently store documents and this is interesting  It's a collectively owned a hard drive might be ipfs that never forgets  Welcome to the permoveb  Hmm  So this is where your your data will be stored  I guess if you if you're using our weave, you'd probably have to participate right you'd want to  Give some of your this actually sounds really interesting  Jeff and do you earn there's stuff in there for nfts too hosting they can be integrated in yeah  It natively supports new crypto native business models around tokens and nfts for instance  Posts on mirror can be minted as entry additions allowing them to be collectible

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Interesting collect my blog post does it pay you for like?  Taking like some of your computer storage i'm gonna assume becomes part of the the distributed storage. Do you get like tokens for that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know what else to say here  Because that's that's a really like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean i've i've been high on decentralization for you know a decade in with some of these  Blockchains  And token like cryptocurrencies. It is actually incentivizing people to maintain  Consistent records over time right because a big issue is like you might sign up and then you're like, ah screw this  I'm not interested in it and then you take it offline, right?  You don't care  But if you have an economic incentive to like maintain it, which is what this can do if you have a token or something like that  The nft feels a little silly, but that's just me well

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Even more this seems like overkill for a blog post most of which are ephemera. Yeah  Hey, hey, hey speak for yourself for jeff's blog post  Granite for no actually seriously  Your blog posts are real essays and should be preserved  I think they're not being preserved as well as they could be my blog posts on the other hand are ephemera  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel like we should just accept that everything is kind of ephemera. I mean  Think about it think about like all the yeah, think well, let's get real. Oh my god now i'm depressed  But no just think about I mean like look at how much culture we've lost over time and how haphazard the findings we have are  In the it's it's pure hubris to think that our stuff is really gonna stay. I mean, yes, we have shakespeare  But I guarantee you a million other people were writing  Maybe not a million but lots of other people were writing at that time frame and we've lost a lot of their pamphlets  Or they're not worthwhile  So I mean, I don't know. I think this is cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For instance, uh ant because it doesn't have to be blog posts could do his photographs this way. You could have a photography blog  and uh, totally fine with that you can mint the uh entries  Connect the revenue to a stream or auction  I wonder what you can't yes, it supports crowdfunding  So you can rally the support of your audience on mirror. Anyone can raise funds for an idea or project using the crowdfund block  You know what? This is really interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank you. You also have token race. Have you heard about token race? What's that fred wilson has written about?  so token race is a way that um  I'm gonna completely blow if you look up fred wilson and token race  Uh, let's see  It's a way your audience can choose can curate can choose what goes up. Yeah to create a token race

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is  The one of fred's writing about this it's mirror  I didn't know that mirror is his portfolio company. Okay, there we go  So our portfolio company mirror has been using a game mechanic called the right race to onboard users the mirror service  I'm very interested in this. Yeah  You need a right token to publish on mirror. The best way to get it is to join the right race that happens every wednesday  Oh, we missed it 5 pm eastern shoot shoot anyone who joins a  Yeah, if we had just been stopped yelling at each other  We could have tokens now now vote for new users in the right race top vote getters are airdropped a right token and can publish on mirror  Fred got his right token a while ago. What a surprise  Yeah, and he now publishes a mirror image of this blog on mirror  Yesterday mirror announced they've expanded the game mechanic to any activity that requires a token  They call it a token race. Imagine your dao don't know what that is wants to admit new members  And I had to look that up too, but needs a way to do that token race

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Decentralized autonomous organization. That's me

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh, imagine your dao wants to distribute funds to worthy crypto proget projects crypto race  token race  It's like a crypto race  It's like a crypto race  So to create a token race user specifies the address of the erc 20 token contract to use uploads a list  Oh, this is going to be very mass appeal uploads a list of proposals  And specifies the minimum number of tokens members need to hold to be eligible to vote

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's just like civil which is how the reason I have aetherium is because I I gave money to civil which was this whole journal  Something built on the blockchain wildly over complicated journalist heads exploded and they didn't know what to do and it died  That's what I fear for this  But there's let me ask you a question about distributed though for all the problems we were talking about earlier and all we don't want  The huge company to be involved  Is a distributed thing though  More vulnerable in the long run. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But so why not but it's less popular because it's so damn complicated  So I'll use as my example mastodon which is our federated twitter  Uh, it's just less popular because you have to figure it out and it's it's not it doesn't that doesn't need to be does it?  Sort of because you have to find a server  Join that server then the people you want to follow on other servers. You have to understand that you're following them from there  It's yeah, it's not immediately obvious a little complicated and I think though we're getting to a point

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's some services and that's why i'm excited about the crypto thing. You can embed a lot of this in hardware  so imagine if you  bought like  Let's mastodon may not be a great example, but like you bought the gamers mastodon  Server, right you wouldn't like in a box  So basically or maybe you just bought a mastodon box and then you connected to certain  Categories that you liked when you set up your box like I think  People are becoming a more interested in buying hardware and maintaining it and so as part of that deal  You are  You know your own server contributing to the distributed network. I'm sure in the early days of the worldwide web

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was a little confusing and complicated and of course you want to create user layers above, you know  Honestly a hardware wallet is basically what you were talking about with your personal blob  Ages months ago on this show  And I can imagine that your phone could contain have a hardware wallet or you'd have in a separate device  It's a hardware wallet that is your identity blob  And it has it has everything has links to the blockchain where your personal stuff is stored things like that that you control access  You could you know, I mean this is this is I agree  Very interesting right now  crazy  complex

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Much more to this one token race supports voting on behalf of a multi-sig account without requiring multi-sig holders  To sign their vote using the multi-sig in order to vote on behalf of a multi-sig add your multi-sig address to the token race  Page once it's verified you'll be able to vote on behalf of the multi-sig  So that's using your wallet get me at it  But it's interesting and Fred, you know, I listen to Fred Fred's smart  There's something here. I just can't it's totally something. This is very very interesting to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Um, well, I put it there. Yeah  Yeah, i'm i'm definitely going to figure this out and do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I found a couple links and i'm going to look at it some too. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you put her see especially since I already have wallets. Yeah, I see and you've posted what did you post there?  You posted a token. I found them on ether scan. Oh, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The token so it shows you all the information about the token and how many holders there are and stuff like that so people can research it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you want to read about this, it's dev.mirror.xyz  Or yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, even though even the address is opaque you mean.com xyz.com. That's where I should go xyz.com

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, i've put it in our cn. I've put it in our disk dev.mirror.xyz

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You mean.com no, no, no xyz.com  xyz.com

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have a flash xyz. I have enough trouble explaining to people that my son's account is salt underscore hank underscore. They go. What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does he regret the underscore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, it's well, it's too late now. He ain't gonna change it. Yeah, you can't change it. I don't think he regrets it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's always you know, he's he's ahead of me. Yeah, he's cool. He's way ahead of me  A million followers on tik tok show us the way hank  Show us the show us the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I I love it. Yeah, you should be doing uh him on the discord server

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you you're right ask him anything he would absolutely love to to be on it  I guess tik tok is back up now, huh? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  um  all right, I i feel I feel like i'm uh, uh,  our rundown has taken on the  Attributes of twitter now for me. I don't understand any of this. What's going on?  I put stuff in there. How I do my research every google's coral ai kit. Does miss stacey have thoughts?  Okay, let's look at it. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was that was brought up this morning on floss weekly  um by what line is that it's right after the uh, in it right after the mirror xyz

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Coral.ai in the quick quick takes you mean coral.com?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff coral.ai

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh alexandra  tunian coral.com

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a dev kit for their coral compute. Oh, it's hardware  Yeah, it's just you know coral is their their ai compute board. It they've had it for a while  So i'm just like what it what's new here

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I did see there's a risk five usb device. There's a new risk five board from intel

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Out which is interesting the fact that intel is making a risk five board is pretty interesting  Although like nvidia has had them for a long time. They use them. They built them to  manage some of their processing on their massive big gpus but like intel  Usually pooh poohs everything so i'm no they're right intel's probably terrified. It's what's happening

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was going to say they're just trying to join the party essentially  Yeah risk five for those who haven't been following our conversations about it is a new architecture open source  microarchitecture for processors kind of like x86 would be or arm  Um, it's it's it's risk. So I bet it's arm like I don't know if it's related to arm

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is it is it is a risk and it is trying style instructions. Yes, and intel's not exactly building fabs for this

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're putting on an fpga so  Um, you know they can program with machines but still the nios v processor is the next generation

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, so they're using it actually just like nvidia's been using it  So they're this this makes sense because you can cheaply optimize and control your fpgas with this. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you know, that's the first step, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is and it's not like intel actually has to pay licensing fees. So, you know beauty part. It's free man open  I is I would I mean the hardest thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I would guess there's like gpl style licensing for it if you use it you have you can't  There's restrictions on how you can use it. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think there are restrictions on how you can use it a lot. I mean one of the challenges of using risk five is  Most people are not chip designers. Like that's a pretty esoteric skill set. Right? So you usually go to like  It's not is it sci five sci labs. Yes, that's that's where no no  No, that's silicon labs. Oh, um sci five. I think is the there's so many sci companies mr. Huggy

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So, you know, he's good. He's cute. Anyway, yeah sci five. Okay. Mr. Huggy said intel did an ip and fab deal with sci labs

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  for a risk five

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sci-fi is related sci-fi. No sci-fi is a company. They're a fabless chip company that they do  Compilers and they make it really easy for you to bring your ideas to risk five. They're kind of like a neat  I don't know but intel was actually in talks to buy them. That was the big rumor  Which would have been a big freaking deal  Anyway, I I don't know why we were talking about the sci labs

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  British regulators getting involved  Uh setting out rules  That I think might be a little challenging for tik tok snap and only fans. They want age  verification

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Admittedly you end up with identity verification, which means you end up  screwing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Vulnerable people around anonymity. I don't think so. You can still be you can still be anonymous on the web  You do need to have we do need I know people are going to hate this and it just depends on how you  Mandate it. You need to have a credible digital identity that is  not that is protected and that is attributed to you and that isn't like

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it could just say your name  Yeah, just say your say or just say your birth date and and verify that and I have the token  It's me. You don't know my name or address, but you do know my birthdate is over 18 or that kind of thing  Yeah, the problem is they also things with it they also want to control hate speech  Uh, they must video streaming platforms harmful speech speech that isn't even harmful, but it's harmful

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so when the government tells you it's it's legal but harmful then it becomes de facto de jure illegal, right?  The government said but they won't tell you what is harmful. It's just your ass. We know it when we see it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  video streaming platforms under the new regulation  Must ask the age of users and take down harmful illegal content including hate speech and terrorism or face heavy  fines the uk media regulator  Ofcom ofcom or ofcom

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know somebody who'd be great to have on the network. I don't think you've had on before maybe you have jeff kasev  No, let's get him. So jeff wrote the 26 words that created the internet  Oh, yeah. Yeah, great definitive book on on 230 his next book, which is just coming out  Which I blurbed is on anonymity and the need for anonymity and jeff's a law professor and brilliant at this stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jason let's see if we can get him on a twig  Kosi f k o double s e f k o double s e f kasev

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The 26 words created the internet is a brilliant book  It's really is that it explains the history of 230 and really well and and his anonymity book is good too  And he defends the need for anonymity so that goes to the question stacy is it possible to have an identity that is not  Um tied to you, but if you've got to have verified age somehow it's tied to you  So who do you trust to do that? You you end up in the death of anonymity spiral?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think you may remember that the original offcom regulation required you to go to a bar

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And show them your id  And I see some born might the bar would then pass along. Yeah, he's good, man. He's good

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The guidance does not according to analysts not put pressure on video platforms to roll out any major product changes  Such as new age verification technology because offcom admits consumers could just switch to services headquartered outside the uk  That's called an unintended consequence. The regulator said it hopes to coordinate these requirements with counterparts in europe and elsewhere  Here so there is a globally consistent regulatory framework in the future analysts said the  Regulation and the guidelines were not meaningful  And were inherently set up to fail because they don't address the biggest player in the video video streaming industry youtube  Which is not does not doesn't have the kind of office in the uk is in ireland. They're in ireland exactly, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, and plus this is also pre legislation. So it's a weird thing to do where the regulator is deciding to regulate without the laws behind it  It's very out

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Big well, i'm gonna take a break and then we will talk about probably the biggest security story of the week in just a little bit  Our show today brought to you by udacity and I am a fan  udacity  Uh was founded about 10 years ago.

They're not selling it in the net  today a user posted a  125 gigabyte torrent link on 4chan that basically contains  everything  Everything on twit the the poster said which I'm sorry twitch. No, you don't get our source code. No way, man  There isn't any twitches there is no other source code  Amazon owns twitch

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Amazon AWS serves twitch. I'm gonna what does that mean all of twitch? I don't understand that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You get the source code you get projects twitch hasn't announced that the code for those you get  How much money people are getting paid on twitch you are getting?  Passwords, although it looks like the passwords were salted and then and then encrypted with bcrypt later  But apparently well somebody was looking at the code on twit  Twitter, that's so confusing twitch Twitter twit  I was reading on Twitter somebody's looking at the code saying, you know the way they coded this you could use the salted hash as the  password and we go yeah, come on in so  I know  I know  So normally you salt it so that it's a one-way process so you can compare the salted hash  But the idea is that nobody has the password in the clear  well anyway, I  Don't know look change your if you have a twitch account. I do this immediately change your password turn on two-factor for sure  Twitch internally is aware of the breach according to one anonymous company source  This is from video games chronicle.com and it's believed the data was obtained as recently as Monday  This is not old stuff. There's a very nice angle here. Yeah  This is on AWS. We don't know exactly, you know, we've seen breaches from  Poorly protected s3 buckets things like that. Maybe they're going on. I don't know the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Posters imagine that twitch would have all their stuff in an unprotected s3. You'd think they'd be smart

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Twitch has confirmed the leak is authentic  We quote we can confirm a breach has taken place our teams are working with urgency  To understand the extent of this will update the community as soon as additional information is available  Thank you for bearing with us the entirety of twitch's source code their git  Basically their git repository with commit history going back to its early beginnings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a lot. I mean good on him. Hello. Hello, twit club. Come on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Club no these I mean some of these people are bond like a lot in I mean  I  Mean I complain about being on for like almost three hours

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, they work for this by the way three of the streamers on the list have confirmed to the BBC that the figures are accurate  So this is this is this is this is the real deal  Twitch is confirming it people are confirming the data  People are looking at the source code saying yes  Looks like the real deal fortnight streamer BBG calc told BBC news the earnings list got my figure 100% correct  Wow  Anyway biggest biggest breach at least in terms of you know the impact to the real world in a way  I'm glad they weren't ransomed  You know, I mean they're not they probably would have yeah gladly paid millions not to have that revealed but

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This feels kind of like the Sony hack in the sense that it just feels like vengeance

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, vengeance is mine say at the hacker

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Leo have you been following bad art friend considering that you have a tiny kidney you might need to make a friend  Who's bad our friend and our friend is the story of the New York Times, okay, everybody's going nuts for right?  Okay, is this where a woman went on?  Social media and said I'm gonna give away my kidney to somebody  I don't know just to do it because I'm I want to be one. Oh  and then people started  Thinking that this was a little overdone and then a writer  This is this is an unpublished writer and then a published writer came and wrote a story pulling pieces of  The chat as part of that story. So now everybody's in a kerfuffle all over creation about her and her kidney  But I bring this up only because it's relevant to you with your

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They use doctors to find somebody who needed a kidney but wouldn't otherwise get one  Right. In fact, she eventually did meet him and she started posting  Celebrating her one-year kidney versary. Ike, you know what the good news about my particular plight. I cannot donate a kidney now, so don't ask  I don't know if it's not functioning or just less functioning or what they don't really tell you that they just say your kidneys kind of  Child for why not to do this this is okay. So I've been thinking about this because we talked about it  We're talking about his earlier a couple weeks ago  I mentioned that I had done a full body scan open an MRI and it's like very detailed takes an hour a  pain in the butt  Noisy, but it didn't scare I didn't wasn't claustrophobic so  And then they come back to you with your pictures and they say well  Here's the 20 things wrong with you  And what I realized is of course first of all if you just look at your skin  You know, there's things wrong with you on the outside, right? Everybody's got a flaw  You know, I have an eye that turns in or whatever  But you don't know about the things that are wrong with you inside. You just go along merrily living your life. Well now, you know  And you know, none of it was life-threatening for me one of the things I learned I don't have heart disease  I don't have good makings of an aneurysm and there is no cancers. So all of that is what I wanted  Hey, that's worth it. It would seem to me but then you learn things like I don't even know what it means  Your spine ends at t2. I don't know what that means. Is that good? Is that bad? I don't know  They say there's there's there's something on your liver that could make your shoulder hurt  No, actually what they say is it's probably nothing  What  Because what's really weird is my right shoulder was hurting but now it's all better. So I don't think it's related to the liver  All right. It's more like lifting  This weird little things like that. I have one of my one of my mastoids is full

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Still laugh about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, what  Look at the picture you see it's full you can see it's full the other one's empty one's full one's empty  so they said full of  Fluid I guess but it could be tar. I don't know. It looks like tar but they don't they say look  You should probably have this looked at how I don't know where they put something in your ear  I don't know you should have this looked at because if it got infected you get a bad earache  You could lose your hearing if it's really bad  But it's been there probably my whole life right life  So that's exactly that with a CT scan. Yeah, so they could  Yeah, I was gonna send that one of my doctor and then they would give you anybody like someone go  Would you do this again or not? Yeah, I'm gonna do it  Oh now what I wish is I did it when I was young because then you'd have a baseline of all the things that are wrong  With me, I don't know how long I've had a bad kidney  But maybe it was this is not be congenital. You don't know bad. It's not even bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's just a little smaller than the other smaller seven centimeters, but a normal kidney like 12

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like being as it could be like that exactly. Yeah, so but now I have a baseline  So if it gets any smaller  Wait a minute see now you're setting yourself so no I'm going back. They said you should come back. Of course they did every  Yeah, yeah. Well, hello  I think this is good  Changes you'll know because you now know what's what it looks like you still don't know what it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, no your kidney might expand to 24 inches

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wouldn't I want to know that I think I'd want to know what if they say like, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's weird or different we think but we don't know what it means and then you're like, oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what you have to be prepared for is this knowledge that there is the everybody had everybody's imperfect  There are no there's no perfect human. So you're gonna find out about things that are imperfect. Are they bad?  Well, if you have no symptoms, maybe not I  Found out what I really want to know no heart disease. No cancers or no aneurysm  That's important because that's something that could kill you like that  so I wanted to know that and  And the rest of it  I'll just kind of live with the knowledge and then I do want to go in every couple of years just to make sure that  Nothing's changed. I don't look it's expensive. That's the problem  2,500 bucks and most people are not gonna spend that kind of money, but I can afford it so I'm gonna do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They said no it may not be a problem, but I have been eyeballing a yacht. So make sure you come back

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the  the discord chat is going is fighting every perfect all the all these animated gifs

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So sorry, I'm totally over sharing I know I'm totally  Totally over sharing

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's exactly what it looked like and  The guys the guy is literally sitting on the screen while you're doing it. He says, you know, cuz you have to do things like  hold your breath  For like, you know and and get us to get a steady shot. And so he's saying he's saying oh, that's good  That's a good one. Oh, that's nice

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Is that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I I think that I know people who you know died suddenly from aneurysms my aunt yeah  I know people who have gotten, you know found out they had cancer when it was at stage four or stage five  So if you could find out at stage one, would you want to know that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and that's something considering  Like this is the month of October and it's breast cancer awareness. Yeah with  Covet 19 a lot of the checkups didn't really happen and that's right  Oh people are catching this stuff. Yeah a little later than you would have normally caught it. So I feel you on that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, don't feel my kidney cuz it's a little small. No, I'm not gonna do it  No, but it's good because now I have an excuse if anybody says hey, I need a kidney upset

Transcript:  Need both

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google is investing a billion dollars into Africa including a new subsea cable  So that Africa will have faster internet. That's pretty cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, let's just put this in perspective though  Google just last week spent two point one billion dollars to buy a building in New York  Well, you gotta have both  One billion for a New York expensive, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There should be more expensive the billion dollars will be spread over five years to support Africa's digital transformation to cover a range of initiatives  from improved connectivity to investment startups  Nigeria Kenya Uganda gun Ghana, you know, I have to say yes  It should you know, it's not enough other companies should do it. Maybe it should be more but we'll take everything we can get. Yeah  Africa's historically just been ignored plus what's happening? There's fascinating things happening there

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The the the Kenyan and Nigerian startup scenes are amazing. Nigeria is becoming a major  hub for new online fintech  There you go  There's stuff to be learned a lot of stuff to be learned the subsea cable

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Will cut across South Africa and Namibia Nigeria and St. Helena connecting Africa and Europe  It'll provide 20 times more network capacity than the last cable built to serve Africa  This will be this will lead according to the managing director for Google in Africa  19 Nigeria to a 21% reduction in internet prices and increased internet speed in Nigeria  Almost triple in South Africa. See Google knows more internet's good for Google. Yeah, it's a nice virtuous  Yeah, nice virtuous cycle. It's a projected to create about 1.7 million jobs in Nigeria and South Africa by 2025  There are dollars does go farther. It's a lot of money. They've also launched the Africa investment fund  It'll invest 50 million in startups across the continent and they'll give them access to Google employees network and technologies. That's exciting  I think that's great. Good for you  Google is also working with Swedish engineers  To build a carbon emissions tracker  You're gonna see I think over the next 10 years a lot of activity in  Climate change and carbon capture and yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do we want to talk about Google's sustainability event that was on Tuesday? Oh, yes. Did you watch I did watch

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I'm gonna give you an example of what I think is corporate  BS  Microsoft announced their ocean mouse  which is  Made from recycled ocean plastic and then if you look at the fine print  Only 20% of the outer shell is made from recycled ocean plastic  So there's a lot of plastic in that thing, but only one-fifth of just the outside part

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Same thing with the iPhone they say that crap every year it drives me crazy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well in Dow just talked about building a are you ready for this a carbon neutral plastics plant

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not gonna use  It could make plastic with soybeans you can make it with no without hydrocarbons yes in mushrooms they are they are not doing that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Google has always said we're carbon neutral. They have been since 2007. They want to be carbon free by 2030  I don't know if that means using  Carbon credits or actually being carbon free, but you know Google those network centers use a lot of juice  So what are they now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Proactively so well and I was gonna say also Google's been very proactive Facebook as well at buying  Renewable energy credits ahead of putting a data center somewhere to help goose demand for renewable power in places  They're going so I think that's actually very proactive, so they announced a couple things  I was most interested in the nest stuff because they're but okay they they they did a deal where  When you search for things on maps, they're gonna show you the most eco-friendly way to get there

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's an option that the most fuel-efficient route there also if you're gonna take public transportation  They will show you the most like the D or the non diesel buses if they're electric buses  When you're booking flights you will be able to book flights based on  Carbon consumption so things like if you buy a first-class seat in there, they're doing at the seat level  So if you were like I'm gonna buy a first-class seat. You're gonna consume more carbon because you take up more space on the plate  So you'll get a notice about that  I think that's kind of a little bit of lip service  I think it's nice for people who like still believe in individual efforts for affecting climate change  So that's fine and you can you know look up like eco-friendly hotels and stuff like that on the nest front  They're actually basically using their market power or the market power of anyone who signs up for this to buy  renewable energy credits  You'll pay ten dollars a month as part of this subscription  So the oh sorry I should tell you the free subscription the free option is they will  let you use your  Energy consuming devices things that consume more energy at times when renewable energy is being produced  Oh, that's so green. That's the green dots versus the black dots. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. This video is just brilliant

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's really into everything's made of wood in the future or cork  So that's good

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so and then the extra feature is you pay and what they're gonna do is they're gonna aggregate all those payments to in  Areas to say hey, we're gonna buy carbon  renewable energy credits for these people and then that'll incentivize more  construction of renewable power in that area  You can actually do that through other places Kevin and I spent a lot of time trying to figure this all out because he already does  And then there was a third thing that I don't remember. I'm sorry we when we travel we buy

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a lot of evidence that tree planting projects and others are not as good as they thought  But when we travel we go to the good traveler when we fly and we buy carbon credits  There and twit is buying now from tera pass  Carbon credits for our business  It's because we want to be we want but again, this doesn't mean you don't I mean  We got a lot of lights and we use a lot of power and stuff. The idea is you you buy credits  It's actually surprisingly  inexpensive and they use those you give them money and they use those credits to  Buy programs and this one's good tera pass they buy programs near you  Which is nice for things like land gas capture and clean energy from wind power and farm power

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This goes back to Stacy's point way earlier  I'm not bringing up the topic again, but but but the true cost of things and that's why carbon rate taxes  Yeah, and having a cost to causing the damage

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Will make more sense. Yeah, Lisa and I love to travel. We know that you know planes and cruise ships are horrible polluters  And we don't want to trick sailboat. Yeah, I wish I had an electric sailboat  We do have you know, we generate all our power at home with solar panels  But so we buy carbon credits, which makes us feel a little bit better. I don't I don't want to do performative  Sustainability and you're right Stacey you raised the most important issue was is individual effort gonna do anything we need governmental and  Corporate effort, you know, we need to change this school fix this globally  But it makes us feel a little bit better and I guess it helps

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, yes, it keeps you from being as depressed in feeling as so bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but also I think it does help I hope it helps and we we decided a while ago we want to make it be  Carbon neutral so we buy these that's terrible pass. That's off to you. Yeah  It's not you know, it's surprisingly inexpensive. It's a few hundred bucks per plane flight something like that. So  Yeah, if people are interested  Terrapass.com is the carbon credits for businesses and so forth and for travel  It's the good traveler and I got this from the Yale Forestry Department  So I figure well if the Yale Forestry School  It's cool you enter in your flight in it yes, it also considers, you know  Your your first class costs and so forth and then it's not very expensive  so  It's good and then  They pay for carbon offsets which I guess is like tree planning mostly but  There was a big article on how tree planning is not  The panacea that we would hope it to be Google engineers are helping a Swedish startup to build a carbon emissions tracker  I mentioned that now I've said it again. So saying it twice is better, right? Let's move on  What did I tell you I told you something

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google's deep mind has made money if it's so smart. Why did it make money sooner?  first ever profit because they can embed this AI stuff in commercial  Products it lost half a billion pounds in 2019. I wish I could lose half a billion pounds. I  Think I've gained three pounds  It's the first sign that Google's huge investment the research outfit is starting to pay off according to the Financial Times  46 million pound pre-tax profit  nice entirely  Revenues derived entirely from applying its technology to commercial alphabet projects. Oh, it's even in-house  So it's just moving money around I guess  Google is as you mentioned updating Maps search and other products to help you save energy  Traffic light efficiency. Do you want to talk about that? Stacey? Oh  That's their other sustainable thing. You're right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Basically, it's AI to figure out how to keep people idling less at traffic lights to produce fewer emissions and I don't know  That's like I'm not I had a car  Fluffy I had a car that when you were stopped would turn its engine off a lot of cars do that  Yeah, the hybrid stood out. Yeah my Audi did and the reason I found out was because New York City. That's the law, right? Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You if you're at a light you're supposed to turn off your car. No  No

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe they need to tell the elders they get off the the green so fast  Tell more people about this supposed to idle you're not supposed to stop on the parking and idle. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But not lights. Okay. No not lights. Okay. No person  Shall allow the engine of a car to idle for longer than three minutes while parking standing or stopping

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that means you're the sound like a traffic light doesn't mean traffic lights are quick in this town  We're fast in this town, and we don't we don't waste three minutes of the traffic light. Well wait, there's wait

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's more in addition. The legal idling time is reduced from three minutes to one minute around public and private school facilities

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So if you don't cool off and stop right? Yeah, you can't idle there when you send the car service to pick up  Right Percy little Jimmy

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, so it's not just it's not stoplights it's just you can't see the old driving in New York

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought I was supposed to turn off my engine. They're all rear-ending me

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, but the nice thing is that car anyway, it would and they put your foot on the pedal  It would start up and it didn't seem like it, you know was a big deal  I even a cheap it's always been killed in New Yorkers. Good Lord. Oh, I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Light turns green. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what we should be we have places to go we got things to do and these tourists are always walking slow in  Front of us, but it pisses us off. Oh, please. That's not tourists. That's New Yorkers

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  God you can spot a new yorker anywhere else in the country because they're like you're at a stoplight or a crosswalk  And they're like halfway in the middle like ready to frog her out there. Yeah, I love it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I want to say is the tourists are the ones who walk and drive slowly in front of us

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Have you watched that yet? Oh  God you gotta watch that. It's so funny. She was so funny. Isn't she it's on the Netflix

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  At least there was no one was yanked up by a  construction crane  What movie was that?  That was a reference to an earlier show in which the certain character appeared. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, I have to rewatch  Damien Lewis, oh Damien Lewis. Yeah, oh, that's right. Yeah. Oh, that's right. Yeah  He showed times now a kind of person actually it's when you watch billions  It's kind of sad because Damien's wife was dying in the process of this these final few episodes and so it's very sad  But he like what a trooper man, you know great actor Oh get ready because that two-step verification  We mentioned before the Google's turning on here it comes  They're turning on this is gonna be fun. I can't wait to do the radio show that weekend  By the end of the year  150 oh my god Google is going to start enabling two-factor authentication  This month is cybersecurity awareness month today Google provided an update on its account effort to two-step verification efforts  Right now Google says  I don't you know, it's not clear what this means. We are enrolling  We're enrolling people who have

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's very okay, and we're connecting to your eath wallet. Yeah, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We recognize that today's 2sv they call it 2sv which drives me crazy two-step verification  Instead of MFA or 2FA which everybody else called it aren't aren't suitable for everyone  So we're working on technologies that provide a convenient secure authentication  What experience Alexandria, why can't I get into my  Reduce the reliance on passwords in the long term right now. We're auto enrolling  This is what I was trying to get to right now  We're auto enrolling Google accounts that have the proper backup mechanisms in place  If you own a Google camera phone to make a seamless transition to two-factor  To make sure oh you can do the security checkup if you want to see  As part of our security work, we led the invention of security keys. Oh, please Google  No, that is taking a little too much credit  another form of authentication  Yuba key was around before you got involved and all this that requires you to tap your key during suspicious sign-in attempts. What?  wait a minute of  Requires you to tap your key during suspicious sign-in attempts

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I had the little notification it pops up on your phone every once in a while. You got to tap your key

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What if I if I try to log in your physical key? That's crazy  This is poorly written. We know security keys provide the highest degree of sign-in security possible  That's why we've partnered with organizations to provide free security keys  Don't get your hopes up to over 10,000 high-risk users this year something like this is the Yuba key  Oh, okay, the Yuba keys. Yeah, that's what I use. Yeah, okay to make security keys more accessible  We build the capability right into Android phones and our Google smart lock app on Apple devices. So it'll use the  Already built-in fingerprint or face ID to to be the second factor today over 2 billion devices around the world  automatically support the strongest most convenient  2sv technology available, so  It's the end of this year, but I don't it's not by the end of 2021  we plan to auto enroll an additional 150 million Google users and  Require 2 million YouTube creators to turn it on

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does this I don't remember if it's specified  Using SMS in there. No, this is not SMS. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That would be my

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Regular people would try to  Find an easy way out of this and yeah, no, no, they're not gonna check email. Yeah, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I think with their well there might be a fallback to email or SMS  That's a good point, but this is intended to use devices you already have somehow. I  Hope it's not you're right and that would be not a good I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Many of Google's competitors compete for spot podcast listeners Spotify Amazon Apple  Yeah, I don't know what this means exactly because I don't think a YouTube video is a podcast is it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We upload our podcasts as a YouTube video, yeah, but then it becomes a YouTube video right, right  Could we pull a YouTube video and turn it into a podcast? You know what it is Leo what it's a net cast

I'm a bad host. Let's let's play  Things interested no, I'm just I'm going down the list. I'm too tired to be interested. It's time for  Well, we can cross this one out we already did this Google updating maps to help assume consumers save energy  How about this the October security patch is rolling out?  You know, I don't think that's true because I just checked and I didn't have it. Oh, but I'm on 12  So this is for 11. So keep your eye  We also did the two-factor authentication throw that one out Google abandons plans to offer bank accounts to users  You know who's offering bank accounts to users now the US Postal Service

Transcript:  so apparently  You all know Canada's waiting room now  You couldn't listen in the music in the background while you were doing other things on the phone or the screen is off  I didn't know that that's a real limitation  That's terrible. You could do it on Spotify Apple music. Everybody else lets you do that  So apparently you couldn't on YouTube music, but now starting November 3rd in Canada  You'll be able to and maybe that will extend. Oh  I see it's free users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, Google almost  It was it was getting close  And of course Sunday NBC had a big game where Tom Brady goes back to New England  That would have been a big problem if NBC had yanked its feed wouldn't just be that NBC as a lot of other  Things they started a website to pressure YouTube  Etc etc  Apparently they've made a deal Google says no price hike  It later emerged according to nine to five Google that NBC wanted Google to bundle Peacock premium into monthly consumer payments  This would have led subscribers to paying more  With Google in August committing to no price hikes in their near term because they've had some steep ones  65 bucks a month now  Low is it well slow it's cable money, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's exactly what the  Channels had been trying to do to the cable guys, right? So in no, I know this constantly happens. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Take our crap channel to go with our good channels. Oh, I see you didn't mean the low priced you meant low behavior  Yeah, that I you confused because 65 bucks I said 65 bucks you said that is low and I thought that's talking about
