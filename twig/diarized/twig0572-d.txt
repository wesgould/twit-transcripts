Transcript:  Hey, you don't usually wear glasses, do you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not too often the these are some just to put a glare to blue lockers. Yeah, I could tell that's cool nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Welcome and always has the best shot cuz he's a photographer. I try yeah  Looks so good Jeff Jarvis is also here  He's got the hat too he's the Leonard town professor for  journalistic innovation at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University, New York and  He has a leftover Kamala hat

I give you Stacey Higgins, but  Hey  Stacey on IOT comm  We cannot play  Sarah Cooper's appearance on Jimmy Kimmel last night. Why can't we who would stop us from doing that Leo? I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean besides would it be would it be killjoy Karsten?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Karsten is only dealing with the ledges are the laws that have they force not against the law. That's the funny

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it's against YouTube's it's not against anything it's not against anything just puts you at risk of stupidity  But because of automatic content ID on YouTube  It could very easily get it taken down on YouTube until we appeal and the problem with this show like all the shows we do  It has the long-term staying value of a dead fish  In when we get back on YouTube, nobody would watch it. So  We kind of it's a terrible chilling effect because it's completely  Fair use to to quote  The you know, I don't we don't have to show it. I'll quote the Jimmy Kimmel show and she was on it  She was guest hosting she's become famous  Thanks to tick-tock but what I didn't know but Jeff told us is not only Stacey told you  Hey, Stacey Stacey figured out that she was a Google engineer

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In her husband, she's married to a girl. I don't know if she's in it. Was she an engineer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What was her job? She was a product manager and she was a UX designer UX design

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and then now then became a stand-up comedy in the worst possible time  During coven and  But the good news is she like many actually stand-ups now have figured out how to use the internet  Particularly tick-tock and this is one of the things that really gripes me about this  executive order putting tick-tock out of business in the US is  This is a great platform for a lot of comics including Sarah Cooper  She though I would guess is one of the main reasons why the president doesn't like tick-tock her her lip-syncing to his  His speeches and talks are really right on there

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was thinking about our conversation about this last week when you know  He's threatening to ban it and all that and you were defending tick-tock the one platform you defend until you get sick of it  In a few weeks and I love tick-tock. What's wrong?  You do I'm glad but it occurred to me since then I had a conversation with a reporter that  It is the one platform the Republicans haven't figured out how to use Trump hasn't figured out to use there are there are Trumpists

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But not as many on that tick-tock. No, not at all. I would say you know  But you know what Jeff you may not see him because they you're a well-known Democrat

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they don't really do content analysis. They don't know what the content of the tick-tocks is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I see to I see Trump to pro Trump tick-tocks  Occasionally, but yeah, not as many as many as not many the anti Trump tick-tock

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then the other thing is it really it really does strike me that that if tick-tock is the modern printing press  Then this is a first amendment issue  It is government interference in speech  Even if it's a foreign platform how printing came from Germany and the Italians were not crazy about that  Scribes complained I'll get me started that the Germans were coming in and making all the money from from from printing and getting drunk  Ruining the children. There was those damn foreigners

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See nothing's new if I have to say though if Trump executed issued an executive order to take  Down Twitter or Facebook. I would be just as defending just as  Actually defending both  On the other hand, I'm even more so with tick-tock just because I think it it's you really see some real talented creativity  I feel the same way if they try to take down YouTube, of course  Facebook Twitter and YouTube are American companies  and  Ticktocks a Chinese company

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that's what I was gonna ask if I was just  Oversimplifying this whole executive order because I assume this went into place because of its being is something that's owned by China  Because when I read this executive order it says tick-tock automatically captures vast swaths of information from its users including internet  another network activity  Information such as location data browsing and search histories sounds like every app on Android. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just an excuse and that's all the China thing and I have to say if you use tick-tock on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  iOS which blocks a lot of the things that  This is not the article we're talking about right now that blocks a lot of the things that  Tick-tock can do on Android. We just learned for instance that tick-tock on Android is  Skirting Google's protection supposedly according to the Wall Street Journal to take their own identifier. That's not a good  That's not a nice thing. I'm sure everybody does it of course, but that's not a nice thing  But it's not doing that on iOS. In fact, it can't really do much on iOS  It's not even getting location data on iOS  So unless you turn that on because you want to have it embedded in your tick-tocks  So I don't I don't think tick-tock is even as bad as some American companies is the issue then that it's being sent  It's it's not being sent to China stored on US servers and backed up in Singapore  But I guess the issue would be that a China  China's government could  subpoena it and

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Get it. The issue is that China is the squirrel versus Russia. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  think that's  that's the political analysis of it that plus, you know the  Various things tick-tockers have done against the president, but I also yeah  I do think but I feel like it's a that the new thing is  the  It's easy. It's hard to have a racist  Point of view about Russians they look a lot like us  They are slobs Hitler said we can beat Russia the reason he opened a two-front war against Russia says those slobs are weak  We are Aryan troops can beat the slobs easily boy did he what he said. They were  Untermentioned untermentioned so there is a racial identity associated with Russians, but at least in the modern world  They're seen as white folks, but we like folks to me. Yeah  So  But Chinese people they're clearly others  Furners and  We don't like them and so it makes it an easy  Racist target the Kung flu and all of that  And not to defend the Chinese government, but the American government could subpoena everything tick-tock does too  And I'm not convinced the American government is gonna do good

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're setting ourselves up terribly here because yeah, no so many countries don't trust us and our access to data

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's interesting because one of the things that we've talked a little bit about this, but and I apologize  we'll move on pretty quick, but  One of the things  People were saying oh I forgot I don't care I'm moving on  Tencent is also  Affected by this another Chinese company because we chat is part of this ban  We chat is owned. I think wholly owned by Tencent  But you know what else is partially owned by Tencent a lot of stuff  Well, I'll give you an example a hundred percent owns Riot Games creators of League of Legends  Mr. Trump might want to ban that too. Just just giving you some ideas  It owns a significant portion of many banks in the US. It's a Chinese company  it owns a  Part of reddit Chinese company. So this is the problem you go down this road  Now you start to wonder well, how do we disentangle ourselves from Chinese owned companies?  That's a hard thing to do. They're global the iPhones made by a Chinese company. Yep. Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, but the current administration probably already knows that right because they're smart, right we're waiting for we chat with

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they're very stable geniuses I hear  Now everything's going out of my head I was gonna say something interesting I'm gonna stop talking now go ahead sorry  It's your turn. Sorry. No, it's not your fault

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's my turn to talk about the US government trying to ban Chinese. No anything you want to talk about you got a doorbell you like  I  Know currently I don't I was gonna draw attention. The Wall Street Journal actually did some excellent reporting on  Devices. Oh  My gosh, sorry y'all. I was watching Kamala speak

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, Jeff, have you been paying attention?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've been paying attention to the fact that  Stacey has much improved for room background on sky. Wait a minute. Let's see. It's followed on my god

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a plant there are lots of plants this room has like six  Now  That's so awesome plant to her ready Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you had one more firm we could say Stacey's between two ferns look at there's another plant  Crushing it. What a nice room that is rushing it on the plant front. I told Stacey before

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just right you need that balance you see it works it works we're right it's wonderful  Congratulations  Got crap for having no plants and room reader said to put plants on so he put ten plants on a table and then on  The whiteboard he just wrote faintly rr 10  room  And they saw it and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For you Cory so the Wall Street Journal just did a study about  data  Snarfing by apps or something. He was they actually did one on tik-tok

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that wasn't the that wasn't the story. I was really excited about they did that was a story about and them  Snarfing up the yeah, that was the Android store. Oh, that has a Google reference. Maybe we should talk about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Android is Google, you know  They've you know, look I'm not saying tick-tock is clean as a whistle or the Chinese government is clean as a whistle  But the tick-tock is being essentially  Put out a business at least in the US without any evidence presented about why it's just well because it's Chinese

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which is something we complain about other nations doing all the time. But here's the story. I was talking about  This is an NSA focus story and I thought it was worth noting even if there's no Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we don't have to have the Google bits in it and we are gonna get to something she's just trying to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Give herself license for always giving us crap. We and it's a warren cell phone data location could pose national

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  security threat that story

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, this is this is I put it in the the rundown  This is a company called anomaly six and what it has done is  Various app makers in the US allow anomaly six contracts with the federal government  Anomaly six grabs their data though by paying various app makers to embed their SDK on  Phones. Yes, so I might download an app that has an SDK from anomaly six  But if I have done that and there's no way for me to know if I have or not  then anomaly six is taking the data from my phone and  Selling that access to the federal. Wow  And that is like nobody talked about this story. They published it on Friday. I don't understand why they would do that. It is  to me a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Huge deal, but maybe I'm more than 500 apps  hundreds of millions of users

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is how the app businesses run right if you are giving something to someone for free  You do need to make some money somewhere and so you're like, yeah  Well, buddy you couldn't and I talked to companies all the time that embed their SDK in apps  You know not all not all of its marketing. Sometimes it's like hey, I'll use your Bluetooth, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we had a sponsor for a long time called Braintree  That does in app payments and what they sold essentially was the ability to embed  Their SDK in your app so that you could take in app payments. This is very common  Many most apps I would suspect are using libraries and tools from third parties  It's interesting that there's a company that specializes in  An SDK that provides location data to branches of the US government and private sector clients  Yes. Yeah, that's an interesting business anomaly six founded by  Defense contracting veterans who work closely with government agencies for most of their careers  It helps because then you get you can knock on the door and they say come on in Joe  They built a company to cater in part to national security agencies  The firm's capabilities described in documents prepared for military officials that were reviewed by the journal  They also explained their business practices in a briefing to Ron Wyden's office  Whose staff then also described it to the Wall Street Journal?  Apparently senator Wyden from Oregon has been conducting a probe into the sale of our location data  in the centers in the journal has suddenly become the  White night in for our privacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Progenitor of moral panic for the view of Rupert Murdoch that he wants to fight Google, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I would argue it's not moral panic to draw attention to this and say hey  Is this something that we really want because this is clandestine?  location tracking on your device and  I may recognize that and I have focused on this for a while  I recognize that Google can give my location data to law enforcement if there's a subpoena  And I also recognize that those subpoenas are getting more and more broad  Which were some of the things that Google has been doing for a while  More and more broad which we're seeing some court cases come up around that  I also recognize that when those subpoenas come out Google can't always tell me  Right. What are you looking for? So I very much focused on that. What I haven't thought much about is  This kind of data gathering and used by the federal government, but it's relevant Jeff  It's not just moral panic when you think about what the FBI is doing around tracking people

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was just Leo and I were just trying with I said I'm trying to praise the journal and I was trying to say remember

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's Murdoch. That's all so okay. I was like Jeff. I would think this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it safe to assume that was a little

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you have a smart see the thing about the and one of the reasons I started carrying the iPhone and started maybe  Preferring the iPhone is because it does at least warn you when something is getting your location data and you can say no to that  Right Google started doing that a little bit  Those notifications all the time  Are those effective against Babel Street and anomaly six or by the way?  It's spelled anomaly. Am I when I say anomaly is that not right? I  Always say anomaly. I'm gonna have to say words aren't they? Yeah, but I pronounce it word is anomaly  It's an anomaly or anomaly  It's anomaly

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where's John McWhorter when we need him, mr. McWhorter what does what does an a with an umlaut over it mean in the pronunciation guide?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a whole separate letter in Sweden by the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Should be a whole separate letter here, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and you know what if you go to a town  This is very fun and true story if you're in Sweden and you're at one of their transport kiosks  Their train stations and seeking like a ticket to like Almhurst for example if you look under a  It's not there. You have to look under a with the little

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Play it right now and see what this anomaly

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anomaly that is even that doesn't sound right at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anomaly anomaly  Anomaly now, I'm really confused. Okay moving along so  Should I  Even though I get warnings from my operating system that and I it feels like I can control location data  Should I still be concerned about this anomaly six or does that block them? I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Say be concerned but  most of the time people are not going to be concerned enough the  regular folks  People like you you're probably just gonna understand the app and just say you know what forget it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't really care. I turn on Google location because I like to know where I've been

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Same here

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So then relax Mike says this is my adder reverb Mike says is my own private via anomaly via anomaly  Go ahead I'm sorry Jeff yes, I just say relax relax

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you let him the office let him follow me around. We all know you're at the office. Yeah  Well, that's true. It's not like I you know, there's a certain ego that that is inherent in this is that is that  We worry that China is gonna care where we were  Yeah, that's what I want  I think it's the wrong thing and all that but at some point  It's not worth my brain power to stop trying there from knowing and I that I used to go Taco Bell

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I understand. I mean if it's not you Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Understand that I'm just saying military service people right and they and they're barred from having tic-tac on their phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think that's a good thing. In fact, I have no problem if Wells Fargo what which they do wants to bar  Employees from having tic-tac on their phone. I have no problem with that, but I have a problem with it being banned from all use in the country  Because I don't I don't get the threat

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If I were a spy for the regular folks, right  The hacking me  Hacking me is not gonna get them much other than a they're gonna feel sorry for me if anything  But outside of that, they're not gonna gain anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can understand China wants to know where dissidents are former Chinese residents are American spies American military  I can understand all that. We know that Strava running app  Was heavily used by military personnel and they figured out  Where a secret military base was because there was all these people running around an empty spot in the map in a circle  So they said don't carry Strava on you. Although that has mixed  blessing they for a long time I'm told there  Was it the Russians or the Chinese thought there was a secret place in the Pentagon because there was a lot of traffic  There in and out of there and they thought this must be an important spot turned out was a hot dog hot dog cart  It doesn't replace, you know traditional that is important. Yeah, it is important traditional spying  I don't I just it it sits wrong with me, but we don't have to go on and on about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, you know that people like me can say, uh, it doesn't really matter if they hack me  But that's not fair to everyone in my opinion  I guess we do have a right to privacy to a certain extent, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you think about access even so federal and municipal  Access to this kind of data  There's nothing that prevents someone who works in any of those places from using that data to maybe stalk someone

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right in in that's so I agree. We should have the right to protect our privacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I'm thrilled that the iPhone in the Android. I don't think it's just a function of a right to protect our privacy  I think it's we should be having a discussion about the trade-offs associated with free use of apps and the business models that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  me  Who who should we have this discussion with and I'm not sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That we're having it now when you say to someone hey  That's a really cool app hot or not. Whatever. Is it a hot dog? That's fun  But is that giving up your location? What are the trade-offs associated with these things?  And I don't I mean part of it is making people aware because I don't think  They are and I think it's also really hard to say well, or it's really easy to say well  The government doesn't care about my location  In I think it's important to show people why they may not want the government to have access to that information

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Should we ban tick-tock?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not talking about tick-tock

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  so  Discussions like this discussions like this should have should have happened two weeks ago  Was it two weeks ago when we had that congressional here? Yeah  Instead of having the grandstanding, right? That what you're saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They get they should have happened then and they are still happening. I mean some of this information came out because of a  senator Whiten's  discussion, right I  Think it's just we need to have this ongoing conversation and we need to keep thinking about it  We need to keep talking about it and one day something's gonna click for people, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here is a picture of the Pentagon hot dog stand  According to Brett Eaton an information and communications officer for Washington headquarters services  Rumor has it that during the Cold War the Russians never had any less than two missiles aimed at this hot dog stand  they thought this was the Pentagon's most seat most top-secret meeting room and  That in fact the entire Pentagon was a fortress built around  This hot dog stand this because according to satellite imagery  This is in the days before smartphones the Soviets could see groups of US military officers  Entering and exiting the hot dog stand about the same time every day  They concluded the stand was the entrance to an underground bunker where officers were going to get their top secret briefings in a protected area  sadly in 2006  Cafe ground zero as it was known  What was torn down?  So this predates location  What a name. I think it was a colloquial name

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know because because the missiles were were aimed at yeah, it was declared. I mean  Ground zero became ground zero because that's where the missiles

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because the Pentagon has been declared a national historic landmark  Even if they tear it down they had to replace it with a building of roughly the same size and shape  so  Maybe there's something there that actually is the entrance to a secret underground briefing room now  Which is what I would do if I were the Pentagon I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Would actually have the hot dog stand and put the secret meeting room under the hot under the hot dog stand

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's how that's how they do it on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  TV shows yeah, the Americans. That's clearly where the secret briefing room would be  Anyway, it's just depressing. I don't got nothing to say about tick-tock anymore except that  This is we're gonna take a break and then we are gonna talk about the hot new Android phone that was announced today  Hot from one of the from a surprising  company  Say does it help you narrow it down our show today brought to you by  Monday calm a team management platform that lets teams like ours plan manage and track work in one  Centralized place you can collaborate with your teammates track everything your team is working on  even when the team isn't all at work in fact especially when the team is working from home or  anywhere in the world in any industry whether you're working with a team of five or five thousand  Monday comm is the easiest way to keep everyone connected everyone on track and  With so many employees working from home today Monday comm is a project management platform that makes effective teamwork possible  anywhere  These look one of the things you need is a central place of truth of all the information  But I know also speaking as a team leader myself one of the things I don't want to do is start using  You know getting rid of everything we use and use this but I was so excited  We got Eddie to come in and show us how to use Monday comm he's he's one of their onboarding specialists  He's help set it set up some stuff and he showed us how we can automatically bring everything  We're doing right now right into Monday comm zoom slack Google Docs calendars emails everything and  We so we continue to use the tools we're used to but now we can see how it's going all in one  Centralized place you can improve coordination across teams and departments no more stand-ups  No more check-in meetings because you just go to the dashboard and you know exactly what's going on and  For people like Stacey who likes her perch charts you can have Monday comm look like whatever  Kind of dashboard you want again chart a timeline a can-ban you can have tables like spreadsheets Monday comm has you covered  They even have remote ready templates to get you up to speed in seconds. It's completely customizable  It adapts to whatever you need it to be you'll increase productivity and efficiency while facilitating transparency to improve  Collaboration they have automation and I love it. It's no code  It's no code automation so you could put and we did we put the entire team's workflow on autopilot  So everything wherever you're working flows into Monday comm so we can see what's going on alerts  Automatic status updates project flows keeping your team on track  confident in their work  Make and the other thing I love about this is if you use data to make decisions, and I hope you do  Now you're not just guessing well. I think this is how we're doing or this is what's going on you now can  See what's going on in real time from a single source of truth track progress timelines budgets  And that'll help you make better decisions a hundred thousand teams are already getting things done with Monday comm  And and get if you you know if you if you decide to sign up  And I think you will you definitely want to get Eddie or whoever the onboarding specialist is  To help you get the most out of the platform. They'll help you walk you through it. Give you some idea  You'll be up and running instantly  Change the way you work and do it online with Monday comm  Let them take care of the things that slow you down and free up more of your time to work on the things that get  Excited start your free 14-day trial right now Monday comm slash twit Monday  monda y Monday comm  slash to it we thank Monday for their support a  new OEM in the Android ecosystem someone who's never ever made an Android phone any  guesses  Apple no that would be good no  How about Microsoft  They have never made an Android phone before today they announced their first Android phone  It's called the duo the duo baby, and I am Microsoft doing this again. I ordered it already  Well for one thing they say tablet right it's not a phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I hope people are watching the video version of this because Stacy space

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why are they doing this again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why are they doing this so you're referring to their ill-fated?  Expedition into the world of mobile phones

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well there was the Nokia thing, but even before that they had the windows

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Most things they had some success until  Until Apple's came out with the iPhone  That's really what killed Windows phone and then they waited while Android and Apple kind of started to  Dominate and then finally they released Windows phone which I thought actually was quite good by Windows phone 8  It was a very nice operating system, but it was too late. They couldn't get in company stores  They couldn't get Verizon to recommend it it just died on the vine  It was it was actually kind of sad that they also took a multi-billion dollar write-off because they bought Nokia  Hoping that that would help them make the transition it didn't so they're very careful to say this is not a  Phone this is the surface duo I  Am very intrigued by this now remember. We've got folding phones. We're starting to see a lot of folding phones  This is a folding phone with a hinge. This is not a single screen  The idea is there is a you know there's a hinge in the middle, and there's a little bit of a bezel  Here I'll mute the sound it's no reason  Hear that stop

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would say that I okay, I still would call that a single screen. There's just a seam in the middle  I mean like well, it's two screens

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's two screens single screen or does operate it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like you can do either so this is their new launcher for instance, and that's an eight point one inch  Combined screen so you're somewhat right to say that this is basically a modified Android launcher  You still have the dock you have the left-hand side

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Y'all

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait till you see the Kindle app that Amazon's done for it. It is like a book in fact. That's what I  Know that's one of the killer apps as far as I'm concerned

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, because a Kindle is really effective at what it does

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree, but I love the idea of having two pages turning the page that kind of thing  It can it's a 360 degree hinge

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now remember you were right there Stacey. It was continuous. Yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean there's a  Bezel doesn't have to be I like it doesn't have to be yes doesn't have to be it's  Announced and it's Android pretty excited and they said they worked with Google effect when this morning Hiroshi  Luckheimer tweeted welcome to our newest  OEM you know what how weird this is for Microsoft?  Who has for years made operating systems and software that third parties would then make PCs?  Around right to now be the OEM and Google is providing the operating system and software

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What the hell why there's they're also still providing office 365. There's always that hook somewhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we talked about this on Windows weekly this morning because they do hope this will be a productivity tool a business tool  I don't think so see well. Do you like that Stacey? Why would you see that? I go back

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm liking everything about it. I really am I do this thing except for that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Size of that phone as she talks, that's why they're saying it ain't a phone  It's just it's really a piece of roofing tile that you're talking into

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're gonna get the fingerprints on the back screen when you close it that way yes, that's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's that's not so we're all used to fingerprints now. That's part of no no oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, we found Stacey's week

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Underbelly, no, it's actually not me. It's it's everyone in my family  My family runs around with greasy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh really? Oh, yeah, they're my daughter's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cuz I are back the other machines I'll reach out to touch the screen is you sit down Stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you're already sitting down  For 128 gigs $100 more you get 256 gigs now. I'll give you some interesting selling points  It's it's less than five meter each screen is less than five meters thick so together  It's 10 millimeters  Thick which is less than an iPad. It's thinner than an iPad even folded up  That was it I think it's interesting it has a camera, but it's not a great camera. It's a 11 megapixel  Well, we don't know it may not  You could

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ideas I would put this in my bag if I were traveling yes  To go it would replace my Kindle and my iPad could replace your phone  But a sim in my laptop yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Works on all the curious. Here's a question

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you were gonna watch a movie would you watch it over the both screens with a line or would you take it on the half?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You may not have the choice because  To span both screens software will have to be coded to be aware of that  It's my understanding and the way they should though would I mean they could do it if Microsoft  To bear well they can also tent it you can also tent it and watch right there's a table screen

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but it won't be half of it is each screen is what Leo. I'm sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You want the size?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  8.1 you said was the whole thing open yes, it's a point one inch so

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So each half is what?  I will tell you what the diagonals right there on the diagram. It's up there. Yeah, but it's not a diagonal for the oh there

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is yeah, there's a point three this diagonal five point six for the single screen

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's a sense and what's weird is this three two aspect ratio that is weird yeah, but that's Microsoft surface  That's what they like to do and actually I'm kind of on to it. I don't mind that  not windows

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like when I sit on my couch, I'm trying to think like they actually showed all trails, which is an app  I love in the maps and like right now when I'm planning my hikes  I'm scouring all trails and then opening up the maps to see how far away to drive it is so I'm like  Oh, that's kind of a fun use case that I have both things available to me  It doesn't feel productivity like content creation because that's my job  but it could feel like productivity from the standpoint of  Sometimes when I'm searching news, and then I want to tweet news or then I want to be to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, remember Microsoft has this app for windows called your phone  That will work with this it will take the Android apps and put them on your windows screen so you can kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Use it in a dual way, but it ironically you could now run a windows app in Android. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they come with a comes with yeah. Well it doesn't you you the way they show it is an on-screen keyboard

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you were asking about watching Netflix or something like that  And it's cool if it could span across both of those screens  But if it's spanning across both of those screens just how much time are you?  Spending you know expecting to spend watching a cinema on a device that small I bet on an airplane

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I yeah, I used to carry my my Nexus 7 that I mourned last week on the airplane  Perfect for watching a movie was perfect for doing productivity it was it was the pocket  I was

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But what I'm saying is you would probably just deal with that scene just for that particular circumstance  You don't want to do that every single day  But you would deal with it just because I'm on the plane

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It ain't much else I could do it's if you want to get it in perspective  It's a little bit bigger than a Nintendo 3ds a lot thinner, but about the size of it  So in fact here's a picture of a kid he's sitting me as a baseball referee  He said but that's it's like a game a little handheld game device kind of it's I think a little too big

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Stop showing people talking on the phone my goodness

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a guy notice are not showing a man with huge hands in both cases. They're showing a woman with it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, which is maybe that's just because women like to talk on the phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No comment, you know what it'll be good for it'll be good for Skype calls or video conferencing calls

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah  I liked I liked that they and they were talking they were showing somebody gaming on it and they had their  Betty the buddy that they were talking to while they were gaming right you could use the screens independently that's there's no Android phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know of that'll do that you the Galaxy fold  Once you open it that's the screen, but this the two screens could have each have a different app in them  Which is interesting  It's kind of like split screen on a Samsung  device  Or an Apple device, but I think there's something about a physical hinge with a little bezel  That just separates the two and a more

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Makes me it seems more naturally at the bottom of the service duo page  It shows the charger and the cord and the thing and then it has this weird kind of like license plate  Yeah, what is that? So?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a bumper. We talked about this on Windows Weekly because I said what do you why is that?  They Paul and Mary Jo got a briefing from Microsoft yesterday about this  device  But they didn't address it, but I think what we came up with and we may be wrong  This is a protective bumper that goes on it comes with it  and I think what they what they're concerned about is that people are gonna have the phone and  They're gonna go and that's that and slam it shut  And it's gonna crack the screen so the bumper I bet is a little  Stopper to keep you from slamming why does it have that that big left margin? I don't I don't know that's an interesting question

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know so maybe that's how you hold it in your hand  So you're so the your problem is not on the screen perhaps low bezel. There you go small bezel  Well, it's not teensy weensy bezel. Well, but it's big enough that that would create a holding spot. Yeah, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't know. This is a it's a nice. It's nice. What do you say? What's really to me?  There are a few things that are interesting one is that it is a Microsoft Android phone  Too is that they say it's not a phone  It has all the comes loaded with Microsoft Office all these productivity tools. They say it's a surface. It's part of our surface device  line  But I also I'm intrigued by folding phones. I was about to buy the Samsung  Galaxy fold to I think I've ordered this I think this might be better

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think this might be more interesting. I would love to go to a Microsoft store to try one, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can't and I don't think they have any they did not see reviewers with these Marquez Brownlee does not have one as far as I know  So they're they're being they're playing it pretty close to the vest  Pre-order now again 1399 or 1499 for delivery September 10th. So I'll have it in a couple of weeks. Which one is your order?  It looks super small in this guy's hands more storage exactly. Well, it is I think it is 5.6 inches  Yeah, it's like if it's like two phones side by side

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is fairly big Samsung phones. Yeah. Yeah, it's fairly small. It's the fatness of it. That's kind of it's a weird aspect ratio

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I don't know. But like you said that three to two aspect ratio is pretty common with Microsoft  I love it. I did a video for hands-on tech  This past week and the laptop that I did that I use had a three three to two aspect ratio  And I remember some of the comments were talking about how they can't stand that and like  Why would you want to have three to two because Netflix and Hulu is gonna look like crap on those types of screens?  And the answer is it's not for that. This is for getting work done. This isn't for entertainment  So it makes perfect sense. They do show people

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Watching videos on it. I think it's not as weird when you have it full, you know tended and you're just looking on one screen

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. I wish if I had if I had fourteen hundred dollars to spend and I wasn't gonna spend it on furniture  But I have a house  I would buy this because I'm really interested  I think I would use it in ways that are surprising and in novel and I I'm actually I hope this does well because I would

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like to see other people iterate on this concept. Thank you, Stacey. I would I would use it too and not just  Specifically from the content creation side like you were saying earlier, but there are some use cases where I'd like to have one screen open  To an app and another screen be for part of the research and note-taking and things of that nature  You know  I would love to be able to have Google Maps on one screen and a note-taking app on another screen as I'm planning out a  Walk and taking notes. All right, I need to make sure I go at this time and you know, I love that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's very do you hear us Microsoft? You should send us this because I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As far as I know the only person who has one is our friend Harry McCracken  Who who actually interviews Satya and Panos Pane was in charge of hardware at micro devices at Microsoft  He interviewed both of them and got one. So he's gonna join us tomorrow or yeah tomorrow on tech news weekly  He'll be our guest  with  Jason who will be very interested in this because he's the host of all about Android and Micah Sargent who will also be very interested  Because he's the host of hands on iOS or iOS today and hands on iOS. So I I think that I you know what?  We very rarely get a new form factor. Yeah, and so it's interesting to see it's also interesting again because Microsoft is now  Shipping Android phones which even though they say it's not a phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's kind of weird kind of shipping hardware and they're shipping a service. Yeah, that's all they're looking at. That's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right. And they and they see it as a continuum by the way, you can use the surface pencils with it  I presume that means I can use this pencil that came with this Lenovo as well  I mean, I think it's the same kind of pencil maybe not right? I have I have a few surface pencils lying around  So if you like to jot notes or sketch you could do that too. It's really interesting device. I'm really pleased to hear you and  Stacey say how much how interested you are in this because I thought it was just me when we did

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The live stream way back when when we're actually in the studio  Mr. Sargent and I were in the studio and did the Microsoft event and that was the the last thing that they showed that we almost  Missed because they just sort of oh, yeah  Here's this other device that we want to talk about  We were both of our jaws dropped because it looked like an interesting device brand new form factor  That it's something to be excited about. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Although let me just remind y'all of one of my favorite non devices that I don't know if that ever made it out there the surface  Table, do y'all remember that?  I was like yes, I want to have in hotels and casinos

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I've used it it was a weird I think was on a cruise ship as a weird device  The idea though is you put something on and it would sense it  So if you put your camera on it would show pictures and stuff. It was a very interesting  Device this is actually the great great great grandchild of that because it's using that pixel sense technology  They bought I think for the surface table

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This I don't want to be a naysayer but as I think about it more and more I think ever I agree  It's cool. Gee I want one because I'm that kind of guy inquisitive  But I could imagine  Finding myself using just one half the screen constantly. Yeah, see that would imagine a lot of apps then you should have a phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I think  Microsoft's gonna have its apps adapted but  Developers will have to jump on the bandwagon to take advantage of this the good news are how badly apps work  Android apps work on the Chrome that's what's interesting to me Android  Tablets have failed it's a failed category because nobody wanted to adapt their apps for a different form factor same thing with the same  Problem the Chromebook faces, but this if an app is just an app it'll look normal in the five point six inch screen  But if you do adapt it  It could be smart about it and some of the Microsoft apps are smart. They showed  Adobe I don't know if it was a PDF reader, but it would have the form here and the and the thing you're filling out  Bigger on the right so you could write with a pen to sign your name or whatever  So I think some apps will be adapted and they did say Amazon has adapted the Kindle app  So it has that nice page turn. I think this might be like reading a book, which will be very interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What I would do much adapt, but it still be cool to have. Yeah. Well, I'll get one. I'll have it September 10th

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We'll talk about it. The thing about it is though. It's something I think you have to spend some real time with  Yes, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kind of my attitude  That's why we I buy all the phones I review because I want to spend enough time with it to to get a fair review  I think the two-week I got a loan or two week now. We're gonna send it back reviews aren't just aren't that useful. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Feel like you can spend a lot of time with the device in two weeks, but that's just me you can  Like as a smart home person having actually having the stuff in your house  Does change how you report? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This one is sorry  The problem is I want to go on the road

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, no one can take it on the road right now, yeah, that's the problem  Yeah, well you could Jeff you just you would just have to pretend here you just here's what you do  You wake up super early you sit in your car for a while  And then you go and you find another uncomfortable place to sit like a closet maybe and then you hang out there for four hours  And every now and then your your wife can yell at you how's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, that's now now Stacey you you're also a  electric car owner, so  I'm gonna say something you can say whether I'm full of it or not  I think that only people who don't have an electric car worry about the range of their electric car  Once I once you get one a couple hundred miles is all you need. I think you're in the cult Leo

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I I look at that. There you go. That's what it is. Whoa

Transcript:  Geez say it's a recliner rural area. I think those people have legit range anxiety

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, if you if you don't live anywhere near a charger, you're right  Yeah, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think if you just don't live in a suburban area or a city, right?  Because the type of driving you're gonna do is a little bit different

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, some people shouldn't own electric vehicles that might be one of them. I don't know. Yeah, there's that yeah  Cuz I mean, I think you need a pickup truck Stacey is what you need. What no, I will never drive a pickup truck  They're very useful. This is one of those car reveal videos. It doesn't actually show the car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now this is the new jersey supreme court

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, you know, what doesn't really

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The problem is the courts go back and forth on this do  You have a right not to unlock your phone  Does it violate your police with the police with the police does it violate?  Yes, you can unlock your phone anytime you want but can the police demand that you do it or does that violate your fifth amendment right?  Against unreasonable search and seizure  New jersey supreme court has now ruled that compelling a suspect to unlock his or her cell phone does not  Violate the fifth amendment  You may remember a couple of months ago indiana's supreme court says it does  There there's just a virgin  Cases which I guess means that we're gonna have to wait till there's a supreme court ruling on this, right?  The case was a focused on an allegedly corrupt cop named robert andrews  A former Essex county sheriff who allegedly tipped off a suspect about a pending police investigation  Under police questioning the suspect said  Oh andrews told me to get a new phone to avoid a police wiretap  He also said, uh, yeah, he helped me identify an undercover police cop in unmarked police vehicles  So the police seized two iphones belonging to the  police officer, but they couldn't unlock them  And andrews refused to unlock them based on his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination. That's what it is not search and seizure  That's fourth. This is against self-incrimination  But on monday the case appealed to the new jersey supreme court

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they rejected that fifth amendment claim. Hey, couldn't couldn't they just grab the text from the other dude's phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, or from uh phone company records or yeah, yeah  Yeah, yeah, you'd think that's stupid. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um, this is a prosecutor panac's to grind. Okay, the the could we just also just say I forgot my password  Like everybody else on the planet does

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, seriously just I forgot my password you're gonna unlock you'd be forced to unlock it with your thumb

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, you don't have to have that enabled

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's true. Yeah, there's a lot of there's a lot of reasons you could be put in who was put in jail

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who was put in jail for a long time for contempt for just

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not following the yeah, there was a child pornographer who would not unlock his hard drives  So it's been a couple of years in jail  uh  Now I can't remember how that case finally got freed. I think I think he got freed. Yeah  So the supreme court said the right against self-incrimination only  protects defendants against  testimony  Not the production of incriminating documents by the way, there's cases that disagree with this  Testimony usually refers to speech, but that's not always the case. Sometimes a defendant can reveal information by his or her actions  For example, if the government doesn't already know who owns a phone  Then forcing a defendant to unlock it amounts to forced testimony that the defendant's the owner  Mm-hmm court said you can't do that  but  Since the phones are registered in his name and were in his possession  They said yeah, you obviously, you know the pass court  So if he's forced to enter the pass codes into his own phone according to the new jersey supreme court  He is not revealing any information. The government doesn't already know they know he owns it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay  So now on the password still doesn't matter because they own it yeah, that's what you're saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is the crux of it is courts of a long for a long time said  We can force you to produce documents  Even if they incriminate you that is not a violation of the fifth amendment  For instance the government can order the defendant to unlock the safe  Even in the pursuit of incriminating documents  So this does sound kind of like that  And this is the case that you were talking about jeff a philadelphia man was released  From jail after four years of being held in contempt  Because he refused to unlock the hard drives of vermont federal court  Colorado federal court virginia state court and massachusetts supreme judicial court  as well as the indiana supreme court all  held that  You can't  They rejected his argument that the fifth amendment gave him a right to refuse to unlock his  hard drives  But in florida wisconsin and pennsylvania  The courts have held forcing people to provide computer or smartphone passwords violates  the fifth amendment so

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stay out of jersey if you know what's good for you new now new jersey indiana vermont colorado virginia and massachusetts

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  versus florida wisconsin and pennsylvania  I guess it's really so

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh before are we ready for a news story? Yeah. Oh, we're done. All right  Do y'all have the feature the twitter features that let you only talk to certain people?  Not yet to you y'all I do

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You do too, yeah  Yes, sir, but i'm not utilizing it. It's fairly public when you say only talk to certain people

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You mean that only some people can you you can say who can reply to you, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Everyone people I follow are only people I mentioned

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Those are the three choices who can reply to your tweets to a specific tweet or or or blanket?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Whenever I write a tweet now. I have an option for that tweet  Yes, so when I say what's happening I can I can do everyone can reply  People I follow are only people I mentioned

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, then they additionally put on a  Governor on the number of replies you can have right?  I believe so. I'm not a fire that's in here somewhere. Yes, where would you see that?  Do you see it after you open up your tweet button?  The reply when I press the tweet or when I when I retweet with a comment

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, so in order to test this I actually have to tweet

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Correct, you don't actually just hit the button. You can just see it at the bottom. You'll see you don't have it  Yeah, I don't have it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe they're giving it to women and people of color first because we're maybe the most because you're better maybe  Because we're the most maligned people on twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have I I when the after the twitter hack I set my account to  Private so maybe it's doesn't make sense if you have a private account. Oh, yeah, if your account's already private

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No one can talk to you. Anyway

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nobody can talk to me. Anybody can see it. And if you could you can't see it, but I feel better because you can't reply

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey who has who here has more than half a million followers  Who has two thumbs and more than half a million followers?  this guy

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who used to be the most followed person on twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So does it now does it make any difference if you make your account private you have half a million followers  You're not that private

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's a good point. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just didn't I don't know. I just didn't want  Any bitcoin fraud on my account? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It doesn't make sense but didn't it had nothing to do with being

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Verified in the end which is who they picked on right? Yeah, and if right and if we didn't know and if they had that god mode  If they could have easily turned private mode off and then tweeted for me

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I was gonna I was gonna point that out to you, but then I was like, it's mine. It's a minor protection

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I would like to say here now if you don't follow me and you see a tweet from me, it's not from me

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's that I was gonna say I said it was dumb kids and I was right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was yeah, you were it was a 19 year old high school recent high school graduate  Not named Kirk  But he did have pointy ears so we thought maybe he's a star trek fan we didn't know  But then wouldn't he be Spock  Yeah, but maybe maybe he wanted maybe he's saying i'm the captain now, I don't know  Okay

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So then we have

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So then we have material design  What's that?  So I got upset because my on my gmail  Suddenly had a bar on the bottom that said email meet and I took away space from my email on my screen  And I didn't know what to do. I got very upset. I got very angry and I was very unhappy  No one looking around and luckily the verge has a piece about how to get rid of that five steps in  But then because it's yes it does you can get rid of that  Yeah  But then here we go. Yes, let's do this. So you go to the settings you pick your account  Then you go to the meat thing and you can click off  So you don't like this extra button here. I hate it. I never have used meat that way

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we're looking first of all, I don't use the gmail app, but uh, that's just because you're you  Oh the gmail app is terrible. So but you're using the gmail app. Has it gotten better?  This is one of the reasons it's terrible at the bottom  You can choose between looking at mail and looking at meetings. Is that what that button means or or making it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I think no starting an email or starting a meeting. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you so stacy just did it so you select the hamburger icon  In the upper left hand corner scroll down and tap on settings select the gmail account  You want to change scroll down to the meat category and uncheck?  Show the meat tab for video calling

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was the most helpful thing that has come of this show wasn't it? You're welcome. It gave it gave you one more

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  message in your view

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, I know but one message counts. I'm with you jeff  Yes  I mean, I'm not I wasn't that angry, but I appreciate knowing how to change it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So then below that somewhat google's been pushing meat everywhere they possibly can I really have yeah, so now they have  material design

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  material design  It's just funny. Okay, I have to  Hand paste this hold on  Yeah, the spreadsheets act weird. Well, it's just life. I'm really excited about google's new design system  Material design and he's pointing out how is  Everywhere meat meat meat

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which is when you um, where's that there it is that is it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everybody forgets we have half the faculty trying to go to meet and half the faculty in zoom

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, we've had that happen many times. You have to turn it off because it's there by the phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  After you put the address I fall for it all the time. I'm in sitting alone in a google meet  And there's nobody there and they said what are you doing there? Well, that's what the link in the calendar of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Irritating is irritating

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you gotta you gotta admit though  That's that's how you have to market it and raise awareness is just keep putting it everywhere because there it's not like they're great at  General marketing and getting everybody's attention like a company. So is this an example?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not like they only have one kind of messaging  Conferencing app. Yeah, there's that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is this example as mark cantor tweeted?  Of and a monopolist behavior leveraging an existing property to take  On a competitor

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, come on. It's not gonna work. Nobody  So does that make it less monopolistic if it doesn't work? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's still monopolist behavior. It's just not influencing it. This just doesn't work. Did you read mike masnick's thing about  google's ad  His ad debacle like he took he had to take ads off of tech dirt because mike's gonna be on twitter on sunday

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I want to read I know about this so I can ask him  So is it on tech dirt doc? Oh, yeah, why are there currently no ads and tech dirt? There it is apparently  Google thinks we're dangerous  That's basically puts him out of business

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well the the challenge is and he talks about this really he does a really good job explaining how  Google keeps flagging things on his site for being problem. Basically some oh, this is what the federalist was this was the yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They were complaining that uh, remember this the stories  From the right that the federalists and other right  conservative journals are being defunded by google  Because but what it is is if they see content on a page that they don't think  Advertisers will want to be near they'll just say well, you can't put ads on that page  The truth is  Says mike masnick ad sense content moderation just sucks  Tons of websites deal with the same kind of pie privacy a policy violation notice from google all the time two weeks ago  It went into overdrive for us at tech dirt. We started receiving policy violation notices at least once a day  Frequently multiple times a day every time the message was the same telling us we had violated their policies  They don't say which ones and that we had to log in to our ad sense policy center  To find out what the problem was  Every day for the ensuing week and a half until we pulled the ads down  We would get more of these notices and every time we'd log in we'd get an ever-rotating list of violations  Do you think it's possible somebody's?  Got it in for that's what i'm wondering

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's exactly what i'm flagging here with this happening a hundred times

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But this is I mean that's a pretty abusive thing to do  And it's a problem that google doesn't have a way for his team to reach out and say  It's kind of like when you call the police and you're like, hey, i'm highly like it's highly likely that I will be swatted  So right document that right google doesn't have that service

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google also started claiming our daily emails, which are just snapshots of the blog were phishing attempts  Automatically deleting them from any g-suite users email account

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody's going after somebody  partly maybe because he pooh-poohed the federalist story  possibly

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But mike makes enemies right and left  By fighting the good fight such a nice guy. Yeah, we had him on twit a few weeks a few months ago  We're gonna have him on a twit again sunday. I will definitely ask him about this. He had him on twig too  Yeah, he was on this show. He was on twig and he wasn't on twit. You're right. He was on twig this show  So he's on the big show this time

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, hey, hey, I feel really lousy when you call it this the not big show  I think our show is good. It is the big show or the kitty this show

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no the precursor to the big show. No, no, no the post cursor

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This show  Is our deep philosophy show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I really don't want to be a deep philosophy show. That's what she hates. She hates. I am I am a tech nerd

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would like to talk about tech. Oh, I didn't understand that all this time. I wish you told me

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can we talk about chips?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have no idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, well that's why we put you on this show to break to make it less philosophy and more chips  Chips, let me find a chip story

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll see the chips  She said oh no, we do have oh we have the reallocation of spectrum. That's that's up stacy's. Oh, that's a big story

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, oh we can do that. The defense department has finally agreed to give up some  Spectrum they use in the three point gigahertz range  It'll be applied to consumer 5g. So that's that's not millimeter wave, but it is a high frequency  Yeah, 3.5 gigahertz. Woo. Woo. It's not it's not a huge amount of frequency. It's only 100 megahertz of frequency

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But is it one channel? I guess because if you have one channel that's 100 megahertz wide  You can put a lot of data in those

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's that's the that's the if your phone is already made and is already supposedly 5g does this not help that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, because you would need chips that work at this unless they somehow have a 3.5 gigahertz chip. So this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry, go ahead. I was I was assuming the phones have the two point was it two point four  That's why

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  yeah, so spectrum policy is like  they planned like  10 years out is not abnormal to think like so yeah when you're thinking about what freed up for some time

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We actually have already some 3.5 gigahertz. No, there'll be a spectrum auction in the december of 2021  Followed by a mid 2022 consumer deployment  Wow, okay. Oh, wow that far we just did we just did

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah  So we just did cbrs in the same band so we did  A citizens broadband radio service in the same band that auction just concluded

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like thank god cb radio has a new new home  That's how long this takes  That that is cb right this now they call it rebranded a family radio but  Family radio service, but it's c it's the old cb

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know if it's the old cb videos frs is the old cb. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because yeah cbrs and that's that's 150 megahertz in the 3.5 gigahertz band  Which technically runs from 3.55 to 3.7 megahertz

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if you go to jeep jamboree this year, make sure you bring your cb radio  by the way the  this they call this mid brand because  There's 600 megahertz  5g that's the stuff t-mobile's doing it's not particularly too fast or anything, but it's 600 megahertz  So it goes through walls. There's millimeter wave, which is what is it? Where is that 20 gigahertz? It's really high

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They say it's between 24 in like 39 is what we're calling it really high and that bounces off tin foil

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That bounces off your nose. It's that doesn't go through anything  But it's fast  So this is in between

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have to think about it this way, right? So you've got your there's a couple things  So we saw that chart last week where we saw how far things can travel and then how it can go through walls or not  Or water or whatever how fast it that was a really good graphic. Yeah. Yes  So how fast your your radio waves drop off the other thing you have to think about when you're talking about spectrum is channel width  so  When you get to those hot higher ranges  Nobody's using that very much and because there's so much attenuation. It's just overall less it's been less useful  So it's not as crowded so you can have these really fat channels  So like 100 megahertz why is that why you get so much bandwidth why you get so much bandwidth?  It's nobody wants it  Yeah, it's 600 megahertz. Everybody's there. You've got like 10 megahertz channels  maybe 20 if you're lucky and  The carriers they have to split that between upload and download  So that makes sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so it's where all this is coming from it's a trade-off that you have to make between  A penetration penetration and you know availability usability and speed

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this will be a little they didn't they they have 100 megahertz, but they didn't say whether they're that's one band

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah in in channel width is super nerdy y'all. This is again. This is this is where jack is like you'd like it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love it keep talking

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But so but that's that's one of the things where people are like  you know, it's it's an under discussed element there, but and if you can like  with like  The millimeter wave stuff they can even talk about like they're talking about like 60 gigahertz, right? Wow, which is easy, but  That doesn't even go through a bush. It's like me to my my camera right here  Yeah, it's like a lot of data really fast and that's why we always talk that would be useful like in the home, right for

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Devices to talk to one another that type of spectrum is not necessarily that tried to use that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it actually sucks in the home because it fries your liver  No, the reason is because we're giant bags of salt water. Yeah, we're the worst

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, okay. We're the worst  So it really is only useful line of sight applications  Yes, and that's why specialized line of sight applications your giant bags of salt water. We are

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I thought I thought you didn't talk like philosophy. That was a highly philosophical statement. You just made that's all we are  All we are is bags of salt water in the world there's there's stacy's existentialism

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There we go, according so the problem is that this mid band is typically used by military  Uh, and so this was a big deal the white house announced the dod has agreed to relinquish

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A mere hundred megahertz of that 3.5 gigahertz spectrum. Here's my next question. So that's in the u.s  The same thing's not happening in europe, right? So your 5g hearing and separate everything's there. Yeah, it's different everywhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So there are efforts every every time the the fcc looks at this stuff and like all the chip companies  They make efforts to try to get everybody on the same bands. Obviously that's just work  but things like wi-fi  Um, some of actually some of the cbrs stuff that's in this band will be uh internationally  Uh, congruent there's actually a word for this and I can't think of it right now, um, but yeah, so  The answer is sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn't  Oh when it works though, it's really good because that's fewer radios in your devices and fewer skews for like a big vendor

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you stacy  You're welcome. Fascinating  I feel better. Thank you. Ah now I feel like I need  Some gutenberg philosophy or something

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you see I was really new about channels like that was fascinating  The channel with that I never even knew anything about that. That's that's really fascinating

Transcript:  So I think it's interesting the genius lost its case against Google so tell this is rap genius  Rap genius, so they said that Google  Was putting up lyrics from genius and Google said oh sorry yeah, okay?  They proved it they proved it because they had messed with the lyrics

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that they would know if their lyrics appeared anywhere else inserted codes with yeah different kinds of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Astros and stories really foods and stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google's defense was we didn't buy it from we were using a third-party surface service to do which turned out to be a lie

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because they were in fact still getting the ones for genius because genius spiked them with little clues right however  Genius lost because genius was stealing the lyrics to they didn't know the copyright so they had no standing  Obviously  Yeah  How can they sue Google over copyright when they don't own the copyright okay, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This whole story we did a story when they put the Morse code in the lyrics and it's spelled out red-handed  And we even asked at the time  Do they have a license for the lyrics who's right remember that discussion in fact we guessed that well  They must they must have a deal with the public license. Yeah  Not  That's a dumb lawsuit didn't they have an attorney mention that you know guys do you actually  License those do you have any rights to those you have any standing in this trial?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  While we're up in that part of the rundown I  went to my cardiologist a week ago because it's just regular checkup because I'm an old fart and things go wrong and  He said is tech gonna solve this being kovat and I said how and he said you know  couldn't Amazon and Google get together and and finally make tests that work and  I thought well yeah  Yeah, why not Amazon has its tests and verily is doing tests  But if big tech got together and said governments failed us yeah, we tried that once tests remember

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That API that Google and Apple made it. I know nobody used

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well the problem there is that software trying to solve the problem. This is not a software problem  They should make the tests they should make a test a facial the tests and do all that they could do this Apple

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just further erodes any use in utility of government. We need our government actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we don't we don't want to right now. They have failed us miserably the thing  We need most is testing and as somebody steps and the next thing we're gonna need most is mechanisms to distribute  Vaccines knock would we get one right now if we could all have a cheap test well the Russians have one  Vaccine yes, sure Trump will be taking it  So I just I just don't know so so you're right Leo  I mean as they stepped up who's heard of the track tracing acts apps since four states said they'd use it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They never did a few  Turns out nobody you need to contact tracings

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you need contact tracing when you have fewer cases when everybody's getting it  It doesn't do good, but if we do desperately need testing still  It's a huge failure and technology could have stepped up and they still could

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's a good gig throw some money throw some money at the government. It helps speed up the process if you have to just whatever it takes  Got the cash we all got time

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We all got time got nothing but it I  Think it's harder than that. I don't think you can just do it  Why you say that?  Because if you could then they would

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Amazon's making its own test you think bill Gates what they need is scale. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Amazon Google make their own tests. Yeah  Somebody else from Abbott or somebody they actually have a Google's COVID test

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm telling you if they put their heads to it if if well if the if the federal government used the defense  What you would call it act they could make them do it. But of course production it does. I'm sure Amazon

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Doesn't make its own test they get it from Abbott or somewhere. I think Amazon can do anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, barely so Google's barely has built its own lab it does not

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because that's one of the problems is because these commercial labs are so they can build a thousand labs, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Challenges facing quest and  Lab core the big companies that are doing this is they can't get reagents and they can't get swabs, right?  Right. So the swabs are for the testing side, but the reagents are for the diagnostic side. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is one of the few times I say throw some money at the problem, yep cuz it'll help

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It would help immensely. I just wanted to get off my chair. So Vera it looks like

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is fairly doing PCR tests  Yeah, barely is using thermo Fisher's tack path test kit  So it's the third party just an emergency use one. So it may or may not work  There's that but

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know Amazon could put three thousand two hundred thirty six satellites in orbit and they can't make some tests for us  They can't do everything. They've got other things to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They can take over empty spots and malls and they can't make some tests for biology

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they can't make some tests biology is so vastly different

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  in Silicon Valley's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ask your  cardiologist

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Say why is why isn't what I mean, why doesn't Bill Gates do it?  He's got some money. Why why doesn't Bill just come up with a vaccine? Come on Bill. There was a guy there was a guy

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's no Amazon is doing their own labs

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and by the way, they are the bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has spent many millions of dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  funding test research and there's plenty of tests there's over a  120 something tests out there Jeff  They just need to be going through the process of making sure they're accurate and that takes time

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And these are scientists at these companies they could do it. I have faith in them

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Make a test if it's so easy time it's happening

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just happening at speeds that work with you know, the fact that it's sounding more and more like you mean grandpa

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Forty-eight. Yeah, is this your class? Is this your class is 45 minute? Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I put I put a bitly link up there. This is because we are remote  What is normally done in class I had to I had to record as a video and you've made this available to anybody  I made it available to all the entire me if you if you love my I know you don't I know you all hid  But if you love my Gutenberg moments, here you go  The entire history of media and journalism five hundred and some years in 45 minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you do it from notes or you just off the top of your head? Oh, no, I just knows but I did it one take

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I did a few takes at first, but then when I did it I did it one day

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's pretty neat and did you have to hold up these books at any point or did you just I did I did I held up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Elizabeth Eisenstein's the press is the pretty impressive the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you if you were if school were meeting would you do this as a lecture? Would this be one of your life?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We do it as a discussion with the class and I would use material and I asked some questions and I okay  So you don't just what I had to do was I had to record it's this this this remote learning stuff is hard  And I don't have kindergarten  You should tell him to do. Mm-hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Download Jeff  Give you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  More like more interactive presentation I could have applause and if Sarah Cooper can do it without an audience I can  so I did one on the history one on the business one on the roles of journalism and  Then I'm now having discussions today was my first class which felt really good. It was a hundred students Wow one zoom room

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is not by putting this on YouTube. You've already got  373 views you've tripled the number of people who are influenced by that's right. This is great. I can I can hypnotize

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hypnotism I'd like to check this out  It's good

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Journalism, I'm fine. You don't want to you know, it's youtube.com slash Jeff Jarvis

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I did I did bit.ly slash journalism history. Okay, that's good to be ITL y slash

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  journalism  History, why don't we take a little little teeny weeny break a reeny?  Don't we have to do something before that break? Oh, is it change log time?  Did I forget again? Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you don't like the change log, I love the change log

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Love the change like

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think Karsten makes him do it. I'm scared of Karsten

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are lots of ways parents now of course saddled with a challenging task of  Homeschooling in effect you still have classes and teachers like mr. Jarvis  But ultimately parents are often now called upon to do things like solve math problems. Yep  Yep, do you remember much?  You know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's some of this some of the things I do. Okay with  But a lot of this stuff it's totally out of my head because I don't use it, you know  Granted I still know Pythagoras theorem or whatever, but I don't use that crap anymore  but  Yes, doesn't excuse me not being able to help the boys either, you know  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yesterday we did an iOS today that was all about some tools for parents who have kids at home learning  One of them was Microsoft has a math helper program that lets you take pictures of  Math problems and formulas and it will solve them for you  Google's getting into that business too. They're gonna add a Google lens  Unfortunately, it's later this year. We need it now Google hurry both iOS and Android that will allow you to take a picture of  Math problems and get step-by-step guides on how to solve them  So, you know what you need to do though

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You need to have an option in here to do it in certain styles because there's like traditional math. There's Singapore math  There's yeah other math and you have to teach it the right way that your kid is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I saw something where an equation that I saw was wrong because apparently the order of operations has changed

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've never changed the order of operations  Operations

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Something there they I believe his order of operations is changed. Wow. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just an excuse as excuse for getting the answer wrong with this kid. No, no, no, no, no, don't you try that  Kids they change this on me

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Read and said the article I was reading said you probably guessed the answer was B or whatever  And and you're wrong and it told me why is because you learned on the order of operations this way  Now the answer is yada yada yada yada and I'm like now what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this is and this is the Microsoft math solver which is free on the App Store and on Android it does it as well and  Micah Sargent talked about that yesterday. So  Lenses will do it soon. That's pretty cool that you can't do that  Right Google search is also adding 3d molecules to help teach chemistry at home  So you can search for propanol and you'll get a nice yeah, that's nice. I like that. These are all things  I mean, this is great. Yeah, this is exactly  What it should do and you'll get models and so forth. Honestly, the internet is the best teacher ever  There just takes time folks. You have to know where to go and we're no it takes time to develop these things

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, don't give up on the internet. No give up. Don't give up

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is a new Google phone app beta which you can install from the Play Store if you're  You're on Android  Google's new phone app which has some nice features  Is now on the Play Store instead of kind of being installed from the factory and updated  as part of the software update  so you may not see it in search but  You try to find it good luck  I don't know if you don't see in the search. I don't know what you're supposed to do. Just keep looking  For some reason it doesn't this is from Android police. You'll have to navigate to it manually. Oh, well  Search Google for it and then click the link that you find or go to Android police because they have a link there

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's weird, but I don't talk on the phone often yeah who needs a phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This I love this idea. This isn't going to happen right away, but this is coming  Soon you know that your smartphone has an accelerometer in it well apparently that could be used to detect earthquakes basically  Like a seismograph Google is partnering in California with the United States Geological Survey and the California governor's  OES office of emergency services to send earthquake alerts directly the Android devices now that comes from Shakealert  Which has seismometers all over the state, but seismometers are expensive and the plan eventually is  To with the permission of the phone's owner  You don't need a separate app your I Android phone become a mini seismometer  it's going to be called the Android earthquake alerts system and  Honestly with millions of phones this thing could be pretty amazing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't it mean it's already happening no

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right now they're using my shake

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But this Google system is coming. No no I mean that the earthquake is already happening. Oh, yeah  It's not an early warning system. It's not it's not an alert. Yeah, that's a yeah although although

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can detect both primary waves and secondary waves people don't usually feel the P wave  Which is the first and fastest wave from the epicenter the s wave is the one you really notice  So it could be a little bit of an early warning  It could give you a few seconds warning when the P wave arrives and then the s waves on its way  You can quick and run and jump under the table  You won't have time to move out of town, but it'll give you a few seconds anyway. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Got to tell you  Since coming to Northern California. It's been some weird experiences  You know I got here and there was the first forest fire or wildfire and in a month later  There's another wildfire and then we got into  The crazy rainy season then this pandemic happened and then I woke up on a Sunday morning to earthquake news  That wasn't in California, but was in North Carolina. Ah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The earthquakes they left when that you got here. They said oh man. It's here. No earthquakes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Send them back home such a weird weird

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Six months to a year do as you know and I'm sure we told you this  Yeah, and we're due for a pretty serious shaker, but we just haven't had a big one since 89 and I don't I  Don't know you know how bad was it up in Petaluma? I was in San Francisco in 89. You were in San Francisco weren't you during the no?  Loma Prieta, it was pretty bad. I was actually the World Series game  The Giants game was going on and we're sitting here, and it starts to shake and you know the big towers  This is a candlestick park that lit the field the big light stanchions  You could see him swaying by many feet like that and then crazy all the players ran out of the dugouts  Into the center of the field and they grabbed by the way it was really insulted  They would they reached up into the stands got their wife and kids and they all ran out to the middle of the field  And then so then that shook shook shook, and then we're sitting here  And it just the lights went out and it was scary  We knew we'd had a big earthquake everybody from the area knows what it feels like  But we didn't know how bad, but that's when the rumors start boy  You really see how that happened that you didn't have phones then with no people are listening to the radio the Bay Bridge is down  And it turns into the city's burning  You know it's really interesting that so I was with a friend who knew the city pretty well  We drove back, and I went right to the radio station to work for the next three or four days  But that we haven't had a big one since then  So so let's see when is this gonna happen because this is kind of cool  You won't need it. You will not need an OS upgrade it will be integrated in Google Play services  Which means most Android phones will get it?  Except for the I'm sorry Huawei the Huawei phones won't get it  It's not clear when this will  Will be available, but I think that's a really neat idea  It will give you a few seconds warning before the earthquake  Wow can you imagine your phone hollering?  It's gonna be a quake get out if you got enough time you can get outside which  Unless you're in a city probably all right be all right to do  You don't want to if you're downtown San Francisco you stay inside  All that in your door frame yeah that falling glass is could be deadly  But apparently there is an xkcd  About this from what if what if everybody?  Stood next to each other and jumped no. I don't think this is related

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's I'm being funny if everybody on earth jumped at the same time okay would it register?  That was the would it I don't know we'll find out

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google Lookout can now read grocery labels for the visually impaired. That's kind of neat. That's nice  What is the name of that app?  There is a really nice app that you can ask somebody to read a label for you if you're blind and it's kind of a volunteer  App but this will be part of Lookout is so Lookout still around I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's funny. I forgot like yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you can aim it at the camera on the phone at a label  And a computer voice will say what food it thinks you're holding  And maybe even read stuff too, but it's mostly about identifying food in the grocery store  Be my eyes, that's the one I was trying to think of oh be my eyes is a really neat  A  Volunteer app for Android or iOS  Where if you're blind you could say hey, I need some help  And then you press a button calls the first available volunteer you show them a picture and they'll explain what's going on Wow  Is that neat and I know a lot of people to do it. It's just fun. You know you got a little that's pretty cool  Yeah, you have the app on your phone. You say I'm available anytime somebody needs me I  Know I love that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you need there used to be like a Q&A app  Remember way way back at the day where if you had a question this was before Google was good at this sort of stuff  You would you would ask your question and it would actually text a person  I think that was called or something. Oh aardvark. You're right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What a memory  Yes aardvark

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that went away, but this is still here. So yeah, I'm a cool. Yeah, it was like phone a friend

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I  Call a librarian  Google is pushing out some updates to all Android phones running Android 6 or above  We're getting close to Android 11, but there are new features for even so Android Auto now works on it with more  What more cars I think  They've also changed the user interface so you can see a list of upcoming calendar appointments while you're looking at directions  You can have a built-in dialer button if the appointment has an associated phone number  And Android Auto users should have more control over what they see over their cars infotainment. There's a new bedtime mode  Not for the car  This is something we got on the pixel phones, but other phones will now get it and it's kind of nice thing  It has a sunrise alarm which kind of gradually wakes you up  Android's emergency location service is being expanded so emergency personnel  Will be provided with your devices language settings. So you'll don't know what language you need to speak for  First responders arriving on the scene. I think that's kind of that's cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I would have never thought about that  Until I moved here and noticed there's so many people that speak different languages

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah  So that's a bunch of new features for Android in addition the ones we've already mentioned  And Google is testing new profile cards  That let you add yourself to search results  Now this is only in India, I'm hoping this will come  To the US and the rest of the world at some point  So they're testing it. It's a new user created profile system called people cards  You create your own profile card kind of like a business card. Yeah, nobody's gonna spam this I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wanted to I wanted to ask you how's the opinion on this?  What what do you think of this?  Well, they have to search for you and would you use it for your own personal  Yeah, I would not for someone else use it for yourself

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so remember when you search for ant Pruitt right now, you don't really control what shows up, right?  Right. Google bases it on links and so forth. This is nice. You could say no. No, this is me  This is what I want you to know. How do they verify this?  They know everything  Google says it has a number of mechanisms to prevent spam and abuse of the people card system  You create in your Google account. You can only create a single card in each account  You have to have an authenticated account with a phone number  It will let users flag cards with bad information or you can flag cards  You think we're created by an imposter and of course users can delete or edit their own cards at any time

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All of that sounded good, especially with it being tied to the Google account  I just hope they actually stick to that premise because this is just something that could very well

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know somebody's gonna try to make a Leo Laporte card. Yep, you know  Yeah, I mean they'd have to figure out a way to do it without that risk  But yeah, maybe that's how you do it tied to an account something like that  Ladies gentlemen that concludes the Google change log

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was a little loud on you Ben Evans your favorite my favorite it's a very good one  It's too long for us to really yeah discuss but I will put it in here so that people were interested would breaking up big tech work  And this is on Ben dash Evans calm

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is can you summarize yeah, yeah, it just simply that doesn't  Regulation is gonna be better than breaking up  There's network effects. And so if you cut off  Instagram and Instagram becomes Instagram, it's still gonna be Instagram. You haven't really you know, they said oh gee Facebook doesn't know anymore  Okay, fine, but it's still Instagram. It doesn't change  The factor of and standard oil is not a good example of what this is and what the phone companies went through and so on so forth  So he argues for other reviews, but it's gonna be unintended consequences. Yeah, I think I agree with that but we do agree

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's life life is an

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Indeed mom and dad had other philosophical statement from Stacy. I just want the record to show  No, but he's but I think we all involuntary

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Philosopher some form of regulation is a good idea. I think we could agree as what you want to do, right? But it's  I feel bad for Mozilla some big layoffs. I think 250 people  Dang yeah, it's refocusing on commercial products. They're trying to make Mozilla  Hey better

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, this is and this is one of Ben Evans points again in another tweet that the government's saying Google you paying for exclusive  Access is a bad thing and it's a use of your power  Well that actually pays most of the bills Mozilla which creates a competitive browser  What do you want to do yeah, yeah, that's literally how Mozilla is funded yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And until their credit you can say I don't want to use Google as a search  But if you do they'll make some money just as Apple pays Google  I mean Google pays Apple to be the default search engine in Safari. You could change a lot of money. Yeah  Eleven billion dollars, I think last year  Wow  All right your picks Stacy  Are you ready for your thing I am ready for my thing this this week is not actually a thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not because I'm lazy, but because I donate blood  And I didn't realize this but the FDA loosened the  Donation qualifications, so if you have not been able to donate blood  In the past you actually may be able to donate now  So like some of the things are like for a while if you lived in the Europe between a certain in Europe  For certain time periods when mad cow disease was happening. They wouldn't let you donate blood, but they've they've since said that's fine  Now you instead of if you have gotten a period of time that you've been able to donate blood  You've gotten a piercing or a tattoo  Within the last three months you can't donate but if anything over that and it used to be 12 months

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if you get a lot of the restricted they've reduced it from 12 months to three months  There's a lot of this is good because we need blood right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. So that's the other part  So because of the pandemic people are not donating blood as often right because a lot of people like they would do it at like  Corporate blood drives, but we're not at work anymore  So I encourage everyone to look up your local  Blood works or blood organization and donate because supplies are down in some parts of the country  They only have like a seven-day supply and that means I  Mean you don't have to if it's not your thing  But if it ever was your thing and you're just kind of casual it's time to be more active if you feel like you can I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Should start again. I get I stopped after I after I got my gallon pin

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That you got to get your five gallon pin. I want a five gallon pin. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought I've done enough now  but  Yeah, I think I will I'll start doing it again

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean if you can I it is it is of all the things I do. It's one of the most risky  Because you're in a room donating blood with other people everyone's wearing a mask, but you know when you go to the canteen  You're not wearing your mask because you're usually shoving like right your face. That's a good point free cookies and juice. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I went for the cookies, but I stayed for the juice. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
