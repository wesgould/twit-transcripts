Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I just did a piece for outside magazine on the North Pole, which was pretty interesting  But if you go to my name Christopher Michael M ICH EL comm you can see some of the photos or I post them on Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  badass

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm basically like an astronaut

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You do do great astronaut pictures too, thank you  Yeah, I think you were you into photography back in the military comm days or is it just a little bit but

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  after my second company said what is it I really want to do and it's tell stories with photos and  It's really fun  The problem with the YouTube flight though is it was a one-off thing  So after my week of training and my flight up to the edge of space  I realized that that might have been the greatest moment of my life and it was all downhill rap  You know how Buzz Aldrin felt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's tricky that's it baby you done now  That is that is pretty cool. That seatbelt looks a little frayed though. I'm a little worried for you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll tell you that the spacesuit helps a lot makes everyone look epic. Yeah, you could probably get you a ride what?  Yeah, really? Yeah, maybe I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, we've had really possible. We have a fan as a YouTube pilot. He was here  We were talking that is a very tough assignment you spend how long in that plane when you're on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they can spend like 10 hours yeah, and it is and you're alone physically demanding

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, cuz you're you're practically at the edge of the atmosphere

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is me doing weightless training with the at Star City in Moscow  So I went and did a shoot for Yahoo around one of the launches and I got to do some fun space training

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was pretty fun. You're getting to live the the dream now

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's interesting, you know, is it about the pictures or the experiences the camera brings you and sometimes it's about the experiences  You know and the photos are a byproduct

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I just use it as excuse to travel person  If I were this good, I might take more may take it more seriously  Maybe should be taking more photos. You have all these interesting people here. Yeah, you know, that's one of the things you've been doing  which I love is taking  beautiful black and white portraits of  startups start-up founders in San Francisco  You kind of hang out a blue bottle and just and just wait a little well, it's funny

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I go to board meetings and I'm the only person that in the heat of the moment of the most difficult like conversation  I pull out my camera and take a few photos  But you know, the funny thing is we don't remember  Well, we don't also don't remember those conversations because they go pie and right ten years later. What do you remember?  Maybe somebody took a photo. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really awesome. What's your preferred distribution?  Method for your photos. This is your personal site that Leo's looking at. Yeah, it's my personal site

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, I mean I use I have a blog explorers comm and I tweet stuff. I put stuff up on smug mug flicker  I I'm liking the new Google photos  Really? Oh, yeah, it's a why you know Bradley Horowitz was at the lobby and we've been talking for a long time  So I had like I don't know 1.8 million people following me on Google Plus and it just wasn't working  It you know, you post a photo and you get all these people commenting  You didn't know them and I just knew there was a problem and and you know, that's not Google strength is social  Their strength is sort of utility. So I think there is a bigger opportunity, but I honestly I'm generally worried about all of our digital photos  Because you know if Flickr or Microsoft or even Google decides they don't want to give you that storage or something happens to these companies

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would never happen. Why would somebody like Microsoft just turn off your story? You can count on them forever  We could lose the photos, you know, right it's a problem. That's why I store them on I do I use I use Dropbox  Yeah, one drive Google photos flicker and Amazon has a free upload service, too  So I put them on all of my figure. They're not gonna all go it's enough out at the same time

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll have an opportunity. Yeah, you're probably right. I probably once a year do a book, you know blur book print it print a book

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Print a book that's probably the safest way that's gonna last especially if they use good paper, right and you keep it and you store it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's kind of funny through all this technology what we're trying to get on this paper

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, this is one of my I love this picture here. Oh, that was from  Halloween. These are amazing. Yeah, I saw this in your Instagram. Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I just want to set my Chromecast background to your photo  I agree  Gosh, these are really gorgeous

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I hope both of you are taking a lot of photos because you know you meet all these interesting people and there's an opportunity  Should we Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  True. Yeah, I'm stories. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Speaking of  Google plus Vic Gondrotra has found a job. Thank goodness. He's gainfully employed once again  Remember Vic was the guy who pretty much put Google plus on the map

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By his job search wasn't too onerous for him. I think he wasn't really looking

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But along comes a very interesting startup that allows you to do an e  e  EKG on your smartphone and he's now the  as of today the CEO  But you I think you're exactly right  He probably didn't need the job. In fact, if you look at this picture of Vic  From Ricoh, it looks like he's on the beach  By the way, I'm sorry if your helicopters and planes going over the veterans days. There's some really

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Little sunglasses. He has yeah. Yeah, I think they're Chanel. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Vic has joined a live core  And this is one of the few  Devices that has gone through the expense and trouble of FDA approval  So it can do a full ECG  I always call the EKG  I'm not sure if there's a difference that you get you get these  Which I I gather you probably put on your chest  and EKG requires a  More than two electrodes, but maybe this is enough for them to do what they do. Can it jumpstart you?  It looks like paddles. It does look it does look like it might be a  defibrillator as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's that that's what you want to happen in the board meeting. Excuse me. Well, I just  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He said you know, he was seven people don't remember he's 15 years at Microsoft then seven years at Google  The story goes he he just badgered Larry Page until Larry said alright. Alright, we'll do social. We'll do Google Plus  And then once Larry kind of moved upstairs to alphabet there was actually even before then  Once Larry kind of withdrew his patronage. There was not much more for Vic to do and he left  In April of 2014 apparently Vinod Koshla  persuaded him  to join the the team he would have a notice of well-known VC and  He he has a stake in a live core a live core  And he's a CEO Vicks the new CEO. Yeah  Yes, you say probably not too onerous of a job search. She just kind of yep on just wandering around  Looking for things to do I  Did get the new iPad Pro we were talking about this before the show  I guess I should show this I haven't done I just got it this morning Apple put it on sale at  Shortly after midnight this morning Pacific Time  And you know what gang it's a giant iPad  That's what it is. Now. I've attached it to this is interesting Apple selling the keyboard that they mentioned  When they did the the reveal, but I decided not to get the Apple keyboard it was $169  And Apple's also selling at the same time the Logitech creative keyboard for 20 bucks  Yeah, it's well, it's a lot  It's not an Apple product, but Apple's selling it at the Apple stores 20 bucks less and unlike the let me unlock this here unlike the  Which finger today I've just been setting this up unlike the Apple keyboard it has dedicated keys  for the iPad which is oddly something there's the lock key, it's oddly something that the  The Apple keyboard itself does not have this finger  This has a lot of built-in keys. Just go to home screen search switch tab  It's enormous it is a giant  Yeah, let's talk about the iPad enough about the keyboard actually when you so you were smart because you brought a nice small  Macbook along with you Christopher you could fit like three of those inside of that one

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe it could be a carrying case for the Mac is a little more expensive not much

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I bet it's not no actually this was nine hundred forty nine dollars for the 128 gig plus  150 for the keyboard  So  Roughly, it's maybe a hundred bucks less than a than the starting

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, it's a cool device if you can forgive them for the charging port. It's heavy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Much heavier than the Macbook and Apple's really trying to sell the new iPad pro as a replacement for laptops  Tim Cook told the telegraph  Earlier this week. Oh, you don't you don't need a laptop anymore. You've got this. I do everything on my Apple watch

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, it's a desktop replacement

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A desktop replacement, of course, I just I have a Bluetooth keyboard for my action  No, I don't I don't know really the reviews are started coming out last night  Most people including Walt Mossberg and others said hey, it's neat technology, but no it can't replace a laptop  It's just a giant iPad Microsoft though. We were talking to Windows Weekly earlier today  The whole office is on here. So obviously Microsoft thinks this is an opportunity or  Somebody at Microsoft can use it as a phone  No  Please people people I beg of you do not take this to concerts. Yeah as a camera  It's the I don't want to see people. Oh, that's great. Look at that. Look at that shot. That's terrible  I don't want to see people doing that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The thing that was most intriguing to me about the pro is the pen which isn't out yet. Yeah, that's also another thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you Apple you but the pen is of course the most interesting part of this won't be out for a month  I'm also December  December 7th, they said a day that will live in infamy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, I mean it feels like this is this like other this like light computing kind of  Category like where the surface is and maybe even the Chromebook  This idea that there's a selfie kind of a laptop, but not really

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a great yeah, I don't know it's a see I think if Apple was smart with and I'm posting that  If Apple got skills man  If Apple was smart, that's what they would say is this is a unique category because otherwise what happens is people go  Well, wait a minute. How is this different from the surface Pro and I think the surface Pro is better because it's a full operating system  I just I feel like this is not  This is an interesting product but I know it remains to be seen whether it's gonna be  Reinvent the world and and that's what Apple should be saying is this is a unique product not it's gonna replace your life

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm thumbs down. Right, right. You haven't even held it. I don't need to handle it. I've seen everything I need to see  It's a great photo platform

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can you window apps can you run app side-by-side on on the yeah, you can effect

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me do that so  Only or is that for its iOS 9 can do it on on even on your on your phone  I don't know if you'd really want to on a small screen, but let me see you could slide this over see I  said  It's a long way to go and for some reason I have no idea why I'm seeing unplayed episodes of  Twitter on here, but apparently that's what Apple thinks I want to do  And then you can I think you can change that's the greatest photo of all time  I'm not an expert on this. So but yeah, the idea is you could you can't have half and half somehow  I don't I haven't yeah, I just got it. So I don't I don't really know that's the notification bar

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is all the second to cut me out of your Facebook profile picture. I don't know now. That's just there we go  No, that's just a little photo

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is a beautiful screen resolution wise it's a gorgeous high-res screen but  you know, I we shouldn't knock anybody who  Wants to innovate in this space, right? I mean, why not? That's great. Well, let me look. Okay, I'll tell you what I'll open  I've got inbox open now that if I select can I slide did we expect a little more from Apple though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It seems a bit linear  Just harder

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Harder harder that I don't know I  I'm doing something wrong. I this is not a review, right?  This is just I got it. I haven't had a chance to play with it  I do have to say this key if you're gonna get a case a keyboard, I guess this is a good idea  Although it makes the thing damn bulky  very heavy  And it keeps turning my  tablet on  There you go  Circles the screen  Thousand dollars down the tubes I  Will I will learn and I will show at a later date I haven't had a chance to do to do anything  with that  Google has acquired a new company called fly labs speaking of Google Photos  This is actually in fact, I have this on the iPad a really nice little video editor  That's very easy  That's really loud isn't it?  You can still buy your actually download fly  It's really kind of a cool editing app that lets you very simply create  Multi-camera edits you can have picture-in-picture you can have  Sorry inspiration videos not available. Okay, there's flaw number one  Because of the acquisition, I think fly labs is starting to take assets offline  So if you want to get the fly labs at you might want to quickly get it  All the plugins are free for the time being the clips video editor the tempo video editor and crops on the fly  Those three add-ins used to be paid  add-ins  But it's a nice little video editor. It's interesting that they acquired this I would imagine  What that they will?  They say that they're gonna continue to make these apps available all for iOS for the next three months  And you'll be able to continue to use them, but there won't be any more updates. I'm impressed by the app  I had never heard of it until I till Google announced that they had

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't the question though it are they gonna port over the features that they just want the team? That's always the question

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The team is good, I would love to see Google does Google have any video editing chops  No, they got they have pretty good photo editing capabilities built into Google photos  It wouldn't this be smart to have a nice clean simple video editor  Seems like it especially one that could take stills and videos mix them you can add music to it and all of that  So three more months if you want to get it. It's an iOS product. I think it's great  And I think it makes sense for Google Photos to have a video editor, so I hope they keep the product alive  I  See are you using Google Photos?  Yeah, I love it. I'm actually surprised to hear you that you use it because I don't see it as a pro product  I see it as a very consumer focused product. Well back to your point

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I I want to have like a multimodal backup system because I'm worried about everything  So this thing just operates in the background and right now I'm fine. I mean I have I don't know a million photographs  It's taking forever to get up there, which is one of their problems  But one of the great things is they're doing a lot of sort of image analysis so I can oh I do love that  Yeah, so I can sort I can find your photos  I can look back and you know you could see where this is going this this is playing to their strength  So I think they will probably be the best online catalog available, and you know it's just it's free  I don't I don't I don't send them up there. You don't do the high-res so you do

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The free you have unlimited free  Low-res images right?  It will cost me a lot to do the higher-res yeah, I'm using smug mug which I love so it costs you 140 bucks a year  Yeah, something like that. It's incredible. I love smug mug too  I but smug mug doesn't have any of this back end stuff and that is really

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fantastic interesting to be able to tie them together  And that you know that would actually be possible for a third party to do that which is you know you do all the analysis  On Google, and then it finds you the most appropriate

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right file right  Yeah, but I think the categorization is interesting  You know what would be really great is if you could keep the raw original photos on a hard drive and somehow have them be linked  Yeah, so the Google online  thumbnail and  Treat that as a way to find

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're on the big idea the big idea is they're the catalog and it points to the original file wherever it is right exactly  It tells you it's also on flicker or somebody including flickers smug mug yeah, or anyone else who's picked it up

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or anyone else who's picked it up it could even do that couldn't say hey by the way you know that that picture is being stolen

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or it's being used under creative  Yeah, I use that on flicker yeah  Yeah, you put up on creative. I do all of my stuff Wow Wow that's that's cuz you don't have to make a living  I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know I have this debate all the time with professional photographers  Which you know a lot of pros hate the idea that if they put an image on the internet  they lose control of it forever and  They said but no I mean this is how I make this is my product is I make a living and  I'm of the opinion that whether you're a musician or a photographer or writer  It's not a bad thing to put your stuff out there  You have to find a way to monetize and some people still pay for a lot of the images

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I make it available and you know the main reason I make it available is for Wikipedia  So my photos are many many of the Wikipedia pages Dalai Lama  Has a credit photo by and people can touch with me  And they say they want the original image or whatever and then that there's an opportunity there  But I make stuff pretty available and don't freak out about you're not worried about it now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, trade as a city where I cliff does the same thing I feel good about it more people use the photo the better

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Makes me feel yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gina you've always been all about that you don't hold hold back stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I'm go both ways I mean I thought about it mostly in terms of writing  You know I've been approached by lots of websites that asked me to contribute and you know get paid and distribution  You know and that's a battle that that rages on I think people should get paid for their work  But I also believe that you know it also makes me feel good when I have the chance to  You know reach people that I might not have reached otherwise, so it's it's tricky business  But I tend to err on the side of generosity generosity. I try to open source on my code when I can and  It's usually paid back  You know down the road and in lots of other ways that I didn't necessarily expect

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just read an article who was that that was complaining that the Huffington paid written an article and maybe it was  Huffington Post is one of the examples and they said hey, we'll publish it how much oh nothing you should be happy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're giving you the distribution. Yeah, like we're like you like you thank us for offering

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well you know I shouldn't say that because I'm not paying you to be here Christopher you're not

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Give me that iPad

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People who come on come on for the publicity or for the fun  I think you're not here publicity you're for fun. I want to get the photos and or to take pictures, but but  We pay regular hosts people on a right we pay Gina we pay people are on a regular basis  But a lot of the genius Gina's getting paid  No  Absolutely not  We're gonna send her a fez at the end of the year and call it even I get paid in pezzas  We have a new hat it's called a chapeau you're gonna love it  So but I understand that there is not it's not unusual have some sort of tit-for-tat  People come on Twitter all the time and don't get paid

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, CNN has a giant business. I mean that's television. Yeah, CNN's not paying contributors and those people are working hard  They're showing up at 7 in the morning

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Making stuff up on air by actually, you know what I did get paid  You know pays is live with Regis and Kelly or now Kelly and Michael  They but they have to pick as a after because they're not a news operation. So they pay a union scale

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which doesn't cover you then I guess I'll accept their invitations

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  $982 last time I checked something like that  But you're right CNN never pay because they're a news operation and they don't they're not bound by the union rules  And so yeah, you show up you put on makeup you get dressed  Because it's good PR it's good publicity  So I'm not sure that I blame the Huffington Post for trying. I don't blame people for saying no either

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, right. I mean, that's the thing right Leo people say no if they've got you know, they can't do it  They say no or or not, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's funny. It's a sensitive topic  I was in Luxor two years ago in a balloon  You maybe saw some of this and the balloon next to me blew up and it killed 20 people and I took all the photos  And tweeted it and all of a sudden they wanted the photos for the cover of like every newspaper, right?  And I was in the middle of this thing and I just didn't feel right about making money  And so I said anyone could use the photo for free and I got a lot  I mean a lot of people are thank you saying thank you but a lot of people were saying that's not professional  You should have charged. Yeah. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like you write your your decision affected other photographers, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know in the industry if you're a professional you need to charge because we don't want to start this  Cycle of people getting content for free. I'm just glad I didn't do a balloon ride over Luxor. I didn't realize that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, how was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's really hard

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was that not not a good morning no must have been a horrible thing to see yeah, particularly with a yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And a tragedy like that. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you all gonna run out and get the new tag Heuer Android wear watch I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't think on the target audience there was a really hairy wrists in that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the hairy wrist watch  Our friend Kevin Rose did a did an article in a review on his he's now a watch guy, you know  He's the CEO of Houdini  What is Houdini a content destiny? Yeah, it's a what it was. It's a was a watch blog that's expanded and now mean  You know Kevin told me once I don't think it means anything, okay  The last URL available. Yeah. Yeah all the other names are taken basically  When I looked at the watch, you know, it's big it is functionally  No different than any other Android wear watch. That's not surprising because that's how Android wear works  But it doesn't even have a heart rate monitor  So it's not from functional point of view as good as let's say the new moto 360  Which is 1 10th the price or not quite 1 10th, but 1 8th the price  But it is tag Heuer  right, and it does have you know a nice titanium case and  You know, but but that display that's that's the same as any other Android wear watch  They come with a this is what Apple does too. They come Apple with the  Hermes Apple watch it's an Apple watch, but it has a different watch face and different band  Talk to yours doing something interesting though. They're offering an upgrade in two years. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So in two years, so you're purchasing two watches or a watch now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I don't think it's I have to look and see if it's a free upgrade  The watch is 1500 bucks, which is pretty pretty pricey, but not Apple watch pricey

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm looking for more stuff to charge every day. Yeah. Yeah, you should see my bedside table

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, I went on vacation for a couple weeks of San Diego was really great vacation and I brought my moto 360 which I which I love  I love my everyday. Yeah, and I just I just didn't put it on one day and I think I'm on vacation  Yeah, it's not gonna and I have it put it on since like I got home and just didn't put it on  So I was like, you know, it's just another thing to charge and the software to update and while like I liked it  It wasn't like if I left the house in the morning and forgot it, you know that I would go back  You know for my phone  I would go back and I wouldn't go back for the watch and I finally thought you know all these wires and this plug and  This what a charger and the software updates and then it would die and I would get really mad about that because that shouldn't happen  and I found myself like whipped into an angry frenzy about a  Electronic device dropped my wrist and I thought this is not  drink some tea Gina  Life I want the yes all that coffee

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's funny cuz that's what Kevin Rose, you know, you'd say Kevin well, he you know, he's getting to watch it  Of course, he's into very expensive, you know mechanical watches  But you'd think he might be interested in Andrea wear or Apple watch and he hated the Apple watch  He said that's the last thing I want to do when I go to dinner with my wife  I don't want to be pinged every five seconds by somebody who's sending me a notification. I want to focus  So the last thing I want to do is have something on my I mean really that's why you get a watch  Right smart watches for the notifications the health  Monitoring things like that. I really like the steps monitoring

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and I like the quick, you know, hey, you know set a timer for this long. I do that a lot  But yeah, it just wasn't the notifications are a co-worker of mine got got the Apple watch and he's like talking to him is every  Three minutes. He's yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just one more thing to pull you out of your reality

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, honestly if you have a phone, why do you need it? I mean the phone works so well  It tells time it like if you want to look at notifications, you got them

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean that the attack your deal is  Get this in two years if you want to upgrade you can pay another $1,500. I get a tag you were a mechanical watch

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What a deal

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait two years to get a real one

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Where is gonna be like how long the upgrades will and then you can upgrade to a McCann  It's sort of like this path toward  Getting a credible marketing team. Yeah Wow, it's weird

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you have to think it's somewhat of a response from tag who were to Hermes which has an Apple watch, right?  There's kind of like a race which watch did you get?  Which which watch would you make  Tensor flow  This is Google's new  Machine learning system and they've open sourced it which I think is really interesting  So Google has a lot of stuff, you know, they use internally right software and and so forth. It's a neural network  That has been used internally  That's the one that you you probably saw the demos of  the computer figuring out  Where cats were in YouTube videos?  It's been used to improve speech recognition in the Google app by 25% and the Google Photos image search is based  On it. This is actually dist belief, which is their internal  Project  So they are now releasing the second generation of dist belief

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I should have a better name for a Google plus disbelief. Just believe this belief strange name

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a strange. Well, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they said we couldn't share dist belief because it's so tightly tied to our infrastructure  So we are now doing open source release of a second generation system that can be used by others  It's flexible general portable easy to use open source. Would you would you I mean, do you have a need for something like this?  I would think think up could probably use  Something like this, right? Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I looked at this and was like how long would it take me to spin up some AWS instances running this just to see  See just to see what it could learn  Yeah, I this is something this is very very interesting and really cool really cool that they open sourced it I mean it I  Get that by you know  Google makes this kind of thing open source so that other people can contribute and run different tests and have different uses and contribute  Back to it, but it takes a lot of work to maintain an open source project to decouple it from your inside infrastructure to you know  Kind of build up, you know separate modules and make it modular and so it  There's a lot of work that just goes into that so I've been you know sort of continually impressed with Google's  Commitment to that it's open sourcing things and you know  And I think the idea is that you know lots of people will get the chance to use this and and that it'll improve for everyone

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is great for the ecosystem. Yeah, but you ultimately to succeed as an open source project  You have to get others in you know committed into it and and and working on it, right?  Unless they could plan to keep it going internally

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, you know plenty of open source projects have a company  You know who are the leaders of that open source Android is is you know from we under you know all those and  And so you know you're gonna have the lead committers and the most  The most frequent committers are gonna be Googlers and Google is saying that they're committed to running the project  So it's so it's unclear. You know how many outside could committers there will be  but just the fact that you can watch the work happen in public and and  Look really into the way that Google gets some of its you know doesn't some of Google's technology  It's just is amazing and helpful for everyone it raises everybody up, so it's a great thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what's amazing is also is that AI was a dead was a dead deal ten years ago, right?  Everybody said oh we tried it failed. We can't do it  And now all of a sudden it's the talk of the town their own networks and this kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You sent that article ahead of time, and I didn't know anything about it  I talked to my friend  Siobhan zillas at Bloomberg beta and she said well, there's nothing that new here  She said there's other technologies that do something similar  She said I wouldn't underestimate Google's ability to market it and there's actually an article out now  And it's like github rankings as like the number of stars and they have like  More stars in one day of release than all the alternatives in you know months, but that's great that means a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean yeah, okay, so it's not better than anything else out there  But it does mean a lot of people will download that could be the big thing  It's got a python in their face a lot of people know how to you know would know how to do that  And I could see somebody like Gina saying well, let's let's apply  We have a pretty big data set at think up right let's see what we can do with it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, and this is just the kind of thing that you know university students who wanted a job at Google  Or was you know taking a class in AI would would download and grab you know data from from various sources and run and come up  With some really neat you know neat information and a cool project  So I think I think it's great. I think people of course Google's ability market is strong  I mean that there's you know there's lots of people who just just by the you know just because of Google is behind it  Or will be interested in it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  8,865 stars in one day  I'm logging in so I can start

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is interesting when you see these companies take  Kind of leadership and open source where I'm on the board of 3d robotics and Chris Anderson is doing drone code  Which is open source community around drones. It's it's pretty exciting. I mean you know they have another advantage when you're leading the coalition  You can sort of direct the vector of what people will be doing so it's probably playing into their longer term interest

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Then in other words people will contribute back to it make this better, and then they can take advantage of that as well  Yeah, I think though. I think that's interesting the PR angle really is a big part of this  We've got the more more scientists smarter people and we're coming up with this latest state-of-the-art stuff  Who was it that is now? It's in videos now offering a drone module  for  Makers  It's called the Jetson, which is a I think a good name  It is the Jetson TX one  GPU module for AI on drones and robots  Now it's not cheap. I mean it's not like Raspberry Pi cheap  I think it's almost wasn't I saw the price of that was all it's got to be sort of a response to 599

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Qualcomm's putting everything on the chipset  Snapdragon they're gonna be basically right basically modern drones are flying cell phones exactly yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're right. I think that's exactly right. It's interesting though that they brand it as a GPU powered device  Which is it kind of in?  Opposition to what qualcomm's doing with arm and a CPU driven  Product comes with the Linux SDK  It's about the size of a credit card. It is a  teraflop per second  256 core Maxwell based GPU

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow the ultimate gaming device

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow  The Jetson TX one  And the developer kit will be 599 299 for education customers goes on sale  Tomorrow and then the modules will be for sale by themselves for 299 early next year just in case you're building a robot  It is amazing isn't it that the I'm blown away by the the fact that  Since 2007 you know with Apple's iPhone and then now Android phones and other smartphones  We've kind of mastered manufacturing these systems on a chip. We've become very good at  interfacing them with accelerometers and all sorts of sensors  and then that was what fostered the emergence of the quadcopter and  And is another industry has exploded out of it. I imagine robotics will do the same

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  well you think about one of the reasons we want kind of the Apple watch to work or the Android watches to work is  You know that's the kind of form factor you want in a drone you want something that small that can fly for a long time

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, a little bitty drone the size of an Apple watch. What would you do with that?  swallow it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's that's that's open ROV you're talking submersibles you're talking a spy a spy  Drone I don't know. I mean, it's just dust flying in the air. It's diamond age

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Smart dust  That's kind of terrifying is it  well, I  Guess I don't know do you want the what you want? I mean, I guess if everybody's watching everybody else

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Then yeah, but it doesn't have to just be about watching. Well, what else would you use it for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Listening yeah watch and listen together at last

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you're right. I guess at the end of the day it's monitoring  But I mean you can imagine you're in the city of San Francisco and you have a problem and you kind of wave and you  Get somebody and somebody comes. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's why we're putting cameras up on every intersection so people will come when you wave yeah, that's exactly that's protect  That's exactly the point  Love it we're gonna take a break.

Are there they're the two that are really running it and they are incredibly nice carrying people in it to me the exciting thing about  Blue bottle not only is a great coffee, but this is the first sort of major effort  I've ever seen to kind of scale quality and authenticity, you know  Usually when these things get big they become a little like Starbucks or you know  Can they do it in a real way where I mean  I think the metric is do the people that work at the blue bottles in wherever Tokyo or New York  Do they feel special do they feel like they're it's a cool job and right now they do and I I think they're gonna be  Able to keep that up  But it's you know, those people are kind of coffee scientists.

It's an oil that's made out of coconut oil and  Asprey I just read a long article about him  He he was hiking in Tibet and was woozy because of course of the altitude and they gave him yak butter tea

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is that's my favorite. Is it any good? It's actually not as bad as it sounds  It's sort of soupy salty. Yeah, doesn't smell like yak though. Everything smells a little like you're immune to it by then, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  It's kind of an unexpected interesting. Yeah, I mean people been doing that for a long time with cream and yeah, I like I put it  Have you been to Phil's it's basically that's their secret. Is that the secret heavy cream sugar and cream?  Sugar and cream. That's what we love it. Yeah, really? That's what fills with a Z right?  I mean, you're just anti-competitive. No, I love those guys. FUD you're spreading. I love them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sounds good

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you know that the thing I really love about the company is just all these artists creating incredible things, you know  I mean in a way that maybe that's what I love about blue bottle and  Entrepreneurship in general is just people who are into it like your staff that were showing me how your control room works  Yeah, they're into it. You know and like when you can like help people that are do the thing that they're into it feels good

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd be kind of it. I'd be kind of interested in  I  Don't know I feel like we should cover more of this kind of create because I think I think what a lot of people  That's at least outside of the area probably in the area to  think of entrepreneurs is really just more about trying to get rich trying to become a billionaire right trying to make a unicorn and  The entrepreneurs I know Gina include Gina and an eel are really not about that at all  Right you're about making stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that right yeah like well the idea it sounds like you're getting out like being passionate about  Either a hobby or a cause or a set of values, you know that you're trying that you're trying to kind of express  Yeah, you know, it's funny  I watch these stupid reality shows like the Bachelor and the Bachelorette whenever they have like on the lower third like this person's an entrepreneur  Like yeah, that's just a way to say he doesn't have a job, you know, it's the new consultant, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, right right right now like, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I realize that that I guess that's a word that's a word that I've never felt our title that I've never felt  Comfortable with because I don't consider myself that I consider myself someone who makes software  And I'm trusting taking a risk with a business in that process  Which I guess is really the definition of entrepreneur somebody takes a financial risk  I guess is the literal meaning with a business. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and I'm not an entrepreneur because this isn't a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Financial risk we need to look this up. You guys are both entrepreneurs. Oh, right. We're here. We're denying it  Yeah, you're like entrepreneur  Your deniers

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like in Silicon Valley that I don't I have a little bit. Yeah, I feel like I feel weird  identifying with even though by any definition

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  According to Wikipedia anybody who starts a business is an entrepreneur  Anyone who starts a business it's the process of starting a business typically a startup company  offering an innovative product process or service and  I think nowadays we think of them mostly as tech entrepreneurs, right? Well, it's just because the people we hang out with right  Maybe that's us  Yeah, I mean, I'm sure Asprey thinks of himself as an entrepreneur even though he's selling fat and coffee  Right, so that's an entrepreneur. It's funny. I just wrote about

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what what what's the objective of entrepreneurship and you're right  I think probably a lot of people think it's money  Some people have something to prove like when I was doing military comm  I mean I came from a really non-traditional background and felt like I needed something to prove  But I did you know, I did another company after military called affinity labs. Oh, yeah, and I think I think back to  What what was the purpose for me and to me it was?  Kind of the adventure of going on a mission with people you admire, you know at the end of you know  We talked about screen savers all of these people that were really inspired  By that experience and they're all still friends and they're all still doing cool stuff  And to me that's the big thing  It's like can you work with cool people on stuff you love right and like the other stuff comes out of that and that's the  Thing that I love and that's the thing in a way that I miss the most about the company

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why did you start military comm you had you just gotten out of the Navy when you started?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I had so yeah, so I was in the Navy and then I worked in the Pentagon  I went to business school and I was kind of a computer nerd programming, you know  My first computers Sinclair ZX 80 Wow to date myself  All right, and I came out and I was at a reason and I really wanted to start a company in 1999  It was the thing to do and and it's good timing one of those people that was like  Exactly if you want to be in it, well, you know, I got fired  Do you know this whole story I got fired and like for military.com?  Yeah, I got we raised a lot of we raised like 30 million dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got fired and the idea of the site was a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Destination for military. Well, you know, the idea of the site was Facebook for the military  My small mistake was just keeping it focused on the military. I was this close. Yeah, you could have done face  Was that close anyway, I got to come back to shut you Sue Zuckerberg you should have alright  But I got to come back and we're to come back to shut the company down  The board fired you so this in 2000. Well in 2001 we were out of money people were unhappy  It was a great site. Well, I thought you were doing great, but you know, there's a lot of well  Think about what happened in March of 2000. Yeah, I mean a bubble burst  Well, we had a million dollar a month burn rate. Oh, there was no more capital and you know, this is what you know  We think that that was a unique period in time. This is happening again companies incredible burn rates  And so they're reliant on outside financing and when stuff started to fall apart  It really fell apart advertisers didn't want to advertise they were done with the internet, right?  And basically they hired a gray haired CEO to take my place. You're too young you can't possibly understand  And it's funny I remember sitting in my office and he's sitting across from me and he says he's in my seat  He says hey be better if you didn't come by the office anymore. Oh lord. Oh, it was really shitty  Lord and then I am but but then he then it got worse and worse and they're about to shut the company down  We're talking to bankruptcy lawyers. I came back to shut it down and we turned it around good  So is nice we took the 747 and scraped the tail against the ground and yeah learned a lot. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so these see that explains because I keep looking at like companies like uber which  Valued at more than 50 billion dollars now, right?  But they keep going back to the well and saying can we have some work? We have some work?  They're not profitable, right? They're running through this money  Right the theory being that if you keep pumping money into it at some point to take off and make money

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they probably like Amazon they could probably get profitable very quickly, but they're using the capital for expansion globally  That's probably a pretty safe

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Amazon proved that worked right by building distribution centers and reinvesting instead of taking the the profit out of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They built a pretty powerful company, right? But some of these other companies, you know, they're gonna find themselves in a really big  Problematic situation a lot of it has to do with ratchets early investors aren't gonna be able to make money  You know  There's like only one possible outcome for these companies with billion dollar valuations and raised a lot and that is an incredibly successful  Public offering or a big acquisition and that won't play out for at least some of the so when you look at a company like square for instance

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jack Dorsey's one of his two companies  He's got the Twitter thing as well  So he's got something to fall back on but you look at square where they're planning an IPO  But it's below the value that they were valued at the last time they went to borrow money. Is that a bad thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, how would you feel if well depends on the nature investor? It's a bad thing. It'd be interesting  I don't know the nature of the investment. So one element is what's the valuation?  Because if you if it's gone down you might not make money  But sometimes they have protection in the investment  So they might have a kind of protection so that they get covered no matter what right which is really problematic for other investors

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I don't know that I don't know. Yeah, we I learned about that on Silicon Valley  Right the one where that it was it Silicon Valley I learned that I'm like here remember  Where it's where the I guess maybe it wasn't Silicon Valley, but where the investors have a guarantee against the first dollar so  They get they get made whole no matter what or almost no matter what let's see

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good later investors oftentimes have something in there to protect themselves as well. Yeah, Gina. Did you raise money for your companies?  We did we did can maybe I can get in next time

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would invest in you  Absolutely. I love all of our companies. I would absolutely do that company

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Very small relatively small amount with the coolest people, right?  Well, yeah, we actually someone from Bloomberg beta wrote Roy Bahadur. Oh, yeah Roy is incredible. Yeah Roy is fantastic  Yeah, we had some we have some really great investors. We absolutely love them. We very much don't want to disappoint them

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Perfect answer she's gonna keep her job. I think forever. That's hard though, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, that's one of the I have a friend of it a start-up and tanked and then all those people do get disappointed  But on the other hand, they're big boys right and big girls. They know what they're doing there  This is a high-risk game. I think it was Jason Calacanis told me, you know, you can count on  Something like 80% of your investments to lose money  If you get one and five make money and if they make enough money, you're you're alright  So it's a risky. It's a risky business

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is it is but it's you know, it's something like as a founder. I take it extremely seriously  and you know, and it's something that I'm you know working really hard to  Make sure that they're that they're glad in the end that they invested in me  I mean, there's different kind of philosophies, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's some people are like trying to find that uber right?  They want the unicorn company to return the fund and you know, the data would say that that works  So maybe like Ron Conway investing in a million companies is great  but I would rather work with somebody like Gina and  You know really work on a small number of companies that you really feel great about that you're part of the journey  It isn't just a financial investment. It's a  You know it you know, you're part of a team doing something that matters

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How do you feel about bills like the jobs act that change the requirements for investors?  You know, thanks to Dodd-Frank and others  There are laws about how what income level you have to have you have to be the presumption is you have to be savvy  You have to be able to  You presume to be able to lose the money and to know what you're doing  And so as a result a lot of people are kept out of the investment market and the jobs act has kind of changed

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That it's starting to change. Well Angel List has changed all these syndicates you join the syndicate you're in yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I feel like people are gonna get taken advantage of by things like that that those seems to me those protections are not a bad idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, did the protections really protect people?  I mean you can invest in a lot of public equities and lose a lot of money  Find a way to lose money. Yeah, there's lots of ways to lose money. I mean I do think that  We're gonna find that the venture business is difficult right now. It looks like everybody's a winner and  That will that will change yeah  Yeah  and you know it'll be interesting how people feel and react when they lose a lot of money in a syndicate or on Angel List or  Like we seem we kickstarter and some other things or even public something these venture companies  The companies aren't what they appear to be and that's usually when regulators get involved

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Take a break Christopher Michael is here from formerly a military commies now an investor with Nautilus  And is a great photographer as you'll find if you go to his website Christopher Michael mich el  Comm also Gina tripani here from think up comm how are things going at maker base?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good good things are really good  We just we launched a new feature called inspiration so you can you can go on to maker base  You can find a maker like Leo for example that you who you love and who you admire and you can say that they inspire you  Yeah, which is really cool, it's really neat to see people say you know this person you know really influenced me and and  You know change my thinking or inspired me to make something so that that's really that's really fun, and I recognize

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Inspiration right there. Yeah Marcus Sheridan inspires David G. Johnson. I  Recognize that gorgeous Gina tripani design. I love your stuff. I really do

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not my design we have an incredible designer that we know come on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Feel to your stuff though. I just feel like I know that that I could would look at that and say oh yeah  That's a Gina company  We're take a break when we come back Apple has finally released Apple music for Android is it enough  We'll find out in just a little bit, but first a word from blue apron. I love this company. This is a great idea  It's not blue bottle  Blue apron the blue apron is what the apprentices wear at the cordon bleu cooking school in Paris  That's a sign that they're learning  The the the techniques of the masters, and I think this is a really appropriate name for a company that does  Something very special they deliver meals to you  But unlike other companies they're not cooked they just give you all the ingredients you need to make an amazing dinner  For just you and a loved one or for your whole family you get to pick for less than $10 a meal  You don't have to do any shopping  And you never have any waste because they give you exactly what you need and what's great is these amazing recipes you get this nice?  Recipe card with pictures there's videos on the site too if you need some instructions on how to different techniques how to do things and  Then you have made an incredible dish. This is a shawarma dish that Jason Howell made  I think last month from his blue apron box and once you've made that meal your family's gonna love you  It's a very impressive thing to make for date night  But you also know how to make it again, and I think it really broadens your repertoire  They don't they don't say it's a cooking class in the box  But I feel like it's both a great meal and a cooking class in the box every meal can be prepared in 40 minutes or less  You don't have to worry about the grocery store no more sad takeout  No more fast food and they can make it easy no matter what your dietary preferences are  You'll get dishes like trattoria style cheeseburgers with crispy rosemary garlic potatoes and aioli  Or coconut curry braised cauliflower with aromatic basmati rice and cilantro chutney right in your own kitchen. You'll be using new ingredients  By the way those both were from this week's menu. That's what's neat the menu changes every week  You pick the recipes you want you can arrange the delivery so they match your your schedule  They come in a nice refrigerated box all fresh never frozen and the produce comes from local farms  peaked picked at the peak of perfection  Just delicious stuff and you'll use ingredients  I learned I've been learning some really nice new ingredients that you'll want to use again like watermelon radishes and farro and purple potatoes  Right now get your first two meals free go to blue apron comm slash twit. That's blue apron  dot-com slash twit  Check out this week's menu and get your first two meals  free blue apron comm  slash  twit  This week in Google this week is kind of wide-ranging anything you want to talk about  Because we got two great people here, and I always want to give our our panelists the the free reign Christopher Michael and  Gina Turpanney  Finally took him a while Apple finally released Apple music for Android and Gina. I think have you looked at it yet? I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Haven't looked at it. I actually now that it's on Android  I have a reason I have a device reason that to really look at it  I you know I read a little bit about when Apple music first came out people seemed to like it  But you know with Spotify and and play music. I don't feel like I have a need for it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know I don't either I can I continue to subscribe to both Spotify and play music  What I find interesting is Apple making what is clearly like a nice Android app right? I mean this is Android II isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, is it called beats music or no different? This is it's asked called Apple music

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not anything like the original beats app. They did have a beats app for  Android, but I think they went back to the drawing board it actually  If you use Apple music on an Apple device  Well, you'll immediately recognize where you are the onboarding process is the same with the red bubbles and stuff  But it's also native. I mean this hamburger menu. That's not on the Apple. That's a very Android II  Look, and yeah, I think I think this is nice. It's it's really Apple's first app. They had another one called  What it was it switched to iOS which I don't think that counts  But clearly they hired some good Android developers, and I think did a nice job

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have to take a moment to kvetch about about the play stores search capabilities if you type in Apple music right now into this  Play store, yeah, don't get the Apple music app. It's very weird. I think just search for I think what I did is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just searched for Apple and  And then you get the two Apple apps  Yeah, Apple moved to iOS forget beats pill plus  Unless you have a beats pill

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then there's okay Apple. I know but I agree with you. I mean, it's really weird. Why is this so hard Google?  You're in the search business. I know this is their core competency. It's it's really strange  Oh  Yeah, I'm down. I'm downloading it now  I  Apple music on on iOS devices and on on OS 10 that it works through iTunes, right?  I've been avoiding iTunes like the play. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think we should talk about iTunes iTunes is the canary in the coal mines. Those Apple people have some problems  I know where is my music tell me where my music is. I can't find it  Yeah, is it in the cloud? Is it in it might be?  Is it an Apple music?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you where do you want it to be?  Wherever I need anywhere you want  I'm with you on that  Don't get me started on my simplicity even even Apple rabbit Apple fans hate iTunes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's no it's true. Even the Apple blogosphere. Yeah, you know tech blogger types will  But yeah, no, this is an impressive somebody at Apple definitely read the the Android design

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Guideline so that's nice. But of course because it's an Apple product on the Android store, you've got  2831 star reviews  From just you know, I probably people who never even tried it just  Garbage more garbage for Apple. Why would you ever use Apple?  Lots of bugs buggy. I don't know. I've worked fine on my hey, this is the 6p  Yeah, Gina would you have you did you decide what to do with your phone of you? Yeah, I got the the 5x

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't my 6p order and I did the 5x. Yeah, I just want a smaller phone 60 was a little too big for me

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know a lot of people are very happy with the 5x. I like it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like a lot it feels it feels a little it felt a little flimsy at first cuz it's light  It's lighter than the right and feels empty  Well, it feels like just an empty plastic shell. Yeah, it does it does but it's a nice phone and I've been really enjoying it good

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's glad you're happy has a 6p been for you  You know at first I was having problems effect  I think people who watch regularly saw me just struggle with this thing because the camera was unresponsive  but I think I was running an app that was was causing problems because once once now it's now it's just fine, so  What I do is I rebuilt it. I don't know if that was necessary

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But but that makes me want to rush out and buy one right now. No, it's good. It's good

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just really it's good  No, no, I just refresh algorithm I just refreshed it but I don't think that that actually was necessary  I think I had an app on here that was just notifying all the time and it was keeping everything else busy  But uh, I know I I am it's a beautiful screen  The fingerprint reader is amazing. I mean, I don't know what your experiences on the 5x  but you know on the 6p it's on just like the 5x is on the back here and  It's just you don't even have to do the on button. You just touch it and it's all you boom  Right you're in and I just really yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think my first experience with it with a fingerprint sensor on any phone and it has been amazing  It's not having to enter my last pass pass. Yeah being a unlock the phone and it's just it's it's really great. It's a huge  Upgrade just in like, you know every time use I use the fingerprint and we have the same camera and the 5x and the 6p

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's great camera. I think yep great camera  As it fast enough to get out in motion

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, it's been taking great photos. I I'm on Instagram. I posted a few photos on Instagram and yeah, it's really really nice  I'm still in the house. You know, I always take a bunch of her  Once and then one of one of them

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this has that that feature that burst mode where if you take a bunch of pictures you could it picks the but it thinks  It's the best one. Yep. I wish it would throw out the rest but

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I turned on HDR and it does that like processing progress

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I could do without that. You probably should turn off HDR but

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  On the other hand need to understand a little bit more what I'm actually getting for all the time that processing time  And I'm not totally clear battery life's pretty good

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Still not great. I think the 5x is maybe even a little bit less I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's okay by by 11 or 12 at night. It's I'm down to 5%  Which is fine. I should be going to bed at that point anyway, it hasn't quit on me in the middle of a day

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right. This seems surprising to you that they haven't launched that as a feature like the two-day cell phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And waiting people rush out and buy that just make it a little bit thicker. Yeah, that's what I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think people would would be okay with that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it drives me crazy  Everybody's decided except Apple Apple does that the 6s plus goes forever, but everybody else has decided  Well, we just give you fast charging and you just charge it and then you don't have to worry about it. That's not the solution  I agree. I'm with you  By the way notice I am using Firefox. I found out yesterday  That you can run  Firefox on Android and it supports all the Firefox desktop plugins including  You block origin the ad blocker of choice and my ad blocker of choice and sorry Paul. We're blocking the ads. Sorry and  Last pass as a plug-in. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, Wow. Yeah, that's nice. Yeah, really nice. So Firefox  So the it's a little slower because it loads a bunch of extensions but a lot faster because it locks all the ads

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and ads on mobile are a real problem  Yeah, I know Apple Apple really kind of stirred a hornet's nest by putting making ad blockers capable  Possible on the iPhone, but I think that people have seen wow what a difference

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, cool. I'm gonna have to try that. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Chrome support going away for XP. I feel bad about this  First Microsoft pulls the plug-in April and says we're not gonna update XP. We're not gonna update ie  I think the last version of ie for XP was ie 8  And so we I was telling everybody well if you insist on using XP at least use Chrome because that's gonna be kept up to date  until April  So one year after Microsoft pulled the plug on Windows XP  Google's gonna do the same with Chrome. I don't you know, just a word of warning  Right prepare yourselves  Lots of people you want to see you want to see a shocking pie chart Windows usage  By  People using Windows 3.1 version. I don't think there's a whole lot of 3.1  XP still has twelve and a half percent market share. Let me see if I can find the  The graph because it's really it's it's how many of those people are using a well dial up and my Yahoo, right?  I  Wish I could this is this graph does not look real good

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I imagine a lot of users are kind of like my you know older relatives where it's like they had an XP got it  You know, they just moved on to a smartphone or a tablet  Just never turned off or upgraded or change the desktop computer and they're just kind of stuck there on XP  Because they just stopped buying new desktop computers

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they think of it as furniture and it's not disposable like it is right? Yeah, right like oh the TV still works, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They by the way, probably still have a tube TV

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, and let's face it. I mean Windows really lost its way with the investa, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I think people just kind of yeah, they didn't want to go to Vista. Yeah, and by then it was like they're just  Stuck in it  Good news. They're not gonna merge Chrome  OS and Android are you relieved about that Gina? We didn't get to talk with you about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I imagine that you got that you all covered that last week. You're very upset. Yeah  You're very upset at the prospect of the merging. Yes  I mean, there's still this like question in my mind about it, right?  Like there is this like there's two major products that are like really different and yet really similar  But and and so the outcome in the end just to make sure that I'm up to date that Google said  There's no merge happening we're committed to both still

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, am I happy about that? Yes, it still feels like an unresolved issue though  I mean, it feels like they're reserving like we're moving towards something's gonna happen and I just don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what I'm very interested to see is what they do with the the pixel see  because yeah, I feel like this tablet is  Potentially what they meant first of all, it's a pixel right up to now pixels have been been Chromebooks

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah Chromebooks

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It has the kickstand kind of like, you know, then that's the new thing. All the kids are doing it, but it's Android  But I wonder and it's delayed right or it's just not gonna be out till next month  I wonder if this is gonna be the first iteration of something that's a  Little bit more like a desktop or like a well like Apple  Why are these companies doing this? Is there is there a hue and cry to turn your tablet into a laptop?  Because that's that's essentially what this is all about  Right is taking desktop OS's and making them touch and then making them more tablet II

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't underestimate the revenue implications of having the additional things we can sell people it's just more stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think that this is about consumer demand  I mean I see these commercials about you know, the laptop is it I don't know what device it was  But it just it feels like a manufactured like the companies came up with this thing to sell to people  I just don't know anyone who's like I really really want I  Don't know. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you want that get a MacBook Air, I mean well, right? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is better than an air I think yeah, you said you don't like that  The fact that only has one port the time I don't like the yeah, I'm upset with those guys

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  $80 dongle though, right I did I have the dongle but it's just one of those things you just don't remember

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I find though like connect stuff to the computer less than I might have. Yeah imagine that I did and  Not having you know having that simple form factors. There's a lot to be said. It really works great. I'm a fan  Yeah, I actually really like the MacBook  Not that that matters on this show.

They want you want to be the icon on the front page of your iPhone or Android device now the battleground is the notification  because the  Notifications get right in your face and say hey  And if you can get in that notification space you can do so much better

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have you ever tried to turn off notifications on messenger? It doesn't work. It doesn't like that. No, it doesn't know Facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does it very well? So notify is going to give you notifications from news outlets and other sources  It's in effect Facebook's bid to own the notification space. Can you believe that do you want more notifications or less?

Okay, I can bark like a dog  Isn't that what you do in the boudoir? That's what I do. Yeah our show today brought to you by zipper critter. There you go  zipper critter dot com ladies and gentlemen you if you are in the  unenviable position of doing the hiring at your place of employ whether you're the HR department or just it's  You you're the boss  You got to know about zipper critter it will change your attitude about this and it should because  To be you know candid. I think  was one of the things I've learned is the people you hire make the business a  Bad employee can ruin your business a great employee can take you to the moon  Your company is the people you hire and that's why you can't take this lightly. Of course  It's the worst time when you're short-handed to have to find new people  So, you know, sometimes you might rush through that process. Don't use zip recruiter. You'll post jobs in more than a hundred job sites  Including Twitter and Facebook and LinkedIn and Craigslist all the social networks you post once and candidates will start rolling in almost immediately  They also will match your needs with their  Database of nearly 6 million current resumes and that's fantastic  So you're gonna find a bunch of quality candidates. The nice thing is they're not gonna call you  They're not gonna email you all of the candidates roll into your zip recruiter interface  So it's very easy to screen them get rid of the to separate the wheat from the chaff and hire the right person  Fast, I think zip recruiter is a boon to building a great company  It's been used by over 400,000 businesses including twin and you can try it now absolutely free for the next four days  At zip recruiter comm slash tweet we got an email from Scott a happy zip recruiter client. He said the recruiting process  Used to be so painful. You know how that feels don't you for our I'd post to several places  I get a million resumes, but only a few responses from qualified candidates. It was torture  But with zip recruiter we post once we get qualified candidates in one easy to review place. We have hired some of our best employees  using zip recruiter  Use zip recruiter. You got to it's amazing. Go to zip recruiter comm slash twig that zip recruiter  comm slash  Twig and you got it free for four days and that's probably enough to hire that exact right person right now zip recruiter comm  So you were always a little bit of a photographer Chris or guys? Yeah, hey Leo, can I ask you a sense?

Transcript:  I'm noticing the chat board here. These are people that are those are people watching the show  I've been watching it the whole time and I just want to say you have a steak you have really incredible people watching the show  They're very nice. No, really sweet. It's funny

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We I started doing this in the like the early 90s when a Dwork and I were doing radio  And it was this is IRC. I mean it was always IRC even at tech TV  We had remember I don't know if you remember we had that like 3d chat going on but having a live studio audience and a live chat  audience I  Think is a great way to kind of keep me honest is to focus us  But also to give us good ideas and they get off-target, you know  A lot of times you're just having fun, but that's fine, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not like discussion boards or people kind of go crazy there. People are super nice  They're like weekend Gina Mars worms like hey so nice having on the show. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there's some some of the best people I know are in the chat room. Oh, do you know some of those people?  Some I've actually met. Yeah, and a lot of these a lot of people you're seeing are always here. I love that  but then yeah, I've met a few of them and  They're really kind of fun people and they smell good says mn7. Yeah, I can't vouch for that I  Come on. Well show that but the other thing is they're all over the world. So that's kind of fun, too  It's incredible. Yeah, the inner. Thanks. Thanks to the internet. Yeah, we're everywhere. It's really amazing  so  Cameras you have a rollie which is make now is that a film camera? Oh, yeah, it's a film camera  That's a medium format film is  That is a work of art and a beautiful thing, but why would you shoot film nowadays?  Just because you like the hardware

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you have a lot of old cameras around we do none of them functioning unfortunately here's there's a camera

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a shot as you can see right there. You can actually position the camera where your laptop is. Yeah, and people can see it  Yeah, that is a way. This is what a twin lens reflects, right?  So you shoots from the top it's what they call a belly shooter you shoot down from the top and then you're seeing through  The top lens, but the camera shoots the bottom one is that is that how it works? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly. Well, um, so I've had some of these cameras around for display because I thought they were beautiful  Did you see this movie this documentary finding Vivian Meyer? Do you know this movie? I didn't see the movie, but I know the story

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's an amazing story. She was a nanny  and  Never published her photos never showed anybody but took amazing street photos black and white street photos in the 50s

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was in Chicago. So basically they bought her storage facility when she passed away and in there was you know, some guy  120 film yeah, and I saw this movie and I couldn't recommend it more. I mean her photos are incredible. She's got to be  One of the most prolific and profound street photographers of all time and the photos are great and actually she used this camera  She is the role. Oh, you can see it in some of the images  You can self-portrait which yeah, you can see her but there's a few unusual things about this camera  Not only does it take incredible photos, but you're also shooting at a different angle. You're not shooting down standing up  You're standing up and you're shooting and you're looking down there  She is more subtle and so I like well  I have this camera song gonna get some 120 film and started taking pictures and the quality is incredible

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, but incredible you take 12 pictures at a time  10 you can't review them right until you develop them and oh by the way  You have to develop them right? There's no you go you take them to a lab

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe we should talk about this because I get all these questions all the time  So I should film 30% of the time. Okay, mostly 35 millimeter, but someone 20  I take the pictures and then I put them in a little mailer and send them to North Coast Photographic Services and say I want  the scans back now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, so they don't just develop they develop the film but then they scan the negatives  So you're gonna get a digital? Yes image, right?  And now is it noticeably better though than a than a good quality? Yes, Larry. So you also have the Sony a  So I see a scam. Yeah, should we do it on your computer? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Is it on your website?  Yeah, go to my website. Okay, is this the secret entrance?  This might be the secret entrance. Don't show anybody what we're saying. Let's go. Actually, let your sights on smug mug here  Why don't you log in you could do it? Okay, right  And the only reason is because my laptop is connected and you have some some weird funky type C connector on yours

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We can't do anything with well, you don't even have like I have to know where actually I think we have the cables and everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somewhere because I have a type C as well  So, you know my friend Chris Marquardt who's also a film part-time film photographer  Says one of the benefits of doing this is you have to be very thoughtful  You don't have the luxury of shooting 50 images checking them in between  Resetting until you find the right shot. You have to in your head get the shot, right?  And and you and you have to really think about it. Well, what I'm doing is is very meditated  Portraiture so like I'm light metering people you hit by the way. That's another thing. These don't have light

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, this one actually has an old light meter, but I don't trust it. Yeah, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See you have to buy a light meter so you can remember when the photographers come and they put a thing on your forehead  They go. Yeah, let's check that. Yeah, and they're getting the light reading and you have to translate that  Is this where you wanted to go?  So this is a unretouched scan or  Yeah, I see these images on your Instagram all the time. I just love them these portraits you do  There's a lot of pictures and which film do you shoot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  120 Kodak or Fuji and you can get all of it you'd shoot a plus X or

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. Yeah, not tri X. Do you shoot the I do I shoot tri X tracks?  It's a little it's a little grainier though, right?  Cuz it's ISO 400 now, but it's really I mean, it's that's another thing for digital photographers  You can't change the ISO you've got you got whatever the film is. That's the sensitivity of the film. You're stuck with it  These are beautiful images. Do you mind if we show these as we scroll?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So each one of these is a gallery  So, you know some of these people care so I sure  She must be fun to take oh portrait. So this is this is a shot that I'm not supposed to show anyone  Okay, it's Charles what you can see him right there. Oh, I'm not supposed to show that what the what?  I don't know why

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry, but the prince does not allow images of himself to be desered without to try something like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's try this. I'm just trying I mean, here's my problem. You can already see it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have this is just the poor one of the reasons I would think you would want to do your own  Processing developing is because then you at least can push the film. I guess you could give the lab instructions  Yeah, but you don't necessarily  Maybe you do I guess you if you're gonna push the film you have to push the whole roll

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That means developing it, you know Kyrie's doll from market. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, that's that okay, let's but we want to pick an image and you can show me why  You're shooting film as opposed to digital. Can you find an example of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sorry. I didn't have all this set up for you. Let's see

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I'm distracting you of course by talking to you while you're doing this some people can do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So these are 35 millimeter film shots, okay, that's not the yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not gonna shoot 35 if I'm gonna shoot I'm gonna shoot medium format or even large format. I'm gonna shoot  Pixels in fact you have a view camera too. In fact, I'm glad you brought that up. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just came back from the North Pole and brought a format camera Wow and  You can sort of see this is  North Pole scans here we go  So this is a my this is a my these are yeah. Yeah, and you can sort of get a sense of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there more detail is it the more dynamic range what is it that there's more detail more dynamic range

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  These are color shots. I normally shoot black and white and you've got  Kind of cross-processing here a little bit. Yes looks a little different

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, and is that because of the film you choose? Yeah could be the phone and that's Fuji

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is them. The the trip was a pretty incredible trip  There's only one way to get there and this is on this Russian icebreaker the world's largest the most powerful icebreaker

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had so much fun watching your pictures  I guess it was Instagram that I saw maybe Facebook because I'm watching this process this progress  Of course you the you posted those after you got back. I'm sure but check this guy. This is the captain

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah captain Ramis. He's not joking around. He's talking like this is too much ice to get through here  You're done taking pictures you're done. There's no more pictures. Yeah, the prince is on the boat. Yeah, that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, what he was saying, but you know, I mean this is look at this. Wow  Franz Joseph land which is around 81 degrees north now  It's this sort of abandoned island chain where all these Russian is climate an issue as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean the temperature on film don't you have to be careful there or no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You do you have to store the film kind of carefully but I didn't have any problems  I mean the bigger problem is there's only ten exposures per right, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'm like constantly taking the back out of the now can you you don't have to put get in a bag to do that  Right, you can do that. No, no, no, no, no, it's no problem. Did you bring a bunch of backs with you or oh, yeah  Yeah, oh backs. Oh, no, just the reels. Nope. Just film  So I was like changing your rolling rolling the film onto the yeah reel as you're going. Yeah  Okay, I'm gonna stick with digital because it seems like this is a lot more work it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You think so you think so, but you know that the quality is really really you can tell the difference  I think so. I mean, this is all well, this is all digital  You know, it looks great. I mean look if you need the shot digital is the way to go. Look at that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now see I you know, if you had said look at the detail  I'm getting in this great medium format film. I was I would have bought it but that was digital and

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that the a7r you know that a7 to well, what do I have here or what do I should well?  I know you have a seven. That was a like a d8 10. Oh  The icon the Nikon. Yeah, so, you know if I have these are kind of interesting  This is this is like a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now when did you go up on the Golden Gate Bridge? I'm not supposed to talk about that or even show these pictures. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because they used to there used to be a way to get up there but I think since 9-eleven nobody's allowed up there anymore  Well, some people you have friends if in high places literally that is a great shit was a really  Interesting is it scary up there? You're wired in right? You're a little into that thing. You're not scary

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh, well, actually you take it. There's an elevator that goes part of the way  Yeah, and then you walk up a kind of ladder system and get rid of that  There's a spine and you walk along the spine and it's but are you clipped into like when you go on the Sydney Harbor?  Bridge, you're actually yeah, this is different. You're walking up that that cable the cable. This isn't that oh, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a little you're just looking at a door. This is a little more time. You're on the tower. You're in the tower

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, are you not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What is this it's a dinosaur

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The hell is that?  Is it a whale going on here?  It's a whale that is a flying fish that is leapt from the sea what's going on here Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes genius yes Brian knows exactly  This is the shot. So I did a that's it. It's underwater and I flipped the image because he looked like he looks like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was really a cool thing. But there you flip it. That's what that's the very few people get that  Yeah, Brian you got good eyes, how'd you know that Brian Brian Burnett our technical director he picked right up on that he rotated it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But anyway, this camera takes cool pictures and I like using it and you know  What I'm gonna give you at the end of this session is a beautiful print  That you just wouldn't get anyplace else. Yeah, right and you know part of part of great photography is  Things being kind of valuable and special right if I take a thousand makes it special. I think for sure  For sure and you'll probably more likely to keep it if you like right, you know a thousand photos on your iPhone  You know the problem with that really is devalues a little bit. Yeah, not a little bit. Yeah a lot  It's lost in the clutter

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but don't you find it frustrating that you have to kind of meter it and  Think about it and you don't know if you got it till you get home. Isn't that difficult especially after using digital for so long

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a lot of non obviously wonderful things about it  One of them is I don't like normally I come home and have to process all day long

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's nice you could pop it in an envelope. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I just let the phone pile up and then I get 20 of them  I mailed them in right you can't really post process them very effectively. Oh you can't oh, that's interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you don't pop them in a light room and make them much better. They're kind of done

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Interesting  And then the other can't remain I basically have stopped using my SLR except for very specific photo

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Situations like you like the mirrorless. Well this I'm a Sony a7 fan  I have this is a7 this is a7r2. Yeah, I love it. Love it. I mean it's it's the same. That's the same  sensor as in your d810

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Basically, yeah, I know better. It's a little bit better  But Sony sold and then if you really want to do something special, this is my nice lens on there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is my oh, this is the noctilux. This is my go-to killer  So this is a point get this so, you know the f2 is fast and f1.2 is really fast  This is f0.9  Which means but you want to turn off the lights before you can take a picture  Well, you get the size of that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know the depth of field is incredibly hard to focus  Yeah, I have to look right at your eyes through and it's manual focus too, but you actually want that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You prefer a manual focus because you can't  You can't play you know, yeah  Been there done that. Oh, that's beautiful. You know, I love the creamy bokeh and  The color is kind of muted. It's kind of interesting. Is well, there's some interesting lighting in here

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like that, but you know that pot. That's a special kind of photo right it sort of pops  Yeah, and well, you know, this is what I hope for everybody  Who's getting into photography is that they don't worry about the 10,000 shots?  They worry about the 20 shots that they love this year

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's my problem is I have too many shots. I don't know what to do with them all  It's just it. I don't have time to sit down and go through them all you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The business that I would start if I was starting another company would be to do an annual like you had in your high school  Like you got your yearbook everybody should get a yearbook for their year  Yeah, of the few photos that they really care about I mean not only for themselves, but like in future generations  You know, do you think we're gonna have Facebook photos? No get them printed on acid-free paper

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And put them in a book does blurb do archival prints

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They do very very high quality. I can't tell you if it's archival, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very high quality, but that's what you'd want though  If you're saying well, I want this for you to generate well somebody that was talking to yesterday

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They were saying that there should be a service where you mail it to like the National Archives, right your family album

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm gonna tell you the truth though Christopher. You don't have kids do you know?  My kids they don't care they care and when I'm dead they might there might be one or two pictures  They're just as likely to look at my old Facebook postings as anything else and most of the stuff that I've taken over these years  And carefully cultivated they're just gonna throw it out  Let's be honest. You don't believe that I totally believe no  We we fool ourselves into thinking future generations give a give a rat's behind about what we're doing only we care

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you don't have any relatives pictures you look at you go. Well, that's pretty cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but you know one of the things at school is there's like two  right  There's like two daddy Leo had eighty five thousand pictures of every bit of his life  meticulously documented and sorted  Christopher Michael, I don't know if it's appropriate to say happy Veterans Day happy Veterans Day  And are you gonna do do you do anything special?
