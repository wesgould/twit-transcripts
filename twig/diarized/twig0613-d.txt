Transcript:  It's time for Twink this week in Google Ant Pruitt's back.  Stacy Higginbotham's here.  Jeff Jarvis too.  We're going to talk about Amazon.  They just bought the entire film catalog of MGM.  What are they going to do with it?  And is it a trust violation?  Amazon's being sued by the D.C.  attorney general because its prices are too high.  Biden's White House says their prices are too low.  Well, which is it?  And Charlie bit my finger.  It's a good thing he wasn't holding the piece of blue cheese.  It's all coming up next on Twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That I do have is somewhere on this messy desk of mine, but I do have that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually have put mine in a on a lanyard so I can hang it around my neck  because I feel like, you know, I'm going when I travel, I'm going to need to demonstrate it.  You know, so right.  And you suffered for it.  So you should you should definitely want it.  Great. Yeah, there it is.  This right here on my desk.  Don't show it to me. I'm not sure.  Oh, it's secret. Secret.  It's great to have you back. Welcome back.  Thank you, sir.  Also here with us, ladies and gentlemen, from the fine.  I got to reach over here.  I still don't memorize this Leonard Tao  professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig Newark  Craig Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.  Mr. Jeff Jarvis, former TV guide, critic buzz machine dot com.  Great to have you founder of Entertainment Weekly.  Right. That's an important title.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I didn't know you were a founder of it.  I didn't know that.  Is entertainment that's weekly still around?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Surprisingly, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. OK. No, I just like who knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sometimes we just call it you.  You at EW dot com.  It's it's still around.  That beautiful voice is, of course, the wonderful Stacey Higginbotham.  Now via fiber Stacey on IOT dot com.  God, the shot looks so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All the really I feel like I look blurry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, you're crystal clear.  We've got turned on 1080p now on our zoom connection.  And you're on fiber.  So you're sending us enough bits to tell what's out your window.  All the bits. Oh, can you see my roadies?  Oh, is that what those are out there?  Roto dendrens. Yeah. Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. I don't know how to say the word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I see the the flower in front of it.  The what is that in front of the is it a fern?  That's a dragon dragon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But yeah, out out the window are my roadies and they are freaking gorgeous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They blossom. When do they bloom?  Are they blooming right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have I have like seven.  They're native to the area.  So they're like 10 roadie trees.  Oh, that's like around my house and they're all different colors.  Can you go out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why don't you go out now and carry the camera with you?  We could all really know.  I'm just kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was like, I will.  I wish we could lose the fiber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no, that's not worth losing the fiber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here I can show you the here we go.  Ready? I'll see if I can get you a closer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because the light is brighter out there.  So we don't see the the color.  Are they yellow? What color are they?  Didn't suppose for the highlights.  Oh, I do see them.  There we go. I see. Yeah. Beautiful.  Literally rose tree from the Latin  Rodan Rose and Dendron tree, the Rodo Dendron  tree, Greek. Yeah.  Sorry, not like thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I don't know, but they're freaking gorgeous.  They're a little showy for me, though.  They are. There's like five of these things.  They're just like, oh, I'm so jealous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's nice. They're native, though.  You didn't have to plant them. They just they're there.  They came with it. Just live here. Came with the house.  That's really nice.  Look at there. Here's a here's a picture from Wikipedia  so we can see what the pink looks like.  It likes swamp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What? Really? They like swamp.  They like wet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, well, you're on an island, I guess, is damp.  Well, she's in Seattle.  Seattle is damp.  Somebody somebody called me to ask me  about that helium thing you have.  And I mentioned that you make money on helium.  It's the people's network.  It generates Bitcoin while you share your Wi-Fi and does not generate Bitcoin.  Generates helium, block chain, helium network.  Yeah. And he said his friend said he was earning 30 bucks a day.  And he lives in L.A.  And he was wondering if he would make that much.  And I said, well, I think Stacey makes like 30 bucks a month from passing ships.  But then she lives on an island.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, no, dude, some days it varies based on the day.  But like right now,  oh, today is not a high earning day, but some days I make like  70 or 100 bucks. What?  OK, the other day. Well, well, it just.  How does it average out the day?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It depends on the market, too, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah, it depends on the value of the coins.  Like right now, what? Oh, yeah, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a good point. So you get a fraction of a helium coin  whenever anybody uses.  Is it Internet access you give them or what is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm giving them Internet access.  So I'm sending data using my Wi-Fi as a back call.  So that's that's what I'm doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you have enough bandwidth now with your fiber that you can you can do that.  Is there is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's low bandwidth.  It's they're using Lora. So it's very low data rate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, so it's no no no skin off your nose, as one might say.  Although that's a particularly horrible metaphor.  So and then you make money  based on the bits or how does that how does it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And based I make money mining new coins.  So there's money for mining new coins.  There's money for being as a for acting as a witness for other miners nearby.  Proof of stake or proof of proof of state.  Proof of stake. And then I earn money.  Actually, it's proof.  They call it proof of coverage, which is wild.  Yeah, well, it is.  I mean, it's basically like, is there still a thing here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you converted it to dollars yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. So I've converted about fifteen thousand to dollars.  Fifteen thousand dollars to dollars.  Yes. Holy moly.  Like right. Where can I get one of these?  That's awesome. They're all backward.  So the IRS will know.  So it's really a pain in the butt to like calculate this.  There's actually an interesting lawsuit today.  So, yeah. So right now I've got three hundred and seventeen  Helio network tokens that I've mined since probably.  I don't know how long, like the last two or three months.  And those are now more.  Forty seven hundred dollars,  because right now Helium is trading at fourteen dollars. Nice.  But when you the tax implications are kind of a pain,  because what happens is  you are taxed based on the value of the tokens.  And this is all cryptocurrency's when they are mined.  So you have to know how much you mine.  Oh, what they were worth when they were mined.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not on when you convert it to dollars, but when you mine and when you earn them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And when you sell them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, well, so the basis is what it costs to mine them.  And then it's both.  You pay tax on which on the difference or the taxes on both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You pay taxes on the value that you're mining. Yeah. Yeah.  So there's actually a lawsuit that was filed.  Was it today or yesterday by somebody saying, hey, look,  you should just mine or you should just tax crypto when it's sold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's crazy, because you double taxed basically.  Double dipping.  It's not trying to discourage it. Maybe that's that's.  So I'm looking at the coverage map and yeah, there's a lot of Seattle  helium users. It's very popular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. You want to have a couple.  You you make more money if there's other you have things near you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because then you get the proof of coverage stuff.  This is really interesting.  I wonder, I should look at the map down down our way,  because I wouldn't want to do it if there weren't a lot of people.  And you see, it's not real big and well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you don't need a lot. I mean, and it's long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. So like there's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.  Oh, yeah. Luma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do it. But you can't get the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but not with after what you just said,  you're never going to be able to get them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Holy cow. Well, they've been back ordered.  But so the other thing is, I mean, I'm not do it like I didn't do this to make money.  I did this because I was like, Laura, networks are fun. Yeah.  It's the same reason I turned on Amazon.  I'm going to walk. So right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's an interesting and that's another one that the radio show.  We go back and forth about should I leave my sidewalk on or should I disable it?  It's going to be turned on any day now.  But I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess.  It's a member.  You were going to have Steve Gibson look at it.  I don't control.  So I was in any possible way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If I could, I know I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can ask the the sidewalk protocol that's running on top of the it's either Bluetooth  or Laura radio is it can work on both is Amazon doesn't see your packets.  The device company doesn't see your packet.  So it's all they're not looking at the data and the things attaching to your network  and the things that attach and use the sidewalk network can't get into your actual network.  So it's a really secure protocol.  So and it's providing this awesome service.  Now, if your issue is that you're like, screw Amazon, I'm not giving them anything for free.  Then, yes, then turn it off.  But what you're going to be doing is helping all of these companies that want to have a  long range, low power, cheap IOT network.  They're going to use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a huge benefit.  By the way, Steve did cover it in Security Now 796 last December.  And his final conclusion was thumbs up.  He says, well, we'll need to survive deeper analysis by cryptographers and academic analysts.  Amazon has clearly worked to create and deliver a state of the art secure messaging solution.  If this were to succeed, we might be in a world where a cool, low frequency, low bandwidth,  low data rate message passing network was everywhere in this world.  Previously registered devices could roam freely while remaining able to send and receive status  updates and command messages.  So he was bullish.  He did, in fact, read the white paper.  I remember this now and talk about it.  And he he was very positive about it.  In fact, he changed my mind on it.  So which was just debating this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  Two questions. Which router do you recommend, Miss Stacey?  And second, not that I would do this, but but I live on the burbs.  I'm not going to work out here.  If I went to my office and just said, I'm going to plug this into the ethernet at the office.  Can I start mining off the school?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, but the burbs are actually probably a better place to do it.  I mean, if there's too many, if there's too much coverage in one place, you're going to earn less.  Well, that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Petaluma is perfect because there's eight.  Right. Because there's some there, but there's not too many.  Like if you're.  But you can't get one. So good luck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you can't get one.  Kevin ordered one back in January.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Do you go on the wait list for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Any of them are going to be the same.  So here's the choice.  Hardware is the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's the choice.  There's the RAK hotspot miner, the Nebra HNT, a hot outdoor hotspot miner, the Bobcat.  Yeah, a lot of people are.  Which one do you have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I have the helium one they made, but I would say any of these, all of these are fine.  It just kind of depends on your goals.  Like if you want to do like the outdoor hotspot miner is interesting because you can cover a larger area  because you could stick it like outside on a pole.  But I would just pick the one that seemed to have the least backlog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They are. They are saying shipping batch three.  They're on batch four, it looks like.  I can't tell. It does say sold out.  So the button is not.  You can't even order.  You can't even order it on this on the Nebra.  Let's look at the RAK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's that gigastacy effect.  Yeah, it's all your fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, no, no.  This was sold out way before like I wrote anything about it.  I mean, Kevin ordered his in January and his keeps it was supposed to come in May and it's getting pushed back again by another month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Due to unprecedented demand for the RAK hotspot miner V2, we are limiting the number of the units can be purchased to 250 per day.  So you sign up for their Discord server and a message goes out in the morning to let everyone know  that the selections for the day have been made and to check your email.  So you basically doing a lottery.  A lottery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, you can order the Bobcat.  Can you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll order it right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to make fifteen thousand dollars.  I can put it in my Bitcoin wallet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's no rational.  There's no rational reason for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I Bobcats, the people's miner.  Oh, it's it's the it's your North America.  Let's see.  Buy it now.  Hell yeah.  I agree.  Choose the right frequency.  Watch this video.  Do not under or overpay the processing fee.  Oh, there's a processing fee.  I don't know what that means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Stacy's looking at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sounds like Ethereum gas charts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You go ahead and do the show while I check this out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know what to tell you.  Do you know anything about the Bobcat?  I know all of these companies like Nebra was formed specifically.  They were a spin out of a contract manufacturer in the UK to specifically to make helium routers.  That's all they do.  Rack and Bobcat both make other Bobcats owned by CalArts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I love CalArts.  Yeah, that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bobcat, I believe, is their brand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  CalArts like the college.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  They want me to pay with something called muggle pay.  What the hell is muggle pay?  That's cryptocurrency.  I could pay USDC or USDT muggle pay.  What the hell is that?  Do not underpay or overpay the processing fee.  How would I even know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I swear, it sounds like a crypto chip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sorry, CalChip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's different from CalArts, which is a university.  Yes, I know.  Right.  OK, that's that's OK.  You see my confusion, though.  I certainly do.  How would I know if I were underpaying or overpaying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  This got really complicated.  I bought, I mean, mine is from February of last year.  It looks like I have to pay from a muggle pay wallet.  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or, God, I don't even.  Don't buy that one.  I don't understand this at all.  This website is confusing the heck out of me.  It's cray cray.  USDT.  This is so crypto.  Man, I feel like I'm in the 28th century, man.  So you get to choose what wallet you're using.  This is cray cray.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, and to avoid like the people who are individually asking me  how you transfer your money to cash.  Yeah, how do you cash in your helium?  I did it on Binance.  Binance doesn't work in all states.  Binance is also now under federal investigation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Stacey, this is looking worse and worse and worse.  BNBs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm telling you, this is journalism right here.  This is me telling you exactly.  That's why I want to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Journalism.  All the things.  Plus $15,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know.  You're in a weird tax scheme where you can only pay using odd things and you can only  get it using odd things.  I don't know, Stacey.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I paid money to get mine.  So like, I don't understand how like anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This sounds Bobcat's created for you to earn more.  It's a high efficiency miner hotspot for HNT compatible with helium long phi and architecture.  Blah, blah, blah.  It's also compatible with all low RAN devices.  Five watts, signal range 10 miles.  That's pretty amazing, isn't it?  It goes 10 miles.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's why those people are trying to buy that.  I mean, because the difference is basically the greater your coverage, the more you can  earn on your miner.  So the outdoor, I guess the buy.  So yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  Well, I won't buy it right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Even if you do, you're not getting it for months.  You have to get a muggle wallet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What the hell is a muggle wallet?  Yeah, CalChip makes that one.  But Nebra sounds like it was designed specifically for this.  I'll get on the wait list.  We'll see what happens.  Meanwhile, how's your rhododendrons?  No, no, that's something else.  Big story.  Just broke.  Oh, Amazon has purchased MGM for nine billion dollars.  That's good.  That 8.45.  Oh, all right.  8.45 including debt and pending, of course, regulatory approval.  So Jeff, you're old enough to remember the 1920s.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Just teasing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you maybe do remember a very famous antitrust case because the movie studios in the early  days of motion pictures owned the theaters, the movie theaters.  So they had absolute control, not only of the content, but of the distribution.  And they were forced to divest.  This sounds exactly like a movie studio owning the means of distribution, Amazon Prime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, Comcast.  What about Disney Plus?  Well, I guess this now is the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Comcast and NBCU.  They're all allowed to do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, so when Comcast bought NBC Universal, they actually, the FCC, put a bunch of conditions  on the transaction, including things like, hey, you have to invest in minority cable  channels, which they did and nobody watched them.  So there were a bunch of conditions those are all done with now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The real problem with, and this was the US versus Paramount Pictures, the real problem  was exclusivity rights.  So the theaters that Paramount owned only could show Paramount movies and no one else  could show Paramount movies and things like that.  And the Supreme Court agreed, it went on for...  What year was that case?  It ended up being 1948 was the final Supreme Court decision.  So you do remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, so you were alive, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  F you all.  F you all.  It's a very, it's famous.  It's prematurely gray, damn it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So do you think...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think, I guess we live in a different regulatory environment.  We haven't really, nobody's complained about Facebook, you know, buying WhatsApp or Instagram.  I mean, do you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We just haven't translated the conventions of the physical world to the digital world.  That's part of it, isn't it?  Yeah, because it's digital distribution now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But presumably James Bond, Amazon could say James Bond movies will only be shown on Amazon  Prime, period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Bezos, Jeff Bezos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Disney does that on Disney Plus.  There are certain films that only show there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mandalorian is only available on Disney Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, I mean, but I would argue though...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Bezos has announced, by the way, that he's retiring.  Well, as CEO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, he'll be other stores chair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Will he be pulling any levers after all of this thing closes and is official?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No one knows.  He'll get a cameo in at least three films, guaranteed.  That's how you do it.  He can get cameos in films today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  No, I mean, Elon was in movie.  I mean, every rich Larry Ellison who nobody likes was in movies.  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  What movie was Larry Ellison in?  Was it the one where Sinbad is a genie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, Larry Ellison, he was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What movie was Larry Ellison in?  Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hold on.  So Bezos has announced...  For the nerds?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, really.  Silicon Valley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think that was the one it...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, is it Bezos or Amazon?  It's not completely clear.  Amazon is no longer Jeff's personal...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Iron Man 2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was he in Iron Man 2 along with...  What's his name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I remember there was like a cocktail party and he's wandering around or something in  their face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's in IMDB.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's just pure pandering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, so...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah, in Tim Curry's performance of Charlie's Angels was supposed to be him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tim Curry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The evil villain in Charlie's Angels.  Do you remember that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  It was supposed to be Larry Ellison.  Okay.  So 8.45 billion.  I remember when Kirk Kukorian was unloading MGM because it was so deep in debt and so  worthless.  I guess it's worth something now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it got sold again and again and lost stuff along the way.  Right?  Now I can't even remember, Grandpa.  Gone with the Wind.  Yes.  I remember 1939.  Which now is...  Yeah.  Well, what studio was it originally?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  MGM, wasn't it?  Right.  And I think Ted Turner, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He was on the deal.  Got Gone with the Wind.  He took away some of those.  Now, of course, no one's going to show Gone with the Wind anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, right.  Turner Classic movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wizard of Oz and Gone with the Wind are not part of the Amazon MGM deal because...  Right.  They were bought earlier.  So Prime will get 4,000 movies, 17,000 hours of television, no Wizard of Oz, no Singing  in the Rain, no Gone with the Wind.  They all belong to WarnerMedia, HBO Max, because of Ted Turner.  Which Warner got through the Turner acquisition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  All of this stuff just sounds status quo for today, though.  Everything is exclusive now.  Yeah.  Every little subscription service is exclusive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think that's a disadvantage for consumers, right?  It really is.  Because you end up having to subscribe to every one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this was what everybody told us when they said, hey, we're going to end up with no cable.  What you're going to do is you're going to have to buy a million different cables, essentially.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but the original plan was disaggregation.  The theory that a lot of us had with cord cutting would be you would be able to just get the things you wanted.  You wouldn't...  Because cable, remember, sold you, you get ESPN, but you also get 15 other channels that you don't want.  300 channels that you never watch.  Right.  So the theory was, oh, we could disaggregate.  And of course, immediately, as always happens when this disaggregation happens, re-aggregation.  Consolidation.  Consolidation follows.  Always happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  You can say the same thing about all of these services.  You subscribe to Netflix and they have all of these different categories that you never even flipped to.  But yet you're still paying that full subscription price just like you would for a cable service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a little easier to drop these.  I'm waiting for the pricing to change on them to really lock you in.  But like, so, you know, I'll subscribe to HBO Max like three months out of the year.  So I'll subscribe for a month and then dump it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then, yeah, I've done that too.  Depends on the season, if you will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So really that's all Kirk Kikorian is doing.  He's he's canceling and re-upping.  He's bought and sold MGM three times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There you go.  He's just doing it on a slightly larger scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fargo.  They own Fargo.  They own The Graduate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What has MGM made for us lately?  What is what is what is Bezos buying in current production talent?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there is a new Bond movie which was supposed to come out last year, which has been held because of covid and will come out this Christmas.  I don't know.  I mean, MGM has not been one of those.  No, no, no. It lost a lot of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it's all so move MGM movies.  Let me look and see what MGM released in 2020.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's going to be it's going to be amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Breaking news in Yuba County.  Respect.  They did A Star is Born.  A Star, which the new one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, wait, wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We have the new one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Bill and Ted face the music.  Legally Blonde 3 is coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Legally Blonde.  Creed 3.  All Children of the 80s.  They have the secret of Nim.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Adam's Family 2.  This is all Samaritans coming out.  So in 2020, they only did two movies.  Valley Girl and the Wrath of Man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So is that is that inventory really worth eight point four or five billion dollars?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, having a wide inventory of content might be worth that.  So what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a question.  So which make what makes a movie studio valuable?  The catalog, the back catalog or the prospects for new movies?  You know, it's my sense that.  The movie companies make money because they have the right people running them, right?  Who have a nose for what's going to make money and they know how to produce it and they can make it happen.  Well, the deadline says that the executive team is in play.  Yeah, so that's you don't get the executives.  But what you do get, it turns out the Winklevoss brothers are making a movie called the Antisocial Network for MGM.  I'm not.  It sounds like a joke.  I'm not kidding.  They've got the new this is all from Wikipedia, the new Fiddler on the Roof.  They're going to make Porgy and Bess.  Oh, they own Project Hail Mary.  Oh, boy, that's that's what I was going to ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's interesting.  Do they have Project Hail Mary?  Considering you just had them on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we Martin Smooth Ant, the author of The Martian, Andy Weir, who's wonderful.  It's going to be a great movie.  It's going to be a great movie.  The Untitled Richard Pryor.  Oh, this is good.  Untitled Richard Pryor biopic, Untitled Sammy Davis Jr.  biopic and the reboot of the Pink Panther series, which has been rebooted at least twice.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I love me some tinder sacks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, wait a minute.  Now I know why they paid nine billion dollars.  Tomb Raider 2.  I'm joking.  I'm joking.  But here we are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here we are.  A show about platforms talking about the old platform, the movie studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, so again, that is a legit question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Tell Toes said, we don't know how to do this.  Get us out of here.  Jane stopped this crazy thing.  But Amazon is buying this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think having a nice back catalog is pretty important too, considering what happened with Netflix last year and 2019 as well.  Getting a lot of run out of that show Friends and a bunch of other old shows.  What was the other one?  The Office.  The Office.  Yeah.  Got a lot of run out of those.  They made me pay money for seasons of Parks and Rec on Peacock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  That is my therapy.  I was very sad.  How dare they?  Oh, you love Ron Swanson too?  You're so awesome.  Leslie Knope is my spirit animal.  I love Leslie Knope.  What a great name, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a great name for a, what was she, a city?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She was the Parks and Rec director, right?  She was the deputy director of Parks and Recreation in Pawnee, Indiana.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pawnee, Indiana.  That's right.  So they own a lot of TV shows.  I don't see anything that's more like a TV show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't see anything that's more like a TV show.  I don't see anything that's more like a TV show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right.  So they own a lot of TV shows.  I don't see anything quite as, maybe as big as Friends, the wild, weird, the wild, weird  world of Dr. Goldfoot from 1965.  Mars Needs Women.  I remember well.  American International Television.  Yeah, it's not, it's not looking that strong.  Not looking that strong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So is Apple going to buy a studio?  Who else would buy a studio?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now Apple, Apple I think is exactly the kind of company that will not buy a studio, but  instead will buy properties and executives.  Yeah.  They don't need, but they need catalog.  And right in a way, really that's what's hurt Apple TV+.  That's what they haven't been able to charge for it.  They keep pushing the date that they'll start charging for it off into the future because  they're, I think they're afraid quite legitimately that nobody will buy it without catalog.  I thought Apple was taking the Netflix.  I'll buy it on a monthly basis for Ted Lasso.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so maybe the way you build catalog is you just make as many shows as you can.  Maybe after a few years.  Netflix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what I thought they were doing, like what Netflix was doing with this original  content and going pretty much all in on it with spending $50 million here, $50 million  there to bring this writer and this director and produce a whole lot of original content  that people love.  I thought that's what Apple was going to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Crossing Jordan.  They own Crossing Jordan.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't even know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Will and Grace also, they own that.  That's pretty good.  Will and Grace is funny.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, the Tony Danza show.  Geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Saved by the bell the college years.  Yeah, but I mean, so Netflix is an interesting story because Netflix pivoted, right?  They were originally, see DVDs by mail.  And when they first launched the streaming thing, we were just talking about this this  morning with Paul Therotte in this context.  They didn't have really anything you would want to see, but they quickly beefed up both  their back catalog, like The Office.  I mean, that's where you watched it until Peacock took it away.  But they also did a very aggressive and very expensive.  They spent more than $9 billion making new content last year.  Huge, huge budget.  And so really $9 billion for catalog is not a huge amount of money.  In that context.  Right.  True.  True that.  Anyway, it's fascinating.  And I do wonder already there are lawmakers are weighing in as they say.  Here's Representative Ken Buck.  As in the Buck stops here.  No, he is a representative from Colorado's 4th District.  Member of the judiciary proudly representing Colorado's 4th District.  This proposed merger is yet another example.  I should probably do it as Foghorn Leghorn.  This proposed merger.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Another example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're going to save you for yourself.  I think that's a great voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But anyway, a big tech's commitment to total dominance in every sector of our economy.  If Congress doesn't act soon, there won't be a market.  Big tech doesn't control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I thought Republicans liked capitalism and big companies.  I'm so confused.  It is a little confusing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to leave for like probably two to three minutes really fast.  Okay, take your time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If you just left, no one would have known Stacey because Leo does it all the time.  I do actually.  I frequently get up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I tell John, whatever you do, don't cut to me because you'll cut to an empty chair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And you know that the will just keep talking.  And so it's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I usually wait till you have something to say and then I go.  Oh, hey, hey, hey.  When the moral panic sign comes on, I go out and have a smoke.  No, I'm just kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you wonder, would Facebook have been smart to actually make its own content and people might like it for a sitcom instead of hate it for other things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we've talked about this classic collision between Hollywood and Silicon Valley and their models.  Quibi being the classic Hollywood play where you say, we're going to pay lots of money, get the best talent, the best stars, make really high quality content.  And we know nine out of ten will be flops.  But that one in ten that makes money will make so much money to be friends that will pay for everything else.  That's the Hollywood model.  And it failed for Quibi, obviously.  And then there's the digital Silicon Valley model, the YouTube model, which is we get everybody to make content for us.  We use the algorithm.  Tick tock does this.  YouTube does this.  We get like the algorithm pick the best stuff and profit.  And honestly, I think that's a better model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, where does Netflix fall in that?  Netflix is in the Hollywood model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Except and really good question, because it's not in the sense that it requires the blockbuster of how many tickets were bought, how many books were bought.  It is a loyalty model.  It is like a magazine model of the old days.  Well, that's interesting.  A newspaper model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By being a subscription model on Netflix.  And that's what Amazon wants to do.  In fact, there was this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a rumor that and I believe it true.  Netflix is trying to hire somebody to run a games division that one of the things they'll start streaming is games, not playing, not watching other people play.  But you play kind of like Stadia.  You play online.  And that kind of makes to me, it makes a lot of sense, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Getting back to Amazon, is prime video an afterthought for you, you folks here?  No.  When you go to watch television, is that like top of mind?  I want to check out what's on Amazon Prime today.  It's one of the big three that we check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's your third Netflix Amazon end?  Actually, I should say four because we do check Showtime and HBO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But really, Netflix, Amazon Prime.  Hulu?  No.  The Hulu, you know, it's funny.  So that's an interesting thing.  It's not that the content in the Hulu is bad.  I often want to watch content on Hulu.  The interface.  Their UI is horrid.  It's so awful.  I don't want to use it.  And then they put ads in.  And even though I'm paying, as far as I could tell, the most you could pay for Hulu.  And I still get ads.  I thought it was supposed to be ad free.  So Hulu is, they're shooting themselves in the foot because they have good.  I'd love to watch some of the stuff on Hulu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How about any of the new ones?  You know, Paramounts and NBCs and CBS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe I'm hitting that subscription fatigue thing.  I think you must be.  I don't do Peacock.  I don't do Paramount.  I have Disney Plus by accident.  I think I got it from Verizon.  Right.  That's the thing.  You got it free for a year from Verizon.  I do Apple because, and that's caught on by accident too, because I buy the Apple Plus  subscription, which includes Apple TV Plus, but a bunch of other stuff.  So, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I spend a lot of money.  Amazon has some pretty good stuff on their platform, but it's never top of mind for me.  I never see any type of marketing for it.  Even on my device that's listening to me all day.  It's normally recommended something on Netflix, YouTube or Hulu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know where they market really well is on the Amazon devices and the Fire TVs.  Pretty much Fire TV is an ad for Amazon Prime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The things I don't have.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know what strikes me is that so many of the series, I like series more than movies,  and so many of them on the platforms are so depressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I've gone through that too, especially last year.  I had pretty much spent most of last year just watching reruns because I didn't want to be bummed out.  I refused to put a bunch of dark crap around me and just cloud up my space.  I refused to do that.  The Nazis with America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The right-wing religious nuts take over America.  Technology takes over the UK.  They're just so dark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what really is the best streaming value money can buy?  What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Take a guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's that?  Club twit?  Podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look at what you get for a mere $7 a month.  Ad-free shows of all kinds.  There's shows like this show of all kinds.  That's just by itself I think worth $7 a month.  But then you also get our Club Twit, Twit Plus bonus content.  Stuff that we don't put in the shows, but there's a lot of good stuff in there,  including we're now doing a Linux show and other stuff.  And then of course our Discord, which we've come to really enjoy.  It's turned out to be the surprise hit of the Club Twit.  If you want to know more, $7 a month, go to twit.tv slash club twit.  And by the way, that ad, Club Twit members don't see that either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But Club Twit members do get to see me talk about my awesome fan mail.  Yeah, you will probably make a bit out of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sure, that should go in the Twit Plus feed.  Stuff from the cutting room floor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The other week I asked you permission when Audible came back  to talk about Audible, and I talked about Audible,  and Stacey talked about Audible, and you talked about Audible.  And somebody accused me on Twitter of saying,  you did all of that just to get people to join Club Twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The longest commercial ever.  We do in fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was a long commercial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, Stacey's leaving again.  Oh, she leaves again.  She has very low tolerance for us.  I'm taking this personally, I'm sorry.  Yeah, I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am taking this personally.  Maybe we should talk about Stacey's article while she's gone.  From Stacey on IOT, a deep dive into Google IOs smart home news.  Oh, I was hoping that would draw her back, but there she is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, I'm back.  I'm so sorry.  It's chaos right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's going on?  I think I heard thunder or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that's my chair rolling across the floor.  No, that was my dog.  That was a dog-related interruption.  The prior one was a doctor interruption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Did you pick up a waffle on the way, Stacey?  A cookie perhaps?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, there was no waffle involved.  Oh, damn.  This time.  This time.  Exactly.  Right attitude, Ant.  You know me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I had breakfast with Henry today and we were talking about his TikTok, which features  some of the most delicious looking.  I said, can you come over and shoot some of those at our house so we can eat the food  afterwards?  So I think we're going to, I think we're actually, what I told him, Stacey, is if you did some  thermomix recipes, there's a whole community of thermomix users that you could add to your  TikTok.  Oh, wait.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm getting an idea.  I'm going to create a thermomix channel and I'll expense the thermomix.  Exactly.  If he doesn't do it, I'm coming for him.  Well, then it's a nice thing about TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could do a collab.  Yeah, you could.  As the kids say.  I also said I have a Vitamix if you want to try that and a June Oven.  I have a Vitamix and a June Oven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm good.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm just saying, I literally said to him, Hank, come over and I'll give you a tour  of the kitchen.  You can decide what you want to shoot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll show you what I got.  Plus, I think your pizza oven.  Oh, I forgot the Ooni.  Yes.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am shocked and in awe.  You still have the pizza oven?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course.  I'm like, what, would I throw it away?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, okay, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have only used it a couple of times.  I have a cast iron skillet.  Oh, and I said, come over, we'll make chicken and waffles.  And I have the finest cast iron skillet made today from butter pat industries.  Do you know about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know that.  No.  Butter pat industries.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just have a, I have a, what's it called?  Le Creuset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, Le Creuset is fine and I have many Le Creusets, but the butter pat industry cast iron pan  is the finest cast iron pan made today.  It's polished cast iron cookware and they are not an advertiser.  Although if I could get them, I would be very happy.  What was the shipping cost on those?  Oh, I don't, these are ridiculous.  Like truthfully, I just, you know, get a lodge pan at the five and at the Goodwill, right?  Some, a lot of cast iron, rusty cast iron pans at Goodwill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can get like a lodge one everywhere.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  And then you just, and then you condition them.  But I have to say the butter pat's even better because they take a little extra care to polish  it so it's really smooth.  Interesting.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you buy a Giserro?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I did not.  I'm not that stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, maybe I am.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Desi, didn't you get one?  No, no one here got a Giserro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, no, no.  I bought, y'all made fun of me for the June Oven, but you know what?  I stand by that purchase.  I love that thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just wish that I had known they were going to cut the cost by about 35.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, well, I just bought a new one.  That's how, because we just-  Wow, she's all in.  Well, we use it, so we use it like, especially because of the pandemic, we were using this  thing like five times a day, every single day.  And we kind of wore out the, what's it called?  We broke the handle and then it became more and more difficult to clean.  And then when the handle broke, we were just like, screw it, we're getting a new one.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Time for a new one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now-  What's the go-to thing in your June Oven?  What's the, oh heck, I'll show you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I'll tell you, Brussels sprouts for us, roasted Brussels sprouts.  It does that automatically.  It's awesome.  They're so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ours is probably chicken and waffles.  I mean, we do toast a lot of waffles.  But the things it cooks, from cooking, it's chicken, salmon and asparagus, and then any  vegetables.  So we roast all our vegetables in that thing.  Like every night there's a vegetable going into the June.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Let me just, for the ASMR fans, here is a spatula scraping across a traditional pan.  Turn up my sound.  Okay, listen.  That was quick.  Okay, traditional pan.  See that?  Traditional.  And now-  Oh, the colors.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But listen to the butter pat.  You hear the difference?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's why.  What does that prove?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What does that tell you?  Nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  Your biscuits taste better because they're not, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's the most ridiculous product demonstration I've ever seen.  Easier to clean.  Let me put this skillet over Leo's head.  Let's put this skillet over Leo's head.  This one makes a louder noise.  It must make better pancakes.  Thank you, Jeff, for asking the important questions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The important questions he asked.  What the heck?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I am going to give my son's TikTok one more plug, salt underscore Hank, if you want  to watch it.  Hank's killing it.  The best cooking.  He really is, isn't he?  He's killing it.  He was doing this all with an iPhone.  He said, well, no, actually the iPhone I use for the top down shot.  And then I use the Canon 5D Mark IV for the video.  I said, well, they match.  He said, oh yeah, they, they, they match quite well.  So that's cheese burger.  And you know what?  The interesting thing is he uses, I thought I gave him all these fancy microphones.  He uses the built in microphone on the 5D Mark IV and he says it's actually the best  because sound is important for him.  The chopping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Was he always a cook?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I, you know, I cooked, I made sure that when I cooked, I taught him how to do  it and stuff, but good dad, good dad.  He, well, this is the thing.  I said, come over.  I said, what happens to this food?  He said, I, he said, I had a couple of bites.  It was too much.  I said, what happens then?  He says, well, I bring it out every Friday.  I bring a bunch of stuff over to my friends.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I like the hanging out posture of it.  I know it's very cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  He, you know, young people understand the medium better.  I said, keep it up.  Don't.  He said, I want to do a podcast.  I said, no, no, that's, that's old school.  You're old people.  It's old people.  I seriously, the media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  There's people born in 1920 and 1940.  I mean, that's all they're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The media landscape is changing so rapidly.  This was the hot thing 15 years ago.  It's, it's, and it's hot in some respects, but no,  it's not the big media companies now.  Yeah, right.  They're fighting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Once the big media companies arrived, started wearing the Nehru jacket.  It wasn't cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not cool.  Once the big, big guys arrive, then you know, it's no longer cool.  And honestly, I really think Tik Tok and I have to say,  discord too are really impressing me.  I think that both of which are used mostly by people under 25.  That's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Tik Tok is the first to me.  It is so important.  I've said it before,  but it is the first truly collaborative platform.  And that's, that's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They've done a lot of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Are we at all worried anymore about them being owned by China?  Does that, did that just stop being a concern?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That stopped being a concern.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It just sort of went away.  Like abruptly.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is Larry Ellison movie star?  Is he disappointed that he didn't get his Tik Tok?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That he didn't get their cloud business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He was, he and Walmart were going to buy it together.  There's a match made in heaven.  All right.  Back to our deep dive into Google IOs, smart home news.  I have to confess.  I'm was little disappointed with the Google IO keynote.  We've talked about that last week,  but this is your particular, you know, beat.  So I'd love to hear what you think was the big story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  In fact, you had exclusives you couldn't reveal unless that's right.  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I knew, I knew the, I'll tell you what, let's take a break.  It's Stacy will reveal all when we come back.  How about that for a while?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  She walks away from us again, which she might do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was going to say, unless I move, you could walk away,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but just come back, please.  Don't leave us.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Our show today, actually, I have to go and get the, get the clipboard.  Our show today, it's actually no longer a clipboard.  It's a virtual clipboard brought to you by Udacity.  Actually, this is a really nice combination with this week in Google  because Udacity was founded by a Googler, Sebastian Thrun, beginning of the decade.  I joined in 2012.  I think he started at 2010 or 2011.  But I remember we, the reason I joined it, we talked about the nanodegree program back in 2012.  What happened was Google and others realized big companies that they weren't getting the employees they needed,  the skills they needed.  Even people who had gone and got computer science degrees weren't really ready for the workforce.  Sebastian worked with Google and other big companies to create these nanodegrees.  Udacity offers a unique part-time, so you can do it with your current job,  with an eye towards the next job, right, online education program  that's geared for those people who are looking to take their technology to the next level  with really great, specialized and exciting content.  These nanodegrees they did in conjunction with Google, but also Microsoft, IBM, Amazon, many other companies.  Those companies said, look, these are the skills, these are the things we need our employees to know.  Udacity offers the latest cutting-edge nanodegree programs, some of which are not available,  most of which are not available anywhere else.  I mean, imagine they have a program on flying car and autonomous flight engineering.  Where else are you going to learn that?  AI, deep learning, intro to self-driving cars, machine learning engineer, robotics, software engineer.  So when you get these skills, this makes you so desirable in this market  because companies are dying to get people in the door who can help them innovate in this area.  Blockchain developer, look at that in the School of Programming and Development.  If you love learning, you're always learning to learn more tech stuff, you will love Udacity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  By the way, Google has training with certificates at the end on Udacity.  IT support, data analytics, project management, design.  Son Jake is taking one of them right now.  Oh, you're kidding.  Because you got a cert at the end and you get access to jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So Jake got a four-year degree though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Jake needs to beef up on some specific stuff.  He's got a few little things.  Yeah, CS is not, you know...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He was a programmer.  He was writing Facebook code in high school.  Yeah, he was.  Very motivated.  So what does he want to do now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He loves security.  That's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a pivot for him.  He loves really interesting security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good.  Well, I know he's got the skills.  He is a very talented coder at a very young age.  Wow.  That's great.  That's really great.  So your dishwasher can now talk to your Nest Hub.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Woo!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they did announce new notifications.  So your appliances, you can now hear like if your dishwasher is done, it'll tell you...  I would love that actually.  Exactly.  I actually thought that was really cool.  But so the big news was, hey, the hubs, the current generation Nest Thermostat, a lot  of the speakers and the Wi-Fi routers are all getting Matter support going forward.  Matter?  What's Matter?  Oh, Matter is what Project Chips, so Project Connected Home over IP became.  And that is an interoperability standard for the Internet of Things.  It's for certain smart home devices.  So they will all work together, even if you're using Google or HomeKit or Amazon's Echo.  You could just swap in between because they all now share a common data.  That's really good news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Has Apple said they're going to do that too with HomeKit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  Apple is one of the founding creators of Matter.  And they haven't said what devices will support Matter.  But most HomeKit devices coming out now have either Wi-Fi or Thread.  And those are the two protocols that matter for Matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Boy, I poo-pooed Chip.  I thought you're never going to get these companies to agree.  They all want silos.  And I was wrong.  This is great news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But we've been talking about this for a couple years, though.  This hasn't been an overnight thing for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's been two years.  So they launched it.  They announced it in December of 2019.  The hope was that it would be out at the end of 2020.  But we had that pandemic.  So get it out.  Everybody gets a pass.  I'm just saying, you know, getting all that many engineers together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's only five months later.  That's not awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, so it's now in 0.7 release.  So it's not going to...  The main features are all set.  So this fall, sometime in September or so, is when they'll be able to start testing devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Arlo, Netatmo, Logitech, Wyse, all participating.  Oh, it's 180 companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's crazy.  It's really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I never thought this would happen.  But the only thing I can think of is they finally realized after 10 years of each going their own way with Zigbee and Z-Wave,  they finally realized that's a showstopper.  People are not going to buy into this unless everything can interrupt.  They're not going to put their foot in the water.  Yeah.  So they have to interrupt.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And all the developers are like, God, you know, the stupid man hours that we have to waste,  like building an app for the HomeKit app and then building for Google's ecosystem and building the Madam A integration or the Amazon Echo integration.  It's just too much.  OK, so Google I.O., they announced that their devices were going to work with Matter.  We knew this was coming.  They also said, what did they say that I was really excited about?  They have, you know, like they have an easy to connect Bluetooth option that was kind of meh.  And they also updated their policies around security.  So they've got some new security policies.  They announced this.  I don't know if you had to actually follow it, but they now have you following it that every year you have to get recertified with Google's policies and security efforts or if you announce a new feature.  And one of those things that they're now adding is if it's like a plug or something that caused damage in the home, it has to have a physical security element tied to it.  So some sort of certification like UL or I don't know what it is in China.  So basically, that's that's a nice they're saying, hey, if our device is going to control one of your devices, your device needs to have all the physical safety things in addition to all of these cybersecurity standards.  We've said so that's good.  And then they created like a website where you can find smart home products that work with Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then we asked you this last week, we should look for matter on the box from now on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. So right now we're in this awkward, stupid phase where nothing's matter certified and won't be until later at the end of this year.  I tell people because they're like, what do I do? Do I dump my stuff?  Don't dump your stuff.  Keep your stuff as matter stuff comes out.  Buy it.  Some of your gear is going to get updated to work with it.  And some of it you're going to have to replace and check.  Don't freak out now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Make sure it's a company that's in the matter alliance.  Right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they'll have a matter who's missing a little matter logo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you point out in your article that camera right now connected cameras aren't supported by the protocol.  There are two. Is it too much bandwidth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's cameras are a little harder.  So the data. So with matter, they're building data models, right?  Standard data model. So I'm a light bulb. I turn off. I turn on.  Here's how you do that. Here's how you change the colors.  Here's those elements. A camera's a little harder.  And plus, I also think this is going to be like this is where a lot of revenue is made in subscriptions.  So it's a little dicey.  It's a little more competitive for the companies working on this.  But with cameras, you've got, you know, image recognition.  How do you build a data model for all the types of things with image recognition?  So there's there's a lot more to a camera that you have to account for than some of these other devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But there is a plan even with cameras.  I mentioned all the camera companies are going to support it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, there is a plan. I just don't know if we'll get there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right now you're looking at lighting blinds.  You have a you have a nice from the Zigbee Alliance, a nice graphic that shows what device types.  Lighting, electrical blinds.  Oh, this slide is old.  HVAC controls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They renamed themselves the Connected, the Connectivity Standards Alliance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  CSA.  I'm so confused.  Yeah.  This.  Cub Scouts of America.  Access control, safety and security, access point bridges, connected home over IP controllers.  So but this is this is this is intended.  This is part of your article.  Should you get sell all of your smart home gear to get ready for matter?  And I presume the answer is no.  Kevin Toffle wrote this actually.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He writes all of our we answer a question on our show each week and he writes all the articles answering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You wouldn't recommend that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, just just chill out for a little bit.  See what see what happens and then gradually replace because it's it's pretty expensive to replace all of your smart home gear.  That adds up.  Google also figure all of this out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is so chip begat matter.  Or is it the other way around?  You missed two weeks and you missed a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me tell you.  You missed at least five pivots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Renames back like two weeks ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Two weeks ago.  Almost exactly.  I'm looking at my calendar.  They did a rebranding where chip became matter and then the Zigbee Alliance became the Connectivity Standards Alliance because it no longer made sense to have the Zigbee Alliance have the matter protocol because Zigbee is going to be like who cares about Zigbee and matters going to be like super sexy and awesome.  I'm trying to think of movie stars.  But anyway, so the point is they became the Connectivity Standards Alliance.  They also broaden their scope.  So they still have Zigbee under their purview.  They're actually developing a couple other standards.  I did a scoop last week where I talked about one of them as a connected lock standard and then they have matter.  So all of that's under the Connectivity Standards Alliance, formerly known as the Zigbee Alliance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, thank you for that.  Does that help?  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google also announced that they're going to put Fuchsia, their operating system, on all of the like all the existing devices, which I thought was really interesting.  No, they said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no, hold on.  They're putting Fuchsia on the old displays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All the displays, the hub and the hub max.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And this, I'm really upset about this because why didn't they talk about this at I.O.?  They spent, they did I.O. and then a week later they're like, by the way, we got Fuchsia.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've been curious about Fuchsia.  That was stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like fear no more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Y'all next.  Oh, I just hit my microphone.  It hurts.  Kevin did a deep dive into the GitHub repo on Fuchsia and in tomorrow.  No, in Friday's newsletter.  He's got a fabulous article.  I liked it so much I saved it for the newsletter.  Oh, I can't wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK.  I'm a subscriber, of course, and you all should be at stacey on IOT.com.  It's free.  So this is their third major operating system, Android, Chrome OS, and now Fuchsia.  They started this from scratch.  We've been watching it develop and wondering, by the way, what the hell are they doing?  It's interesting that they are going to take in, they're going to in place replace what  was Cast OS, I think, on all these hub devices with Fuchsia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I checked mine.  It doesn't have it yet, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's going to roll out slowly over the next few months.  That's really.  Have you ever heard a list?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hope Fuchsia goes to the Lenovo displays, but I don't think it will.  Oh, interesting.  There's a question Captain Jack's asking, and someone else had asked me this.  And the Lenovo ones run Cast OS, but I don't think they're going to get the update, because  I think this is Google's way of kind of testing it in a limited controlled environment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They say you shouldn't notice any difference at all.  That you won't even know you've been upgraded unless you check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Have you seen anything that says what makes Fuchsia Fuchsia?  What is it?  What's the architecture?  Yeah, so here's the possibility.  I've seen Friday's newsletter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But since we don't have that yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And last week we had to wait for your IO views, and this week we have to wait for Kevin's  Friday newsletter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Geez.  I will.  I'm the anti internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You make us wait forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, there's a way to get around those commercials.  It's a thing called Club Twitch.  Right.  No, actually, hosts don't get to skip the commercials.  Sorry.  So, Ron Amadio on Ars Technica writes about Fuchsia.  And he says, and this is, I think, interesting.  Fuchsia is something very rare in the world of tech.  It's a built from scratch operating system that isn't based on Linux.  It uses a microkernel called Zircon.  Google's been working on this in-house since 2017.  Which is actually pretty fast.  Four years for a brand new operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They've been working on it since 2016.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, six years they've been working on it.  Okay.  Fuchsia's primary app developer language is Flutter.  And that's, by the way, why Google says you won't notice any difference.  We're going to slip in Fuchsia underneath instead of Cast OS.  Both Cast OS and Fuchsia used Flutter for the display.  So we can make it exactly the same.  It's not going to change how, it's a cross-platform UI toolkit.  So it's not going to change how it looks.  Flutter right now runs on iOS and Android and the web.  In fact, a lot of people are very interested in Flutter development.  Including Paul Therotte.  So, interesting.  You know, you probably won't notice.  I don't know if Fuchsia is in any way better.  I'm not sure what the point of this is, honestly.  Cast OS wasn't a good choice.  I'll give you some secret tips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's what, it's highly compartmentalized.  And Kevin suspects that there will be security.  Sandboxed.  And everything is kind of very component-driven,  which he thinks has good security implications.  That's the modern way of handling security problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's all I'm going to tell you, though.  The rest you have to just wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, shut up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're just so mean.  There's a Linux that I've played with called Cubes.  And they call it a, quote, reasonably secure operating system.  And Snowden recommends it.  But the whole point of it is everything is sandboxed.  Everything is in a container.  So all the interprocess operations,  a rogue process can't impact the rest of the operating system.  That's the way to do it.  For sure.  Compartmentalization, as you said.  So yeah, it would make sense that if you were going to today,  or even in 2016, start designing an operating system from scratch,  you would probably say, yeah, we should compartmentalize everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So is there anything that informs, I'm going to ask you another question, Stacey.  You may not answer it.  But is it more in terms of the mobile versus computer split that exists now?  Does this architecturally give any indication of how we can bring it all together?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think it's concerned with that.  I think it's concerned with running apps on many different types of devices.  So I guess it would be negating that split.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I don't think it's designed for, I mean, I don't know.  Our story does not cover the fact, I don't know if it's designed to run on a computer.  I mean, it could, but I don't know if there's benefits to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or what their goal is, yeah.  Yeah.  Probably they're not, but who knows?  You just don't know.  Matter support will come to the Nest thermostat.  That's good.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, and then the other thing is, remember when Google killed works with Nest like 18 months ago?  Yeah.  So they said the thing that, so if anyone was using works with Nest to have their Nest devices that were not like the Google Assistant devices,  if you were using those devices to control things in your home, you weren't supposed to upgrade your Nest account because you would lose that functionality.  So Google says that those people who want to use like their Nest cameras to control a smart home process,  they can actually do that.  They can do up to three of those by using what it's called, it's a device access console.  You have to pay five bucks.  You become basically a developer for Google and you jump through a bunch of hoops and then you can run your own Nest integrations that were taken away by works with Nest.  But you have to build them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google has also, and I suppose this should really go in the changelog, but they've also created a directory of smart home devices that work with Assistant.  So this is the page at assistant.google.com.  Your home can do more, discover smart home devices that work with Assistant.  So it's actually, there's only three.  No, no, no, there's a ton more.  There's tabs.  You get to scroll through.  Look, a big ass fan.  Nice.  Sensei.  Actually, we have these in the gym.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Big Ass Fans was one of the original companies that worked with Thread.  Way back when Thread was announced in 2014, they were one of the seven companies who were part of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And anything that works with Thread will work with Chip now or whatever, the matter.  Is that right?  Matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we're waiting theoretically.  I say this because Apple right now says they're putting on their stuff that the home kit stuff that it's a home kit Thread.  I'm hoping that goes away.  That's a question I've asked Apple, but you know Apple, they're just like, ha ha ha ha.  We'll tell you when we're ready.  So Roku is on this list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How would Roku, what would you get with Roku?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you see Yanko's story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, Yanko Redkirsch.  He no longer works at Variety.  Now he works where?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Protocol.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So he wrote a story this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yesterday, Roku is getting into the smart home.  What?  Yeah.  So that's why there are members here.  Look at that.  It's a fancy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Roku wants to expand his vaccine commercial.  I've missed that.  Sorry to mention the vaccination.  Yeah, let's not mention that.  I know.  I'm sorry.  Companies IOT plans include both partnerships and products developed in-house.  That's it.  I mean, why not?  I mean, they've kind of gotten to the end of the line on what you can do with a set-top  box so that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  And AV is the missing, I mean, really, unless you go with a professional installer, AV is  the missing component, especially since Logitech killed their Harmony remote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  Oh, man.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're all like, oh, sadness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So in a way, Apple led the way with this because the Apple TV is a hub for HomeKit.  So this isn't that far-fetched.  You didn't lead the way, please.  Well, who else has a TV device that's a hub for your smart home?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All of the display companies out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  They all wanted to be the hub for home automation.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, they're just not a TV, but I mean, I watch YouTube on my Google display.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you're right.  You mean like the Nest Hub and Nest Hub Max, those are hubs.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Are they Android, the Echo shows?  I don't think of them as TVs, but you're right.  I mean, I can watch clips from YouTube.  You can see your doorbells on them.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I mean, I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  TV, what I say TV, like the AV side being missing, I'm thinking about things like, you  know, Madam A turn on my, you know, turn on Netflix.  I used to have that when I had the Logitech remote, but when that died...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Amazon's FireCube does that.  You know, it's a Fire TV device.  It's awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't like it?  I didn't think that thing sold.  I think it's terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're still selling it as far as I know.  I like it because I could walk in a room and say, turn on the TV and turn to NFL 49ers  game.  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you can do it with routines, I think, with a Chromecast on a Google display.  The Cube did it the old school way with IR blasters and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it really wasn't a smart home device.  It was really...  Big difference.  Yeah.  It was more like the Harmony actually.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But it was a Cube and it had Madam A in it and you could talk to it and you could tell  it, turn off the TV or turn up the TV, things like that.  I like that.  All right.  When you say Roku is getting the home automation, it's at a level like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we don't know.  But my suspicion is there's a hole in the market and Roku is a logical company to fill that hole.  Yeah.  If they come out with lights, I'm going to be like, why Roku?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love it that Jeff Jarvis has written a thank you note to the internet.  Order the cart from all his collections, by the way.  Beyond grateful.  Thank you so very much.  And you make a good point, Jeff.  This would have been a lot tougher year.  I mean, it was tough, particularly for young people, but it would have been a lot tougher  if we didn't have the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Just take a moment, take a moment and think of what the pandemic would have been like  without the net.  Think of all the things that it did well and how people used it well for that.  And so what I argue is the net needs...  You know my shtick.  The net's yet young.  We have a lot of time.  It's early Gutenberg years.  But as we talk about how to think about the next generation of the net, the starting point,  which every conference I go to now is, oh, it's all messed up.  It's all bad.  It's terrible.  And then the ideas are all incremental and small.  And if we start instead with what do we want it to be?  What do we want it to do for us?  It's a different conversation.  That's all I'm saying.  I'm not saying there aren't tons of things to fix.  Of course there are.  I'm not saying that the current proprietors don't need to do a hell of a lot more.  They absolutely do.  But let's have a discussion about what we want it to be.  And that's my point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And thank you for leaving us out of this.  You say in every panel and conference I watched and that stupid show I do called This Week at Google,  the starting point of the discussion about the net is what's wrong with it.  And you also, I saw your tweet where you said, hey, you know,  I know a lot of people lost their jobs during COVID,  but a lot more would have if it hadn't been for the internet  and the ability to work from home and things like that.  That's a very good point.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Parents able to stay at home, students able to continue studying, family and friends.  I mean, Leigh Ann and I are old enough to remember.  Can you get off that phone? It's long distance.  Oh, God, yeah.  Science and doctors doing amazing work,  able to share information through preprint servers and everything.  Commerce continuing.  I got food to my 95 year old father in Florida.  The great miracle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, Andy Weir was talking about this when I interviewed him for Triangulation,  the author of Project Hail Mary and the Martian.  He said, you know, people forget we invented a new way of making vaccines called mRNA  that probably will end pandemics forever, that it's going to change medicine forever.  So technology, it's not just the internet,  technology very much saved us in this pandemic.  And let's look too after the murder of George Floyd

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  and the fact that we all unfortunately were able to witness it.  The movement spread across the world at long last.  A racial reformation, capital R.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course, we also bring up the fact that the internet propagated QAnon  and the Stop the Steal and all of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I stipulate that, but you can't help yourself.  You just can't help yourself.  Well, it's a mixed blessing.  It's called a constant blessing, but it's a mixed blessing.  I acknowledge all of that.  But I think that my point is made.  If we start the discussion differently, then to me it's more than about fixing the problems.  It's more than about adapting an existing institution.  It's what can we do with it?  And one of the great things for the pandemic for me as a silver lining  was I finished writing my manuscript, still waiting to sell it,  trying to hear back from the publisher on the end of the Gutenberg age.  But that gave me a lot of perspective.  Yeah, that's a useful perspective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think both, they're not incompatible views.  No, they're not.  The internet has been a, I mean, technology in general,  that's why I cover technology, is an amazing, transformative thing that's happened  that's as big as, if not bigger than the Industrial Revolution,  certainly as big as the Gutenberg Revolution.  But there's also consequences, just as the discovery of nuclear fission  had some benefits but also had some negatives.  Nothing's perfect in this world.  Thank you, Dr. Einstein.  Well, we have to be, frankly, we have to be cognizant of both.  And I agree with you that perhaps we talk too much about the negative  and don't spend enough time acknowledging the benefits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's imagine what we can do.  And it's nice to think about that.  There's a course I want to create with Doug Rushkoff.  And Doug Rushkoff is the guy who wrote Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus.  So he and I have different views of things.  He's also in CUNY.  I'd love to start one around designing the internet we want,  whether that means you're designing a feature or a company or a regulation  or a set of standards.  Let's start presuming our agency with it.  So thank you for the time on this.  Rushkoff is a great guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't realize you worked with him.  That's very interesting.  He's at Queens College and I'm at the journalism school.  Very interesting.  And he's been around like you a long time.  Hey, hey, nobody as long as you.  No, he's younger than me.  So you're actually right.  So there's a little dispute in Washington.  What a surprise.  The D.C. attorney general is suing Amazon because he says the prices are too high.  But Biden's antitrust people say Amazon's prices are too low.  They're so confused.  It's the new antitrust paradox race, Casey Newton and platformer.  So which is it?  I would tell you, but I'm not subscribing to his sub stack.  I just subscribed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know what?  This is like I had three in a row that were great Casey Newton pieces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just he's good.  He's actually doing really great stuff as a solo artist.  Yeah, he really is.  Yeah, it is a very interesting.  So the and I think the D.C. attorney general is going to have a tough uphill road on this one.  He's basically saying Amazon tells sellers what to charge.  They did until 2019 have a clause in their contracts with third party sellers saying and by the way,  this in my mind is quite reasonable that you can't undercut the prices you're using on Amazon.  You can't go off and sell it for less somewhere else.  Amazon did, I think, discover in 2019 that that is in fact an antitrust violation.  So they they pulled it out.  But they did kind of leave in something similar called a fair pricing policy that lets them quote impose  sanctions on a seller that offers their product for a lower price.  And that's what the D.C. attorney general is using is saying.  That's price fixing and that's illegal.  Amazon says the D.C. attorney general has it exactly backwards.  Sellers set their own prices for the products they offer in our store.  Amazon takes pride in that.  And like any store, we reserve the right not to highlight offers to customers that are not priced competitively.  So the which if I may if I may insert right there, which is really interesting, I think was Casey who raised this.  There's a section 230 angle to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can't tell us what we have to promote.  Right. Yeah.  I mean, and it is a benefit to consumers.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'm not sure we're going to be able to do that.  I mean, OK, maybe it's a technical violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act, but I think it's this guy's going to be hard pressed to prove a harm.  Carl Racine, the Washington D.C. attorney general.  And it is ironic that that's exactly the opposite opposite.  Who's paying this legal bill?  Who? Racines or Amazons?  Racines.  Because it's because it's because he's all of us.  Yeah.  Which is why this angers me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's what maybe it's showboating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And certainly that would not be the first time a state attorney would showboat or showboat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  It doesn't bother me that Amazon I can understand why Amazon would say we don't want to showboat.  Maybe I'm violating any trust.  We tell the same thing to advertisers.  If you give us a discount, please don't offer one lower.  But the reason we say that is because our audience is not stupid.  They'll go.  They'll find the lower price.  So please give us the best deal you've got.  We don't force it in any way.  And sometimes people do, in fact, undercut their deal.  But we don't like it.  People give Amazon a lot of grief because they're big tech and they definitely have their problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they also give a lot of small businesses a bit of a lifeline to be able to have their products distributed through them and to a lot more people that they're not necessarily able to get right here in Sonoma County.  Yeah, I have a feeling this suit is not going to go very far, but we'll see.  No, we'll see.  We'll go about as far as Florida's pro-Disney.  Oh, my God.  How long before that's challenged in court?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mike Masnick had a great tweet this week.  Pardon me if I'm wrong, but I think it's a little bit of a surprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it's a little bit of a surprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's a little bit of a surprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, we talked about before, and by the way, that Florida bill has now been passed and signed into law.  It does exempt anybody who owns an amusement park, aka Disney, because, well, that's the home of Disney World.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it says that if you'll be fined $250,000 for every day, any social media site will be fined for every day more than two weeks, that a statewide political candidate is banned.  Obviously, in direct response to Trump's banning on Facebook and Twitter.  And as numerous people pointed out, it violates Section 230.  It probably violates the Constitution, not necessarily the First Amendment, but the constitutional prohibition against states regulating interstate commerce.  And that's the only way to get into the Constitution.  And as numerous people pointed out, it violates Section 230.  It probably violates the Constitution, not necessarily the First Amendment, but the constitutional prohibition against states regulating interstate commerce.  I can't imagine this will survive in court.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No. But, well, I mean, with the courts we got now, who knows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think there's a lot of performative stuff in politics these days.  And a lot of it is aimed towards one guy in Mar-a-Lago.  Ron DeSantis just wants to send a message to the Donald that I'm in your corner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Which I honestly don't get to this extent.  Now he's off Twitter, he's off Facebook.  He's virtually silent.  He's pretty powerless though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel like these politicians must be testing the wind to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't think it's him. I think it's the idea of him.  I think it's...  Well, he's getting the benefit of it.  Yeah, yeah, and he raises money for himself and all that.  But he's a symbol of being able to say nasty things or whatever.  But the idea that he himself right now is wielding power?  I don't see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just don't want this cat to end up being a martyr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, he's going to be that no matter what.  That's his thing. That's his stick, Ant.  He's the ultimate victim.  There's never been anybody better at saying, oh man, no one's ever had it been treated worse than me.  He's like the Roddy Dangerfield of politics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can't win that one, Ant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He is going to be a martyr no matter what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  People would come to their senses and not give him that much praise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He who shall not be named.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I wish that too. But here we are in the year of our Lord 2021 in the US of A.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I had a big fright the other day. We all thought it was 2020. It's 2020.  What if it's the 2020s?  Do you know what I mean? Oh, we're done with 2020. It's over.  Then something stupid happened and we're getting sick of it.  It's the whole decade.  I thought, yeah, it's the whole damn 2020s. Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cicadas are cool. Why are we so against the cicadas?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You crunch on them on your sidewalk in about two days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have dealt with cicadas and I've dealt with the annual onslaught of crickets in Austin.  Believe me, I know it's kind of like, but it's also pretty awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I had to come up with something. Yes, I know. I know. I had to come up with something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, completely unrelated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  To what? Cicadas?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That was related to anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, it is related to cicadas, actually.  Somebody posted on Twitter the one time. Let me just see if I've got socks on here.  I can install this here. Let me just quickly install this.  I can make my computer simulate a cicada's breeding sound. Do you want to hear it?  Sure. That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That sounds like the X-Files.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know. It's good, isn't it? This is a Linux one-liner. If anybody wants it, I'll...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If you're on to the sound moment in the show, I direct you to line 142.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have another sound moment. Let me stop the cicadas, though.  That doesn't sound like cicadas. They're lower, but maybe this is the brooding cicadas.  The sound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Brute X cicadas?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. They're Brute X. Do you know what that is, Brute X cicadas?  It's the 10th brooding.  They're brooding. They're breeding. Are they breeding?  They're up in Jeff's neck of the woods, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They come out every 17 years. This is the 10th year.  Oh, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. They're going to hit my side.  Sorry, the 10th generation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is like locusts. They're back?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  17 years.  Oh, that's interesting.  They're 13.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I didn't realize that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's other broods. There's broods in other parts of the country that'll emerge at certain times, too.  And cicadas don't go down for that long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're in the audio portion of the show. The Google Doodle today is an audio doodle.  Oh.  Here, let me press play.  Put your rhythm to the test as we celebrate swing dancing and the Savoy Ballroom.  All right.  Shall we play the two-player? No, we'll do the one-player game.  Press the matching keys in time with the note. Are you ready to play?  This is Ella and Louie. And the keys are F, D, J, and K.  Yes.  Here comes the note. F, J, D, K.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This was my wedding song.  Really?  This is the song my husband and I danced to.  K. Well, you got to play this, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought it was the wedding song.  This is F, K.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that's what we walk down the aisle to. This is our first dance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, I'm losing and I feel like I'm winning.  Did you jitterbug?  Sort of.  You're probably going to get taken down.  How can they take me down for something that's on a Google Doodle?  No, they won't.  They can't. YouTube, watch YouTube doing it.  Anyway, it's fun. If you get a chance to play it, it's great music.  And it's the Google Doodle. They're celebrating the Savoy Ballroom.  I don't know why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Today would have been Miles Davis' birthday.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Little, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The great Miles Davis.  May 26, 1926 is when I was born.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think your sense we're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's less swing, more jazz, but you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In Harlem, it was one of the first racially integrated public spaces in United States history.  Where black people and white people could go to dance together and sing.  You say potato and I say potato.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yet, neither my husband nor I, when we picked that as our song to dance to, realized that the chorus is let's call the whole thing off.  Yeah, you missed that part.  We just caught on to the fact that we often I say tomato.  He says tomato.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's it was from a Fred Astaire Ginger Rogers movie.  There's a Gershwin song.  I'm trying to remember to a swing time.  It's a great scene, actually, if you ever get a chance to to see that.  Let's see. Let's call.  Is it Gershwin? Maybe it's Gershwin.  Maybe it's Gershwin. I think it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Gershwin wrote Porgy and Bess.  This song isn't from there, but that was your porgy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That was your effort to make make Jif out of Gif.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There there's there roller skating or as you kids would call it rollerblading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Skating and blading are different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're skating. They got four wheels.  They're skating. But you'd figure Fred and Ginger could probably pull it off pretty well.  One hopes this would probably get flagged.  This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  Man, the 30s were good.  Remember those, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Depression.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was going to say the Depression.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's from the movie Shall We Dance, 1937.  A very good year.  That was the year I married my first wife.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Do you want line 114 or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we're doing audio.  It's our audio daily double and line 114.  You're going to love this.  This is. Oh, yeah.  We've actually played this on Windows Weekly a while ago because they did.  No, no, no. I'll do a few of these.  They do the Windows boot up sounds and everything.  This is a South Korean a cappella group called Maytree.  And they do a lot of different.  Should I do the Skype one? Is that the one you like?  Let me see here. They got PlayStation.  They got Zoom. Windows XP.  Where's Skype? I see Zoom.  Maybe if I go to their YouTube channel.  Or it's Instagram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The nervous story has it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I clicked it. Here's the Skype.  Here, let's see. Here's the best.  Oh, where's my audio?  And pulse audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She purposely skipped Skype.  Go forward a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's Hangouts. Not so good.  I love their faces. They're so cute.  That's fine Skype, which is my favorite song.  In fact, I'll probably sing along with Skype.  Okay, just if you're listening at home, don't worry.  Your phone is not ringing.

Transcript:  Now one other sound here.  All silent.  He never said Charlie bit my finger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, this was a shocker.  Charlie bit me.  This was very, and you can't find it anymore because it's been sold as an NFT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They actually created a new version of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there is apparently hidden versions of it on YouTube.  They said that I'd be peeved if I bought it for half a million pounds to find that Charlie bit my finger is still hanging around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me ask you, isn't that what the Internet Archive is for?  Yeah.  Everything's there, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The kids are all grown up.  Well, not everything.  They're in their 50s now and doing quite well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But wouldn't it be on Internet Archive?  I don't know.  Seems like you could find just about anything out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It seems like that's exactly what the Internet Archive was invented for, doesn't it?  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When I saw it and they talked about how they're going to take it off of YouTube forever, I'm like, yeah, you can take it off of YouTube, but that doesn't mean it's gone.  The Internet lives forever.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They actually have a website.  Charlie bit me.  The auction has ended.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, Charlie, Charlie bit my finger.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The total final bid was $760,000.  Wow.  Why would somebody do that?  That's nuts.  Anyway, I'm glad the kids got some money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you don't even really need to hear it.  You know it.  It's in your head.  Just watch it.  So the video is still there, but the audio is gone.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Charlie bit my finger.  So he didn't say what he said that he didn't say that Charlie bit me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Charlie bit me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even though it's called Charlie bit my finger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  My finger.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm searching archive.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See if you can find it, Ant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there it is.  Funny or die.  Okay.  There's no preview.  No, it's got to do it.  Please download the file.  So yeah, there's a very, very careful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you post a picture on Instagram of your favorite blue cheese, if you post it with  a picture of your fingers, you might get in trouble.  This fella who is apparently a fan of a very good mature blue Stilton from Leicestershire.  I love Stilton posted a picture on an encrypted message service called EncroChat.  Turns out who else is on EncroChat?  The Popo.  I was going to say FBI's.  They were able to analyze his fingerprints.  He was just sentenced to 13 years and six months in Liverpool prison pleading guilty  of conspiracy to supply cocaine, heroin, MDMA and ketamine.  And Stilton.  And apparently Stilton.  He's such a fan of Stilton that he thought, oh, I'll just post this picture.  No one will know it's me.  Except apparently you can see the wars, warls and patterns of his fingerprints and the police  got him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So he's on this site.  Like, how does the police know to check his, to pull his fingerprints?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this site, he used this site EncroChat to sell drugs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Got it.  Okay.  I was like, where's the connection?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then they were apparently the police, you know, you think it's encrypted.  Well, the police can't figure that out.  And so the police were on it and they saw that the same guy, Toffee Force, was also  a cheese fan and were able to put two and two together.  And they could pick it as a fingerprint off the photo.  Yeah, they actually got him, which is kind of amazing.  Don't do this.  Don't do this.  Did you, I heard about this a bit.  I meant to ask my son, he was in LA over the weekend.  I wonder if he went to the Huntington Beach party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why is this on our shm rundown?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because it's social media.  It's TikTok.  This is what's wrong with the internet.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it was a 17th birthday party for a young man, which unfortunately, to which the invite

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  got posted, I think on TikTok or Instagram, and 2,500 people from all over the world showed  up.  It turned into a riot.  Many people got arrested.  Huntington Beach Police Department requested assistance from outside agencies, over 150  officers from all the agencies within Orange County went to Huntington Beach.  An emergency curfew was issued.  121 adults, 28 juveniles arrested, booked for vandalism, fireworks, failure to disperse  and curfew violations.  No serious injuries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is this at his house?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, this is downtown Beach.  Oh, well, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was like, okay.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Police said they knew about the post and made preparations.  Do not post your party invitations on TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did that person do it or did someone of his friends do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They thought they didn't think people would show up to it.  I don't blame them.  Who would know that people go, oh, yeah, let's all go to Huntington Beach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, that's again, that's the good and the bad of the internet because it probably  got a lot more people to this person's party.  He had a great party.  Could have been a great time and something they would always remember.  And then the foolishness happened and it devolves within minutes, unfortunately, the  good and the bad of these platforms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to take a little time out, a little breather so that  Stacey can go get a waffle.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And when we return, it'll be time for the Google change log.  Are you all waffled up, Stacey?  Are you ready?  That was a faux break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you could go get a waffle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll wait.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, start the change log.  I got nothing to add.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's time for the Google change log.  Like the guy said, June 15th.  That's the end of the line for free Google photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Unless what?  That's the fastest change log ever.  That's all you need to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Man, I didn't get my waffle that time either.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, June 1st next week, the Google Photos Policy change.  No longer will you have free unlimited storage for high quality or compressed photos from  that date unless you own a Pixel phone from the two onward.  I do, thank goodness.  However, everything you got there so far up to June 1st will stay, right?  So you should really upload all your photos today.  Get it done, folks.  Get it done.  Get her done.  Any existing high quality photos and videos are exempt from the change won't count toward  the free 15 gigabyte storage that you get with a Google account.  But anything new you upload will count against your storage from June 1st.  So if you want to use it like you've been using it, you'll have to pay for that storage.  Google Photos has offered a new weeding tool.  And Google said today we're starting to roll out a tool in the Photos app to help you easily  manage the photos and videos you've backed up that count towards your storage quota.  Which is like going through your email.  Well, it's automated, which is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And fixing your bookmarks.  Yeah.  Nobody's going to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It will surface blurry photos, screenshots, large videos.  That's actually a big one on me because I had turned on video uploads.  So it's uploaded every video I've ever taken for the last.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Whiteboard pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Whiteboard pictures. Yeah.  It hasn't rolled out in all devices.  But when it does, you'll find it by clicking on your account in the top right hand corner of the library section and tapping storage.  Then you'll see manage storage and you should see new sections including blurry photos.  Actually, you know what?  They should have done this years ago.  I will.  I can't wait to delete my blurry photos.  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've got like I have are these to my wife.  Are these bananas green enough for you?  Pictures.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I got I do that all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But those it's not probably going to highlight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Anyway, it's so annoying trying to get rid of all of those one offs to you.  Yeah.  The picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you anybody else downloaded Android 12 yet?  I've been playing with a little bit.  I like it.  I'm a little gun shy with betas.  There have been people who have bricked their phones.  XDA developers says you should use DFU to install the update, not just the OTA update that Google offers.  That's what I did.  Had no problems on my Pixel 4 XL.  But they say if you use DFU, you can roll it back.  So maybe that's the device firmware update technique.  It's explained on XDA dash developers dot com.  Pixel launcher discover feed on Android 12 can be themed by doodles in a material you like manner.  According to Abner Lee writing for nine to five Google.  I don't even know what any of those words mean.  But I was hoping you would consider they briefly spoke about material you there and I.O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It just sounded sort of they don't yet have that really nice wallpaper changer feature.  That's the one I'm looking forward to because I don't want to spend a lot of time theming.  But if it will take my wallpaper and change my colors, that's nice.  You know that page that we all have that Google has that shows you your searches, web and app activity.  Mm hmm.  You know, that pretty much anybody who has your phone or your browser could probably just go there and and look at all your searches.  I'm going to take a chance here and go to activity dot Google dot com and and see all my searches.  You can now password protect that you might want to.  I thought it already was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I'm correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it is in the sense that you have to be logged in.  But most of us log in on our browser, right?  And just it's always logged in.  So somebody got my phone or my set down my computer.  I'd be logged into my Google account and they could just go to my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I would definitely still be logged in.  But on the computer now, I always log out.  What are you nuts?  That's a lot of work.  It's habit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do not.  I do not.  I do not.  I leave myself logged in everywhere.  I'm logged in right here.  So as you can see, I searched for Charlie bit my finger earlier today.  I searched for so the John saying you sure you want to show this?  I don't think I slow down.  Slow to scroll.  I think I searched for anything bad.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I think I'm OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, you might want to password protect it because well, your searches say a lot about you.  Don't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  True.  That's exactly what Google says to all of its people buying ads.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One more photos thing and then we'll wrap this thing up.  If you have Gmail attachments, finally you could save it to your photos in mobile.  Holy cow.  How long is that?  We've been waiting for that.  Only JPEG images are currently supported.  But if there is a photo in your email, you can now save it to Google Photos instead of downloading and import.  And then upload it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  That's such a pain.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's the Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  ScooterX just posted something in the chat.  First physical Google store opening in NYC.  We have that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  NYC.  We have that.  Yeah.  That's in our Quick Takes section.  Because it's actually in the rundown.  They've had a Quick Takes section?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's something new.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm like, oh, what is that?  It's time for the Twig change log.  Because Leo keeps missing big stories.  It is stupid.  No, no.  I don't think so.  I think it's because I'm not a big fan of Twigs.  I'm not a big fan of Twigs.  I'm not a big fan of Twigs.  I'm not a big fan of Twigs.  I'm not a big fan of Twigs.  I don't presume to put it in either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Please don't.  Jason, we'll move it around.  I don't make a judgment.  It was like the green, but we had green boxes for a while.  Yeah, the problem with the green boxes is they were all spread around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so I was missing green box stories.  So we thought of a new way to do this.  And that's your Twig change log.  I have to say, Google has had brick and mortar stores many times before.  So I don't know why this is new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Only as pop-ups, I think, because it's a permanent one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, they had a brick and mortar store in Austin for Google Fiber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They had it at the Oakland airport for a long time.  You could do a Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, I've never seen this store.  It's always been the internet fiber.  Never something that's for actual Google hardware.  Yeah, they haven't had a feature like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They have pop-ups.  Well, they haven't had a lot of hardware, if you remember, y'all, other than Pixel phones.  I wish they had more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Pixel phones, Pixel books, Fitbits, Nest smart home devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'll be able to, there'll be customer service right there.  You can make online orders, pick them up at the store, kind of like Apple does.  I should point out Microsoft closed all of its retail locations not so long ago, but  maybe Google would do better.  All of them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  They closed the whole thing?  Wow.  Shut it all down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do remember seeing a Microsoft store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'd walk by there and those geeks are just kind of twiddling their thumbs.  Then you go by the Apple store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it was so quiet.  And there are a lot of people in those lines.  It was so quiet.  Yeah, it was really bad.  And often Microsoft built the Microsoft store across the way from them.  Yes.  Right across the hall.  So that comparison was even more...  The contrast was all the worse.  Pathetic.  Google has filed...  Silly jab.  Google has been fined, big fine in Russia, $81,000.  Free throw.  I don't even know.  It's like, oh, it costs us too much to write a check.  We'll just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a big fine in it.  We'll credit it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, it would be a lot for me.  We'll just give you Google+.  Roskomnadzor, Russian media watchdog said, they gave Google 24 hours to delete videos  that contain drugs, violence, and extremism.  They failed to do so.  It's going to cost you 6 million rubles.  Oh, rubles ain't what it used to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was going to say, how much is a ruble worth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, $81,000 total.  I'm not even going to talk about the Pixel 6 and the Pixel 6 Pro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a Camaro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's exactly what it is.  Not a Camaro.  That's a car from Chevrolet.  Yes.  It's a Chimera, which is something you're not going to...  Chimera.  I said Chimera.  I say Chimera, but I don't really know.  Let's check the...  Say again?  What is it?  Chimera.  Chimera.  Chimera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is that like an amoeba?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nope, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's, according to Greek mythology, a monstrous fire-breathing hybrid creature of  Lycea composed of the parts of more than one animal.  Really the reason we use that is it's something imaginary, illusory, impossible to achieve.  Chimera.  Oh, okay.  The Pixel 6...  What is it?  Chimera.  That's what it is.  Anything else we want to talk...  India raided the Delhi Twitter office, kind of the same reason Russia doesn't like Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There was no one there, but they made their point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that really...  News cameras were in tow because they wouldn't take down tweets that bothered Modi.  It was a symbolic message, the Prime Minister.  They've been putting...  The Twitter changelog.  There's a Twitter changelog?  Let's do it.  Well, just because you can now apply, you can verify the count.  And now the Twitter changelog.  I could play cicadas again if you want.  Do they send...  Please no.  Okay.  Let's call the whole thing off.  Is that what you're saying?  Twitter has previewed ticketed spaces, but I have to love the way they did this because  it really was a little bit of shade at the Apple Epic battle because basically spaces  will allow you to charge for an event or a stream or whatever so you can host paid gatherings.  Twitter will take 20%, but if people are paying on an iPhone, Apple will take 30% and you'll  get whatever's left after all of that.  You'll get about half of it.  It says you can earn up to 80% of the revenue on ticket sales after platform fees are deducted  by Apple and Google on the in-app purchases.  The math is way too complicated, but it is interesting.  I guess this is a way for...  Has Twitter charged for anything in the past?  This is the first, right?  Negative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is the first.  This is just a shot in the dark.  They haven't implemented this yet, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Space has been around, but the idea of a paid space is...  No, I mean the yes.  The ticketed space is not there.  Yeah, yeah.  Get ready.  Users in the US will be able to apply to host paid live audio rooms in the next couple of  weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that makes sense.  They don't want just anybody doing it, I guess, because it saves them headache and money with  all of the hosting and so forth.  Make sure it's somebody that's actually notable and actually going to get some people in to  draw some funds where they can get their cut because I guess that makes more sense, not  just anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  New York Times...  I misread this.  I thought it said the New York Times talks to buy the Atlantic, but it's actually the  athletic.  What the hell is the athletic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Even I'm not a jock and I know what the athletic is.  Oh, is it a website?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought it was a magazine at one time, wasn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They stole basically every beloved sportswriter across the country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, this is a...  Okay.  I thought they were an old magazine.  The athletic laid off 46 people last June, but ended up hiring about double that number  back last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're huge.  They're the darling subscriptions.  Oh, gee, can't we be like the athletic?  Because they got all these sports writers and jock people like that.  I don't get it, but they do.  And so they competed with every newspaper out there.  They took their talent and built the athletic upon it.  Is it for athletic supporters?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Rim shot.  I had to say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's why they named it the athletic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The good thing is he may be old, but he never grows up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess I mean, that's not so interested in sports that I would go to a general sports  thing.  Plus a subscription.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm specific sports.  It's a huge success story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a market for that though.  The way ESPN is quite polarizing because again, they are the world of sports news, however  they quote themselves.  But they have a lot of people that love them, but just as many people that hate them because  of the way they sensationalize a lot of the different events in the sports world.  And maybe something like the athletic is the better way to go, whereas it's a pure journalistic  approach to it and not a whole bunch of fluff.  Because if you turn on Instagram or whatever and go to ESPN, everything is just slam-dunk  home runs and really no meat to the story about the game that happened.  It's just flash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's Ant Pruitt, our sport ball correspondent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was like, I have nothing to add here, Ant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bravo, bravo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well done.  We're all going.  Come on.  What the hell would that be?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  When I hear sports, I just zone out.  I just completely zone.  Oh, that was me?  As a child, my greatest trauma was going to the barbershop.  There were still barbershops then.  Oh yeah, sports talk at the barbershop.  Hey kid, how about them Phillies?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had a very similar experience except it was, hey kid, how about them Playboys?  I'd go to the barbershop and there's girly magazines in there and it's like, I was not  prepared for this.  I'd rather talk about sports.  Thank you very much.  I think that's pretty much everything we were going to talk about today.  Would you like to move along to our picks of the week?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you have, you scared me.  Okay.  Sorry.  All right, picks of the week coming up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm so excited about mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stacey Higginbotham is so excited about her pick of the week.  She can't wait to tell us about it.  What is your pick of the week, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You may have seen this because this is not new, but I just encountered it for some reason.  It's a site sponsored by the EU called HowNormalAmI.eu.  HowNormalAmI.eu.  Should I do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can go to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Shall I do it?  It's sponsored by the government?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So let's talk about the face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's an educational thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Specifically, we'll be looking at machine learning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For AI.  So we'll just get to part of it, but it's going to tell you how attractive you are first.  And this guy is telling you, it's asking you some questions.  He wants to know how old I am?  This data, by the way, is not kept.  Yeah.  Okay.  None of us read the terms, apparently.  I read the terms.  I am reading this right now, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't even see the terms.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's giving you your beauty.  Oh, I'm a six and a half.  This is how attractive you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm a six and a half.  I'll take it.  I'm a six and a half.  I'm a six and a half.  I'm a six and a half.  I'm a six and a half.  I'll take it.  Look, this guy's a seven.  Wait, nine!  What the hell?  So if you look at it, if you play it without this.  Oh, wait a minute.  I got more attractive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I got more attractive too, but I didn't get a 7.1.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm more attractive than 80% of the Spice Girls.  I don't know about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Will it go up if I smile?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think so.  It might go down.  That was terrifying.  Oh my God, it went up!  So if you were listening to the little German dude in the corner instead of us, they would  be explaining to you how this algorithm is calculated and what types of companies use  it.  So I encourage you when you go check this site out to actually sit down with the sound  on.  He talks about that.  It's just a random algorithm?  No, no, no.  He talks about why it was developed, which ones they're using, and it talks about how

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's...  So my beauty ranges from 5.8 to 7.8, although apparently I got a 7.9.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My lowest age prediction is 37, thank you very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mine was 32, so that is pretty wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow, that's good.  Did I lie about my age?  Yes.  My gender's a man, that's good.  Go ahead, play the guy's voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  ...a country or culture in which an algorithm was constructed can have a big influence on  how it will categorize...  What algorithm?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's 99% sure I'm not a woman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Whose algorithm?  They have to discuss...  Oh, it's going to tell me my BMI.  Get ready for this.  ...from just looking at your face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just looking at my face, it knows it's going up.  It's going up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is what the EU government's going to...  Here's what you want, Jeff.  Here's right here.  In practice, I found that the required data is often simply scraped from the internet.  For example, some researchers who work at Google took these pictures from online communities  where people shared their weight loss progress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Who wrote this algorithm?  They're putting it up here.  You know what I'm going to say, Stacey?  It's moral panic.  Oh no!  An algorithm can do this.  What algorithm?  From who?  With what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is irresponsible as hell.  Well, listen to it before you...  Listen to the whole thing.  I have 44 years left to live.  I want an about link on this thing to tell me about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's not there.  It is there.  Well, it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  Yeah.  Keep...  Go to those sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You read the site because we're not playing all the audio here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  These types of predictions are essentially created by stacking educated guesses on top  of each other, which makes the results even more imprecise.  However, that doesn't stop insurance agencies from purchasing these types of predictions.  This is an art project by a gentleman named...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It thinks my name is Mr. SexyPants83.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So one guy wrote one algorithm.  Now this speaks for all algorithms, how awful and evil they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  He's talking about...  So in this thing, before you have a freaking moral panic attack, listen to the whole thing.  So he developed...  I don't remember if he developed this or not, but the idea is to show where these things  are used and how they are developed.  And the way they're developed is not wrong.  I've talked to people who build these sorts of things and the sorts of data he's crunching  to get to these algorithms are the same sorts of data they use.  So the point of this is not...  That does a lot of work.  The point of this is to make people aware of two things.  One, that when you go to these things, a lot of times people are using them to grab your  information, which is true.  So if you go to Hot or Not or whatever, you're going to get...  They're using that data to feed algorithms.  One, that's point one he's trying to make.  Two, is he's talking about how these are used.  Wait, you already...  This isn't now to the dog.  This was to the dog at the beginning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I was happy.  So, I think this is a really good idea despite what Jeff says.  Hownormalami.eu, because it informs you about how these things work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  These things.  These things.  This is how these things work.  It's exactly how these things work.  This technology.  This is exactly how these things work.  But I do want to say there is a flaw in this, which is I am much more interested in what  it thinks my age and BMI are and whether my score looks is seven or eight.  That actually makes me much more interested.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, Jeff.  He does.  So he talks about the beauty scoring model was found on GitHub and he points out two,  the models to predict gender, age and facial expression are part of FaceAPI.js.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Before your score, I'm going to get a score.  Before my score is revealed, will you allow the anonymous data in the list above to be  to calculate a new average?  It will shift what this test considers to be normal in your direction.  I don't even know what that means, but I'm going to say, okay.  I am 58% normal.  I'm average-ly normal.  So I don't know what that all means.  But again, I'm more distracted by, oh, it thinks I'm pretty good looking.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Honestly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there you go.  I'm missing the whole point of this.  You know, the whole thing, because I'm going, well, it only thinks I'm 37.  It thinks my BMI is 22.  What the hell?  I like this machine.  It thinks I'm going to live another 80 years.  I love this machine.  So I'm missing the whole point, in other words, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  And Jeff, if you go into, he puts his sources in there so you can read up and get your.  I think it's really good for explaining.  I agree.  What this stuff is and how it's being used.  And even like, I mean, we just saw the tweets from Lemonade talking about how they're going  to assess fraud on your insurance claim based on your video claims data.  They're going to run it through an AI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And he does at the bottom, Jeff, have a whole link of sources and references.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, my point is he sets up a straw man.  I'm saying this is what all of it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff, you're setting up a straw man because you didn't listen to the whole thing, period.  Casey is snapping at you right now.  Facts.  Facts.  Read the whole article, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No waffles for me.  By the way, the beauty judgment comes from how TikTok works.  So OK.  OK.  I'm just saying, according to TikTok, I'm good looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I can't confirm TikTok does this algorithmically, comma.  No, it doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they've said that they do.  They've been on the record about this practice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's move on.  Let's just move on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  Move on because I'm going to get snippier with Jeff until he watches the whole thing.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's an art project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Complained about technology?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's not complaining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is an educational thing for people to understand how algorithmic decisions are made  about you.  I think he should check it out.  He's labeling all his...  Besides, it thinks I'm 37.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It only did that to seduce you, Leo, so that you'd buy things from it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's not selling anything.  All right, Jeff, what's your number?  A smudgy camera.  And Stacey, you can say anything you want about Jeff's number.  Line 120.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, this will fit right in, actually, now.  Line 120.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  120, America Talks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's something coming up called America Talks, which is based on something that Dezite  a couple years ago called Deutschland spricht, which means Germany speaks, where you answer  five binary questions and then the algorithm will pair you with someone, if it weren't  for the pandemic, it would be someone near you, but now it will be on Zoom, with whom  you disagree.  Oh, God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The last thing in the world I want to do is talk to somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was my question.  I'll just call up my family.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I can talk to people I disagree with without leaving the house.  I don't need to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So if you go to sign up, it will then ask you five questions.  You can show you can demonstrate that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you approve of the job Joe Biden is doing?  Yes.  It's kind of a binary choice, but it's all binaries.  Should the laws covering the sale of guns be more strict?  No.  Is freedom of religion under attack today in America?  No.  Is a 15 minimum wage good?  Yes.  Is legalizing recreational marijuana a good idea?  Absolutely not.  Is a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants a good idea?  Yes.  Is three speech threatened on college campuses?  No.  Okay, I've answered the questions.  Oh, I missed one.  Oh, yeah.  You missed one.  Yeah, it didn't take you.  No, I don't believe freedom of religion is under attack today.  Thanks for your responses.  What are your hopes for America in the coming year?  So on Saturday, June 12th, you can sit down one on one with somebody.  I don't want to talk to somebody who disagrees with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Really?  Do you?  I do it here every week.  I know.  I don't have much choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm talking to Jeff right now.  Yeah, I guess we get our fill of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't want to talk to someone who disagrees with you because it's an impossible conversation?  Yeah.  What are you saying?  Because I think that's the difference of it all.  Well, it depends who they pick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if they pick somebody who thinks black people are inferior, Donald Trump won the election,  I don't want to have nothing to say to somebody like that.  Right.  And would you do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm going to Texas in two weeks.  Would you do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I don't bother with stuff like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Stacey, would you do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I already do this with my family and it's no fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've praised this from Germany and then when it actually came time to do it, I said, no.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is the, some would say this is the problem is that we are not talking to one  another.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And, but sometimes for good reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I'm sure that there are people who feel to like, I'm not going to talk to that atheist  liberal from California.  I don't want to hear from him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Maybe you'd meet someone very nice and find out that they're actually okay.  I'm sure they're nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As long as we don't talk about any of those issues.  I was thinking so.  I talked to people I disagree with all the time, but we can talk about the weather.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The other day I tweeted, pie is still better than cake.  Oh, don't get in there.  Don't go there.  And it just, it was just a fun conversation.  And what I enjoyed about it is people disagreed with me, but they, they weren't, they weren't  jerks about it.  You know, Hey, I disagree.  Here's why.  But yes, pie is good.  You can't get that nowadays in general.  If you have something that you, that you feel and someone disagrees with you, you are now  an idiot.  And I think that's the-  Well, our arguments are a lot higher stakes now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pie and cake is a low stakes argument.  Black people are inhuman.  It's a pretty high stakes argument.  It's a pretty high stakes argument.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now granted, yeah, that is a-  Or cacio e pepe from Trader Joe's and see what happens to you.  Pie and cake.  But, but what I'm saying is in general, people are going into, going to debate on a lot of  serious things, but it always devolves.  It always just turns into a pissing match essentially.  And nobody has ever heard.  And I can't, I don't want to do something like this because I've been in those rooms  where you're trying to talk to someone that has a different point of view from you and  they flat out don't want to hear it.  So what's the point of the conversation if they don't want to hear a daggum thing I got  to say anyway?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Play my, play my audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, sir.  I'd like to have an argument, please.  Sir, sir.  You've been here before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I love it.  No, this is my first time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My daughter and I used to run around splitting this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do you want to have the full argument or were you thinking of taking a course?  Well, what would be the cost?  Yes, it's one pound for a five minute argument.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I shouldn't play the whole thing because YouTube, I do.  You will get picked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it isn't just saying no it isn't.  Yes it is.  No it isn't.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Arguments and intellectual process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Contradiction is just the automatic game saying of anything the other person says.  No it isn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes it is.  Not at all.  No look.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, that was very good.  I think that's exactly what would happen with me if I went and talked to somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So today I was in a faculty meeting where things got a little...  Heated?  Well, no.  Spicy?  Difficult.  Difficult conversation time, right?  And so I have said something to somebody else, and somebody else said something to somebody  else, and one value member said, really brilliant.  And this is what I have to say, I'm tired of having this conversation.  And the person who started the Zoom accidentally at that moment killed the entire Zoom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh!  Oh!  Are you sure it was accidental?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, the one who talked had another power.  It was a mic drop.  It was a perfect Zoom drop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's fun.  There we have it.  Your number of the week...  No, it wasn't a number.  Your site of the week was...  Let's say it again.  americatalks.us.  In case you're one of the handful of people who actually want to stop somebody who disagrees  with them.  Ant, what's your pick of the week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's see.  Mine was something fun, and it's something I saw on Twitter, and I got 11 out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you know, I almost showed this the other day because of your tweet, and then I'm glad  you brought this back up.  What did you get?  I got 11.  Eleven?  It only goes to 10.  I got a nine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What?  But this is testing your lungs.  I think technically this tweet has this little revolving...  No, no, don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, I just want to say if you're watching this show, because there's no audio, but if  you're watching this, please don't do this.  I don't want you to pass out.  You won't pass out.  What do you mean you won't pass out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hopefully you decide to exhale if you can't hold your breath any longer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you exhale before you...  I mean, I probably could have gone to 10, but I might have passed out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you really get 11 and 10?  No, I got nine.  Do you see divers?  Are you competitive breath holding?  What's going on?  I'm pretty good at slowing down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If I were playing against Ant...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh.  I'm pretty good at slowing down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that what you do is you just let your body go and lose your body weight?  You just got to slow down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not going to do this.  But I wanted to challenge you all on that and see what you got, but that was my one pick,  and my other pick was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This, by the way, does come from a hospital, so I'm going to presume it's somewhat accurate,  although I'm not a fan of these kinds of tests because honestly, I think people could hurt themselves.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there are some people that do that, but again, exhale if you need to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Chat room, breathe, please. Breathe, okay?  Please.  Yes, don't stop breathing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Also, I was recently on another show called Behind the Shot where I was able to share one of my favorite shots,  actually my favorite shot that I captured in Shanghai, China a couple of years ago, and it's a long exposure.  I call it the Blue Ghost.  And yeah, it was a lot of fun talking about how I was able to capture that and put it together and just nerd out a little bit about photography.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's BehindTheShot.tv.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hosted by Mr. Steve Brazell.  Nice.  And before we go, this is May.  The month is almost over.  This is Mental Health Awareness Month.  I want everybody to remember that.  Don't forget that and take time to, if you need to take a break and have a vacation or staycation, do it.  Take care of yourself.  Get your mental health in order.  Thank you for always bringing that up, Matt.  And be a lot healthier, if you will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I bet you that it's now been a year since you've been with us because I remember you talking about this last May.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Have you been with us a year?  Well, no, it'll be two years in July, sir.  Are you kidding me?  It'll be three.  I thought you were the new guy.  Because we haven't been in the studio for a year.  So yeah, I thought you were the new guy.  Wow.  It's almost two years in July.  We were just talking about that here in the house because, you know, this is milestone time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was a big move for you guys to leave North Carolina and family and friends and come all the way out here on a fairly speculative job at Twit.  I'm eternally grateful to you for doing it.  You've been such an addition to the show.  I can't believe it's been almost two years.  That's incredible.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And this week, as of Friday coming up, senior hardhead will be a graduate.  I am pretty pumped up about it and can't wait.  You'll be shipping off for school here soon.  I'm still waiting on a way to get more money to pay for school.  But yeah, I'm pretty proud.  That's a big milestone.  Tell me the truth now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know this was difficult, a very challenging move I know for Queen Pruitt.  Did the boys adjust pretty well?  Are they happy they're out here now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look, I'm dead serious about this.  Before we even got to California, they already had friends here.  Wow.  We were in like Arizona somewhere and they're on Snapchat and talking to other people.  See? The internet's a wonderful thing.  Yeah.  And they were already popular before we even got here.  And when school started for them, they were just no big deal.  And they're just living it up.  I was a little worried.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's hard for kids, especially high school students, to leave everybody behind  and go to a new place, a strange place, a place very different from where they grew up.  So I'm very happy to hear that they did well and they're happy here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I went to four high schools in three states and four elementary schools in three states.  Was your dad in the service? Why did you move around?  No, he got out so he wouldn't move.  But at that time in America, back in the 20s, as you've been saying,  you were in sales management. They moved you around.  That's how you moved up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This also explains a lot about how weird I am.  It sure does.  But being a new kid can have its advantages, right?  Because you get a fresh start.  You get to start over.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I thought this was the right time.  I had to consider it, but I thought it was the right time because at the time,  the senior was a rising junior.  And I felt like, okay, that's enough time for him to get his feet wet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's better to have a couple of years instead of just one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. And then the now freshman, he was getting ready to go into the eighth grade.  So he was going to do that anyway.  Right. So it had been a rough about them.  How's yours doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  She's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. She moved from Austin to the Seattle area.  Yeah, she was a rising eighth grader like Aunt's kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good time to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She would disagree, but yes, it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  So she would say, oh, no, you ruined my life or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She was really devastated.  I mean, she had gone to the same school for kinder through,  it would have ended in eighth grade, but she had gone to that school since kindergarten.  That is a big disruption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  I moved to California from Providence when I was a sophomore in high school.  And I was very unhappy about the prospect of the move.  But once I was going to a boys school and as soon as I got to Santa Cruz High,  I realized there were certain benefits.  And I quickly got in California in the 70s.  I quickly got over my I never went but never looked back.  Actually, I still I love California.  It can be challenging, but I'm glad you know, this has been a very horrible year for kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They've done unbelievably well.  And I'm quite proud of both of them.  I'm quite proud of Queen Pruitt because again, like you said, it was hard because she's leaving her family behind.  Just like I left my family behind and she has a much tighter bond with their family than I did.  So I knew it was going to be difficult, but she's been able to just put her head down and keep herself occupied  and find things of interest and entertain and learn and grow.  And it's just it's been quite fascinating to watch.  I keep pushing out that film that I shot because it means a lot because I saw the growth in her and she saw the growth in her.  And when I presented it to her, I was like, we should we should share this.  We should put this out here because you just live this mess.  2020 was a mess for a lot of people and, you know, people that have mental health problems.  It's really, really, really hard.  But she she buckled down, as you say, and fought through it and just really grew up and got some stuff going for her right now that she's quite proud of with the I love the potheads.  Yeah, I love the potheads.  Potheads. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's her Etsy store?  Where can we?  She's taking it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She's going to end up putting it right on her own website.  I can't say that.  Not too bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She doesn't know somebody who could help her set that up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we're going to do that.  I am.  I am.  We're going to do that.  She's been at the farmers market and doing quite well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Please please let us know when she's got those for sale because I mean, there are people around here in bottom.  Great.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, you raise another really important point here, which is which is part of what I guess I was trying to say about my thank you, Dr.  The Internet is that we all have a lot to be proud of for having gotten through this year.  And it was tough and it was difficult.  And, you know, a lot of people had worse times than me.  I'm very privileged.  I have a job.  Right. That's what I say.  But, you know, people survived and they got through it and they struggled through it.  And I think everybody who has should be proud of themselves for what they've accomplished in this last year.  Good Lord, it's been no doubt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No doubt.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
