Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who was on the cyanogen mod team and now does clockwork mod helium and all cast  I haven't seen the show yet. Anything you want to share from that show? I mean, he's just great. I just think he said I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually have it. I have a queued up in my player. I haven't been able to watch it either  I had a busy day today. So I  But I was really really sad to miss it  Problem with having a one-year-old is that you get every single cold that her classmates at school get so  I'm excited. That's definitely I'm sure it's a great interview. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah last night's all about Android  So  Google I Oh, let's talk a little bit about that before we get into the news. It's coming up. We're excited about it end of June  Right everybody's gonna be there except not all of us  Google  Well, you know, I think it got to be very popular and this might be Google's fault a little bit because they keep giving away  So much stuff. Yeah that I think everybody wants to go and of course Google this is their developer conference  their strongest interest is in getting in people who are  You know Android and Google developers. Yeah. Yeah  Yeah, that's what the events for then there's press but but we but we you know, we warm up seats  and  Traditionally, we haven't had too much trouble getting in this year. They told us only two passes  So now we have a conundrum

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the only reason I'm included is because I applied  from saying twig was my

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Affiliation as as you should have now  I'm not gonna go I've already recused myself  Mostly because we're gonna cover it live and it's impossible to cover the keynote live if you're in the keynote  Unless you want to as I I did try once and it didn't work. Well  And now Larry's coming to the stage  He's brought his eight iron  So I'll stay home and we'll cover it live we'll do the live keynote of course  And then what we've done in the past and this works quite well is that Jeff and Gina would be in the event actually  Last year but but traditionally Jeff and Gina being the event and then rush up here and we do it this week in Google  Unfortunately, we can't get you both in

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, I I didn't make the I didn't get a press pass which I was okay with we got two and then I in my

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Solomon's almost som manic  Mode gave one to a G to a Jason Howell of all about Android. Yeah  You really wanted to go and then one to Jeff and the what I was hoping and this was our  This was our gamble is that you would apply as a developer  We'd pay for all of that but that you would get in as a developer because you are a developer  You're an Android developer to do dot-tex is an Android app

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, right. And and I went so I went through the application process which asked you, you know  Do you have an app in the Play Store? If so, what's the URL?  They they authorized the $900 on my credit card through Google Wallet because that's the cost the you know without charging you  And I thought okay, you know, I answered a few questions  I thought you know what I'm interested in that kind of thing and I thought okay  I probably I maybe it seems like I should have a good shot if

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look at all that stuff or is it totally random?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean why well, I mean why would they ask if you had an app in the Play Store if they didn't look at it?  So I thought I had a good shot, but I did they ask if you have the most listened to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Show about Google in the entire world. Did they ask that they didn't ask?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, see they should they need a new field on the field

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Two of the most listen to shows all about Android is easily the number one Android show in the nation in the world  And this is about the only show about Google in the world. So we went on that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you think anything from Google watches a show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's the irony of that is that nobody at Google watches this show or is  Has any idea we even exist apparently apparently not I would really like to get you know, you know  I was really I was totally willing to pay the 900 bucks. I wasn't the problem at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everybody stands here. Let's be clear here. Gene is getting in no matter what I'm transferring my past to Gina  Well, I hold on mr. Gallant, but but I know he's being so gentlemanly we want to have the show there  We want to Gina and I are a Google couple  To split apart this Google marriage. We're willing to cross countries and time zones  We are ready to fly out coach for God's sakes  To see this thing. I actually I actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I  Don't know what I was gonna say. You're not gonna fly coach  I actually would give you my pass Gina if I if I had one but I don't so  Don't think it's just Jeff is the only person that would do that. No, you're both very go on. I gave Jeff my

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't want the audience going after me and saying charters is going and not Gina

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the reason we want to go of course is because we want to give you the best possible coverage  Yes, and they might give away a watch

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll admit I kind of want the watch, you know, it's funny  I have really mixed feelings about this because on one hand I'm sad that I didn't that I didn't get in but on the other  Kevin and I did this whole episode of in beta talking about these big developer shows and how they how they had turned into these  Press events people who got in rolling people who had money and who were there that two minutes when the registration was open  so a part of me that's really kind of glad that Google's cracking down on press and making the the  Application process for developers, you know a lot more sort of equal opportunity  Like I'm all for that the rest of the great and the other developers you're different. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just want to say that if if Google smart they will give no swag away at this year's Google I o and they will never  Have this problem again  the  People half the number of people's time

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're gonna spend the money and go to the effort to go to this are gonna be those who care right as it was  This story somewhere down on the rundown today about Google class and somebody like Google person said  We charge fifteen hundred bucks because we wanted people who are serious about yeah, so Google should have been serious by this  I agree, but but you know in all in all truth by being there last year  I really did absorb a lot that affects our coverage through the year  I mean I understood more about about Android strategy and  Chrome strategy and voice strategy and all these other things and  And to get around to hang around with the people who actually do this stuff for dumb old me is really useful I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  do I do have to say that I  Don't I'm what's happening to my brain. I don't know. I can't remember what I had to say was seconds ago  I do have to say that we will cover it no matter what and that all of these developer conferences are huge  mostly because of the success of I  Mean because of things like whatsapp I mean if you want to make money in the tech business these days you're an app developer  You're developing either for iOS or Android  WWDC and Apple does not know does not give away anything to developers WWDC same issue  So, you know the signups go instantly  They just can't make these big enough now to Google's credit. The entire thing is streaming, right?  So if you're a developer  What you lose is the is the press the flesh the meeting people the connections you make but the content is available to you  instantly, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This way I think is really part of it. It has sort of become like Oprah's Christmas special, you know  Yeah, where it's not just fans  It's the folks that want to get get the stuff and look I'll admit I'm part of that  I if they're giving away to watch I I want my hands, you know on the watch first, right?  It'll be a prototype and won't be out to everyone yet and I'm a developer and I'll get to develop not only in a simulator  But on an actual piece of hardware that would be amazing if there's gonna be a low-powered nexus if they're you know  Whatever that they have kind of up their sleeves, of course, I want access to that  So there's that part of it and and I'll admit being part of that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Listen I've proven I'll buy anything they make you know Jesus  And we know this yeah Chromebook, you know, I can I prove that  So  That's not the issue but but two years ago when you guys went sorry there go my lights  And you got even though it didn't really turn into a product what was the round thing the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The nexus Q the queue, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, that's what made me jealous is because you had something that no one else had and never got  I wanted to play with it and understand what their brain was what they were thinking  That's the more valuable piece of the swag not a shame is I'll buy Google. I'll buy it  I'll be buying the Nexus 8 if you do it. I'll buy all your stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's that you want it soon, right?  As well

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I bought the damn glass. I bought the darn lenses. I mean really how far do I have to go?  I wrote a book about you. Come on, babe. Come on

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't want to spend too much of the show begging but there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  nice, so  Bastards bastards. I'm gonna go to investor dot stock dot or investor dot Apple comm

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the the chat room says  Apple raising share buyback from 90 billion to 90 billion from 60 billion  There's a link in the chat room to tech crunch on the split

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Seven for one stock split boosts that's a percent. I've heard of two for one. That's what Google just did  I've heard of three for two

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Seven to one but here's the here's the funny thing after Google's split  Apple stock Google has been Google's been falling. It's only  Thirteen dollars away from Apple being the higher price than Google you think I want to get there first and then split

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So these are the the Apple quarterly earnings are coming in for fiscal  q2  43.7 million iPhone 16.3 million iPads  4.1 million max  That's a draw a significant drop in iPhones by the way was 51 million again  They went from 51 million in the first quarter to 43.7 million in the second quarter big drop  Went from 26 million iPads in the first quarter to 16 million in the second quarter big drop

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Isn't that a normal though q2 it is because but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's fiscal so q1 is is the calendar fourth quarter. It's the Christmas quarter, right?  so yes, there is always a drop but that seems like a  significant  drop now year to year  It's not so bad year to year and so the second quarter is often a bad quarter  Last year was 37.4 million iPhones this year 43. So they're up. It's not up a year over year  However, last year was 19 million iPads and this year was 16 million  So iPhones are up year over year, but the iPads and some analysts have said the iPad sales have been slowing  They did beat Wall Street's estimates. So that's always that's always a good thing  How did any and I go put it yesterday on that break weekly was funny  He says it's like if though if if you polled  Sports analysts about what the finishing time would be in the Boston Marathon and the guy came in won it  But came in six seconds below their analysts  He said if they if they had if they had estimated that he would come in third they would punish him for coming in first  Right. He didn't make us to failed analyst estimates  iPod sales, you know, yeah now pretty bad 2.7 million iPods. I'm amazed. They're selling any  Yeah, there was no iPod update year over year performance and that's I guess what you really should count is a iPhone growth of  16.8% an iPad drop of  And that's I think signs that maybe the tablet market has has reached its what's what's the what's the concomitant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Android tablet sales. I  Don't know  Now I wonder if they're losing business to to Android

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I doubt it very much but will but we could check into that we will check into that now this maybe in the call  I don't know  I'm trying to find this rumor of the stock split. Maybe they mentioned something in the call  Or maybe the chat room is just punking us  No, there's no crunch nope from Reuters Apple buy expands buybacks by 30 billion you mentioned that and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  announces a 7 for 1 stock split and boosts dividend 8%

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow  which is to say that the  Sharks got to him. I think a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Rarely seen 7 for 1 stock split. So their stock was what around 500. So I know it's oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's hold on brings it down well below a hundred by 24 75

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the idea of a stock so it doesn't really change the the capitalization of the company in any way  Because you cut the stock price by the factor of the split  but what it does do is make the individual shares more affordable in this thinking is that  Well, if it's more affordable, you know if somebody wants to buy one share for their kid they can and no well now you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can buy an iPad and get a share?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really no

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a good idea though. Yes. You start to own the company. Yeah, that's good. That's a great promotional device

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, do you think it was activist stockholders that he gave into

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah, and I think that the problem remains with I mean why am I getting trouble for saying this?  Oh the letters I get by the way folks by the way folks. It's nice that you send email. I got enough email  I can't deal with email. I can't deal with all the people  You but we just can't don't send me email about what I'm about to say but has Apple lost its mojo  I mean we haven't seen major development from them. We haven't seen major innovation from them  They've got to satisfy Wall Street at some point Wall Street's gonna say what have you done for me lately

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you know, it's funny that you should say that because  I I don't buy tech stock  So this is purely an academic conversation  But I was gonna ask Lisa this morning. Have you ever shorted stock because I think it's time to short Apple  And maybe that's this is a response to that I'm raising the raising the dividend certainly  Helps sell stock and buying it back shows your confidence in your stock

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, it has something really interesting to say in in Twitter yesterday  Which is of course where he says everything and and he said that the whole bubble conversation going on in tech  He said activists come in when they see things that are undervalued

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's no bubble in tech. I don't believe that. Yeah, I don't think there ever has been a bubble in tech  So there's a belief that Apple is undervalued right now. Yeah, maybe but I think it's overvalued  Personally, but I agree with you. Yeah  Tim Cook did make his quarterly pronouncement that there are new products coming

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, he said quote and this is a Neelai Patel quoting the wire story

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're eagerly looking forward to introducing more new products and services that only Apple could bring to market  Why only Apple we don't know  Because only Apple can make an iPhone  Because only Apple can make an iPhone  first

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  TV no

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  More new products and service services is interesting. I don't know what services they're talking about  No, I think what they're talking that if they announce new iPhones this year he will have satisfied the new products, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but but well, but then  You know Rowy we make the screen bigger with me the screen as well  So so an iPhone with a bigger screen is not innovation  It's red and you know same problem with Android phones. How are you gonna beat?  your own prior  In a story here and how are you gonna come up with something that's new and innovative in?  phones

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nevertheless Apple had a very another record-breaking quarter in terms of profits and revenues  iPad sales slow, but iPhone fo sales increased and  a 7-1 stock split and increased their and full disclosure. I have Apple stock  But it's probably not enough to make you a wealthy man, I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have Apple and Google stock

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We should mention Apple and Google and Amazon and I saw other full disclosure is I sold Microsoft

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm really tempted. I don't know even how you shortest stock, but I'm just I feel like well now's the wrong time

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Obviously that kind of statement says a lot though. If you don't know how to do it  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't know what is this shorting a stock thing it always sounded interesting to me. Can I make a margin call?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hmm yeah, you're right. It's margin maybe not a good idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe not a bad idea  Anyway, there's the there's the latest  From Apple. How about the latest from?  Facebook first quarter results for Facebook also out. Oh  Revenue two and a half billion up 72 percent Wow  Wow  I guess we're not short in Facebook stock revenue from advertising up 82 percent  Wait a minute who's  Wow, what are the revenue they have?  Revenue was 2.5 billion mobile versus desktop sales  It's all advertising. Yeah, what is that other quarter of a billion? What is it? Where does that come? Yeah, I  Don't know  Daily users  Monthly active users 1.28 billion people  That's a neat number to say anything over a billion is active users every month one and a quarter billion people use Facebook  Mobile daily active users 609 million Wow daily active users users overall 802 million  so  Mobile went up a lot 43 percent year over year

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does daily really mean daily we mean every day of the month every day?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Every day 609 people use Facebook on mobile

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  802 million use Facebook on mobile newspapers run 12 page views per user per month and so visits per  uses per month

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Often one to three one to four. Yeah, but this is users. This is any you know, this could be 20 pages

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know what I'm saying amazing newspaper, which we supposedly depend upon for a healthy society

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mobile advertising revenue. This is the metric. I think everybody looks at with Facebook  This is the thing they had to figure out you had to solve how do we get mobile advertising to work?  You know, they obviously licked it on the desktop  But how do we get mobile advertising to work mobile advertising revenue 59% of the total advertising revenue is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Incredible double what it was last year double and they're in the caparazzi there because Google is  Facing a you know  You mentioned last year lower yield on advertising because it goes to mobile  So their picture can only look kind of worse in some ways because Facebook hadn't figured it out  Their pictures only gonna look better and I don't know what the comparative yield is or any of that  But Facebook is only going up

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Confirmation that the CFO is stepping down. We knew that he's been there five years. He'll be succeeded by David  David Warner David Ebersman is being succeeded by David Wenner who is currently vice president corporate finance

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is like that moment on on on the Oscars when the accountants come out most people just couldn't possibly care who the CFO

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Abercrombie and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fritchberg  So very interesting. They're having a conference call right now or will in ten minutes, I guess  To talk about it, but very good  Very I mean boy  You couldn't get much better than that in terms of Facebook results  So the two the two big quarterly results we expected today both Apple and Facebook doing what was really?  Like even for Facebook does it say there? I haven't I don't see that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sorry, I keep asking these stupid questions that are you do research. What do you want? What do you want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Come on  So both Facebook and  Apple yeah Facebook beat the  estimates  1 billion users on small screens  Its quarterly earnings show at be expectations earning 2.5 billion  34 cents per share  Wall Street expected 2.3 6 billion and 24 cents per share so a significant beat on Wall Street  I don't I know we're supposed to report this  But I don't understand why it matters what some guys  Guessed compared to what the actual result was because it's only because  What the stock will do next is whether that was built in I understand

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What the stock will do next is whether that was built in I understand

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, that's right. So stocks go up. That's right. Yeah  The daily active users are is mind-boggling and there's there's a breakdown here  By  Geography and so if you look at this graph, let me make it as big as I can here  If you look at this graph and for those of you listening, I'll kind of describe it  US growth is fairly flat US and Canada is the dark stuff at the bottom from  2012 to 2014 two years it went from 129 million daily active users to 150 million active users  The big growth is in Asia  massive growth 119 million to 216 million  Somewhat less in Europe, but still growth there and the rest of the world  Big growth there. So that's what you want to see if you're Facebook you want to see

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, big international great, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This does explain the drones boy does it ever been I wasn't yeah because because if he gets that kind of level of daily  Daily usage finding a way to give away the access fine  Come on folks

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll be listening with interest to see you know a little more detail things like young people versus older people things like that  Boy  It'd be hard pressed to find any bad news in this

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the proportion of US usage now is what like on that chart Leo if you do it proportionally

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's you know, it looks like a 150 of 802. Yeah, it's it's what is that? It's not it's  Ain't no American company no more. It's like 25. That's not even 25%  Notice how good we are at math. It's between 20 and 25

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, it's less than 20. I'm sorry. It's it's less than 20% Wow  I always think my staff wait a minute. Wait a minute  Let me get my wrap by less than 20% of Facebook users are in the US and Canada

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so all the you were that we hear here all fit you ever talk about Facebook anymore. None of us doesn't matter  doesn't matter  Meaningless  This is an international global company global usage  Which has always been part of Mark's vision

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Less let me say this again fewer than 20% of Facebook users are in the US and Canada  80% something like 82% of all Facebook users are outside  US and Canada Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What?  Know that that explains whatsapp as well  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My friend Rafa Ali now founder of skiff says that every single member of his family is on whatsapp everybody in India  Yeah, that's because of text messaging being in fact. I saw some great pictures from India of women wearing  Sorry's with the whatsapp logo on it  Those wonderful really beaded things that they do in India. There's a wonderful with the whatsapp logo on it  It's part of the culture Wow

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  More than 80% of Facebook usage is outside the US  you know Facebook is quite amazing because  Every single market it's entered is just suddenly you know taken over so it started at Harvard and  Dominated within a few days it dominated the Harvard student body writing. There's like instant then they go to all the ivies  You know they open up to all the universities in the ivy league and it's immediately and then they open to all universities  Almost immediately dominant then they open the United States almost you know  There's just astounding growth and the same thing seems to have happened globally you know what we need to do is discover some more planets

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no what he's doing is discovering new apps, and I think it's very a whatsapp is very telling B  He was interviewed at the New York Times by Farhad Manjoo. I thought that was a great  Oh, it's a very good interview and most telling thing to me was but mark is breaking up the app and  And as I thought about that I'm thinking about that in my context for journalism  We think everybody's gonna come to our our big thing that gives you everything you need right, but but think about how you use Google  I go to things that are appropriate to the use. I could do a right do gmail over here  I do maps over there. I do this over there. I do over that of that right  So what's happening with Facebook? I do friends stuff here. I do photos there. I do chatting here  And and so you start to break up not because these become wholly new worlds  But because they're appropriate to the context of my life and what I'm doing at this minute

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He says we're unbundling the big blue app exactly that's that's really important

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what is he really in marks genius huge vision?  He's people connecting so he's always wanted to be that's what he's doing every way get people connect. That's where he is  Google is about people getting information and  They're trying to do that every way damn way they can and if they each hold true to that vision  They each have good, you know incredible good businesses

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What we want to do is build a pipeline  This is Mark Zuckerberg talking to Farhad Manju in the Times what we want to do is build a pipeline of experiences for people to have  It would be a mistake to compare any of them in different life cycles to other ones. They're in different levels. They're all different and  You know, it's really interesting because in  There does seem to be there two different thing trends you see one is to bundle everything into all in one, right?  Like let's make the mobile phone do everything  right the mobile phone was condensing an iPod a phone a  Computer into one item and it seemed the conventional wisdom was yeah people just want one item  But then you look at software you look at Unix where the philosophy is  Do one thing well one thing well  But and very important you can chain them together to do one bigger thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, and you can have a relationship across them, right?  Which is also the strategy so Mark doesn't even care about the Facebook brand necessarily some of these things will not be called Facebook  So making truly a platform development  The other thing you can see about mark is when he opened up Facebook to outside the developers and that that worked  It then didn't work right? But what is paper?  Paper is saying there's a basis here of content and relationships and you can build an  Incredible new app on top of that the same thing that Facebook is built on and you get an entirely different experience from it  And so what ties it together it's you it's these companies knowledge about you as a person if we can get past all the creepy stuff and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it services so once again if you understand this  Gina this idea of we'll do one thing well, but then create a pipeline and  And Zuck is obviously he's a programmer. He knows you next well. He knows Linux well, so when he says now  Let's let's let's hear that quote again  What we want to do is build a pipeline of experiences for people to have  Yeah, so what is Facebook?  It's a bunch of different apps, but we are the pipeline

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're the unit he the key though to the unix pipe is that it can pass data, right?  And so now if you if you look at Google they're a little farther along than Facebook right and Google had all these sort of different  Different apps right and then they introduced the unified privacy policy  That said that these apps can share this this data across them and and we're getting better better experiences out of that like Google now  Facebook isn't there yet right like Instagram and whatsapp those those those data sources or at least with whatsapp  They're saying that that data is not shared back to Facebook right that they're not mixing that data that doesn't seem like very very

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's true  But does he need to Gina in the case of Google Google lives and dies on relevance and relevance means knowing you and knowing what you want  Who you are and all this stuff about you right Facebook if it's just connecting you appropriately to the app  Does does what you do in whatsapp really have to be that tied to Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  listen to what he says because then Monju asks him about anonymity about snapchat and  So forth he says do you expect Facebook will do things with the anonymity because of course anonymity is  Antithetical to this idea of let's share all the data across the pipeline mark says I don't know I do think more private  Communication is a bigger space than people  realizing  But anonymity is different. I'm not gonna say it can't work  Because I think that's too extreme, but I tend to think some of these interactions are better rooted in some sense of building  Relationships which is what he really believes he wants  It happens to coincide with his business model, but yeah  There are different forms of identity you can use to form a relationship  You can use your real identity you can use phone numbers for something like whatsapp  Pseudonyms for something like Instagram, but in any of those you're not just sharing consumer content  You're building relationships with people and building an understanding of people. That's core to how we think about the world  So and this is the important point and an anonymity is not the first thing we'll go do  It or ever do  He did do poke which was like snapchat, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  uh  Was it poke was anonymous you could anonymously

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Know right no because it was your Facebook entity, but you could get but didn't the don't did the things disappear after time  I don't know. I never used it. Nobody did  And it no longer exists no longer exists, so who cares  Farhad said you get it you're 30  Do you feel like you're in touch with the younger audience?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, so here's another question for you if your Twitter is bored and you look at those results, what are you thinking?  Where does Twitter fit into that we know what Google is we know what Facebook is I think there's a really significant issue for Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  which is  that  What was it 40% of people on Twitter never post ever?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  mmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now on the other hand I'm watching last night. I'm watching the voice and  You know how those shows used to do text us with a hashtag or rather with your vote  now they just use Twitter hashtag save lear or whatever her name is and  Boy, that's brilliant. It's good for Twitter. It's good for the show

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know these newspapers, I don't know only 1% of the people who touch them ever ever write anything

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is Twitter a newspaper is it so I guess that's what it is right  Say blogger how many people read blogger versus how many people write on blogger and that that doesn't bother me  and I think I think Twitter hasn't done something necessarily done a good job of  answering that back publishing platforms are

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Historically always have been more read than written, but I thought that the idea of Twitter was it was a more egalitarian  Military and

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Much more yes more much much more right than any publishing platform ever

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah  I mean if 60% of users who read a newspaper were printing stuff putting something in the newspaper  That would be a very different kind of newspaper. So you're right 60% of Twitter users post  Although the 40% we don't know how many of those are real. That's another issue with Twitter is  Yeah, a huge number of we see we seem it seems to be fake accounts

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they do a guy I think they do a good job  The funny thing is when I see one I  Report it all the time constantly partly because it gets it gets it out of my feed  But also because it's so easy to do  And I don't see that many I  Mean, that's me  but I  Think they kill them pretty well. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they probably do they do an okay job  I don't know I have my doubts about how quickly they could they or they have the capacity to actually kill  accounts that are

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Accounts that you do analysis on that Gina on on how many?  Users you blocked or it will know is there. Yeah, is there a way kind of to see  Based on blockings how many fake accounts seem to pop up in people's feeds?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean you'd have to collect your data kind of over time  Like I've got a pretty big database of Twitter users at this point  I've been running think up for many years and so at some point, you know, you  You check the user and it's suspended. It doesn't exist anymore  So you can do that kind of analysis kind of after the fact  But you have to be collecting those users and a kind of over time and then checking back in on them  And there's that there isn't an easy way right now to say what happened to the users that I blocked  But I was just having this conversation on Twitter recently with with a couple women who are being harassed and who are blocking  People then asking their friends to block these got these, you know people users who are harassing them  And by the time I had seen the conversation which was the next day they actually were suspended which make me really happy  Yeah, but they were complaining like oh, you know, there's there's no way  You know, there's no way for just a regular user who doesn't have a ton of followers who isn't verified  You know who's getting harassed to really get you know  Sort of get Twitter's attention because there's just you know, so many of these that just you know  You know, I was

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was thinking about this the other day because I have adopted a new policy that if anybody says something  I don't mind criticism on Twitter, but I was getting you know, such ugly stuff on Twitter  I just decided if somebody says something really ugly about me. I just block them so I don't I don't see it  I mean others still can but I don't see it  Right and when I realized is if I block about and it's only about 15 people  Twitter is a wonderful place. All of a sudden. It is a small small percentage of the total  that can occupy so much of  The content by just tweeting a lot  And I just I have a much better experience on Twitter  So I encourage people block block block now getting somebody blocked  Globally on Twitter. That's another matter. I don't take those signals seriously. I'm sure  Yeah, but I don't even care about that. I've you know, I mean I believe in the person's right to say bad things about Leo  I just want to read it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it if a tree falls in the forest and no one?  If a troll if a troll falls in a forest no one hears him does it matter  So so those women who have been harassed on Twitter it wouldn't be it's not sufficient for them to just block it so they  Don't see it  Or is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's a couple things I mean  I mean sometimes it's like they're getting doxxed or they're getting you know harassing pictures and it's not it's not just enough to say  I don't want to see this anymore. It's it's it's straight up like this person should be banned  I don't want anybody to have to see this as anyone else to see this right?  so so there's that and you know a lot of is just  You know this feeling of that there should be consequences for for harassing, you know for harassing speech  And you know, look the lines around that are really are really blurry and you know what constitutes, you know criticism versus harassment versus  You know what's considered a legal threat?  But I think I think there's definitely some frustration I think that that sometimes it feels like Twitter errs on the side of you know  protecting  harassers over the people getting harassed  Like when they change their block policy and they actually wound up reverting the change they changed it so that  You know, you wouldn't see the person harassing you but the person harassing you could still see your stuff  And it was kind of like protecting the harasser versus the victim and then and then and then Twitter reverted it  So it's tricky. It's tricky. It's hard  It's not an easy problem to solve  Yeah, it is and it's really easy just make another Twitter account and harass person right from another name

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know see our story last week about about you know, the trolls really are as little sick say this they're saying this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's so easy to block people at least in tweet bot. I just I've it's given me great satisfaction and now I don't ever see any

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm very liberal. I'm very liberal

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've always said that be liberal with your following and even more liberal with your unfollowing and or blocking and you can you can create a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Twitter feed that's marvelous and I gotta tell you I mean I follow a lot of people I follow over a thousand people  But I have this private list of people whose tweets, you know  None of you know, I just don't want to miss and even just kind of changing that up  I mean, oh I have to play with that in real life  And I use was just who are just like really just loud or noisy or just whatever annoying on Twitter  I just move them out of my list and they kind of fly by

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that makes a much much better experience. I need to do that because I follow more than 2,000 people on Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I guess it's unusable that level. Yeah, I have a I have a public media walks list and  That's my main list. I have some other lists too, but that's my main one and those are the ones that I want to miss

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I have lists. I just I never

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Something to Dunbar's number like I really think that there is a limit to how many people you can really pay attention to and  Keep a narrative in your head about

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  On the other hand, I just love these the kind of the serendipity of just having a  2,000 person  Twitter stream where it's just you know, there's all sorts of stuff flying by and then fly and I love that  I mean, it's just you know, I never know what I'm gonna see  It's just fun  So but that's why you do it in a list instead of unfollowing. I like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm gonna create some lists because there's the social convention if you unfollow someone it's you know  Folks get upset and some people I want to follow and I just want to follow casually  I just want to kind of want to dip in and out what I want  I don't need to hear every single tweet about their cat or whatever. Does somebody know if you've blocked them is that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do they get a message you were just blocked? No, probably not. I don't believe so. Maybe that would help

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I feel like that would in the case of a troll or  Grief or something that would really aggravate the person. Yeah, you probably motivate them to make another account

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let them just shout into the into the darkness. Yeah, exactly. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Although I believe if you block someone then they can't follow you so then so then they do know  Right because they'll just stop seeing your stuff. So actually they do know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  by the way  Jeff to kind of sort of answer your question not about iPads, but about Macintosh's  I'm watch I'm monitoring the Tim Cook's  phone call right now Apple get is gaining PC market share and  Making OS 10 Mavericks free led to the largest ever percent of installed Mac  Users using the latest version so because PCs are dying. Yeah, so that's so they're going up even though everybody else

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, everybody's going down. Here's here's another question about the mobile numbers for Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  These two-thirds of iPad users are new to iPad two-thirds of iPad  Buyers are new to iPad half of iPhone buyers are new to iPhone. That's very those are very good numbers  That's what you want. That is good. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've talked mobile mobile too often mobile includes tablets. I think that's the misnomer because you're sitting on your couch  So are the mobile numbers for Facebook is does that indicate that some proportion of people just aren't even using laptops now  They're using tablets. Yeah, or the same time you're saying the tablet sales are kind of going down and I  Don't know how to read that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just me. I mean you look you have a desktop. I have a desktop you have a desktop Gina  But when we go on Facebook two-thirds of the time we do it on our phone or a tablet  Yeah, or a tablet, but I guess I would guess phone. I uninstall the app

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just use the web view now on Android because I can't deal with all those permissions  You're right, okay, it asks for everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It asks for it wants the world web browser works. Yeah, that's a really interesting point  The new app is getting getting more and more stripped down. You know, they're taking messages out  It's getting simpler and simpler and simpler breaking up the big blue app. Yeah, they really they really are doing that  and and so in a way, it's kind of nice because it's it's a  It's very clean and simple. So the essence of Facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If he has all these other apps out there the essence of Facebook itself big bum of Facebook is what?  managing friend  That's a good question content but communicating you're gonna do elsewhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would say the news feed has been up to now the heart of it, right? But yes. Yes. Yeah, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Think it I think that that becomes the heart of it is that's it's Facebook is content and  And

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  communication is other things that makes it but what I should also point out is that  Facebook dominates in social login, you know the Facebook Connect versus saying Google Plus  It's Facebook and that's that is more a measure of how you're I think that's kind of the future of Facebook, right?  It's the connector. It's the pipeline

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's also just because Facebook Connect I think was first to market with that and it's so damn convenient

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well when I'm given the choice I always use Google instead of Facebook, yeah, I would forgive the choice

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's rare that I see the choice  That's interesting. I've got to get a new light

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Although I gotta say on Android the Google login is is obviously way easier, right?  It just does it it just does it right? You don't have to do anything else

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but doesn't Facebook do the same thing? Well, you don't know because you don't have the app

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It just it pops open a web view and I have to log in or whatever

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but see that's that's not easy but if you have the app installed  You can use both about equally easily  I think it will just it does give you permissions and you do okay. I don't remember what Google does  I guess it does the same thing. It says allow you have to allow it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it'll ask you what permissions and you say allow I've got two Google accounts  On my phone. So it'll ask me which one I tap which one and then I'll say this game usually it's games these days  But you know what, you know, we want to post your circles you just private to you to keep this app  Know your email address and you just like okay and you're good to go

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's take a break we're gonna come back with more Gina Trippani Jeff Jarvis  We're talking  By anything we want to talk about I don't even know how I'd quantify this now quarterly results  Facebook Google Twitter  Do we answer do we talk about did we really answer that question what's the central experience of Facebook?  The news feed right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's for now, but not for the long term. I don't think Facebook is just like about that social sixth sense  You know, it's like sort of knowing what's going on with my acquaintances in a way that I wouldn't have beforehand  Our show today brought to you by

Transcript:  Speaking of design, I like that design a lot. Isn't it great? Yeah, it is. Yeah, that's great. Apparently google according to an interview

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  uh with john constein at tech crunch  Google's gonna focus on design at the google io this year  What what's with the big sigh  What is with the big sigh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because if you have to announce that you're focusing on design, I love you google  You know that I do but if you have to announce you're gonna focus on design  but  I hate to be critical, you know, uh marco actually did a post on this. Um, and you know, whatever marco is marco  He's very pro apple and not not so generous with the google  But I gotta say I think he was kind of spot on here and i'm I don't know  I might be risking my chance at a google io pass  but it just it feels  I don't think that you can  Have uh, you know a thrust on design one particular cycle of development, right?  Like that just has to be embedded in your in your whole entire process and in the values of the company  And I don't think that google's there  I think that they're getting there  But I don't know when I saw that they're gonna, you know focus on design at io part of me thought  Oh, that's great. And another part of me thought like  Like design has to be part of every single. Um, io every single product

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Every bit of development and I I think design is one of the most overused words right now  I hear it constantly what it means often to people is let's get out the post-it notes  Uh design thinking oh, I hate design thinking. Yeah. Yeah, right  And and design thinking and design I think are not only separate things one one is one is  Use and aesthetics and the other one is listening to people and listening to people is a good thing  It's an input  But everybody's gone nuts saying it's all about design design design and I think it's being overused now it comes to mean less  However, somebody who believes in this told me a few weeks ago that ibm is hiring designers like crazy  I think I said this on the show because they think that the technology is going to get easier and easier  But but experience is what matters you can

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Experience you can you can blame?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  idio and david kelly for all of this stanford d school. Yeah  um, so idio kind of  It's hard for me not to be cynical about it  Running having run out of people for whom it could design actual things for it decided the design applies to everything we do in life  And we know how to do it. It's just expanding the market. Yeah, you're right  I  What does that mean? I have mixed feelings about this  well, you know, it does look basically idio and and I think it's primarily kelly, but  their thinking was  The principles of design should be applied  To everything including how an organization is run  How meetings are run?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How you experience buying a hamburger?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everything whatever everything and the example they use it's a good example is uh  If you're designing a hospital you better lie on a gurney and look at the ceiling  Because that's what your patients are seeing  And that's a good point  I don't think it's a bad point  but then then i've been in these these meetings, uh, or these sessions where they oh, yeah design thinking and it's  I don't know. It feels a little cultish frankly. It's weird

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean isn't design just a code word for thoughtfulness and empathy. Yeah, and they've got a methodology

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Basically, they have a methodology that they want you to use  And it's very it's good. It's brainstorming and free form and how to then incorporate that into actual planning and I guess it's okay  I'm i'm i'm allergic to some of that stuff. I'm like a new yorker in that regards to kelvin when it becomes jargony

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I think I think there's something to it  I mean i'm doing a lot of work now in engagement and journalism and listening to the community before you think you know what they need  Um, that's the essence of design thinking it's it's it's cultural anthropology. It's watching people. It's it's discerning their needs  I agree with all that but you're right. I think I think really putting it in this in this marketing shell  um  Turns it into a  cliche written

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hype  so, uh marco writes, uh  The idea that google needs to attract designers to win against ios is misguided at best  A software platform's ui and design ethos can't be changed on a whim by conference sessions and a marketing push. It's it's  deeply ingrained  Built over the platform's entire lifespan and very slow to change see I would disagree with marco in that respect  Because the first android phones were an uh, admittedly a nightmare  Um, you know fonts for different sizes icons were weird and everything was everything felt very cobbled together  but over time  Android has become much more polished and that's because google has pushed it there  I think holo and everything that they've done  They have set a tone and a standard just as apple did by the way marco the reason apple's got is because apple imposed it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  From day one with a macintosh. I would argue and i'll get an email about this too, but don't bother people  Uh is the single best design?  In the history of the net was the original google homepage  There you go  Here's a box the world's behind it was designed that was undesigned. Yeah, exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And and marco says the thing that has become a cliched cant

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh android's best apps usually aren't as good as ios's best apps  Because and this is the part I disagree with people who value and demand the best apps overwhelmingly choose ios

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's really old-fashioned thinking that's not true anymore. That's well, we're better than you because we have iphones  That's just that's just so marco

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no, he's wrong about that  But but I do think that he's right about the about about design being part of the culture from the beginning and androids approach  Is so different than apple right it was like put it out even if it's dirty and broken and we'll fix it later  Whereas apple would be like if it's not ready. It doesn't go out, right?  We're not going to put out copy and paste until we have it perfectly right and you're just going to live without copy and paste

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know the difference there is we're going to define what right is versus google says the public's going to find what right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's I think the fundamental difference apple's willing to be totally authoritarian  Yes, absolutely and google is not google says well, we want choice  And we're not willing to say to lay down the law  We will encourage people to use holo, but we won't make them use holo and we'll and we'll have it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We'll have a methodology of ab testing  And we listen to signals we're data driven. That's what was we're data driven apple says we're steve's driven  We're you know, I mean that's and there and there lies. It's it's we it's strength and now it's weakness  There lies the reason for a several one stock split and a buyback and a dividend up

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although as we found out in the samsung apple trial and the revelations there  Apple did in fact use focus groups. They they encouraged the opinion the feeling that it was all steve, but they in fact did some research

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They didn't say maybe researching these guys do do

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ethnographic research. Yeah  That's part of the process is to watch people in their environments and what they do and try to solve problems and that's  That's a form of listening. It's just I for one choose the free form

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  sometimes messy  Google way over the authoritarian way  Yes, the trains run on time, but it's not a it's not a good feeling

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go ahead. I think there's I think both approaches have their have their strengths and weaknesses and you have your choice  Yeah, yeah, I mean I know a lot of designers who would say, you know designing by data is is insane  You know that I forget the name of that designer who was at google and said, you know  They they ab tested every shade of blue, right?  Whereas as a designer I couldn't say this is the right time, you know, so  I see I see both sides there and their strengths and weaknesses weaknesses to both  um  But yeah, no design was definitely not at the forefront of google's mind when they were pushing out android part of that is because  They were doing it after the iphone  Um, and um, and that's just that's not part of their plan. What's up, too? Yeah, they're playing catch up

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there are a lot of different factors and by the way go to go to play.google.com  And what is on the front page of the google store the nest one of the most beautiful designed  Things ever and google bought the company. Yeah, um, I think google doesn't hate design google loves elegant beautiful stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh definitely right one of the few products that's in both the play store and and the apple store as well. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, isn't that interesting I wonder how long that'll last yeah google of course owns nest  I bought three nests at the apple store not so long ago

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which are now bookends. Yeah, I don't use them anymore

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And when we moved I didn't bother installing them because I didn't find it made that much of a difference  And I really hated anything turning on the heat without my say so  Yeah  I just don't like the idea of a smart thermostat nuts and by the way  I noticed google's not selling the smart smoke detector  I think venture beat got this wrong, but maybe not they say google is researching ways to put encryption in gmail  this article by harrison weber  Says that in response to edward snowden's mass surveillance revelations  Google's working on a way to put pgp into email. This is from a source at google  Uh vent they say venture beats source at google acknowledged that end-to-end encryption is the best defense for message protection  We know that though it comes at considerable cost and functionality  I don't think it comes at a cost of functionality to the end user. Just it's it's a pain in the ass to implement  The cost of functionality is to google which can't see into your email and put ads in it  So I wonder I can't imagine this would be a real gut check for google  Google believes in right. This is part of google's ethos. It believes in privacy  It believes encryption should be easy to do on the other hand  There is absolutely no ways to monetize encrypting email without charging

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have have you ever ever ever seen money and seen seen figures on how much google makes from ads on gmail  No, I think it's gotta be  Minus interesting as we talked about the other day. I often I usually don't see ads any any on gmail, right?  Um, and what I do i'm engrossed in an activity  Why do I use gmail? Why does google still want me to use gmail even if it doesn't have direct revenue from it?  Well, because it it's it's part of the service now  Yeah, right. It feeds all kinds of things. It's it's it's i'm addicted to google  Why did I why did I buy all my my la vida google devices because of gmail because it was integrated  So gmail has huge value to them  I think they could they could stop advertising on gmail tomorrow and I would bet you  We'll never know but I would bet you the impact on bottom line is de minimis  So what's more important to google trust  Trust trust trust. I'm going to speak to the privacy folks  Uh at google in a few weeks  Which is and i'm doing that as a favor. So, you know, I don't know maybe maybe you might want to let gina end  I oh but we'll get it  Ads I love you what I love to help from from the listeners of of twig and for this you can send me an email  Or you can talk to me elsewhere is what would what would the perfect?  ultimate google as the absolute leader in privacy look like  Um, and I think that that I want to give them a wish list about you know, it's just interesting because i'm looking I don't see any  Ads at all. Do you do you see any ads in your gmail?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do I do so I turned off a little bar across the top  I have ads on if I open up a message. I have um a related google plus page  Oh, yeah, there it is on the right. Okay, and then on the right at the bottom

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but they're very very minor doesn't bother me  Mm-hmm. Um, here's here's you know, there's a dotnet development and this is not bad at all. This is an ad  This is a email from jason

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know if anyone can figure out how to sometimes they don't have anything get these ads to show up with encryption

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's google. Um, or just still know about you. So here's a couple of options. Here's a couple of options  Right, you could have you could have ads that just aren't targeted  Well, although they're targeted to you they're not they're just not from your email why not this is a hot hot button for a lot of people  Get off the squiggle bandwagon or charge five bucks a year or whatever how much I mean it's not can't be

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, this is this is what I was thinking google apps users who are paying businesses and organizations  This is this is something that they want right so that you pay for this premium service  You turn on privacy  And and your and your communications are encrypted now your communications are all stored on google servers  And if the nsa or whoever is getting what's ever coming in and out of google servers  The encryption doesn't doesn't do anything for you, right? Well, hold on. Well, not well, I don't know if it's end-to-end encrypted than it does  right if then then right because

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I use a service called hushmail right now  Uh hushmail is was created by phil zimmerman who created pgp. It's pgp encryption  It's if you use it to go outbound outside of hushmail. It's not encrypted anymore  But if you're sending it to somebody within hushmail, it's fully pgp encrypted  Right, and that's what you would do. But if google did it almost I half the people I write to are on gmail already  That would all be encrypted

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, let me explain okay that gina leo explain this to me because I get I get confused about encryption  It shouldn't be but I still do  So if it's end-to-end  Anywhere outside of google then I still have to publish a public key

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you would need to encrypt mail to me  If i'm on yahoo mail, you would need to know my public key and encrypt it to that public key  Okay, so now google could make that easy by saying oh, you know, I see this is not a gmail address  Would you like to encrypt and then is this the person to whom you're sending the mail? Does this match?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Your knowledge of jeff. Okay, but here's another question. Here's here's a clever way google would do it  Ah will make it really really easy to encrypt like hushmail  Inside gmail and because I don't know anybody who uses hushmail except you leo, right?  But I know lots of people use gmail and if you if you are concerned about this being private communication  Hey, just just find your user on gmail and send it to them in gmail and you don't have to worry about publishing  Right, that's right. That becomes a real premium service  I don't know something in charge for it  But i'm saying it becomes a real benefit another benefit to using gmail

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's a question becomes the most secure place to email would google if it did that google would have to hold your private key, right?  How where would the private key live jeaneth let me think yeah, that's that's the question right it has it has to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It could live in your hard drive

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know your client on your hard drive. It could live in your client and then uh, yeah, I guess it could it could live in your client

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's not the hard part. The hard part is I want to send private email to gmail to jeana  I don't know her public key. I have to go looking for her public key instead in gmail. It says jeanah jeanah accepts encrypted mail  Would you like to send something to her encrypted? Yeah, check here. Yes, I would  That's the hard part made easier, right? Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, it knows her key and as her public key so it'd do it automatically

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And what what gmail could what google could do in addition to that just to play along here?  Is that it could make it a standard?  To make it really easy for anyone in google plus get this get this  Click one box and you get a public key  And gmail will use use it automatically. It'll put it in your google profile  Profile and put your public key there and put your private key in your gmail and you're rolling

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So actually I think that's the only way to do it, you know hush mail keeps the private key  Which means that they have in the past turned over unencrypted emails to the federal government on subpoenas  That's not the way to do it obviously  and by the way ladar levison who created  A lava bit the gmail or the encrypted mail that reportedly edward snowden wanted to use or did use with glenn greenwald  Uh, he shut down lava bit because the government's wanted the keys and he said no i'm not going to do it  He's now in a lot of trouble because of it  But he and phil zimmerman are creating something they call dark mail that will presumably do it correctly  the key is that that  To make it trust no one's in steve gibson's famous phrase tno  Uh, the only person who could have access to that private key would be you  So that no other third party could turn over your unencrypted email  And that's what we all want. We all understand that now  So all google would do is maintain a directory of private keys automatically use that i'm sorry of public keys  Automatically use those public keys on your request to encrypt, but it would not be able to decrypt  Your client would have to do that exactly in the window or whatever

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The only thing that gives you security and safety and he's the only thing that prevents the nsa from getting your stuff unless  Unless they can crack the gp. We don't know it right, but but but yeah, you know  In thinking about this this talk at google the other thing that occurred to me as I was  Walking the street the other day  Is that I think we're thinking about this this personal data the wrong way. We keep on talking about vaults protect it  Right, I think instead that that what you really want to do is see that there's an economy here and a benefit of sharing your data  But you want more control over that  When do you share something so really a platform for being able to publish and share things and making that possible and getting me value in return  Is is where I think this goes so this idea that you can you can encrypt something so easily in gmail and keep it private  From everybody including google and the nsa that's a powerful statement if that's what they're going to do  And if and if you were thinking this way you think it's a good idea. Well invite jina and me to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We'll explain it to you this would prevent them from from doing all the cool google now features though where it's like  Oh, you have a flight coming up and you've just arrived at the airport. Oh your package is shipped

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's why I don't think but and I but i'm not gonna well they encrypt automatically they encrypt on request  Yeah, yeah, it has to be because jena also united airlines is not going to encrypt right? It's that's incoming  Yeah  So that email is still there  Yeah, that doesn't change anything that doesn't change anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When you do talk to them tell them that if they really want to get this right nobody ever says the phrase public key  No regular person should have to ever say the phrase public key, but you have to treat it like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The secret mailbox this is jina if you were only going to google i.o. You could explain that to them yourself

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right it's instead of priority inbox, it's it's it's it's private mailbox. It's secret mailbox. It's you know, um, it's like  Oh, hey, you're gonna send a postcard or you're gonna send it this certified mail  um, you know some some sort of  Some sort of analogy that makes it easy to grok and no public private key  I mean last pass does this right? I mean, I installed a last pass extension on all my different browsers  Uh when heartbleed happened last pass said hey, you know what even if our servers were vulnerable all of your we don't have your data  We can't decrypt your data like your data. I mean  They have my data right but it's encrypted. So even if a hacker had been using heartbleed  Um that they wouldn't have been able to decrypt anything that they had  and this is what's going on right all my stuff is getting decrypted when i'm when I when I  Activate the extension on my on my client and this is basically how pgp works as well  But I don't I don't deal with keys with that I just install it and log in yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know that I want to also want to just note here. There's not just the iGo or gena goes we've collaborated here together  We're a team  You don't want to split us up  That's that's the key to this

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh my goodness

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it's hopeless. Forget it guys. I know I know that I don't know we don't nobody pays for it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We don't nobody pressures google. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just want to say we were thinking of trying to game google by just signing up 100 people and  But uh, I thought that probably was a foolish idea as well  I think gaming google is probably the last thing anybody ever wants right now matt cuts his ears are perking up  Well, hey, you know in fact next time we get matt cuts on I want to just thank him because I guess google's cracking down on  bogus inbound links or whatever  Because i've been getting I did I mention this before tons of email from people  Saying hey, you know, we spammed your forums some time ago. Can you remove that spam because google's cracking down on us  Yeah, wow, it gives me such pleasure to send them back. You know what? No, that is the sound of my feet dragging  One guy just sent me we'll pay for whatever it takes to get rid of these spammy links  Now probably what happened in some of these cases? It's it's it's that uh,  They hired a kind of rogue seo group that did these spammy links and they didn't know what maybe i'm going to give them  A little benefit of the doubt on this  um on the other hand, maybe not  Um, and the ones I really don't like are the ones who threaten me because we would hate  To have to go back to google and disavow the links because that would adversely affect your own google ranking

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Threatening jerks. Yeah, that was my that kind of was one of the words that came to mind  Wow  Can you believe we would we would hate to have to go back to google and tell him he wasn't cooperating with us  The nice horse you have

So they want to get our google juice  To their evil client or whatever  um  Anyway  Uh  Don't write to me because i'm not gonna be i'm not gonna be a nice guy and matt  If they try to smear me, I presume he won't affect it won't affect our

So you'll see chad's got the video up there  You can see if you go to say one world trade center the freedom tower  You can go back and see the construction you can see buildings kind of kind of get  Pop up out of the ground. Just really cool  Um google says the new feature lets you see landmarks growth  Or you can see things like reconstruction after 2011 earthquake and tsunami in japan  And you can even experience different seasons and see what it would be like to cruise roadways in both summer and winter

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So yeah, really neat time-lapse. I when I first saw this I thought oh cool  I could go back to 1856 or something, but the street view wasn't around back then

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no street view was only around about seven years and and and the photos are about one to two years old  So you can really kind of see there's big differences between them, especially in construction sites like like down  a world trade center  What else do we have oh it updates to the hangout app for android that will be released later this week merges sms  And hangout conversations and the same uh with the same user in a single log  So if you start a conversation with someone over at sms and later you chat with them via regular hangouts  You see all those messages kind of in the same view  If you don't like this change no big deal  You can disable it on the fly and you can switch between sms or hangouts while you're chatting with someone  So you'll get the choice to text that person or just regular hangout them  And you can see in that screenshot the I think the hangout messages and the sms messages are shown differently  I think one's white and one's green so you can kind of tell uh, you can tell which way it was sent  Right, and there's a lot.

Transcript:  You just use the htc app. Yeah, that makes sense  Yeah, I don't mind using hangouts  But i've had a lot of people say that they don't they don't want their sms and hangouts and they've just so you use

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You use hangouts for your text messaging, you know, I use google voice

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I don't actually even use the native you use voice app. I just use voice for everything which is really clunky  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Voice kind of I don't know how but voice  Ties in with the text messaging app the native text messaging app on your phone  So i'll get google voice text in my sms  And then if I respond to that then it stays within voice  Yes, if I initiate I have to initiate invoice if I want it to be from my voice number. Yes  So it's a little weird. It's all very weird. We need a unified system and in case and that would also allow third parties like  Facebook messenger to become part of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Agreed. Absolutely. I look forward to google voice being part of hangouts because it's clearly been a neglected android app and  That's clearly the road they're going down. Yep  What else do we have? Oh google trends. Uh, so this is the tool that shows you what users are searching for on google  Uh now offers email subscriptions  So if you want to keep on top of a sports team a celebrity or a brand you can subscribe to get email notifications  If searches for those topics spike and you get those email notifications once a week or once a month  You can also subscribe to hot searches for any country. So  Or any us monthly top chart entertainment  News, etc. So you can kind of keep on top of what's what's popular amongst web searchers  And finally google analytics  Making life easier for app developers and content providers and a new update that's rolling out in the next few weeks  The analytics app will merge web and app data into a single report  So if you've got content on the web and you've got content inside of an app  Google analytics will show those all in one in one space  So instead of talking about visits which only makes sense on the web analytics now refers to sessions  So it's users in both your app and on the web and instead of calling  People visitors like it was what kind of traditional conventional web terms. They're just called users now  So merging app and web just kind of kind of interesting so you can get better reporting and better insights about how your users are  Interacting with your stuff across different different touch points  That's it. That's all I got play the drum slowly

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The google change

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now I want to put the soundtrack behind your winging winging winging figure things  I want to use that music behind that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In time, that was a good one. I will share that to go plus and you guys can do whatever you wish with it  Before we wrap up a couple of quick stories. I know this was a big one for you jeff  So I don't want to let it go fcc proposal that would destroy net neutrality according to the verge  According to the wall street journal and no journal. Okay. Well, let's let's the verge is quoting the journal. So let's go to the original  The fcc plans to propose a new open internet rule on thursday that would allow content companies  To pay internet service providers for special access to consumers. So let's be very clear here folks. That's not net neutrality

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's not an open opposite. That is killing net neutrality  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So so apparently they think they're gonna if we need yeah right there. I want that anime a gift  Apparently they think they're gonna fool regular people by saying  The rules will prevent the service providers from blocking or discriminating against specific websites  Like that's the problem  But would allow broadband providers to give some traffic preferential treatment  So long as such arrangements arrangements are available on commercially reasonable terms

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what else we're going to charge you for decent carriage of your content other everything else is going to be delivered like molasses  Unbelievable that is unbelievable. It is terrible. It is wrong wrong wrong. It kills the internet fcc. Guess what the f stands for

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is really disappointing now the chairman of the fcc tom wheeler  Former cable company lobbyist has absolutely got has absolutely got to take the the flak for this

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He absolutely does the the revolving door went around and and and slapped his butt as he's going in  To the fcc. It's just awful just terrible

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He says he's following the road map that the uh, the court prescribed prescribed  To give the fcc, uh jurisdiction here  Here  But to say to say oh, yeah, you can't block a website which was never at issue  Nope, but you can charge for access to consumers, which is exactly the issue is not this is not an open internet rule

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a closed probably. This is the exact opposite. This is a kill the internet rule f u f c c  funnel cake

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fandango  Frilly  Uh, whether the terms are commercially reasonable would be decided by the fcc on a case-by-case basis  So oh, yeah, that's gonna work. Well. Yeah  wants to squeeze  Twit and say hey if you would if you would desire to reach our customers with your programming  We'd like to charge you one million dollars. Then I would have to go to the fcc and say wait a minute. That's not  commercially

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Reasonable and then and comcast has 87 000 lawyers and you have none and then you know five years later  Advertiser that gives you forms you can fill out but you don't have lobbyists

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The companies would be paying for preferential treatment on the last mile of broadband networks  It connects directly to consumers. The words preferential treatment  right there

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That should tell you something  Listen techville out there you fought sopa pipa. What was that?  Gee, I want to be able to watch a movie. That was nothing that was unimportant  This is the very heart soul and essence of the internet fight people fight

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This has nothing to do with that signal time. This has nothing to do with what netflix already paid comcast for the peering  This isn't about peering this isn't about back end and interconnection. This is saying if you would like to get to the house

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What are you gonna give us I just don't get this what is the point of this why

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because the journal was wrong unless the wall street journal got it wrong  And it's a trial balloon. We don't know find out on thursday if true. It is utterly completely absolutely disgusting  And i'm telling you people to the barricades  Don't don't jane and I have this conversation the show very often  All you geeks think you could hack around something you can't hack around this  This ruins the internet this ruins. Well, it's like twig. It does open

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  An opportunity for an internet service provider that chooses not to do this. The problem is the same fcc gave us gave  This these duopoly rules  Which means we don't have in most cases choice between uh more than one or two internet service providers

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if even if you do who is it in my case? It's it's cable vision and and verizon

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I can give you an example sonic net which is a great internet independent internet service providers here up  They would of course never do this  But the problem is they come in over copper. They're a dsl provider. There is no way to do it over cable  That's not allowed so they come in over copper. So, um  They're kind of at the I think at the mercy of the phone companies and i'm sure the phone companies will find ways to screw these guys  Oh, this is really bad news. I'm glad we ended the show with this and I didn't begin it  I wouldn't have would have been happy. This is terrible. Let's watch with with interest tomorrow  um  They have not been released  But this is a huge departure from previous open internet rules. This is tom wheeler

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cashing the check from the cable companies. Yep. Yep. Mr. Wheeler. We know what's in your wallet  All right last week when I brought the show down I tried to get a little amusement back into it then  So i'll try that again this week  Mimosa  The google glass there was a funny bank ad mox glass

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh boy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay  So i'm gonna play that for you now here. I think I might have seen this actually  Oh, maybe it's old. I don't know. This is no. No, I think I saw this on time because  It's time. Yeah. Yeah  first bank

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who wants more peas?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's watching tv go away

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Daddy hates pop-up ads go away hashtag dinner time. Let's go forward selfie  Selfie delete selfie go away  Bookmark go away. No post photo go up go forward hashtag crazy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So mom is serving dinner this has nothing to do with a bank by the way, uh  Obviously, they just felt like we got a really skewered glass here  I think this is kind of true go away dad's pushing away pop-ups mom's putting the peas on the table because she's watching tv while she's serving  the little the boy the son is playing video games the daughter's trying to  You know food spot. It's this isn't so far from reality. It isn't it isn't it isn't actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Frankly what happened scobel scobel did a 180 on uh on glass. Well, that was the g you couldn't see that coming

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Could you what is he he doesn't like it now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apparently last night before skrillex at coachella came on two guys were talking next to me says robert scobel  One said I want to get away from the google glass guys. I turn around and there are two guys wearing glass  Google has a problem here. I haven't worn mine all weekend

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Robert goes to coachella

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He did he took a lot of pictures at coachella

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not with his camera not with his a cloud with his very big camera

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I have been saying this all along by the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just want to point out here's somebody random say I want to get away from those guys with glass and I  Okay, okay google says

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Says this is because we didn't make have enough people  Uh wearing glass it was too small a row rollout  marketing uh, uh a guy, uh  Responding in fact to this backlash marketing guy ed sanders  Uh says the backlash is a result of the way google decided to roll out glass  But it was a deliberate decision to do it that way with a limited public beta surrounded by a nimbus of hype and curiosity  It was an unusual step of doing it so exposed and risks come with that actually some of this is a quote  Some of this is not uh, this is forbes writer, uh, jeff  Berkovic, but uh, the quote is we knew there would be downsides, but we also knew  And know there would be a tremendous upside  So I guess this makes sense. In fact, any publicity is good publicity having robert scobel

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bitch about glass on facebook is good for them as somebody said exactly somebody said on twitter, you know, uh,  glass going to take off

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I glass futures. I don't think so scobel gives them up no one scobel gives I know but I frankly don't think I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a fascinating experiment

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But interestingly the 1500 dollar price point was chosen to only get people who are interested not based on the hardware which  I gotta tell you I didn't love that makes me feel like a schmuck  Well, it you know, it doesn't choose for people who are really interested it choose for people who are really rich, right?  I mean which is more home 1500 bucks is not a challenge and there are other ways to limit access, right?  Like i'm sure there are plenty of explorers and I know that there are plenty of explorers who got chosen but couldn't afford it  I mean we saw lots of indiegogo campaigns and people trying to get you know  Trying to pay for glass in different ways. So I didn't love that so much. I was like  You know  If you want all your beta testers to be rich beta testers to be rich then that's that's what you do  But I don't think that that was the point

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nothing sanders who is in charge of marketing for glass says nothing great has been achieved where it's incremental you have to go all in  But it is a little the high price point another quote isn't about the cost of the device  We want people who are going to be passionate about it  But does that really mean that it didn't cost them that much

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean that sounds like the implication, right? Yeah, I mean maybe they wanted people who were so passionate  They were willing to you know, raise money

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  right for it  well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Time for jean's tip of the week

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I gotta tell you I didn't I I was I was having a hard time finding a tip this week  So and then I was like.co you should definitely check out  Um, and I couldn't remember if we covered it on this show because I know we talked about definitely all about android  But did you cover the the last past update where now it does auto fill on android?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We talked like we did. You know, I love it. I apologize if we've come and I think now see if this sounds familiar  Because I found a bug in it that caused the htc 1 ma camera to crash every time

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's crazy the camera. Yeah, because

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The camera didn't expect one path for some reason or last pass to pop up if some reason last pass wanted to pop up  So it puzzled me now this pop up is great. It's inconsistent  Uh, unfortunately and something I don't know for some reason i'm able to find a lot of sites that won't let me paste  So in in when it works, right? It works wonderfully. So you're on a site like path for instance, and you want to log into path  It was like the native app not just a site the native app. Did I say site? I meant app exactly  In fact, let me log out of path so I can show you  Uh what this looks like because it's really awesome. So i'll log out of path  And then I will log back in so you launch path you say log in and if you have last pass on your android device  And you start typing the password  It's not going to do it is it  There it is there it is now now don't look because I have a pin and by the way  I would recommend that you do that require at least a pin if not a full login  But once I gave the pin which I did it says oh you're on path. Should I fill it in?  I tap it it fills it in  And uh, and i'm done and i'm gonna log in  So that is a really nice feature now. There's a couple of weirdnesses  Sometimes it doesn't pop up. Sometimes it does pop up and it says copy and paste copy and paste  It doesn't can auto fill and then sometimes on sites. I don't know about you, but I found sites where I can't paste  not sites, but apps

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh weird, huh? So I haven't been said it works for me more often than not it works enough  Yeah, and it makes me yeah  It makes me so happy because it used to be copy add to the notification shade and flip but then copy and paste  That was such a pain. It was such such a rigmarole, but it's um, but it's so much it's so much better now  So yeah, it's got a little a little weirdness here and there but better than nothing really loving it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everybody knows because we've told them that because of the heart bleed bug that you should be using a password vault  We love last pass. I do want to point out one other way that you could do this before listen new features really nice  But you also get a last pass keyboard and you can and I it's a crappy keyboard  But I I do make it my default keyboard when i'm first setting up a new phone  Because then it's kind of the same thing when the keyboard comes up. You could say hey just fill it in  So that was the previous way of doing it and it's it's still around  Last pass is a must have on android on ios on mac on windows. It's just you it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love it. Yeah, I feel like i've i've cheered leader for last pass a few times  But that that particular feature has been it still delights me every time it works  I'm like, oh because I set up my new m8 and it was like so much easier with that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, yeah, yeah, so one other issue as I mentioned at least on the htc  version of the ma  Uh, the camera app was crashing crashing crashing and I did a lot of searching and I finally found it  I think they've last pass has fixed it within an update  but  When I was launching the camera for some reason it it was launching it last pass was trying to launch its pop-up  And it would crash the camera app all I had to do is go into the last pass settings  And say and because you can control which apps launch again. I'm not right and say don't and say don't launch

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right don't launch for this app. Yep. Yeah, that wasn't happening with the google play edition  And it wasn't it's not happening with the regular google camera from the play store, which is what i'm using now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does the google play edition of the ma come with the google camera or an or an or an actual htc camera?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It comes with the google with the google camera  But it's a special version like they fork the google camera to include  The the the focus shifting and the 3d so it has a few of the htc features. Yeah  Yeah, I think it's I think it's actually a special build. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So here's where you change it. This is in the last pass preferences  First of all, you have to enable fill into apps. That's not on by default  So you want to go into last pass preferences scroll down?  And enable fill into apps. That's what jean is talking about and then the app association  Are a list and that's where you can say hey when the camera launches, please don't try to do a password login  Uh, that's the first one I found there may be others and of course last pass probably fixes it as time goes by  But um, just just a little tip if you do have a problem with a crashing app all of a sudden  You know what it was? It was a confluence of a new a new phone  That yeah a new and then an update to last pass and neither could test because both were brand new  Right not unusual  Jeff I highly recommend it jeff your number of the week. All right, i'm a little confused about this number

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe you can explain it to me lucy  so  As you remember google did a stock split and it came out with a class  Uh c shares of brand new kind which are non-voting class a shares are voting, right?  And the and a price differential has has developed there wasn't supposed to be dollars eleven dollars  Okay, eleven dollars on average according to the story that I have in the in the um or today  the um  class  Google shares which are class  uh c  Uh is five hundred twenty seven dollars  Google g-o-double-g-l shares which are class a is five hundred thirty seven dollars. So you're talking about eleven dollars between  so the  Non-voting shares are worth more than the voting shares  What what that doesn't make sense to me did I get the story wrong  You would think that the voting shares would be worth more than the non-voting share right? Yeah, unless the story got reversed

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. I don't know. It's a mystery to me weird everything that happens on the stock market is a mystery to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, me too, unfortunately, no, no, not unfortunately, yeah leo leo go short one of them, but I don't know which one i'm gonna short something

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm gonna short something

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The number is 11, but I don't know what it means

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Eleven dollars a share  Um, I was gonna actually do that google maps, uh time machine thing as uh, whoops i'm sorry  I don't care because you got it in that's a better place for it really  Uh  um  I guess this isn't a tool but I do I I do  Want a warning if you haven't upgraded to kitkat yet and you use an sd card  And I actually wanted to ask you about this jeena because you're the developer here  Did you have you talked about this and all about android but in kitkat at 4.4?  Uh google really changes how sd cards are handled  with file permissions and I think they I I I this is a long google group posting which  Includes a response from jeff sharky who's on the team  On the android team  Before kitkat public apis only supported a single primary external storage device  And most of the time that was emulated. It was the internal storage not the sd card  um primary external storage devices  That is uh sd zero on most android devices  Have not they continue to work the way they always have  however  The sd card secondary external storage devices  They have limited write access to directories belonging to the app now this makes sense  An app shouldn't be able to write anywhere at once on the sd card at least it seems to make sense initially  But it breaks a ton of apps and developers are really  Pissed off and there are a lot of use cases where  It makes sense, especially camera apps things like that where an app might want to be able to write  Let's say you take a picture with an app the app has its own storage in the sd card  But it would like to save the picture to the camera's store. It can't  Because it doesn't have access now that's a security thing I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they do sand this have the android does sandbox app permissions to particular folders, which really is good practice

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, but a warning because this is new to kitkat  Um before kitkat some oems chose to leave external storage devices unprotected in other words  Apps could write wherever they want if they could understand the the path  But he says these were never part of any plaque public platform api  They were internal implementation detail. We warned you again again. You shouldn't depend on these hidden behaviors  Well now you're screwed but as an end user you might want to be aware of this, uh, and you might check your app  Before you upgrade to kitkat if you haven't done so already I haven't had any problems yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I haven't I haven't seen any problems with this. I wonder how this manifests. I guess this is a crash or  Sometimes it'll crash if the if the app is well written

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It'll just say can't write to that directory, but some apps crash

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If it's the longest time to do text wrote to assumed you had an sd card  This is early in our development, but it assumed you had an sd card  So like if you didn't it would just crap like it would try to write and it would just crash

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was terrible. It was terrible. So like if you have es file manager, which is a very popular file manager. I use  Um, it can't it thinks it can delete files from other directors, but it can't  So it says I've deleted the file and then you see it's still there. Yeah, is it obviously so there's no way to request that permission

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think I kind of understand it. I mean it is more secure, but it does make sd cards a lot less useful

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it does. Yeah  It does and it seems like that should be a permission that the user could grant  I mean a file manager you want to give access to all your files that it can manage them  Yes, right. I mean, I mean the way that like for instance dropbox implements that this in their api  Is that by default apps get a certain folder?  But you can ask for full permission to your entire dropbox, but the user has to grant that  Um, so yeah, this is interesting. You can see the security argument, right?  But it does render certain things like a file manager

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You'll also see then fewer apps using sd cards or working with sd cards because they can't or they won't because they can't yeah  Yeah, uh, so that makes an sd card somewhat less usable and going forward in android devices. Just thought I'd mention that  It's not a tool. It's not it's kind of a tip  Hey, thank you. Good luck getting into google.io you two
