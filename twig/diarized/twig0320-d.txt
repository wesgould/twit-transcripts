Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can't wait. He's of course a maker and you work at NetApp still?  Yep, still working at NetApp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. I should always ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thanks to NetApp for letting me come do this.  Thank you NetApp.  Very gracious with my time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you may see him on a regular basis on all about Android and on Floss Weekly.  He's on Floss Weekly this morning.  And many of our shows. Who are you interviewing this morning?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This morning we were doing, where's John? I can't remember the name of it.  It's a Kickstarter rival and they've got some interesting products.  I'll talk about those two later.  Cool.  Pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Also with us from Canada, it's our good friend Matthew Ingram also from fortune.com.  Good to see you Matthew. Welcome back.  Thanks.  And get this, yes, Jeff Jarvis is here, but he's not here here.  He's in, I wish we could do a guessing game, but no one would ever guess where you are.  Unless they saw that picture over your left shoulder.  There we go. There's the picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That picture even is not what you think it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, Jeff Jarvis is in Medellin, Colombia.  Medellin.  How do they pronounce it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, some say Medellin, some say Medigin.  Medigin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you're there, why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I spoke last night at the foundation that honors Gabriel Garcia Marquez has the awards every year for the best of journalism throughout Spanish speaking the world.  Oh, neat.  And so it's people from all over the world over here in Medellin.  And I got to speak about, you know, future journalism in my usual song and dance.  But and as you know, on the show, he has been studying Spanish for two months.  Wow, two months.  And two months. And according to Pimsleur, I was going to say very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It gets confusing, you know, too many languages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Very good.  And so I'm, you know, I'm picking up about once every 10 words, but it's it's kind of thrilling to pick up a few words now and make it kind of worthwhile.  And so I got to keep going with my study. There's 150 days total.  So I've got 20 days to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there's no better way to learn than to be in the in the country and talking to people.  And I mean, immersion is really the best way to learn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's so great. Today I was at a I went to the mall just to get out of here.  And this guy stopped me and I thought he's panhandling or something.  I have no idea. Turns out he was at the event last night.  So congratulations. Good event last night. He spoke hardly English.  I speak hardly any Spanish. And it was it was he's a radio executive.  It was much fun to go back and forth. So, yeah, this is it's thrilling when I can read a headline or a sign and get it.  But this is a great conference.  And I'm going to give the awards tonight.  And then I fly back on a five o'clock flight tomorrow.  What a fun what a fun assignment. I like that.  And of course, Marquez is one of my favorite authors.  I love in the time of color is is and 100 years of solitude to just two of my favorite animals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And importantly, he wasn't just a novelist.  He was a journalist.  And he was a journalist.  And he was a journalist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He wasn't just a novelist.  He was a journalist of major note.  And that's why he started this foundation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good for him. Where was he a journalist?  Was it Mexico?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In Colombia and then I think in Venezuela.  And then I think in Mexico.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're going to have to help me because like many of us, I've been watching Narcos,  which is all about the Medellin drug cartel.  That's that's over. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not. Yes, it's well over.  It's actually an extremely exciting time to be here for a few reasons.  One is that the government just announced some real huge steps in the negotiations with FARC  and peace negotiations after decades and decades of war here, of guerrilla war.  And so it's a very exciting time that they're finally making progress on that.  And the Narco wars here are well over.  And the city has rebuilt itself phenomenally.  They've used they built a metro so that brought the poor people down into the city more.  The irony of Medellin is the rich people are down in the valley and the poor people are  have views of the mountain top and surrounded by mountains.  And it's quite quite an amazing setting.  And they've used arts and culture and events like this to really do an amazing,  amazing job of making Medellin a tourist attraction and a safe city.  And it's really come back. And, you know, I said stories about I said a story from El Pa√≠s  about this to a foundation I work with in New Jersey.  You know, if you look at cities like Newark and Camden, Medellin is kind of a model.  You know, don't give up on the city. There's a chance.  This proves there's a chance to really rebuild it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How exciting. And how much is the Internet a part of what's going on there?  Are they? Oh, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Usually. Yeah. Usually. Yeah.  And the media businesses are still trying to hold on to print.  And there's the same exact debate that's going on just a little bit later than where we are.  But of course, it's all mobile and mobile phones.  And I love walking around the streets where they're selling minutes for, you know, 100 pesos, 150 pesos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just to get online.  Well, were you able to get online yesterday and see the Google announcement?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not only that, but I was afraid that because I was in Colombia, I'd be restricted from buying.  But no, no, no, no, no. I bought one. Yeah.  Yay. Bought one. What?  I got the P, the 6P. I got the 64. I mean, that's what I got to.  No, 64 is a sweet spot. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Now that everybody streams most content and I think I bought a 128 gig iPhone,  but that was because I was a little worried because of 4K video and the live photos that I might be using an extraordinary amount of data.  In fact, I am after I put everything that I want, like putting all my music on here, still only 70 gigs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So 64, I think that's fine for any sense. Did you buy the warranty period or are you holding the phones for such a brief period?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't imagine. Yeah, I never buy the warranty, although it seems like a pretty good deal.  Actually, let's talk about what Google announced.  I'm going to apologize in advance to Matthew Ingram because I don't think you can buy any of this in Canada.  No, none of it. You can buy it in Ireland, but not in Canada, of all places. Crazy.  So we covered it live. You can watch it on our live specials. It was me, Gina Trapani was with us. Russell Holly.  Yeah, it was really a fun couple of hours to spend with those two talking about what Google had announced.  I thought a Google did a great job. It was fast paced. It worked well.  They brought a big number of people up on stage and I think demonstrate, including a lot of women.  There's a lot of diversity, but I think that it wasn't so much that is just to demonstrate that it's a team.  Sundar Pichai was on the stage for a minute and then handed it off and everybody else got to talk.  I thought that I liked that. It made me feel like Google is a company that is, and this is true of Apple too,  it's true of all tech companies, made up of a lot of people. To see more of them I think is great.  So Mike Elgin, our news director, was there and he came home with swag.  Actually, Leo can send me one of those bags. I'd appreciate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You guys can fight over it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I at least can touch it. I can touch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm just going to put it out in the middle and just let you guys fight over it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want it so badly.  So the swag bag is actually quite beautiful. It's from a company called Rickshaw.  It's a tweed herringbone, but waterproof.  It sounds like you're doing a fashion show, Leo.  Yes. It's a lovely tweed. Fresh bags made daily in San Francisco with the new Google logo, I might point out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which is also killing me because all my swag is now out of date.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they do that so you'll buy new swag.  And it's full of goodies. So what do we get here?  And I'll open these in a little bit. The Chromecast audio. As we talk about them, I'll open them up.  The new Chromecast itself.  And then I was really, when I saw this box, I was going, there's a phone. Is there a phone in there?  But no, sorry to say, this is the Huawei watch.  That's still nice though.  Yeah. It's a four or five hundred dollar watch. It's not a cheap watch.  I don't know what our ethics policy will allow in terms of keeping this Mr. Elegant.  But I've played with the Huawei watch. We had a review unit as well.  So let me just open up that because it really isn't a big part of the announcement.  Although it's one of the prettiest watches. Although as Russell, oh, that's pretty.  As Russell Holly pointed out, everybody, but everybody on the Google side on stage was wearing Moto 360s.  Some old, some new.  The Huawei. They get their choices at Christmas, right?  Oh, is that it? Is that why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe they can like pick one thing and pick one phone and one watch or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Compare this. I'm also wearing. It's funny because this is the Huawei version of a Milanese loop.  Compare it in size and styling to the Apple watch. I like round. I have to say.  Let me see if we can turn on. I don't think there's a flat tire on this one.  I think that's one of the things, but it's awfully thick.  I just have to say that's to me, that's a little bit discouraging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I see these guys with these wildly expensive show off watches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're just thick. Yeah. I guess I can't turn it on.  The other thing that people have said they don't like about this is it's not wireless charging like the Moto.  It has pogo pins and you have to dock, you know, connect it.  But OLED screen, which is really nice.  I mean, one of the things I don't like about the Moto 3, I don't know if there's plastic on here or not.  I guess not. I don't like about the Moto 360 is the LCD screen is not quite as nice as the OLED screen that the LG and others.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's interesting. I don't.  Do the other watches have a maker logo come up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the first I've seen of that. Yeah, me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But this is now the standard Android Wear boots.  Yes.  This takes a while too, as I remember.  I kind of like Android Wear and having, you know, I got the new iPhone and so I, you know,  dug the Apple Watch out of retirement and put it on and wearing it again reminds me that it's just it's hard to use.  And it isn't particularly more functional than Android Wear.  You can place and receive calls with it, which is about the biggest difference.  And one thing that it's missed that Android Wear has is missing is the ambient watch mode.  This isn't even a very good watch because it's off unless you specifically flick it up to save battery life.  Most of the time it just looks like that. It looks like a black chunk, which makes it a not very good watch.  I think also Apple really didn't figure out the UI.  I mean, there's two buttons, there's force touches, all these different fiddly bits.  Android Wear is considerably simpler. This button doesn't really do anything.  By the way, note where it is. It's on the kind of on the outside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it has to be because otherwise it dig into your skin because it's so big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe we'll make we'll put it in English. Oh, now we have to charge it before we can go on.  I think that's fairly attractive.  The only negative I've heard about this is the is the charging method.  Mm hmm. But it's not a big deal.  Not really. You know, we'll have to we'll get a review of this.  I think Jason Howell's been reviewing it for before you buy. He has one.  So we'll review on that. But that is not even one of Google's announcements.  They just I think was just a little spiff. They gave the journal.  What is the what is the policy, Jeff?  I mean, if you were working for a magazine, you wouldn't take it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You shouldn't take anything. Huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The policy everywhere I've ever worked is you can't accept anything beyond a cup of coffee.  Right. That's appropriate.  So what we used to do with review stuff, if we if they didn't want it back, let's say it was a game or something like that,  then at the newspaper we would have a raffle or we'd donate a charity or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's a that's actually appropriate. Oh, it's gone into demo mode.  So there's a demo mode. So that's kind of cool.  Yeah. So I think that's what we'll do with this.  Might not be too happy, but I actually really like let's see if it does that thing.  Yeah, it does. The new tilted forward thing.  OK, Google, like the circle shape, I got to say circles so much better.  Yeah, I like circle. Yep.  I think Android Wear has parity with the Apple Watch.  Can you pay with it? Not with it.  Of course, you can pay with your phone, but you can't pay with it.  You're right. That's another feature of Apple Wear.  Apple, whatever Apple calls it, Apple Watch that's unique to Apple Watch.  I don't do it that often.  In fact, I'm a little disappointed by the the whole pay process.  I still in some cases still have to sign.  Just like, wait a minute, this is so much more secure.  You're validating my identity by signing. Right.  What the hell? You don't probably don't have that problem in Canada, Matthew.  But here in the States, in fact, this is the week that chip and sign becomes official.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, we've had chip cards for two, three years at least.  It's one of the few things that we got before the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But Matthew, do yours come with pin numbers?  Because our stupid cards don't, so they're not useful in Europe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're not chipping pin here.  So this all came about because Visa and MasterCard finally had it after the target break in.  And then they finally said, you know what, you retailers, you're going to have to face your share, fair share of the financial cost of this stuff.  So they decreed that starting Thursday, and they've given everybody a year to do it, that whoever has the worst security pays.  And if that's if the retailer doesn't put in a pin terminal, then they'll be liable for fraud and losses due to fraud.  So all the this is, of course, stimulated Apple Pay, Android Pay, Samsung Monday shipped to its version of pay on its existing Samsung phones.  But in the United States, I guess they didn't want to move too fast.  We don't want to scare away users.  So they don't do pins.  It's chip and sign. That's pretty dumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's really dumb. I let my kids sign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm like, go ahead. You know, Lisa draw just does a thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She doesn't do a signature. I said, Lisa, that's not your signature.  She says, you don't have to sign.  You can put an X. No one checks it.  No one checks it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You guys have the tap and pay cards?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The ones where I don't we I don't think you tap the new the new terminals.  You stick the card in far enough so that the chip goes in.  And by the way, it is a slower process and a swipe.  It takes a few seconds to read the chip.  What's going on in there is the car.  The chip is actually generating a unique ID, right, which is then sent to the bank.  The bank verifies based on who they think you are in the time.  Oh, yeah. Credit cards, right?  Pardon me. That's credit cards, right?  Yeah, I don't know how ATM works. Those are because our because our ATM cards or debit cards,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a lot of them have tapped tap and pay.  So you don't have to swipe or insert. No, I don't think we have tap or nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Unless you're using Android Pay or we got something you don't.  You got lots of things. You got Rob Ford.  You got lots of things we don't have.  Anyway, let's talk let's talk about something more interesting, maybe not more interesting, more apropos.  I'm sure Tuesday night this was covered heavily on all about Android.  But new phones, Nexus 6P, a five point seven inch beautiful from what I've seen aluminum phone made by Huawei.  This is the premium. That's what the P stands for.  Premium Nexus and it has a Snapdragon 810 and it has a 12 plus megapixel camera with laser focusing and all sorts of super duper features,  including as far as I can tell, the largest pixel size on any any flagship phone, one point five five microns bigger than Apple.  And that should help in low light does not have optical image stabilization, which surprises me a little bit.  But they they tried to rationalize that away.  So no, no, you don't need it. It's so good.  Look how nice that looks. So fingerprint reader on the back of the dimple where you find a big hump that everybody thought was going to have.  No, and it has a porthole kind of see that.  But it's not too humpy, not too humpy, a little bit humpy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the five is humpier.  Yeah, it looks good. I think this is probably the nicest looking Nexus device hands down that that they've ever put out or not Google that the manufacturers look big in the hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although they say very, very narrow bezels mean it's not a very big phone.  And Samsung did the same thing with the Note 5. This is the Note 5 size and the Note 5 does not feel that big.  The Apple iPhone is bigger. In fact, Google took a little shot at that by showing an iPhone and how big the bezels are.  iPhone has a smaller screen, the bigger form factor.  Battery life is going to be the big question. This thing has a big battery.  Three thousand four hundred fifty milliamp hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that versus the next six, you know, you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would bet the Nexus six is three thousand or less, but let me look up.  Yeah, I don't remember. I think we'll tell us.  So a typical three thousand is big. No, five has really, I think, three thousand.  OK, somebody saying the Nexus six is thirty to twenty. So it's bigger than that.  It also because of Marshmallow.  And I talked to a number of people, including Russell Holly, who've been using Marshmallow, say there is significantly better battery life.  Google claimed 30 percent battery life from Marshmallow alone. That's good.  So this could be a battery beast.  Wonderful. That would be wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It would be wonderful. But, you know, the manufacturers generally don't put bigger batteries in.  You know, they design these things to be as small, thin as possible.  They put the battery in that they think will last a certain amount of time.  They aren't usually generous, overly generous with batteries because they want to keep the phones thin and small.  So it'll be really interesting to see if you can go more than a day.  I mean, I know my Nexus six. What do I call it now? Regular standard? No letters?  The giant thing? Yeah, the Nexus six. I mean, it goes it goes the whole day.  It goes the whole day. I did not experience that. Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. I never get through the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I mean, when I'm out of the country and searching for right is all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's one reason. One reason why it's hard to be.  I mean, dinner time is and by the way, no other phone except the one plus one from last year goes past dinner time either.  And the way they handle that is with fast charging.  This this I don't know if it's going to have fast charging.  It's not going to have wireless charging, which is a little bit of a disappointment, although apparently that's because it's a metal case.  It would be very difficult to do that, but it will have this giant battery type C connector.  I don't know if it's a USB three point one connector or two point.  Oh, but it is the type C physically, as as will the other phone, the five X.  I'm glad to hear that the camera sounds comparable to Apple's F2 4K video recording.  Two hundred forty frames per second, slow mo, thirty frame per second burst mode.  That's something that's something the Apple does.  And it really well, it's nice and it's not nice because if you hold if you forget and you hold the button, all of a sudden you got a lot of images.  But but as Gina Tripani pointed out, it'll be very nice for Google's auto. Awesome.  You get some of those nice animated GIFs.  Five hundred fifteen pixels per inch on the five point seven inch quad HD display.  It's AMOLED. That's AMOLED, isn't it? The Nexus six. I like AMOLED displays.  The updated eight ten three gigs of RAM. I would like to see four.  Android sensor hub, which is something Motorola debuted in 2013 with its Moto X.  Remember, it had a separate coprocessor that was all that's what was always listening.  Otherwise, you kill the main kill the battery by having the main processor fired up.  So step down. Apple does it now, too. They call it their motion processor.  The whole. So this is going to be eventually industry wide.  The whole idea of a it's kind of a slower processor that's just dedicated to, you know, listening for the keywords, you know, the accelerometer, things like that.  All the background stuff. Yeah. Yep. The ambient display.  It'll know when you pick up the phone, things like that.  Fingerprint reading is a must. Wouldn't buy a phone that didn't have a fingerprint reader at this point.  It really wouldn't. You don't know yet. You will. OK.  I'll wait. Once you once you know, once you go that way, it's just you don't ever want to stop as long as it's effective and fast.  Marshmallow looks good. I can't wait to do the what is it now to tap tap me now to tap me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is it called? Leo, I was just going to say about fingerprints.  I'm pretty sure unless I'm mistaken that if you have a pin code to unlock your phone, the police cannot force you to unlock it.  That's right. It's a fingerprint. They can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know what it is in Canada, but that's true in the States.  And the reason is it's something in your head is protected by the Fifth Amendment, but something physical.  And this goes back to hair samples, fingerprints themselves.  You know, they can compel somebody who's been arrested, not even convicted, but arrested to give up a fingerprint.  You can't refuse. Supreme Court has held that.  So your fingerprint on a phone is considered not protected by the Fifth Amendment.  So that's very important. It's not considered that you're self-incriminating if they just put your finger on there.  Is that true in Canada as well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a good question, actually. I'm pretty sure we don't have as much protection for those sorts of things.  I'm pretty sure they can look at whatever they want and take whatever they want out of your phone.  Mounties, so you trust them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Both of Mounties.  We're very trusting.  You know, I always, maybe because of Dudley Do-Right, but I always thought Mounties are like, like really true blue, straight arrow, kind of like Eagle Scouts.  And then when I started going to Canada, I heard so many horror stories.  They're like, they're like, no, God, I don't want to say this out loud.  Sorry, if you're a Mountie, I love you.  But apparently the RCMP is considered to be kind of rough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Rough, you mean?  Tough.  Rough like how?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like they don't take no crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, they are the best of the best. They're like, they're like the Marines, you know.  OK, I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The best of the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's good.  Theoretically.  I can never go to Canada again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're going to pull you over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  TexasAGI93 in the chat room says they're the Queen's Cowboys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know what that means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Order now and you will get the 6P in November.  If you ordered really, really quickly, you might have been able to get it this.  Was it the first October?  Wasn't the first report that it was going to be October?  They say it'll ship in October.  But maybe there was only a dozen of them.  I don't know, because I ordered it as soon as the store.  You know what we were doing the event.  Gina and Russell and I are doing the event.  The chat room gives me a link.  It's not even on the front page of the store.  There's a deep link into the store.  I go. I order it November 4th.  So I don't know who got it in October.  I'm like the 15th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What did Gina order? Did she?  Oh, yeah, she ordered the 6P.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everybody ordered the 6P.  That's the one you want.  I don't even know why they make the 5X.  Other countries.  Maybe.  One of the things I think Sundar Pichai announced,  1.4 billion monthly active Android devices.  1.4 billion.  Most of those are $25 phones in developing nations.  Does that count Chromecast?  No.  No, Android devices.  And I think the Android TV devices can't be but a tiny fraction of that.  It's phones.  It's amazing.  If you purchase a new phone, you get a 90-day free subscription to Google Music.  Is that to the family or just individual?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They did announce a family plan for $15.  I'm really excited about it.  Great deal.  You needed that because unlike all the other music stores,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you couldn't share your password on Google Music because it was your Google account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if I wanted to give my wife, you know, hey, you want to listen to my music?  I mean, I couldn't because I'd have to give her my Google credentials.  So they needed a family plan.  I hope they implement it nicely. We'll see.  We don't know yet.  You also get a $50 credit to the Google Play Store, presumably to pay for all the apps you'll be giving up when you leave iPhone.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And this is only available in the Google Play Store, right?  The carriers aren't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In the U.S. store only.  They did say that internationally they were doing deals with carriers in other stores.  But in the U.S., at least for now, you have to go to store.google.com.  And as you mentioned, Jeff, they announced a Nexus Protect extended warranty that is much like the AppleCare Plus.  It's two years.  It's not a warranty. It's one year, but it does add accidental damage protection.  It's 89 bucks for the 6P.  And if you drop it, they'll replace it.  There's a $79 deductible and you can have up to two incidents a year.  I mean, in the life of the thing.  That's not bad.  It's very similar to Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's similar to Apple.  It's 79 bucks.  Yeah.  As my son could attest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's really interesting.  I mean, even during this event, it's really clear.  This is all targeted at Apple.  They showed the new Google Photos photo sharing, which looked really great.  And the name of the album was Apple Picking.  Poor choice of words.  Ostensibly Apple Tree, Apple Picking.  But they kept saying Apple Picking, Apple Picking.  I can't think that was an accident.  It was just a happy coincidence.  I would be very interested to get this phone.  All it needs for me to go back to Android is all day battery life.  You get all day.  I get all day.  Yeah.  Unless I have a runaway app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Recently, the app that I used for my business email was suddenly just taking up 30% of my battery.  Got rid of that and I'm back to all day.  I unplug it when I get up in the morning at say 8 o'clock.  And then sometimes I'll go all day and I won't plug it in until I go to bed.  And if I do that, it is down to getting the warning 7% or something.  But I can make it all day.  I think my problem is Twitter.  I don't know that.  But you can tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, you can look at these.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the number one biggest resource hog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I mean, every time I refresh.  And I find I'm using because the same thing.  I find I'm using it a lot more than my iPad.  Right.  Yeah, me too.  You know, my of course you could eliminate apps, you know, take all that stuff off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could turn off GPS.  You could turn off all this stuff and you could improve the battery life.  But I really want to try it with everything that I want to use.  I want it to be a full featured phone and get through the day.  And you don't want to have to keep fiddling with it like, oh, I'm going to turn the Wi-Fi off now and then.  Oh, I'm back to my iPhone.  I'm going to turn the Wi-Fi off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I know you can use apps.  I was going to order about about putting things to sleep.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  One of my mistakes is I leave ways on when I get to the garage.  I forget to turn it on.  Right.  That'll drain a battery so quickly.  They really should have some fix for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know what it would be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, Maps doesn't do that.  Yeah, I guess Waze is just pinging all the time.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You know, pinging the network and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nexus 5X is the affordable and the X apparently stands for next.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  This is the X and X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wasn't there a rumor that they weren't going to do these anymore?  These Nexus phones.  What happened?  Yeah, I read that was going to be one silver.  They were just not going to do phones anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's right.  I'm glad they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's interesting because I think what they're doing is they're trying to get the phone to work.  I'm glad they are.  Well, it's interesting because I think what they finally said is, oh, screw the other guys.  We're just going to just because this is in.  You know, you could say you could make the case that the six was a developer.  The six that your six last year six was it was a little expensive for developer phone.  But it was but really was just aimed at developers and not really aimed at taking any segment of the market because it's so big.  And, you know, it just it wasn't that compelling of a phone.  These are these phones are compelling.  I feel like they compete right dead against the, you know, Samsung's and the HTC's may be better in every respect.  So the five X will be a little bit less processor.  The eight oh eight, which is actually I have a number of phones is fine.  Ten eighty P display, not the quad HD.  Same exact camera, though.  I think that's really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No compromise on the camera, especially since it's coming from two different manufacturers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a Sony camera in there and the USB charging.  Fingerprint sensor on the back.  Google, I think, is saying that's a requirement now.  I really feel like for not for all phones, not for a twenty five dollar phone, but for the U.S. market, I think the fingerprint reader, especially are they going to require the extra antennas for Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, it will be Google find compatible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, no. Will they require that for other manufacturers?  Oh, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's an interesting question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What color did you get by the way of the X of the P graphite?  So did I. Black is black.  Man of taste.  That turquoise five X is a little weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it looks like the that mint, mint Kickstarter phone.  I can remember the name of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Looks like a refrigerator.  Should have got rid of 30 years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's refreshing.  Now on tap.  That's the thing about the back, the back, the back placement of the finger.  I like it.  I think that's going to work.  I'm convinced.  So Samsung and Apple and one plus all put it on the home button.  And it's I don't think that's good.  I think that that's double that's overloading the function of the home button in a way that I don't want to do that.  For instance, I'll give you an example.  It's by the way, this is the iPhone 6s plus.  It's so fast now that you can't turn on the phone.  If you wanted to see what your notifications were or what time it is, you want to turn on the phone with the home button.  It just it unlocks it instantly.  So you can't do that.  It's better to have it separate.  Now, there is a phone, the new Sony's when they come out, the experience that will have the fingerprint reader on the on off switch.  That sounds pretty sensible.  But you do hold the phone.  I mean, I don't think it's they've always had that dimple.  Motorola's always put that dimple on the back and you do hold the phone that way.  I think that's not going to be hard to get used to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We shall see.  So I erupted you.  You're the figure you really can't wait for is the now on tap.  Now on tap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now on tap.  That's where you're in an app.  The app has to be now aware and you can get now to help you out in some ways with the app.  And that's it.  Any more.  Yes.  Yes.  That's marshmallow.  That's marshmallow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would be handy.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Double tap the power button to activate the camera like that.  They're going to have in the X a twenty seven hundred milliamp hour battery,  which is probably comparable to the thirty four fifty given that you only have a ten eighty piece screen.  Two gigs of memory, not three.  I think more memory makes a big difference.  The note five with exactly the same touch was crap where as the S six does handles it much better.  The S six hesitates all the time.  It only has three gigs of RAM.  I think putting four is a good idea.  But Google, maybe they know better.  Sixteen gigabyte.  By the way, the Nexus five X has different memory config storage configuration.  Sixteen and thirty two.  So the sixteen starts at three seventy nine compared with the thirty two six P at four ninety nine.  These are awfully close.  I don't feel like one is a low cost phone and one isn't.  No.  Some people just like smaller phones.  It could be.  Before the show got started, I was saying that my wife prefers a smaller phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She doesn't want the six family.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I think I think that's why they're still doing is people still want a smaller phone and they want to capture that segment of the population that wants a smaller phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you're right.  When you look at the price in the features of the phone, I mean, why you would you would go for the six.  Right.  I mean, I think that's why they're still doing it.  I think that's why they're still doing it.  It's not that big either.  It's not as big as yours.  Yours is five point seven inches.  Sixteen and thirty two gig memory configurations.  It comes in carbon vanilla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know what do they call the white quartz and minty fresh ice.  They also announced that they're going to have a new phone.  Quartz and minty fresh ice.  They also announced this is going to be interesting.  New Chromecast.  I don't think the new Chromecast are particularly different.  They did announce now that they'll have broader support for Chromecast.  Still no Amazon streaming.  That may never happen.  But Spotify support.  Spotify.  Love that.  Let me open it up.  Little unboxing here.  This is a lemon yellow Chromecast.  They did add Showtime, by the way, as one of the Chromecast-iest.  So they now Chromecast Showtime, which is good.  As well as Netflix, of course, and Hulu and Pandora, HBO, Go, YouTube, CBS, I Heart Radio, Google Play Music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I get three of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I ordered four.  I ordered four.  No, I only ordered two of these.  I actually ordered four of the other one.  So here's what it looks like.  No, I got three of those services.  Oh, three of those services.  Yeah.  So what they've done in the old Chromecast had the HDMI port right in it.  So you would jam it in there.  But if you didn't have room, they did have a little extender USB thing.  And especially if you're sticking it behind an AV receiver, that was going to be handy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  They always shipped it with a little extra dongle extender that you could put in there.  It makes sense.  Someone did a cost benefit analysis on this and said, you know what?  If we just make this thing flexible from the get-go, we'll be all set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They ship it now with a power adapter, which they didn't use to, but they always had the USB cable.  So you still need the external power.  And that's just really because the MHC HDMI that powers is so rarely found anywhere.  They can't count on you getting power from the HDMI port.  Better Wi-Fi.  And in fact, beamforming Wi-Fi, which is interesting.  The antennas will tune toward your Wi-Fi access point.  At least that's what they said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe that's why it's bigger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Bigger antenna.  802.11ac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Differently with the new Google Router.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It probably has some on-hub features.  They didn't mention that.  In fact, they didn't mention the router at all.  Still 35 bucks.  Do you guys have trouble with Wi-Fi in Chromecast?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, I have.  You do.  This is also a 5 gigahertz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if it's dual band or just 5 gigahertz, but it will at least do 5 gigahertz, which is usually better if you have Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mine sometimes forgets the network in the middle of streaming.  That's terrible.  Or it has problems connecting to it, even though I'm using the correct password.  I sometimes have to reboot the router.  So that could be my sort of janky network setup.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mine has problems with the...  In the makerspace, actually, we've got a Chrome or a Comcast router for business.  And for whatever reason, it won't connect to that router.  So I have to have a second router that's attached to the main router that it connects to.  It's a known bug.  Weird.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The point being that everybody has crappy Wi-Fi.  Don't blame yourself.  That's true.  It has issues of some sort or other.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do we know when the new Chromecast app is coming out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would say soon, because this is already arriving at people's houses, the new Chromecast.  So I would say very soon.  Up to now, the Chromecast app only did one thing.  You used it to configure a Chromecast, and then you were done.  You never used it again.  Now it actually is a discovery tool.  It shows all the different apps that you have, what you can watch on those apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Chromecast advantage lasted about three weeks.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I love Chromecast.  I do too.  Me too.  It works great.  Sometimes people complain because they have to use their smartphone as the remote and they have to fire up.  I like doing that.  I prefer that.  I find the interface of the smartphone.  If I'm going to search for a movie on Netflix, which is easier, doing it with a remote control on your TV or on your phone?  Plus it makes this so much cheaper.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, I've got, since I can't get Hulu and our Netflix is crap and a bunch of other stuff that I won't go into, I've got a lot of stuff that I stream and movies and content through Plex.  And so Plex has Chromecast support built in.  So I've got a Plex server.  I just stream it through the Chromecast, like through my phone to the Chromecast works great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there's so many good uses for the Chromecast.  And now Chromecast audio.  And if I were so no side, be worried.  I'm interested in that.  So right now you can get Sonos.  They just announced an updated Play 5 speaker with better audio.  But most people, the way they buy Sonos is they buy the speaker.  It uses the Wi-Fi to configure its own mesh network, usually for sharing music so that the party mode is flawless on Sonos.  It means that there's no echo, no latency.  Everything's synced up.  No matter how many Sonos speakers you have.  But it's really, really pricey.  There is also a Sonos Connect that's somewhat like this new Chromecast audio.  You can use it to connect your existing speakers to your Sonos network.  And I like that.  But now Google is moving into this business with the Chromecast audio.  This is an audio only version of Chromecast.  Similar form factor, a little smaller.  And yeah, they pointed out it has grooves like a little vinyl record.  It's a nice touch.  Yeah, it is.  There is a button on it.  That must be a pairing button.  That's interesting.  Comes with an analog cable.  But they did say, and I don't see where it is, that it also supports.  Didn't they say it supports optical and RCA?  Where?  Maybe there's something in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe there's an adapter.  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hmm.  Maybe there's an aftermarket adapter.  I don't know.  Still needs power.  But the idea is now you can do audio into any speaker.  So if you have a standalone powered speaker or a stereo system,  you can use this to stream audio to it.  And I guess a lot of people now have powered speakers.  Computer speakers are powered speakers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was pretty close to getting a Sonos, or at least one or two.  And that's going to be like $600.  Whereas I could just get one of those or two of those or three of those.  Yeah, these are $35 also.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  2.4 and 5 GHz Wi-Fi.  Also the adaptive antenna system.  Wireless control from your home, high fidelity streaming.  We'll have to see what the fidelity is on these.  That may not be good.  I don't know.  And they say, it says on the box, it says optical and RCA,  as well as a mini jack.  But I don't know how.  How you do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It just has the eighth inch.  So it's got to be some sort of adapter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it won't sink though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This won't sink your audio across your whole house.  They said it would coming soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it doesn't have the box.  You can do that in software, right?  Yeah, but you don't want to do that in software.  So they say they're going to have a firmware update that will support that.  That's the secret sauce for Sonos.  People don't really understand the biggest thing.  You could do exactly as you say.  There's lots of ways to have speakers all play the same music in the house.  But getting them synced is very difficult.  At the same time, very difficult.  There's an echo.  And then it's really not pleasant.  There's phasing and echo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can do it with radio.  I've looked at this for the past, since 2006, I started looking at Sonos,  trying to figure out how they do this.  And it is not easy.  It is not easy.  The easiest way to do it is to hook radios up to all the speakers that you want  and broadcast your own radio station with your own music.  Because that's real time.  Yeah, you can do that.  But then it's still the reception is kind of crappy.  It's not high fidelity.  And I've got some little 2.4 GHz transceivers I'm playing with to see if I can get this to work.  But if they can make this sync audio on these little things, they're going to sell...  Then Sonos is in trouble.  That would be huge.  Yeah, they're going to sell a crap ton of these little devices  if they can sync music to different speakers in different parts of the house at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you guys think that lots of people have powered speakers?  I mean, like that's a common thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's certainly common.  Most people I know have them.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Plus, it has an advantage over Sonos.  You can determine how good you want your speakers to be.  And for instance, I got four of these, but two of them are going to go...  I have two stereo systems.  They're going to go in the back, I'm hoping via optical, although I don't know how.  Maybe there's a USB adapter or something.  But they're going to go in the back, and that will be awesome.  Because if this...  And this is the big question mark.  Where's the music coming from?  Is it coming from your phone?  Or is this like the video Chromecast where it makes its own connection?  Right, right.  Because if it's coming from the phone, that's not going to be good.  But I would guess this is making its own connection, which means this could be very high quality.  Because from the Wi-Fi, once you do the A to D conversion, or if you're using an optical cable,  you don't do any conversion from the D to A.  So this could be very high fidelity, depending on what you're streaming from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the chat room says the three millimeter also has optical.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You need to buy a cable.  I think that's right.  I think that's what it is.  And I guess you could also buy a RCA adapter.  Here we go.  Thank you, Virgil.  In the chat room, he's got a link to the Google page.  Yeah, that makes sense.  Because you can get optical three, three and a half millimeter optical cables.  Here's compatible cables and plugs.  That's the one that comes with the analog cable.  And then there's a RCA adapter, not included, but you could buy in a TOSlink adapter.  Yeah, I can.  Yeah, I have, I think, one of these that's a three and a half millimeter TOSlink.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mini, it's mini TOSlink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That would be the way to do it.  It's going to be cool when we get that in a couple of years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, Canada. Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, is this, did this come out of the Chromecast team or did it come out of the Nexus Q team?  That's what I want to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We may never know the answer to that question.  Maybe it's old Qs. They took them apart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they took them apart, just took the essential components out.  Who needs that big ball?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't need new Chromecast.  I don't see a huge difference in the Chromecast video, but I bought a bunch of like four Chromecast audiences.  I feel like that is very exciting.  Yeah.  And I am, I'm all in on Sonos.  I don't want to count how many Sonos speakers I have because then I'll start thinking about how much I've spent.  They're really, they really add up.  But if, but the way you do it and the way they get you is you do it one room at a time.  And before you know it, you spend $5,000.  And they are great.  They're great.  I mean, they are great.  I love my Sonos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the service gives support for just about every kind of streaming audio thing you can imagine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And let's, we'll say it again.  As soon as they get some, as soon as they get Google Now on this stuff, that's when it's going to take off.  I guess it sort of is because Google Now is in your phone.  So you could use the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pull out your phone and say, that would be cool.  Pull out your phone and say, okay Google, play Rolling Stones in the living room.  And it just starts playing in the living room.  Get out of here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That would be cool.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That couldn't be that hard.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it wouldn't be hard at all.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I say that not knowing anything about how that works.  It's magic.  I mean, how hard could it be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, logic is already there, right?  I mean, it's just adding that last little bit of logic in the living room so that it understands, oh yeah, I know I'm connected to the living room.  I know what that means.  Audio, whatever it's called, Chromecast audio, and then play there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what do we think?  Pretty good announcement for Google.  Some good stuff.  Very good stuff.  Wait, there's more.  But wait.  Wait.  In fact, the biggest story is yet to come, but we're going to take a break and talk about that.  The one more thing.  I feel bad for Google because there was absolutely nothing that we didn't already know, right?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Was that on purpose?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  If you think about the bang that Apple gets from the secrecy versus the kind of wet firecracker that the Google announcement was.  Google has partners.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Partners for Apple.  And they don't have the, I think they don't have the DNA for like really keeping stuff secret.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They don't cut people off either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  You're not going to get fired at Google for, well, maybe you would.  Maybe you would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apple will cut you off.  Oh, yeah.  If they know that you blabbed, you will never get anything from Apple ever.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't blab.  That's not why I get nothing from Apple.  I just want you to know.  I don't do NDAs or any of that stuff just because I know I would blab because I have no, I don't remember anything.  Did I tell them I wouldn't say that?  I don't remember that.  I did actually once, many years ago, break an NDA by accident and I felt terrible about it.  I was only by a day, but I felt terrible about it.  And that was the last time I signed an NDA because I just don't have the brain cells to remember what I know and don't know.  It's like lying.  You know, it's like, oh, I don't know that.  Our show today brought to you by Blue Apron.  Really glad to have Matthew Ingram here, Aaron Newcomb, Jeff Jarvis from Medailline, where he's making a little drug run for us.  Little tip.  Don't swallow those balloons.  Just kidding.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Just kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff the mule Jarvis.  You can't go to Canada or Columbia or Canada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't go anywhere.  And I can't go to an Apple event either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just I'm joking.  It's a it's comedy.  Our show today, by the way, Jeff wasn't sitting there.  So don't tell him what I said.  Our show today brought to you by Blue Apron.  Blue Apron will send you all the ingredients to cook fresh, yummy meals right in your home.  You know, I think we all work together.  Right in your home.  You know, I think we all work pretty hard.  We get to the end of the day.  The last thing you want to do is go to the grocery store and pick up the ingredients to make a great meal.  If you go to the grocery store, it's hot dogs, buns and a pack of frozen french fries most of the time.  But wouldn't it be nice to make a lovely meal for your loved one or one's Blue Apron?  When you get home, you got the Blue Apron box sitting right there.  Fresh, delicious ingredients.  This is Jason Howell making something so amazing with his Blue Apron.  What's neat is all the ingredients are perfectly proportioned.  There's no way.  So you see the spices?  That's the packet.  You use it up.  You get, you know, just what you need and nothing more.  The produce is fresh from local producers.  The meat and fish are always fresh, never frozen.  It's the kind of stuff you'd buy if you went out to buy it.  And then you get this great recipe card that explains how to make it.  And they're unusual recipes.  That's what's fun about it.  You're learning new techniques.  In fact, they even have free videos on the website you can visit and learn a little more.  I've gotten such great cooking ideas, found new ingredients, and my confidence level has increased.  Thanks to Blue Apron for less than 10 bucks a meal.  By the way, they have a family plan too where they'll give you kid-friendly ingredients so the whole family can eat well.  And have fun learning to cook, man.  That's the, if you could give one thing to your kids, it'd probably be a love for cooking and great food.  Each balanced meal is 500 to 700 calories per serving.  Very yummy.  Look at that.  Oh, man.  Jason made that.  Cooking takes about half an hour, although I'm a little slower, but that's fine.  You know, you basically can move as fast or slow as you want because it's your kitchen now.  Shipping is free and the menus are always new.  You won't get the same meal twice, which is nice.  No repetition.  Although once you learn how to cook, you know, crispy Cajun catfish with dirty rice and spicy remoulade,  you will know how to do it next time.  And then you're ready.  You feel confident.  Oh, look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I'm hoping that they fix the Android Pay bug.  What's the bug?  It's not a bug.  I shouldn't say that.  There's an issue with Android Pay.  If you're rooted, if you rooted your phone, then it's considered a security risk.  And when they go through and do all their checks, they say, nope, sorry, you can't use this.  Samsung does that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you have rooted a Samsung device, you can't use Knox.  But that makes sense because you've now made it insecure.  You made it insecure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you know what?  I'm willing to take that risk.  You know what?  They're never going to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's not a bug.  They're not going to fix that.  We'll see.  I promise.  They'll be a workaround.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They may not fix it, but I'll run it.  They did that with Google Wallet too when I got around it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They also do it with Netflix and stuff so that you can't steal movies.  I'd be surprised.  It's not Google.  It's the credit card companies.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And like I said, it's not a bug.  It's a feature.  It's a security feature.  But it just pains me because I actually do love to use the tap and pay on my phone and  I can't right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But as soon as you root your phone, you have broken the security model and they can't trust  it anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Especially because now with Android Pay, it runs all the time as long as your phone is  unlocked which is different than Google Wallet.  So when I used to go up to McDonald's, let's say, and scan on the little thing, I would  put my pin in then.  So Google Wallet would come to the forefront of the phone and I would put my pin in.  Now it's tied to the security of your phone.  So it's always, whenever your phone is unlocked, it's always available.  And so the security model has changed.  I don't know.  I kind of wish there was at least an option to go back to that Google Wallet model and  be able to use it on my rooted phone.  But we'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would be shocked if they did anything sanctioned to make that work.  I just can't imagine.  So let's talk about the Pixel C. Again, this one rumored.  But the rumor broke just before, you know, the day before the event.  So we didn't have time to really talk about it.  You sound excited, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know me.  I'll go nuts for any of this stuff.  And I'm speaking to you right now, of course, from my Chromebook Pixel.  So a Pixel C just has a Pavlovian response from me.  I don't know what I'm going to feel.  I mean, the problem is it's a 10-inch tablet.  I hate tablets that big.  Unless it really is basically just a laptop.  In which case, is that going to be a better laptop than the one I'm on?  That will be smaller.  Is Android really ready to be my primary machine?  I'm not too sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think so.  We should point out 10 inches is this is iPad size.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not massive.  I don't like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like the 10 inch.  Well, and I really am impressed by the keyboard.  And the magnetic mechanism was very impressive.  In fact, I had to think that Microsoft because these, you know, these are just basically  like the Surface.  You know, they were the first to kind of kind of do these.  Maybe now, actually, you know what?  Lenovo with the yoga and a few other companies were the first to do these convertibles.  But this magnetic latching system where the keyboard is the cover and then as you flip  it around, it catches with the magnet and becomes a kickstand keyboard combo is brilliant.  It is the best way of doing this I've ever seen.  The Surface, you've got, you know, Pogo pins and it's this is just brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What if you want to just use it as a tablet but you have the keyboard with you?  Does that become extra back?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The keyboard is extra so you don't have to buy the keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, no.  It's different.  So you walk around with what you do.  But you want to watch a movie now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the keyboards are covered.  I presume you could just take it off or flip it around.  That is flipping around.  Right.  Yeah, you don't want your keys on the table, right?  It's a new processor, the Nvidia Tegra X1.  These are the K1 was in the Shields.  It's an amazing processor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Very good.  Still still really fast.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I don't know anything about the X1, by the way.  Quad core.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How much?  Seven millimeters it says.  That's pretty for a 10 inch tablet.  Oh, thick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Very thin.  Yeah, very thin.  It starts at $499.  The keyboard is $149.  So now we're saying it's a lap.  It's cost about the same as a laptop.  Screen.  So Mike Elgin played with it on the demo floor.  He said the keyboard is almost identical to your Chromebook pixel keyboard, which is in  other words, you love that, right, Jeff?  It's a good keyboard.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Love it.  So that means it's better than the Surface type keyboard.  And it's got to be a lot better than that crap Apple keyboard they're selling for the  iPad Pro.  That thing really doesn't look good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll get one of these.  In terms of how I use it.  All I'll say this here in Medellin, I'm hauling around my Chromebook pixel today because of  doing the show.  I went out to see the city.  I'm carrying my briefcase.  I got the heavy laptop in it.  So something lighter would be would be wonderful.  But again, I don't know if it's gonna be real.  But would it be robust up to the show?  It could do Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, finally, you'd be able to do Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually wish I just got a new iPad Air, the 10 inch.  If I hadn't just got one, I would be thinking about getting this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's very camera on the on the long end or the short end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me see if I can tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it says as to the long end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Front facing camera.  There it is on the long end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's exactly where you would expect it on a laptop.  It's the top center.  It is Android, which but yeah, I think it's interesting that he chose to do this as an  Android device.  I can see why it's not a Chrome OS device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's a tablet.  It is a tablet.  And I think I said this before last time I was here the time before.  I don't know.  I get them all confused now.  But you know, I ran Android as a desktop.  I plugged it into my big monitor, had the keyboard set up and everything.  And I ran it.  I had no problem with it as a daily driver.  I totally could have done it as a daily driver.  And there was a lot of things that I liked better, maybe because I was used to using  my phone.  I don't know.  But I really enjoyed it.  I had no problem at all using it as a regular device, as a laptop type device.  Or in this case, a desktop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know, you got a point.  Because the other thing is that I carry my Chromebook Pixel and my Nexus 7 and my Nexus  Right.  That's crazy.  If I carry that, you know, yes, it's bigger than the tablet that I want, but it's on airplanes  and such.  It would be damn nice.  Battery life is going to be a question, I think, because it's screen that big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They didn't really say what the battery life would be, but this should have a 10 hour battery.  I would think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually think you could do without your laptop altogether.  Yeah.  Theoretically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  This could take the place of your laptop and your tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So hard for us to think of Android as a desktop operating system, but I can't think of why  it isn't.  It works great.  All the apps, there's a file system.  There's...  Yeah.  I mean, it actually is probably more of an operating system than a Chromebook, which  doesn't have a file system, really.  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it's not quite as smooth as, you know, docs.  On the Chromebook, it's pretty damn easy to store your docs and that kind of stuff.  You can find them on phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's impossible.  Well, actually, I guess you could run Chrome on your Pixel C and you'd be a Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you think about it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, just access your docs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You just don't ever leave Chrome and you'll feel quite at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look at this.  Look at this.  Look at this magnet.  This is so awesome.  This thing must be some rare earth neodymium.  He's swinging the thing around.  It's holding the tablet via the magnet.  And it really seems like a...  It charges the keyboard.  That's another cool thing.  But the ducted's charging.  There's no pogo pins.  It charges the keyboard from the tablet via basically wireless charging.  And of course, these keyboards aren't...  They don't use much power.  But that means your keyboard would never be dead.  You just keep the tablet charged.  That's your only responsibility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What kind of battery life does it get?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think they said.  Did they say?  Chatroom, did they say?  So somebody's saying, well, how do you know how the...  I don't know how the iPad keyboard is, but I don't like it that it's fabric covered.  Yes.  I think right there, that's a problem.  But you're right.  I haven't tried it yet.  I have tried the key mechanisms.  Those keys are on the MacBook and it's a very poor experience on the MacBook.  The hardest...  I love the MacBook.  The hardest thing about getting used to the MacBook is getting used to the short travel  keys.  They're just very hard to type accurately on.  And according to Mike, who tried this keyboard, this is as good as the...  In fact, it seems to be very similar to, except for some slight changes in pitch, the Chromebook  Pixels keyboard, which is a very good keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it makes you wonder, you know, we're talking about Android versus Chrome OS.  I mean, it kind of brings up the question, why do they have two things?  Why if Android's robust enough to run a workplace tablet?  Why do you need this whole separate OS for the Chromebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is Chrome OS going to be the education OS?  What is the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's going on?  Well, Apple just...  I think that's exactly it, Leo.  I think Apple just said they're not going to combine the two OSes either.  Google says that very soon they'll have more Chromebooks in schools than all other devices  combined.  Some people said this is the death of the Chromebook.  I just don't believe that.  I think the Chromebook has its role.  And I think it may even actually grow in a business sense.  And it is more limited, easier to maintain for IT.  It is easier to find files and things.  It just works better as an operating system.  Could you imagine having designed two versions of the operating system from the get-go?  Yeah, but that's where we are, with both iOS and Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  I think...  I never have understood why they do the Chromebooks.  I mean, I don't understand why they do Chrome OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got in this debate with Sundar Pichai himself when he was running Chrome OS.  He said, what's this?  Well, he has to defend his hand, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But now maybe he's come around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've come around in the Chromebook.  Like, Jeff, I use the Pixel and I really feel like this is a full computer system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's nothing I can...  It absolutely is.  It's the best thing going.  I would never go back.  It's so lovely.  This is the cloud, folks.  Get used to it.  This is the world we're in.  And I don't need all that cross and crap locally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I will say this.  My dad has one and he's never called me once for tech support.  There you go.  Yeah.  Which, you know, my mom...  Windows and everything, they call me all the time for the Chromebook.  Never a call.  After I got it set up for him, he's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They were handing them out at where my mom lives, retirement facility.  They were basically handing them out and getting people to use them.  And they're great in schools.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Are you guys calling me a retiree?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Jeff, you're the hardest working man in show business.  Yeah.  Retired?  Hell, 20-year-old would have a hard time keeping your schedule.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the way, I found a few resources on the Pixel C that say 10-hour battery life...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sure that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Estimated.  And Mashable has said twice in their review, it has great battery life, whatever that means.  Well, that's Google's work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You could also recharge it from a portable battery pack.  Oh, good point.  Go on the plane.  I have tried to use charging things on my...  Because now that I have a C on the Chromebook Pixel, where I tried to use a big battery,  now it doesn't charge.  I don't know if it maintains it or not, but it does not charge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the Huawei compared to the...  Whoops, it's setting off the Apple Watch.  Can you see...  Where is that?  There it is.  I think the Huawei is actually as pretty as the Apple Watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is.  For as thick as it is, it's still pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And look how it's always on.  That's not the ambient mode.  It goes a little bit darker.  This color goes off.  But it's basically...  That's the screen.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's nice.  How much are they?  A little heavy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's...  I want to say $499 or $399.  I thought it was $399.  All right.  You could be...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The thing is, I don't see a reason right now to replace my Moto 360.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, and I think the 360 is good too.  But this is a $750 Apple Watch compared to a $400...  It's not really that much thicker.  I guess really the determination is which platform you're using.  I wouldn't use an Android Wear Watch on an Apple and I wouldn't use...  You can't use an iPhone or an Apple Watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Has anyone tried an Android Wear Watch that you know about on Apple?  Yeah, I think Megan did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It works.  Some notifications...  It's just not as full featured.  It just makes sense to get the watch that goes with the operating system you're using, frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Steel Link band is $449.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it doesn't come...  This is...  The whole thing is $449.  Right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can get a leather one for $349.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like that.  I like the LED screen.  Are you having a party in there?  What's going on in there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sorry.  They're working.  I'm in the room where they're doing all the social media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's what it is.  It's social media.  So Mike Elgin made an interesting observation.  I think of good insight on the Pixel C, this tablet.  They pointed out it has an array mic.  Effectively, it has an array mic on the side.  Multiple microphones.  I can't remember how many they said, but quite a few.  Those are typically used sound pressure microphones, that kind of thing, in an environment where  you want to pick up what's going on in the room.  Mike said this...  There it is.  That's the array mic.  Mike said...  Mike said, this could be the Echo killer.  You talk to your Pixel C from across the room.  Interesting idea.  Mike and I, along with a lot of people and tech enthusiasts, love the Amazon Echo.  I would be very interested in it.  The idea of empowering your home to listen to you and respond is pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Google Now is already so useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is.  It's so much more useful than any other...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because it knows so much about you.  It knows your calendar, it knows your email, it knows what photos you took.  Imagine that, except voice controlled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Love it.  I love the idea.  We were talking about Surface earlier on Windows Weekly.  Richard Campbell, one of our guests, said, a tablet really is a coffee table device.  It doesn't belong to any one person.  It's something you leave on the coffee table in front of the TV.  That would be a perfect place for a listening device to sit.  So I'll be very interested.  The other thing that's different about the Android ecosystem and the Chrome ecosystem  is it's much more vibrant.  More than a million apps.  There are not a million Chrome extensions.  Apps can do so much more in Android.  Really, this makes sense, frankly.  I would prefer to have an Android device.  Can I order it?  Can I order it?  It's not available yet, even for pre-order.  I'm guessing Christmas.  We'll put this under your tree.  All right.  Now we have covered everything Google.  Everything?  Everything Google announced yesterday.  Now.  Everything.  We're going to take a break and talk more.  Is Android a monopoly?  Apparently, Google's under antitrust scrutiny.  This just frosts my knickers.  You do, you try to do something good.  You try to do something good for the world, like make an operating system open source.  It's hugely successful.  And they say, now you got a monopoly.  Ridiculous.  Meanwhile, Apple, with its completely closed operating system that only it can use and  only it can sell and it controls completely tightly.  Oh, they're not a monopoly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is no way that Android meets any kind of reasonable definition of a monopoly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the opposite of a monopoly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's no pricing power.  There's no, you know, anti-competitive practices.  It's farcical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the opposite.  But however, I will try to argue the point that it is a monopoly because that's my job.  But we'll do that in just a little bit.  I want to talk about my little bits.  Little bits are great.  They're not that little.  Yes, little bits are great.  And you're a maker, you know.  Little bits.  Was this a Kickstarter when it started?  I can't remember how little bits got started.  I think it was.  They've gotten better and better.  I think it was too because I think I got the Kickstarter kit way back when.  They're electronics building blocks.  They snap together with magnets.  So there's no soldering.  But in every other respect, it's just like an electronics project.  Resistors, capacitors, little units that do different things.  Motors, switches.  There's a little potentiometer.  They call it the slide dimmer.  The i5 slide dimmer.  And you snap these things together.  You can't do it wrong because the magnets will repel if you try to do it the wrong way,  which is pretty darn awesome.  A great toy for parents to build things with their kids.  And this, because of the way this is set up, they can be pretty little.  It doesn't have to be a 12-year-old.  You could do this with an 8-year-old and have so much fun.  Actually, I'll confess, I sometimes do this all by myself and the privacy of my own home.  Modules range from very simple like powers and sensors and LEDs to wireless programmable.  Yes, you can do programs with it.  You could build a robot with it.  The Little Bits kits come with everything you need to do a variety of projects.  This is the project manual.  This is the Little Bits space kit.  So there are 1 million combinations, 10 activities created with the NASA Goddard Flight Center.  So if you want to become a space scientist and teach your kids to become a space scientist,  this is so cool.  They have the base kits, the deluxe kits.  This is the space kit.  The Arduino coding kit if you want to really get hardcore, serious program.  Arduino is sometimes hard for people to get into from scratch.  Get the Little Bits kit.  You've got everything you need and a really great walkthrough and a step-by-step.  For the Tinkerer, the deluxe kit has 18 modules that snap together to make billions of different  circuits.  Again, no wiring, no soldering.  What would take days to make with real, regular, off-the-shelf components, you could do in  seconds.  Are you a musician?  You have a budding musician in the family?  How about the synth kit?  You can build a modular analog synthesizer.  You get oscillators, filters, envelopes, keyboards, a micro sequencer, speakers, everything.  The Arduino Coder kit lets you manipulate what's on the screen using Little Bits inputs.  And look at the, let's see, these are some circuits we could build, control modules from  across the room, electromagnetic energy.  What is energy?  This is a STEM curriculum in a toy, which is fabulous.  Wave generator, energy meter, make a spectrum.  Oh, that's cool.  This is fun.  It is fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's nice that it's all color-coded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, you can't go wrong.  I mean, it's really pretty straightforward.  The truth is, that's not for the kids, that's for the grownups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The grownups need a little help.  You don't want to look like, oh, I don't know what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've done these kits and really, you don't want to be the one going, I don't know, Michael,  let me figure out how this works.  You want to look like you know what you're doing and you will.  Satellite dish data communications.  Wow, so cool.  So here's the deal.  20 bucks off your first kit.  Go to LittleBits.  Hi friends of This Week in Google.  LittleBits.com slash twig.  That also includes free shipping in the US.  20 bucks off.  Just use the offer code TWIG at checkout.  And if you make something, would you Instagram me?  Just go at Mr. Underscore Laporte, at Mr. Underscore Laporte, and I will, I'd love to  show some of the things you've built with your new LittleBits.  You and your kids or your friends or your parents.  LittleBits.com slash twig.  I just love our sponsors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm so glad they're a sponsor.  Isn't that great?  That's a great sponsor.  That's a great product.  Everybody should go check that out.  If you have kids and you want to teach them electronics at an early age, like you say,  you can't go wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  And not every kid wants to become a maker.  You know, not every kid wants to do the kinds of crazy stuff you do.  But I really think every kid should have at least the experience of how stuff fits together  so they can understand it.  What we don't want is kids to be consumers.  We want kids to understand the, you know, don't just buy a tablet, understand how a  tablet works.  And so even if the kid isn't going to be, you know, getting deep into it, not every  kid wants to be a maker.  They'll at least have that experience and the joy of putting something together.  And when the light comes on or the fan spins, it's so great.  Yep.  Is Chromecast coming to Spotify, Showtime, Sling TV?  I have NBA.  I've been able to, with my Spotify on Android, send it to my Sonos.  Weirdly enough.  And I think I have, I don't know what the new Spotify capabilities are, but anyway,  they said something.  So Android is in use by 1.4 billion people.  Clearly it's a monopoly.  According to Bloomberg.  Now I should also point out that in the past we've seen maybe overstatements about what  the US government is investigating and whether it's a criminal investigation or even a serious  investigation.  But the Federal Trade Commission apparently has reached, according to Bloomberg, has reached  an agreement with the Justice Department to lead an investigation on Google's Android  business according to people familiar, to people, to people familiar with the matter.  And Google stifled competitors' access to Android.  Now on the face of it, this would seem absurd since you can go and download from GitHub  the entire Android code set except for the Google bits and put it on a phone and you  don't even have to ask Google, right?  You don't even have to contact Google.  You just make an AOSP handset and you sell it for 25 bucks.  You can use it on a lot of devices have Android on them because it's open source and free.  So really that can't be the question.  The question it must be is Google using its market cloud to force people to use, to put  the Google services on Android?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, like how can we have Android without Google?  It's a bundling argument.  So it's because that's what worked with Microsoft.  So the argument is they control to some extent the Android platform.  Therefore they can push their Google apps and services on people and effectively give  themselves a head start compared to other services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and that works so well with Microsoft.  By the time the government had finished its multi-year investigation and prosecution,  hundreds and hundreds of hours of boring depositions, millions of dollars down the tubes, what did  they achieve?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I could name a million things that I do want the government to protect me from like bad  hotel Wi-Fi, like bad airline behavior, like name it.  There's tons of things.  This is not consumer protection in any possible universe.  Who the hell can play this sort of competitor?  It must be, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It must be Samsung or Apple or somebody said.  EU is doing the same thing.  Fair search dot org must be a nonprofit, right?  Because it's got the dot org.  Well, yeah, they said it's funded by Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pretty sure it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fair search.  You know, it's really sad that if you can't compete, you just try to win by suing or encouraging  antitrust action against your competitors.  That's just sad.  Make a better product.  By the way, if you go to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nokia, I love this.  I love this, right?  The first company listed as Nokia and Microsoft.  Why would that happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who owns Nokia?  Who owns Expedia?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Who started Expedia?  TripAdvisor, Quenga, Foundem, who's been going after Google, Oracle.  Oh yes, we know how outstanding they are.  Allegro, who the heck is that?  Buscapay, who's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ad marketplace, I'm sure in Spain.  Couple of these guys just threw in a couple of bucks.  Who threw in the big bucks is the question.  Oh, the last one listed, Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, better.  So here's what fairsearch.org says.  Google has used a range of anti-competitive tactics, carrying on a troubling pattern of conduct  that has made it more difficult and expensive for fresh innovative companies like Microsoft.  I added the like Microsoft to reach the market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google's playbook is simple.  It says first you do open and then you dominate and then you close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's yeah.  So okay, you can make that argument like Microsoft.  I understand.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But when has it happened?  Just because it could happen doesn't mean it's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't mean to stop.  Well, that's what they're investigating.  Has it happened?  Well, that's ridiculous.  Google, Android accounts for 59% of the smartphone market in the second quarter  compared to Apple's 38% and Microsoft's 2.35%.  But success in the marketplace doesn't mean you're a monopoly  and it's not even monopoly level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, exactly.  That would be my point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, go ahead.  In the US, the monopoly, it's not illegal to have a monopoly.  A lot of people are under the misapprehension that it's illegal to have a monopoly.  It's not.  It's illegal to gain a monopoly through anti-competitive practices  and it's illegal to use your monopoly in anti-competitive ways.  But so far at least, the courts have only ruled against monopolies  if they impact consumers negatively.  For example, if prices rise or...  There has to be a damage.  Right.  So where is the damage?  The damage is you get a lot of great apps for free.  So it's hard to prove that anybody's being hard done by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and as Microsoft knew when it was being attacked  by the Department of Justice, you prop up the competitors, Apple in that case,  and Apple had a few percentage points of market share.  But Microsoft said, no, no, no, there's competition.  See, we got Apple.  Apple is 38% of the market and one could absolutely argue  is dominant and forces all sorts of concessions from other industries  and this is the key, by the way, an antitrust regulation  uses its market dominance to enter new markets.  And dominate those markets.  That's the thing that is illegal.  And what is Apple doing?  I mean, what is Apple Music all about?  Apple's trying to become big in cloud services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Apple is far worse about compelling you to use its products,  to either make it impossible in some cases,  or at least very hard to use things that are not part of that ecosystem.  Google is much more open when it comes to that stuff.  That's half of the reason I moved from iPhone to Android in the first place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, Google allows Apple to put an application on the Google Play Store  called Move to iOS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apple didn't allow Google to put a Move to Android app on its store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Well, one presumes that the FTC will look at this and go, yeah, no.  I'm really trying, it's hard for me to play devil's advocate on this one  because, so, okay, here, let's see what the case could be.  So Google gives away Android, but really, no consumer wants plain Android.  They want Google Store, Google Maps, Hangouts.  They want the Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the argument will be Google gives away Android,  so it can force these applications on you.  Right.  And so show me the consumers who feel they're forced.  They're all going to be from a place called Redmond, Washington.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They want, everybody who buys an Android,  you'd be furious if you bought an Android phone  and it didn't have the Play Store on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's precisely why I will not buy a Fire.  Fire.  Yeah.  But witness, Google didn't force them to take it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Amazon, the competitor, was perfectly free to take this operating system,  saved a fortune, gets the updates, has the value.  Yeah, that's actually a great example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a great example.  If I were in court, I would use that as an example of how Google has been much more lenient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, just try doing that to Apple.  Just try doing that to Apple.  Well, I mean, I guess you have WebKit, but that doesn't count.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Remember how pissed off people were, especially the Wall Street Journal,  when the FTC decided not to go after Google on search rankings.  They voted five to nothing not to go after Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because the FTC protects consumers, and there was no violation of consumer privilege.  Consumer harm is the number one.  And the memo that was accidentally given out was from a different division of the FTC  that doesn't do that.  But at the end, the commissioners all included the Republicans said, nope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's funny because according to this article, Google lobbied the FTC  to mount a more spirited defense of its decision to drop the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can you guys just...  Make a bit more noise?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Say, no, really, we didn't think there was a case.  Really, there wasn't.  They said that Google's competitors were using those leaked documents to  quote, so confusion and undermine the FCC's conclusions.  I think that's a reasonable assertion, actually.  Gary Reback.  Where do we know that name from?  A lawyer with a car, Farrell, said the FTC comes to this with a lot of baggage.  When we...  Reback, what was his role in the DOJ case?  He defended Microsoft, right?  Yeah.  I think I remember him.  When we say we're concerned, it's not only because they didn't do a good investigation  talking about the FTC the first time around, the fact they didn't protect the confidentiality  of people who complained, but also they were taking directions from...  They seem to be taking directions from Google.  Hmm.  Gary Reback.  Hired gun.  Have Reback will challenge.  All right.  I don't know.  Nothing more to say about that.  Preach into the choir here.  1.4 billion users is pretty amazing.  By the way, interesting costat.  1.4 billion people using Android.  1 billion people using Google Play, which means that  400 million of those Android users are not using Google services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they're by not being forced in any way to do anything that Google wants them to do.  They're not being forced.  They're on the open version of Android.  They paid nothing for the operating system.  There's your proof point right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's got to be a reason that Google used that stat.  400 million people not using Google services.  They get it for free.  That's impressive.  900 million people signed up to use Gmail.  That's impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  These numbers are getting so huge.  It's just crazy to think what that percentage of the population of all the people in the world  are using Android.  It's just crazy.  And then to think of the billions of people that sign up every month.  So what's happening to all of the...  This is where I get confused is in the numbers.  What was it?  A billion people a month?  I don't know.  They're signing up or something.  It's just these numbers get so big it's hard to wrap your mind around.  Where are all these phones going?  Are all these devices going?  If there's only 1.4 million active users.  Or 1.4 million...  See, I did it again.  1.4 billion active users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, we got to run because Jeff has to run.  But we're going to get to our end of the back of the book bit in just a bit.  But one more little public service announcement.  Facebook is not going to charge you to keep your stuff private.  You do not need to put a copyright notice on your Facebook timeline.  Please, God, stop doing that.  And if you do, you just look foolish because it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're an effing idiot.  And you don't deserve Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somebody said that that policy posting was actually very useful  because it showed you who you should unfollow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My college roommate posted it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I felt I didn't know what to do.  I didn't want to say,  Oh, dude, dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Humiliate them in public.  I didn't want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Facebook is not going to make you pay six bucks to keep your status private.  This comes up like every year.  And it's a testament to the viral nature of the Facebook newsfeed.  Facebook said...  It's trying to beat this last January.  They said they were tweaking the newsfeed algorithm to crack down on these stories.  I guess it looks too self-serving if they actually stop that story.  So maybe they're stopping other stories.  I know you have to go, Jeff.  Do you want to go now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll do my number first, then I'll go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, so I'm going to do an ad if you have time.  Or should I give you...  It's a good ad.  You don't mind?  It's an ad that you're going to be interested in  because I know you're not getting much sleep this week.  So you need a Casper mattress, my friend.  When you...  Can you ship one down to Venice?  I should.  Good.  I know I feel better when I sleep on a Casper.  It's beautiful.  Engineered, obsessively engineered to give you support and comfort.  Made in the USA.  Sold direct to you, which means you cut the cost of dealing with resellers and showrooms.  There's no markup.  It's just...  It's a great price for a great mattress.  And I know when I say that, people say,  but I want to try before I buy.  How can I do that?  Just get it.  You have a hundred days to return it and it will cost you nothing.  Shipping is free.  If you decide you don't want it, the return is painless.  They will refund you every penny.  You'll pay nothing.  But a hundred days.  That's the best way to try a mattress.  Look at that, too.  It comes in this great convenient box.  It's very...  That was a queen-size mattress.  Came in a box the size of a small...  I don't know what.  Small.  It's what I sent to my son.  He's the three-floor walk-up in college.  It was perfect for him.  You will love your Casper mattress.  They're cool in the summer.  They keep you warm in the winter.  $500 for a twin.  That's an amazing price for a premium mattress.  And no springs.  I'm sick of the springs.  Springs give you lumps.  Springs poke through.  Springs squeak.  Sometimes springs squeak a lot.  Don't have springs.  Have a Casper mattress instead.  Go to casper.com slash twig and use the promo code twig to save $50  off your brand new mattress.  I'm hearing from a lot of people now who are getting their Caspers  and loving it.  But the nice thing is...  Somebody sent me a tweet this morning and said,  I'm getting the Casper.  I hope I like it.  The nice thing is if you don't, no harm, no foul.  They'll come.  They'll pick it up.  They'll take it away.  Refund you every penny.  Casper.com slash twig.  Jeff Jarvis is in Medellin.  I just like saying that.  He's in Colombo.  Tonight, the awards ceremony for the Marquez Awards.  And you're flying back tomorrow morning at 5 a.m.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  United and Copa Airlines, willing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we wish you luck.  Will you be home next week or do you have to travel some more?  I'll go home next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Good.  I've got one bad trip coming up, which is Newark, Lagos, Johannesburg, Miami, Newark.  Oh, that's a nightmare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Holy cow.  Well, give us a number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay.  So a number is well, so it's a big deal for big week for media deals.  Axel Springer, the German publisher who's been warring against Google,  but is very, very, very smart, bought business inside, but most of business insider.  They just bought a big chunk of Thrillist.  Meanwhile, there was a little bit I forget, but then, oh, Liz Heron from Facebook went to  Huffington Post as basically the chief editor.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You were saying this is great.  She was the digital...  She was kind of the media person at Facebook.  She was head of media partnerships.  Yeah.  She came in right after paper, but she did the Facebook news stuff, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She did a lot of stuff and really helped out with news companies,  really well-loved person, and she's very, very smart.  So that's great.  She's not a journalist, though.  She's a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here she is, Washington Post.  She is.  Washington Post.  She's been a working journalist.  Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So then my number, however, is this, is that our friend,  Ev Williams, got a $57 million investment from Andreessen Horowitz, new partner,  with the participation of Google Ventures, Greylock, who had also led Series A.  And of course, they count to Obvious Ventures, which is Ev's own fund, pretty much.  And so $57 million, I think just like Twitter,  we still don't know exactly what the business model is.  This is...  You're talking for Medium.  Medium.  There was some complaining on, I think it was Business Insider,  commentary saying that it's become a place for op-eds and free press releases.  I like Medium.  But I like Medium a lot, and I think they're doing neat things.  I just wrote a piece on there about how we have to fix advertising,  which is a topic we talked about in the show last week.  But I chose Medium as the place to put it.  By the way, I also experimented, and I put the exact same post on Facebook's new improved notes.  Oh.  Which is what the read like.  And how did that go?  Conversation on both, different kind of conversation, but the Facebook,  you know, had the real conversation.  So it was good.  So it was an interesting thing.  So I wanted to give a hats off.  A hats off?  Hats up?  Hats whatever.  Tip of the hat.  I'm tired.  Tip of the hat.  Tip of the hat to have with a...  Who's changing the world a third time, we hope, in a $57 million investment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know who would invest in Evan Williams.  Whatever was he ever done.  I know.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I apologize.  I must say, hasta luego.  Thank you, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you.  I'll see you later.  You know, I've been using that Facebook's mentions thing.  I tried it three times.  It froze after one frame three times.  I wanted to do a live video.  How do you get it to work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I talked to them about that at online news association.  And they said that it has a high threshold for video quality.  And they're trying to fix that.  They know it's there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  High threshold for video.  You mean it crashes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it crashes at one.  I can't do the video once.  Do it says, F you, I'm going home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think we have some capability here in the Twit Brickhouse for streaming video.  All right.  OK, Facebook, you know best.  I don't know what's up with you out there.  It sees me and says, oh, we're not letting him on.  I'll keep trying because I want to do that.  It looks like fun.  I do.  It'll be fun.  Yeah.  Thank you, Jeff.  Safe travels.  We'll see you next week.  Vaya con Dios.  That always sounds like not so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like, yeah.  Go with God.  Yeah, because you're going up or but not here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, I hope he gets home OK from Medell√≠n.  And stay away from the white balloon.  Check your bags.  Check your bags.  Matthew, is there anything you want to share with us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there was some Twitter.  There's a lot of Twitter chaos.  No kidding.  As usual.  So actually that that company seems to it doesn't actually make a product.  It just it's a drama factory.  And so it's no kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As there's always something going on.  Yeah, it's a drama factory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It sounds like Jack Dorsey is probably going to be the CEO soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I thought he said he wouldn't be the CEO if he couldn't continue to run Square.  And the board said, no, you have to devote 100% of your time to Twitter.  So how did they resolve that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Both of those things happened.  So what's probably going to happen is the board will say,  ah, turns out we changed our mind and he can run both companies.  Oh, Lord.  So that whole thing we put out saying that that wasn't going to happen.  No, we take it back.  It's going to happen.  So at least that's what I'm hearing anyway.  It sounds like there's a, you know, basically there's been a full court press  from a bunch of different insiders and board members and investors that  that Jack needs to be the CEO.  It's going to be very interesting to watch how he handles that because Square is going public.  And he's going to CEO that as well.  So a brand new, brand new public company, you know, with a lot of pressure on it  and Twitter, which needs a lot of help, that's going to be, that's, you know,  either one of those would be enough for one sort of normal person.  And people are pointing out, well, Elon Musk, you know, runs SpaceX and Tesla.  But I mean, he's Elon Musk for God's sake.  Yeah. And he doesn't run SpaceX.  No, plus he doesn't really run it.  Jobs ran Pixar sort of and Apple, but you know, the examples are very few.  Steve Jobs.  When someone's been able to do that.  And so, and Twitter isn't just, hey, I'll come in for some board meetings and  sign some papers and stuff.  I mean, it needs serious help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And he's done this before and it didn't work so well.  He's even though Square is just across the Square, he can run, you know,  and can walk back and forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, at least they're close.  But, you know, the history of that company, Jack has been ousted  many times, like two or three times.  I've lost count.  And so, you know, it's not as though I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Twitter is is is opera.  It is drama.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's direct.  So try and picture the board meetings there as William co-founder who, who ousted  Jack is on the board.  Jack, the chairman and sort of interim CEO who was ousted by is on the board.  Dick Costolo, CEO who ousted have a CEO is on the board.  I mean, board meetings have got to be like, you know, I don't know.  I can't think of anything like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But can't we just.  Twitter is not like losing money.  They're not going bankrupt.  Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no.  In fact, they're making they're making money is not the problem.  Making money is not the problem.  Growth is the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Only because the stock market wants to see them grow.  Right.  But what if you just said, hey, we're doing fine.  Let's just keep on keeping on.  Let's not go crazy trying to monetize.  We're making enough money.  It's a it's a public service.  The stock will tank.  And then what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and then you become takeover.  A hostile takeover.  Yeah.  So Google has been, you know, mooted as a potential, you know,  especially since the it feels like they're giving up on Google Plus Twitter.  They're integrating Twitter quite a lot in search.  They really love that real time data.  Twitter has it like nobody else.  And so there's a fit there.  You know, the price is just a little too high, I think.  Anyway, it'll be fun to watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a shame.  They have it's a shame they went public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because it is kind of a shame.  Someone I forget who it was.  It might have been Sarah Lacey said Twitter's biggest challenge or the thing that has acted  against it the most is it went public in the age of Facebook.  So so everyone expects it to be Facebook.  Why don't you have a billion users?  Why don't you have, you know, why aren't you worth 250 billion dollars?  Because it's a very, very different service.  And yet so if Twitter was all by itself and there was no Facebook,  it would look pretty good, probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, they're they're a public utility.  They're a public service.  They you can't watch a TV show without seeing the hashtag.  Oh, yeah.  They make money.  They even make money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It will be interesting once they their new project lightning,  sort of curators, the news thing, product.  That'll be interesting to see, because it's such a huge news platform.  I mean, that's why I'm on it, you know, 18 hours a day.  I just it's just they need it needs to be a little easier for people who aren't kind of  obsessive nerds like me or who haven't spent four years trying to curate lists of people who follow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, maybe maybe maybe if Jack does come in, his job one should be to buy the stock back  and go private and then just coast.  Yes.  They wouldn't have to run it just coast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That would take a significant amount of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're worth a lot, huh?  Oh, well, I'm gonna let you go, Matthew.  Thank you so much, because we're going to do a little maker demo here.  Project.  Yeah, I think this will be kind of fun.  Matthew Ingram is at fortune.com.  Read his coverage of the Twitter boardroom brawls and ongoing coverage of the drama.  Oh, yeah.  At fortune.com.  Thank you, Matthew.  Great to have you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thanks for having me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See you later.  Aaron Newcomb brought toys, so I thought, you know, we just kind of do a little extra  at the end of the show.  Yep.  We'll call it Aaron's Toys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Aaron's, Aaron's Toy Box.  What did you bring us today, Aaron?  What'd you bring us today, Aaron?  Toy Box.  Hello, Aaron.  Let's reach on the Toy Box.  That would be a good segment.  It would be.  So I'd like to bring a project for you, and this is actually the, our makerspace's mega doorbell.  Mega is the right word.  This is why you don't ever throw anything away.  You either keep it and take it apart or you bring it to your local makerspace.  They'll take it.  They'll find something to do with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, John, when we need to get rid of the stuff in the basement.  Oh, there we go.  Give it to a makerspace.  Absolutely.  Find a makerspace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We got a lot of toys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Find a makerspace.  I don't think I have a video on my side.  And I don't think this is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you need an HDMI port?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I don't.  Actually, I need an overhead camera.  I don't think there is one set up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do we have an overhead camera or should he slide over to my overhead camera?  People are jumping in ladders or...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Going through hoops.  Let's talk about it for a little bit.  What did you do?  So a couple things, right?  So this is using some really cool technology from Adafruit.  You know Adafruit?  We were just talking about Adafruit and Lady Ada.  This is a little thing they call the Sound FX.  Oh wait, look at that.  Where am I?  Over here?  Oh, you're right.  Oh, look at that.  That kind of...  Oh yeah, nice.  Is that a good...  Tell us when we got a good place for you.  That'll work.  We can make that work.  Make it work.  So this little board, it's one inch by maybe two inches.  And it's called the Sound FX.  I think it's like 20 bucks or something like this.  Basically what it does is it gives you the opportunity to load some sound files  onto the board and then they've got these pins and you can connect it to buttons and  all sorts of things.  So if you're building something and you don't incorporate sound and you want to do it in a  really easy way, this is a great way to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's not like a Raspberry Pi itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not a Raspberry Pi.  It's just a little circuit board.  It has two megs of memory, not much.  So you have to keep the sound files small.  They also have a 16 meg version which can handle larger files.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it has to fit in there.  But it has to fit in there.  Two megs is enough for a doorbell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They've made this thing super easy.  Exactly.  They've made this thing super easy to use.  Basically when you hook it up to your computer, it will show up on your computer as a mass  storage device.  You load your sound files on there.  When you're done putting your sound files on, you hook it up to like just a wall wart  on the wall.  Then that turns on the music making magic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the micro USB port can both be a data port which you use to copy stuff over and a power  supply.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  And when it sees the data connection, it turns the mass storage on.  When it doesn't see the data connection, there we go.  I'm not watching what I'm doing.  This will help.  When it doesn't see the data connection, it's just power.  It just draws power.  And then the cool thing they did is based on what you name the sound files, it will  actually do different things.  So for example, if I hook up these two pins and I have a sound file called rand or several  sound files called rand, it will actually do random sound files.  If you have it called next, it will just play them in order.  And if you just have one sound file there called this pin dot aug or dot wave, it will  just play that one when you trigger that connection.  And how many pins are there?  There's ten pins.  So you can have ten different sounds.  More than ten sounds because on some of them you could have random sounds and some of them  you could have going in order.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So one pin could have a hundred sounds that were randomly played.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you had enough room.  You're never going to be able to get that many files on here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So funny because I built a dial a song for they might be giants probably in 2000, maybe  I had to build a Linux machine with a hard drive.  It did pretty much exactly that.  It just played the next song on the hard drive down the phone line.  This would have made it so much easier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you know, it is October.  Is it October or is it October tomorrow?  It will be tomorrow.  Tomorrow is October.  Okay. I don't know what day it is.  Tomorrow is October.  That means Halloween is coming up.  You're going to be wanting to build some Halloween costumes.  This is an easy way to integrate sound into your Halloween costume.  So this is level one.  I've got this little speaker hooked up to it.  Right?  It's a little, I don't know, two watt.  So this would be suitable for a costume.  You can put this in a costume.  You can put it in your hat.  It's very small.  Right?  Let's hear the sound.  So let me make sure this is the big one's turned off.  Yeah.  We'll save that for last.  Here's the little.  Let me get it closer.  Here's the little.  I don't know if you could hear that.  That's actually pretty good sound.  Can you hear that, Brian?  Yeah.  Let me do it.  So it's got some random sounds on here.  I'll play the next one once this is actually done playing.  Come on.  Are you triggering it by?  I'm just pushing the button.  That is the dying battery on an electronic doorbell sound.  Let's do one more.  Let's do one more just for fun.  I've got nine or 10 of these on here.  We won't go through all of them.  Big bells there.  Okay.  So that's level one.  What format of the sounds?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do they have to be waves?  They have to be wave or aug.  And aug is great because it's compressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you want to use aug if you're using it,  especially if you're using the two meg version.  Okay.  So that's all well and good.  Now I've got a doorbell at the makerspace,  but even as nice as this little speaker is,  no one can hear it.  How much power could we have?  It has a built-in amp.  It's like a, I think a two watt amp or something.  It's pretty small.  That's tiny, but you could then power an amp from it.  You could power a bigger speaker.  You could, yeah, you can definitely hook it up.  So here's the deal, right?  At the makerspace, previous tenants were kind enough  to give us this.  Is it a megaphone?  What is that?  No, it's a, it's a Valcom paging speaker.  And you know,  Number 43, your pizza's ready.  Exactly.  So, you know, when you go to the,  you know, when you go to the car dealership  and they page out, you know,  Chuck, you've got a call on line one.  That's it.  This is the speaker they use out in the parking lot, right?  High fidelity.  High fidelity.  And it comes with a, you need a 24 volt DC amp to connect to it.  Okay.  Now I'm only going to turn this up to the lowest setting  because it's super loud.  Let's see.  Let's play one.  Two fingers in your ears now.  This might be a little loud.  So here we go.  Okay.  That's not too bad.  Now that's the lowest setting.  Nice.  That's the lowest setting.  So, yeah, and it sounds pretty good.  It sounds pretty good.  Got a little nice chime there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.  That's actually surprisingly high fidelity.  That sounds better than I would expect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It actually is really good.  And I wasn't, I didn't even know if I could get this thing to work,  but I'm so glad I did.  Do you have a battery down there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's a, it's a, you're not going to be able to see this.  It's off camera, but it's actually a 24 volt DC amp.  Okay.  That's connected directly to the speaker.  Okay.  So what I did was just to show you how versatile this is.  Now I'm going to switch this button over to pin one  and it should play a different sound.  Let's see if it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.  There we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that could be your, that could be your doorbell.  Someone comes up to the front door and they, and they ring it.  They'll hear.  They'll hear that.  So, you know, someone's at the door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's just once, turn it up all the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, you don't want that.  I can turn it up a little more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am the wrong person because I have my in-ear monitors.  I'm protected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You want me to do a little more?  A little more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a little more.  Put your head.  It's time for twit this week in tech.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It gets really loud.  It gets really loud.  But you want that in a shop someplace with, you know, a lot of room.  I mean, you want something that's pretty loud.  That is great.  So anyway, make your own doorbell.  Tell us about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, actually first tell us the name of that part.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this, if you go to Adafruit, it's the Sound FX.  And like I said, there's two, there's four models really.  They have one where you can use discrete speakers like this.  And they have another one with an eighth inch jack where you can hook it up to  external speakers, you know, computer speakers, powered speakers.  So you can get either one.  And then they have a two meg and a 16 meg version, depending on what you want to get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we love Adafruit.  Adafruit's great.  They do some cool stuff.  And there's the part.  I just feel like this is a great place for makers.  And Lady Ada's, we've had her on the triangulation.  She's great.  And she does that Ask the Engineers show.  Yep. Yep.  And we were talking about her on Windows Weekly.  So great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good stuff.  Good stuff coming out of Adafruit.  Now, what is this?  You want to talk about that?  I didn't know if we had time.  Yeah, I got time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't bring stuff in and not tell us about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is the Onion Omega.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  Let's guess, everybody.  Is it a Tor router in a wristwatch?  Is it Onion Omega?  Is it Onion?  Onion?  What's the Onion?  Is it a...  It's got to be a Tor or something.  No, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It could be, though.  So there's potential there.  It's actually a small little Linux computer on a chip.  What?  Similar to Raspberry Pi.  You want to open that?  So it's like the Windows 10...  We'll do an unboxing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like the Windows 10 Raspberry Pi.  Do you have my over the shoulder or no?  Yes, you do.  Because that's a big thing, by the way, Adafruit now is the Windows 10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, which I don't like at all.  But I'm glad Adafruit did.  Yeah, there's no reason to do Windows 10.  But let's not get on that one.  I like the puzzle piece.  Yeah, isn't that cool?  This is a very nice box.  This was a Kickstarter project.  And what's cool about it is it uses OpenWRT as the operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's the router operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, exactly.  So it's very small.  It's for embedded.  It comes with this thing you're taking out now is the extension board,  which allows you to add add-on modules or hook up those pins as GPIO pins.  This is the core unit here.  This is the actual product.  Look how small and cute that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So is that a processor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a processor, exactly.  And this is what actually runs Linux.  Now, by itself, just like that, you can't really hook it up or do anything with it.  But it comes with a mini extension board, which is the other box.  And so when you put those two together and turn it on,  what it does is it automatically sets up its own AP.  So you can connect to it.  It has Wi-Fi built in, by the way.  There's the USB port.  There's the USB.  There's a Wi-Fi chip on there.  There's the micro USB for power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where do I dock it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So just line it up.  Line up the shapes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's got pins on this side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pins on that side.  Just line it up.  Does it matter which way I go?  It does.  You got to match up the shapes.  Of course it does.  Match up the shapes.  Match up the shapes.  Yeah, one of them has...  You had the other way.  The cut corner?  Other way.  There it is.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's like an SD card holder or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would not be good at this.  Oh, sure you would.  This is easy.  And do I have to push it harder or is that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep, push it until it goes all the way in.  It's a little hard to put together there.  But the great thing about this is they're developing some really cool add-on modules for it.  It's very small.  It's really built for IoT.  It's built for the Internet of Things.  You could hide that inside of something and be monitoring sensors  or running some sort of little Locate Me program.  There's all sorts of things you can do with it.  And it's running...  It's running Linux.  A mini Linux?  I mean...  It's a scaled down version of Linux.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because this is the memory chip here, right?  Yep.  So how much memory does it have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a good question.  See, I knew you were going to ask me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wish I had a magnifying glass.  I could probably tell you.  Yeah, it's not much.  And then this daughter board...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want to say it's like 16 meg.  Oh, there's the specs there.  64 meg.  That was close.  16 meg of flash, 64 meg of RAM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Frankly, this is also what your router looks like.  Exactly.  If you took the box out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you took everything out of your router,  you absolutely could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then, okay, so if I want to put this daughter board on,  I do the same matching up?  Yeah, you would actually take it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you would take it off of the...  You have to take the mini one off and put that one on.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then you get GPIO, which means you have these pin connectors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there's also the add-on boards, which plug into those pin slots there as well,  the purple pins.  So you can do an Ethernet add-on board or you can do a Bluetooth add-on board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This all comes with a kit?  It all comes with a kit.  And how much?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good question again.  I think it was 35.  Can you bring that page up?  That's not bad.  You still have it?  Raspberry Pi-like.  Raspberry Pi-like, but small.  The integrated Wi-Fi is a huge plus for people because Raspberry Pi does not come with integrated  Wi-Fi.  You have to get a module.  So to have the Wi-Fi built in, there it is, 2250.  What?  What?  Really simple to get started.  It's not as cheap as the chip, right, which is starting to ship any day now.  I can't wait for that to come out.  I have kick-started the chip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep.  I did too.  That was $9.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  $9, yeah, which everyone says that's impossible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what's amazing is the incredible price performance curve in microelectronics.  As things get micromaniturized, the cost goes down while the power goes up.  It's just crazy.  It is crazy.  And it's what's powering our whole world, including this Internet of Things, the ability  to take what is functionally a full computer, including wireless Internet access, into something  this size for $22.  You could put this in anything and make it Internet capable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep.  And kudos to the developers.  They've done a great job with the setup.  Now, they're having some trouble getting the documentation because they've been so busy  shipping these things out.  But I did find some documentation, was able to get it set up in about five minutes.  Like I said, it comes, it starts at access point.  When you connect to the access point, you go to a webpage and type in your local SSID  and password for your local wireless.  And then it goes out, updates the system, reboots, and you're ready to go.  They're working on some other things like this, the Onion Console, which will be a desktop-like  environment for you to make it a little bit easier to use.  And they've also got a cloud app with APIs already set up so that you can connect multiples  of these things and have them up in the cloud and just run your API calls against them.  So you don't have to actually connect to it directly at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'd be crazy not to become a maker in this day and age.  Absolutely.  Tools are so easy, so integrated, and the potential is so huge.  I want to see your Halloween projects.  All right.  Let's do some Halloween projects, everybody, and send them along to us.  Send a picture or something.  We'll show them and talk about them.  I'm not going to pull this apart.  I'm afraid of breaking it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It does come apart kind of hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, if I had a screwdriver or something, I could do that.  Very cool.  That's the Onion Omega.  And what was the URL for that, Brian, that you found that on?  onion.io  onion.io  That is the best web address ever.  Onio.  Onio-Nio.  Onio-io  Onio-io  Happy Podcast Day, everybody.  Yes, this is International Podcast Day.  I'm not making that up.  Somebody else made it up.  But if you go to internationalpodcastday.com, and I think we should celebrate.  Podcasts are an amazing medium that have kept me fed for the last 10 years, but I think also  kept many of you entertained, informed, kept you company, and have transformed the media.  Absolutely.  What will you do on Podcast Day?  Hashtag podcastday.  September 30th, International Podcast Day.  And they're doing a live stream on Blab for International Podcast Day.  So I bet you there'll be a number of people in there.  Here's the historical timeline of podcasts and podcasting resources and all sorts of stuff.  That's neat.  Happy Podcast Day, everybody.  Thanks for being here.  We do this week in Google every Wednesday, 1.30 p.m. Pacific, 4.30 p.m. Eastern Time,  20.30 UTC.  You can watch live at twit.tv slash live.  You can also download audio and video from us, twit.tv slash twig, or from wherever you  get your podcasts on International Podcast Day.  If you'd like to join us in studio, a couple of nice members of the audience.  Just email tickets at twit.tv.  We'll put a chair out for you.  Thanks, Aaron.  Yeah, great to have you here.  Aaron Newcomb.  Always good to be here.  Thanks to NetApp, your employer, for letting you take the afternoon off.  Thank you, NetApp.  I bet you have to go back to work.  I do.  We'll see all the rest of you.  I'll be back here Saturday.  The new screensavers, Jason Calacanis, is my co-host.  That should be a lot of fun.  Of course, the Tech Guy show as well.  We'll see you then.
