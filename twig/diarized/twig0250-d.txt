Transcript:  It's time for Twig, this week in Google.  Kevin Marks and Matthew Ingram are here, along with Jeff Jarvis.  Gina has the week off.

He just flew in from San Francisco.  Poor guy.  You were in San Francisco for a day, less than a day to talk to Google.  Less than a day, 18 hours I calculated, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Plus about 20 minutes for a plane problem.  You fly a lot.  I do. I am global services, I'll have you know when you're in.  So when they start boarding, I'm that obnoxious prick who goes on first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. I almost want to say, hey, where's your wheelchair, Jarvis?  Where's your crutches?  Soon enough.  Yeah.  Gina's out because her lovely little daughter added not feeling too well and she wanted to spend some time with the baby while she's under the weather.  She'll get over that quick enough.  Meanwhile, Kevin Marks has joined us.  Always great to have Kevin in his garden.  It's nice to see you again.  Bird warning, there will be birds.  There are indeed birds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm actually sitting in a slightly different place than usual because we've got some new garden furniture.  It's actually gorgeous. I love this.  I wouldn't show you around the garden furniture. We've got some really comfy garden armchairs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Always nice to have excellent armchairs in the garden.  And from all the way from Canada, Matthew Ingram of Giga Ohm fame is here as well.  Nice to have you, Matthew.  Thanks for having me.  Boy, we got a great crew for this show today.  A lot of fun.  Our top story, the Nest smoke alarm has finally been recalled in its entirety.  Four hundred and forty thousand smoke alarms for a safety risk.  Oh boy.  Yeah. This is the company Google bought for three point two billion.  They had two products.  One was, of course, the famous Nest thermostat.  The other was a smoke alarm that talked to you and let you wave your arms to disable it.  And apparently that caused a little bit of a problem.  They halted sales of the alarms last month after recognizing that the temporary silencing feature wasn't so temporary.  The Nest has to be connected to the Internet and linked to an account for an automatic update.  So if you have one, make sure that you get the update.  You go to Nest Sense. This is why, by the way, Internet connected devices are a pain in the keister.  You have to go to Net Sense on your account and ensure that the button for Nest Wave is set to off and grayed out.  Those who have not connected their devices to a wireless network in a Nest account should do so.  The devices will then be automatically updated and consumers should take the aforementioned steps to ensure the update is complete.  Meanwhile, I guess they're recalling them unless you say, well, I downloaded the update.  I guess they just can't assume that everybody will have the Internet access and so forth.  Customers can contact Nest Labs for more information.  If you want to get the latest news on the Nest, visit the Nest.com website, or visit nest.com.  Click on the Nest Protect Safety Notice link.  Wait a minute. Why am I getting all that?  Really obnoxious.  ABC.com just redirected me as I went to this.  I come to go to somewhere else.  Some some crap ad.  All right. Where is it?  I'm looking.  Nest smoke alarm.  Life with Nest Protect.  Watch the video. I don't see anything about it.  Oh, here it is.  Safety letter from the CEO.  So it says so at Nest, we conduct regular rigorous tests.  During recent lab testing of the Nest Protect smoke alarm, we observed a unique combination of circumstances that caused us to question  whether Nest Wave, a feature that lets you turn off your alarm with a wave of the hand, could be unintentionally activated.  If you went like this.  Hey, Chad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey.  Hey, kids.  Hey.  Don't go in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This could delay an alarm going off if there were a real fire.  We don't know of any customers who have experienced this, but the fact that it could even potentially happen is important.  I think this is good.  They're telling you what to do.  You know, you can get it fixed.  Now, here's the question.  Can you buy a Nest Protect anymore?  They stopped all sales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because it was the Consumer Product Association or whatever that recalled it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, it's a CPC recall.  CPC recall not.  Oh, so your Nest Protect is off the market until they figure this thing out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I got to say the whole waving thing.  When I heard about it, I thought, well, what if how does it know that you're waving at it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Maybe you're just running around because the house is on fire.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What if you're just waving or there's a fly or something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Not waving, but drowning.  So, okay, so you'd wave and the alarm would say, oh, he doesn't want me to go off.  But how long does that last?  An hour?  An hour would be bad.  A minute wouldn't be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I guess forever is what it sounds like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You didn't really want me to go off anymore, did you?  Wave to disable.  That's not a good feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It reminds me of the, maybe we're going to talk about this, but the Google Glass nod to pay with Bitcoin.  It seems to me that could really backfire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Do you have that, Jeff, on yours?  Nod to pay with Bitcoin?  I haven't done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You accidentally sneeze and suddenly find you've bought something.  Do you want to pay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  That seems a little too easy.  Google Glass had nod to pay.  But you have to, no, this is a feature that Google themselves is offering.  No, it's a new app that takes mobile payment to a whole new level.  It's called Ease, maybe a little too easy.  E-A-Z-E.  It allows Google users to link to a virtual Bitcoin wallet.  Oh, I actually, all right, Ease is a wallet.  You activate the Ease app with a voice command.  Use Google Glass to scan the QR code provided by the store associated with the product.  Once it is scanned, a head nod completes the mobile payment transaction.  Well, there's a few steps before you have to.  That's true.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But is it really that hard to pay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I need it to be harder.  Yeah, not easier.  I don't need Amazon and Google to make it easier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, harder, not easier.  Poor Glass.  So he's looking at the QR code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's going to scan the QR code with his eyes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Can't you do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Those special purchases and Ease makes accepting payments just as easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You don't look talky enough with your glass on, so we're going to make you look sillier.  But he still has a girlfriend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Using cutting edge technologies that are available just now.  Scarf helps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I'll know it.  Don't worry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Using bitcoins and Glass to enable hands-free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a joke, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It has to be.  Here's the QR code as big as your plate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We live in a world that is indistinguishable from the onion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there is a nest parody.  If you look at the bottom of the Google section of the rundown, Google had it taken down because they didn't have a sense of humor about it.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Come on.  Yeah, I read it.  So the third from the bottom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I see it.  I got it here.  Let me just play the this is a parody of the nest.  Oh, but was it gone?  So I can't play it.  It was watered down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Evidently, it was at Repubblica.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It was a German political activist group.  Oh, it was a parody website posting.  Yeah.  Pokey poking fun at Google's products.  So did they have the right to be forgotten?  Yeah, apparently Google has that right.  Wow.  See, I would think Google would bend over backwards at this point to make sure no sites get taken down.  Yeah.  Did it violate trademarks or but no, it's parody.  You can do anything you want.  You could do anything you want.  Didn't people in New York a few years ago distribute a fake New York Times as an April Fool's joke?  What did the Times do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Times was OK in that case.  I think they made it clear enough.  But there was a blogger, a well-known blogger, did a did a New York Times kind of correction site.  The New York Times went after him.  You know, it's just the reflex of lawyers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, so here's what here's what happens.  So if you go to Google dash nest dot org now, you get a single candle saying, Dear Internet, this beautiful website has been taken down  because Google is worried about their brand and the future of Nest Labs, which is in the business of making creepy products designed to collect even more data from you.  Apparently, they just can't get enough.  They must have it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a video below.  Yeah, that's the launch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, it's Republica.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's very popular.  Unfortunately, I had to cancel.  I was dying to go this year.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, you didn't cancel this.  This?  No, no.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If they insult Google, I'm not going public.  I'm boycotting Germany until they get to their sentence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's called Google Nest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I like to introduce to people who show you what this is about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's called Google Nest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Please welcome Dr.  Gloria Spindle and Paul from Rebecca.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Those are phony names.  I presume.  They're funny in German.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't know.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How nice to be here.  Republica for the first time.  I'm Gloria Spindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Not her real name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm Paul from Wibbock.  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's really amazing to be here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I can see Google would be upset about this because they're kind of billing themselves as from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The energy and the collective brain power here.  I was just saying to Paul yesterday, we should be recruiting.  Really?  So as Max kind of hinted at in the introduction, we at Google have actually been thinking a lot about the same things you've been thinking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes, you can't say we at Google.  That's kind of impersonating that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Topics like surveillance, privacy, data, Snowden.  These are issues that are close to our hearts as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's also not funny, which is probably the greatest sin of all.  Google is doing all right according to the yearly brand ratings.  Adweek says Google is the world's most valuable brand topping Apple for the first time.  This is the brand Z top 100 most valuable global brands.  Apple now number two after Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Those lists make no sense.  But having said that, this makes sense.  Google is in everybody's lives more than Apple is in everybody's lives.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, they rated on a variety of categories, right?  Yes.  I'm sure they'll explain that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Last year we talked about this and I looked it up on how they do it and I forget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  40% rise in brand value drove Google to the number one position.  Sounds so scientific.  Yeah.  The brand has appreciated.  Sure it wasn't 42%?  Well, it's appreciated 324% since the inception of the brand Z top 100 most valuable global brands list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The only brand that really benefits from this is brand Z because right now we're branding it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Brand Zed.  Brand Z.  Amazon in the top 10 for the first time.  Facebook second fastest rising brand increasing 68% in brand value.  Sorry.  I have to stop now.  Moving on.  Geez.  SEC filing.  Google says they're planning international acquisitions worth up to $30 billion.  They have all this cash overseas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They can't repatriate to the U.S. or else they'll pay taxes on it.  So they got to do something with it.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Google generated about half its revenue in non-U.S. markets in 2012.  That money then can't be repatriated to Google U.S. without paying tax, U.S. tax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's about half their cash hoard.  They have I think I saw $68 billion plus another $2 billion in the long term.  So Waze was an Israeli company so that was a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yep.  Deep Mind, they got them.  They're in London, $400 million.  Spider.io London.  Range span also in the U.K.  Google told the SEC that it had recently pursued but discontinued a potential buyout of a foreign company with a valuation in the range of $4 to $5 billion.  What do you think it could have been?  Spotify?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Could be.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Who could that be?  Not Beats.  Who could that be?  Twitch?  Twitch was do we know?  There's still that rumor that YouTube is going to buy Twitch although I haven't seen any further confirmation.  That's not a $5 billion.  That's not $4 billion.  It can't be $4 billion.  I mean we're talking that's a lot of money.  That's more than they paid for YouTube itself.  Kevin Marks, you're international.  Actually you're both international.  Canada's not really international though.  Well but it would count in this wouldn't it?  If it were a Canadian company it would count?  Let me Google.  What is Spotify worth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We don't have anything worth $4 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Not RIM for sure.  Spotify's value tops $4 billion.  Good call.  And yeah.  Yeah that was last year.  So there you go.  That's based on investors and so forth.  The most in November technology crossover ventures led a quarter billion dollar investment round into Spotify that valued them at $4 billion.  Up from $3 billion the year before.  But would Google want Spotify?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would think so.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Especially if it's true that Apple's buying Beats.  This could be the consolidation of the streaming music business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I said this last time.  I don't understand why Apple isn't buying Spotify.  I don't understand why.  Much better than Beats.  I mean to me as a service it's ten times better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They got the cash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They have double the cash that Google has.  Well but they don't have those income generating headphones.  Spotify's done nothing but lose money.  It beats at least makes a billion dollar or generates a billion dollars in revenue a year.  Google also in this SEC filing said that it was considering things like serving ads to your thermostat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bad choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So is he wearing a cashmere sweater about now or do you want to spend more money on energy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But then later it said it wasn't thinking about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It just is a letter.  They wrote a letter to the SEC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hypothetically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Hypothetically saying that it could be serving ads and other content to refrigerators, car dashboards, thermostats, glasses, watches.  This is why we shouldn't have to disclose revenue generated from mobile devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it was a dodge to get around having to disclose their mobile revenue.  So just pick everything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They didn't want to break it down.  They said it doesn't make sense to break out mobile revenue since the definition of mobile will continue to evolve as more smart devices roll out.  Which is true.  So yeah it doesn't mean necessarily they're planning.  It's more like hey we don't know what mobile means or what is mobile revenue.  If we put it on our refrigerator is that mobile?  If we put it on a thermostat is that mobile?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Pretty sure the fridge is not mobile.  Or the thermostat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I've never seen anybody carry his thermostat around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think a car for sure.  Glasses, watches.  You could see a Waze sort of heads up the traffic display on your dashboard.  That would be super awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Ads show up.  I don't put it up with an ad in there.  Waze is loaded with ads.  Every time I stop the car I get an ad from Waze.  It's very annoying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah I don't think that's the way.  I don't think that's the value of Waze.  I think the value of Waze is what we are.  But praise Waze.  I got on Newark Airport.  I pull out pay.  I stop and pull over and say Waze how long?  And email Chad and it was right to the minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah that's the best thing.  One of the best things about GPS is knowing kind of almost exactly when you're going to arrive.  And most GPS's are good about that now.  If they have traffic information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The problem is you get trapped by Google Maps being useless at searching for things.  I had a example of that yesterday.  Let me find the link.  So what happens is if you put a calendar event in and you put the name of the company before its address.  Google will instead of reading the address out of that location.  Will do a search for the name of the company and send you somewhere else entirely.  It's only doing a bad search to name the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've got to be friendly.  It does ridiculous things like I'll be searching for something that I know is two miles away.  And it's not smart enough to see that.  It gives me the same named place in Utah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  Or Italy.  Italy?  Well or some completely different country or state.  I mean it should at least know where I am.  Yeah that's the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've got to get the link.  This is what I got on my phone yesterday.  I'll put it in the chat.  So I got a Google Now alert saying leave now because it'll take you two hours and 44 minutes to cycle to 41 Bryant Street.  Had you ever been there?  Matter 3 design?  Actually if you search for 41...  I just done a search for 41 Bryant Street and it said it was 17 minutes.  But because Matter Ventures was there, was in the thing, it searched for some other place called Ventures that happened to be in Redwood City.  But it still said it was the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh that's very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is deeply broken.  Basically the problem is that Google Maps is really really bad at search.  To the point now that I think Foursquare gave up.  Foursquare used to throw across the name of the business and the address.  And now it throws across a lat long point because it can't trust Google Maps to get the place right.  So this is a calendar event I've got with that address in it.  So it's just more than just getting the wrong place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I can see how it might get the wrong place and then give you not only wrong directions but a wrong time estimate.  But in this case it had the actual address.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. It ignores the address.  It ignored it.  I had this problem when I went to Philadelphia and I was supposed to be going to Penn.  So I put the address for this place in Penn and it sent me to another place with a similar name in another college on the other side of town.  And not knowing Philadelphia we went over there and it took an hour to get back.  That's so weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  In fact in another card it says it's only 17 minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah that was it.  I literally searched for the address earlier but it gave me this alert saying it's two hours and 44 minutes away.  And this wasn't getting my location wrong.  It knew my location this time.  It had got my location wrong earlier and thought I was in Austin.  But it had done it.  I think when I clicked through.  That's just a bug.  That's a blog.  Yeah.  But it's an egregious bug.  It misdirects you.  I've had this happen quite a lot before because a lot of you get an event that says the Maui Room at Hotel X or whatever.  And it finds you a restaurant called Maui that's like nowhere near it.  That I can understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But what's happened here is more of a bug because it knows where you're going.  But it has somehow gotten directions for somewhere else even though it has the exact address from your calendar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me click on the thing again and see what address I get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean that's just that's more of a bug.  I can understand how when you're doing a search for a name of a place it finds one.  It should look for the one closest to you.  But that's another assumption that may not be true.  You may actually be planning to go to the other Maui Room.  Just because it's closer doesn't mean that's the one you're going to.  But this is just weirder because it has the address.  It has a card that's accurate.  And at the same time it tells you to leave two hours and 44 minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no.  Because it's not actually going to the address.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right. It's going somewhere else.  So it's not matching the leave now to the address.  So this is just a bug in Google now I think.  That's just a bug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's not a bug in Google. It's a bug in Google Maps.  Maps.  So if I copy that address and search in Maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well I'm sure that even as we speak Matt Cutts is cutting his run short to file bug reports.  It is weird that if you search.  So you searched for 421 Bryant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So no I searched for Mad Adventures 421 Bryant.  I just did it and it found me Peninsula Ventures in Redwood City instead.  It's a database bug.  So it's no it's not a database bug.  It's a we're ignoring the address and we're searching on the text and then it searches for.  It didn't even match the text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It has one word matching the other one doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then it's decided everything else was you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So that happens to you a lot.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It happens to me a lot.  It generally happens when I create a calendar event.  And then the calendar event has a more detailed thing than just a street address.  So if you've got like 300 or things like that in the address there's more to match.  Yeah.  It's basically their address parser is useless.  It it it prefers the text to the address.  You get this.  You can have the same effect by pasting an address into Google Maps search.  So got it.  Look out for that one.  So always always double check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Maybe they should be using urban engines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh huh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Garret Schmidt and Google Ventures just backed a startup called Urban Engines that wants to solve urban congestion using data intelligence.  Probably all they saw was oh data intelligence.  We need that.  Oh that ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Huh.  It should do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well I think this is public transit.  Public transportation specific.  Oh OK.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Don't take the 22.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Take the 24.  It's using people's swipes as they get on the subway or the bus line as sensors figuring out where people are in the system.  And it's really it sounds like.  It sounds like.  It sounds like.  It sounds like.  It sounds like.  It sounds like.  It sounds like.  It sounds like.  It sounds like.  It sounds like.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It sounds like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It sounds like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's weird because you only get entry and exit points for that.  You don't get route.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well what they're looking for is how crowded a bus or a train is.  And I guess they might know something about wait times from that right?  Because that's when they got on.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean every subway system I've used has like a swipe point at the station you get on the swipe point the station get off.  Right.  Well not New York.  Not always with the get off one though.  I think New York makes you swipe on the way out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  New York New York only makes you swipe on the way in.  You put a token in there.  Yeah.  So it doesn't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they wouldn't have it.  Whereas you know Oyster in London makes you swipe entry and exit.  And that they've given some interesting things with that data before.  And the Clipper here lets you it makes you tap on.  You don't have to tap off at exit.  But if you don't it assumes you went to the end of the line which is OK if you're going north.  But if you're going south it thinks you've gone to Gilroy rather than San Jose even though it's not possible.  So he ends up charging extra four dollars if you forget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's getting worse in Germany now.  Oh it's getting a lot worse.  Now the latest insult German officials say we must seriously consider breaking Google up.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Three politicians are doing this.  I was talking to a German Google guy.  Was he yesterday today.  What day is it.  Mountain View.  And yeah it's a cynical political act.  There's a lot of that going on.  They can't break it up.  It's a U.S. company.  Well I know but it's a cynical political act.  That's the nature of it.  They can they can they can do interest rules for their European.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well that's what he said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's Sigmar Gabriel who is a Germany's minister for the economy and vice chancellor.  So it's like a big shot here.  And he's writing an op ed piece in the Frankfurt Alamania Zeitung.  Did I say that right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  For the Alga Minot site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'll go minus item which is a big daily newspaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sit on site site site site or tsunami site site site site site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Cool whip.  He writes in German.  He writes a breakup of the kind that has been carried out for electricity and gas grids  must be seriously considered here but only is a last resort.  I imagine him wagging his finger.  That's why we're focusing on anti-trust style regulation of Internet platforms.  I think breaking up Google especially for not even.  But there are US companies seems going a little far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, well, but they went for, you know, the EU went after Microsoft as well.  Then below that in the rundown, we also have a cynical coalition of German and  French publishers led by actual Springer, which is the company that wrote this  horrible Larry's trying to create a new universe.  Universe op ed in the same newspaper.  I created yesterday that they should just name the paper the Brigadoon Daily  because it doesn't want to change anything.  So they're trying to get the EU to reject the settlement that they've made with  Google about and I trust the EU official said told them to go blow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is the open Internet project manifesto.  Great.  The Paris Declaration.  European consumers and digital entrepreneurs demand ban of Google's  manipulative favoring of its own services and content.  It is a matter of worldwide importance.  The search engine monopolist Google.  Wow.  Over 90 percent market share for business cannot be found online.  It cannot compete.  The root of the problem is Google.  I actually said this for a while that Google shouldn't be in the content business.  Well, and who was it?  Was it Vimeo or no Dailymotion was complaining.  Dailymotion the European YouTube that when you search for video they never show up.  YouTube always shows up a Google company.  Is that not the case?  What is Google's response?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If I go to Vimeo when I search for a video does YouTube show up?  But you're on Vimeo.  Well, that's the point.  Google's supposed to be a search engine.  If I go to actual Springer.  That's not true.  If you search for their competitor do I find their competitor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No.  Well, whenever I search a stock listing I get Yahoo first and Google second.  Yeah, as it should be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Presumably if you wanted to promote their own.  Is Google a search engine company or a content company?  Can it be both?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a company.  And you know it could be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, then we should stop using it as a search tool because they're not agnostic search results.  So you say they are not agnostic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I do just search for net neutrality set to video and I get some YouTube results.  I get Yahoo result top.  I get New York Times get Colbert report.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  YouTube is just a hell of a lot bigger than Vimeo.  So, you know, if you're trying to search for people who are watching, they're watching Vimeo folks.  Sorry to say it to you.  Well, let's do index Vimeo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, if.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think it's Dailymotion not Vimeo that was complaining, which Dailymotion is very big.  I mean, they're bigger than Vimeo.  Nothing is as big as YouTube.  No.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's always bothered me a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You've got you've got all these things going on in Germany.  You have you have the let's break them up.  You have the let's reject their antitrust.  You have the effort to forbid them to share data across their services.  We talked about last week and then at the EU level, of course, you have the right to be forgotten stuff on top of the street view stuff and all those other things that are going on.  It's just it's gotten absurd over there.  And, you know, I was arguing to their policy guys that they should be fighting more.  The policy, you know, all these policy guys, these companies, because, oh, no, we'll pull back a little bit.  I understand why they say that.  And they're in those trying to find some peace.  I understand why they say that.  But at some point, they've got to start fighting.  I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I love Google anyway.  You know, I'll tell you why in a moment.  They just did something that makes me love them even more.  Ooh, but first, ZipRecruiter.com.  If you are you hiring if you're a company or an HR representative or just a small business that needs great team members, what do you do to find the best candidates?  There are, you know, how many dozens of job boards out there?  Who knows which one's going to produce the best talent?  Ideally, if you wanted to fill that position fast with the exact right candidate, you'd need to post on all of the top job sites.  Well, that's the whole point of ZipRecruiter.com.  You post to more than 50 job sites with a single click plus social networks like LinkedIn and Facebook and Twitter and Google Plus.  ZipRecruiter also makes it look better because they will post they will add your company logo and colors to your posting to make your job pages an extension of your business.  You can add unlimited users to your account, create an instant job page on your website, include a company careers page to use as a careers link.  You post once and watch the qualified candidates roll into ZipRecruiter's easy to use interface.  They they will actually automatically highlight the best candidates.  That is so sweet.  You screen them, rate them and hire the right person fast.  We used it and we were really thrilled with results.  We got a free trial for you for four days.  If you visit ZipRecruiter.com slash twig.  ZipRecruiter.com slash twig.  If you're doing the hiring, you need ZipRecruiter.com slash twig.  We don't since she is not here, we're not going to do the exact change log.  But I think we will talk about a few new things in Google and the one that I'm really most excited about is this new Google.  I guess it's a Google Plus feature.  The new stories.  Yes, that's really cool.  See, it's hard not to love Google when they just give you stuff like this out of the blue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's their plan.  That's their evil plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Evil plan to give you stuff.  That's cool.  If this is evil, I want more of it.  So what they do if you've been posting, as I have been for some time, pictures on Google Plus, they will turn them.  Here's how you get to it.  You go to the photos section on your Google Plus menu and then in the drop down under mores, there's this new one called stories along with albums, auto awesome and so forth.  Stories are auto generated stories of trips, of things you did.  This is our cruise that we did in October.  By the way, I have stories going back to 2007.  Seven years.  I mean, it's amazing.  So this is this is now they I renamed it Adriatic Cruise.  This is a 19 day story.  This was all auto generated.  You can go in and you can caption photos.  You can edit the photos using Google's edit tools and so forth.  But these are all pictures that were posted on Google Plus.  You can you know, you have some control.  It knows where you are.  This is using that same broken system that you were just talking about, Kevin Marks.  But it does it does at least attempt to know where you are.  And we were debating exactly how you said the journal would do like here's St.  Mark's Square.  They would do some photo recognition, say, oh, that's St.  Mark's Square, except the result I'm getting is the hotel we stayed in.  So that could be, I guess, from a check in.  It could be from location information from my phone.  It could be embedded in the picture.  But of course, the name of the hotel isn't embedded, just the GPS locations.  So these are the nearby other things.  And you can drop it down and choose another one.  This actually is the same thing for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It showed I was in Italy recently and it pulled up a photo and it and it identified what was in the photo properly.  But up above, it had sort of the nearest, I don't know, cafe or something.  So I can't remember whether I checked in there.  Yeah.  So it's not exactly clear when you're at someone else's house and it picks some nearby business instead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's my son's.  Sorry.  Prom photos that I took last year and it made a nice little thing for those.  But the location was like, that's not actually where you can fix it.  I mean, you can't fix it.  They've got editing capability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I have to say, I'm really fond of the you could choose what moments are in the story.  You can.  This is a very nice piece of work.  This is basically auto.  What I'm showing you now is completely auto generated with the city.  In fact, I couldn't get the picture.  With the city.  In fact, I couldn't remember some of the locations my pictures were from.  So it was actually a blessing because it told me where I was when we took these pictures.  It shows it shows the travel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nice traveling animations.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Now, it doesn't apparently understand that I did that over over water.  So really, we were in a boat and we sailed around.  It just does kind of a generalized Indiana Jones style.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But still, that's cool.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, this was free.  I wish it would give you the option to plot all those locations on the map.  I wanted to do that just to remember some of the places I'd been to.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can get that out of the location history thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I was definitely not at the budget rent a car.  I was at the beach.  And you plot it, though?  Like can.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll do it quite as pretty as the Google location stuff used to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What was the name of that service used to do that?  Location history.  Yeah.  So you would plot your movements around.  Okay.  But I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because someone said if you uploaded them to, I don't know, Panoramio or something, it would do it.  But it didn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have the dullest one imaginable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was at a conference at the Gates Foundation and I was just me taking pictures of people's slides.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, they're not all.  They can only work with what they're given.  They can't work magic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I've got like I shot my son's hockey game, which means I've got like 20 minutes, 30 minutes of people playing hockey.  And it's not very good at picking the highlights out of those at all.  It doesn't know what it clearly it should look for when everyone's cheering or something and find the goals.  But it doesn't.  It just shows you random bits of people going past.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's interesting about this to me is that Bill Gross talks about the problem.  One of the businesses he talks about launching is the one to solve the problem of too many photos and us going just as Google treats Gmail.  We're not going to get the empty inbox.  We're not going to get to organized picture albums like my wife has loyally done over the years.  The family. Right.  So how are they going to take signals and get nearer to that of organizing too many photos?  That's what's really this is really about.  So I just want to look at it.  Oh, yeah.  I forgot about this photo.  I forgot about that photo and a broad surface them in a way that gave them more value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I think they're they're far closer to doing that than just about anybody.  You might think I photo Apple should be able to do that.  As far as I can tell, they're not even trying all the photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And nobody's the way Google knows me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. And all the photo enhancements they've added, like the one where it creates an auto panorama.  It created a bunch of panoramas from my trip that I didn't even realize.  I know. I didn't realize I had taken all those pictures in a row.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I think they're holding back because they could do face recognition.  They could they could do.  Well, they could do more.  And I bet they will over time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I hope they do, because I would like to be able to see all of the photos of my daughter over the last 15 years.  Well, I can't go through and tag every single photo of her.  Like that would take years.  So I just don't do it.  But if someone could do it for me, that would be a huge, huge favor.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think just the Germans are going to say that's creepy.  It knows your daughter.  It knows how she grows.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the what's it called?  Picasso used to do the Picasso client.  You do the facial recognition with it and then you tell people are right.  And then it would then it had a bunch of things that it would do that would do like time lapses or merges of different images of that person and things like that.  So basically it would do you like a slideshow where it aligned the face and made the background move behind them.  So there's some quite neat stuff that was built into that.  I haven't actually used that for a bit, but that was that was impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I know Facebook has tried to do some, too.  When I upload photos, it tries to do face recognition.  But, you know, I need I need to give someone 30 gigs of photos and say just auto recognize everything in your place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, that's what's the fun thing about this is I've been apparently uploading photos because this does include Picasso since 2007.  So there is there are a ton of albums here.  I can only imagine what the total aggregate CPU and and server usage is for doing stuff like this.  Is this because Google like H&R Block has extra computing time?  And they said, well, what else can we use those?  And they do.  Yes, some slack.  I imagine they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wonder how they allocate that.  That's really interesting processing time they have and how they throw the stuff in this to put this together.  And they didn't have instantly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It seems like they have a budgeting model internally for the computer time and you can priorities depending what you're doing.  So something like this, you would they'd run it as a low priority job in the background behind search indexing things.  But there's internally there's there's a budget system that you apply for machines for your project for.  So they would have had to have had a debate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is there a bureaucracy that adjudicates that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, there was when I was there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I mean, photo recognition stuff you can do.  You can chop that up into little bits and do it in the background in between milliseconds between.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is all chopped up and used across multiple machines.  I mean, the challenge for the photo and the video stuff is moving the data around.  You don't actually want to spread across lots of servers.  You want to make it near the data because the actual the really compute intensive stuff is the stuff they do with YouTube where they do the image analysis of every frame and then the wobble them.  And that's amazing, isn't it?  Correct.  Yeah, that was I was saying I was doing like shooting with the phone handheld shots of my son playing hockey and then they're not great.  But the thing is, it's a 1080p camera.  So you can feed it through YouTube and just takes all the wobble out.  It looks like, you know, I'm sitting there with a phone and Gimbal was doing that.  It's really quite impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Google now is adding bill reminder integration into its cards.  So if it's I guess it's from email, it sees you get bills in your email and they'll say, hey, that bill's due.  It's called a wife.  It's creepy.  That's called creepy.  Hey, Leo, don't you remember the power went out last month when you didn't pay the PG&E bill?  I think you really should consider paying it now.  It would save me some embarrassment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The thing from last week where they tell you how to cancel your subscription.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They're at they're rolling this stuff out fast now, aren't they?  You know, the pace will accelerate because the artificial intelligence minds that run Google are now teaching themselves and they're going to get where?  Yeah, they're self aware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They saw me yesterday when I spoke at Google about privacy before me.  Ray Kurzweil spoke.  Oh, that must have been fun.  It was fun. It was fun.  I presume it's not awful.  What did he say?  Well, just this stuff you'd expect him to say talking about his theories about about all this.  And somebody asked him whether you know, you're going to get this kind of the ultimate creepy question.  Are we going to get to the point where Google where the computer?  Because if your cognizance is in the cloud and it knows what you know and so on and so forth, will it anticipate what you want before you want it?  And he got a laugh and said, no, because you're going to change and we're never going to get to that point.  Right. So we saw we found the limits of the singularity, I think, which is comforting.  Thank goodness. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Because all because humans change.  But the machines won't like that.  So that's another reason for them to get rid of part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Part of the argument, too, is that if our if in the singularity, our consciousness, I'll give us all screwed up.  But if our consciousness is relied with machines, the machines will get faster and faster and faster.  But machines can't anticipate the machines.  Machines will be faster than anyway.  I'm not going to.  You should watch triangulation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We did on Monday with a guy named James Barrett.  He's a documentarian who did a lot of interviews, including Kurzweil.  Nor Peter Norvig, who is Google CTO, or he's very, very smart guy.  And his book is called Our Final Invention, Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era.  And basically, he said, you know, as soon as these machines start designing themselves, it's over for humans.  So we got to start planning for this now.  And a lot of Google people quoted in here because apparently Google is kind of aware of this.  Kurzweil, I asked Kurzweil about this years ago.  He said, Oh, don't worry.  The machines are going to be smarter than us, but they're going to think of us as their parents.  So they're going to they aren't going to wipe us out.  They're just going to tolerate us.  Yeah, sure.  That'll happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No one ever got along badly with their parents.  You know, Barrett is not an AI researcher, but he talked to an awful lot of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I told him, you know, my experience interviewing people like Jeff Hawkins and Ray Kurzweil are all pretty sanguine about the idea that, you know, yeah, their machines are going to be smarter than us, but it's no big deal.  He said, well, you're talking to the wrong guys because about 80 percent of the AI researchers I talked to said this is a crisis that's going to hit us in this century because there's no reason for these intelligent machines to just to let us live.  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What about the three laws?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I asked him about that.  He says that was a fictional device.  And by the way, remember all the stories Asimov's three laws are included in ended badly.  True.  We forget that part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think I robot was the best.  The computers had to enslave us to save us.  We were killing ourselves.  Right. They obeyed the law.  They were doing us a favor.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It was a very interesting interview.  That's all I can say.  And you should watch a triangulation this week.  And I don't know what to say.  I mean, you know, basically said there's you can't stop it.  So what we should do is, you know, spend some energy now thinking about it.  There's even a debate among researchers whether we should go full speed ahead towards this singularity.  He says the people who believe that think, you know, what we should do is make these machines smart now before we're too smart and we'll give them too many weapons, too many tools.  If if if we if these machines achieve super intelligence now, they won't have things like nanotech.  But if you wait 20 years, they'll have nanotech.  They have all this stuff and they just go flick us away.  You guys got nothing to say?  You don't want to know.  No, I'm kind of depressed now.  It's very depressing.  But he says he says, but I think he's wrong.  It's not too late.  I think he's wrong.  Meanwhile, Google's added Bill Rick reminders into our Google map cards, which is handy.  We are the frogs in the boiling pot of water.  Well, but you were right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You made a good point about Google.  It keeps offering you these free things that are super useful and really appealing.  And so you're like, yeah, this is great.  I'm going to do this late about that.  And it gets you across the sort of creepy line.  Right. Google now is perfect.  Creepy line.  No, no, but so Google now follows me and track.  They're going to burn you an effigy when the machines take over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They're going to go. It was Jarvis's fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it gives you such cool things that you get sucked into it.  Right.  Yes, it's the candy.  So Venus Flytrap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So your wife gave you a nice dinner before you got married and you fell in love with her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, there's got to be some reason for this.  Well, yeah, but my wife doesn't have 800,000 servers at her disposal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, she's got something better.  She's got a wife's brain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you know, Faust had a pretty good deal, too, right?  Who?  Faust.  Faust got a good deal.  That seemed like a good deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Sure.  Until, you know, sure.  Until the thermostat stopped working and the house burned down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google turned down the thermostat.  I'm afraid I can't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm sorry, Dave.  You're merely a human, Dave.  Have you seen the what is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not HP.  What's the other company that makes thermostats?  First alert.  Honeywell.  Honeywell.  Honeywell.  So Honeywell is advertising like crazy.  They're listening, talking.  They do the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  We can make our thermostat talk, too.  It's not that hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I now have this flash of every appliance in my house is talking to me.  I don't want my attention.  The toast is done.  I'm sorry, Jeff.  Is it a little hot in here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, it's not good for you when you set the thermostat higher than 67.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You should put a sweater on, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just put a sweater on, Jeff.  It's bad for the environment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Do you want to destroy the Earth?  You don't want to hurt planet Earth.  I still need it.  We need selenium for our switches.  Open the pod bay doors.  No, no, Jeff.  Anything else on the changelog?  There was a lot of stuff, but it wasn't like I didn't go crazy over it.  Google Play is accepting PayPal.  If you go down under Android Leo, it's changelog like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nine wowsy new features for Google Plus and Android.  Is that a word?  I did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's not wowsy.  It's my fault.  We saw the auto awesome stories.  That was one.  Auto awesome movies.  Auto awesome movies.  You can create animated GIFs.  Wait a minute.  Let me let's just show you an example.  So is an auto awesome movie will take your movies kind of like the HTC Zoe highlights feature and turn them in.  I haven't I don't think I have any of these yet.  Yes, this is the one that makes really bad ones from really bad musical.  Right.  Yeah, these are not.  I'm sorry, but this is unusually good.  But Google made this one.  Sure.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And for mine is I've got hockey games and I've got.  Let me see what I got.  So it makes these like cut ups that mess up the music or mess up the order of flow in the game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So in order to see these, you've got to go.  Go to photos.  And then it would be under auto awesome or would it be under videos?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you have to look at an auto awesome and then it shows the video ones as well.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Maybe not.  Let's go to videos.  Yeah, no, I don't.  I can't tell.  Oh, they would have like a little thing on them.  A little magic icon, the fairy dust icon on them.  All right.  Well, the ones I actually have seen these now, as I remember, and they're not they're not particular.  OK, here's what it made.  Here's what it made.  This was a Vista.  No, that's not it, is it?  Oh, that's a motion auto awesome.  OK, I want a video auto awesome.  I guess I don't have any.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So disappointed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is kind of cheesy, especially some of the music and snow ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  Hasselhoff was good.  All right.  Well, let's see.  We'll go back to the article and see what else is new.  There's a lot of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's for sure.  Yeah, there's a lot of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's a lot of new stuff.  Where did I put the audio?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It says it supports large photo libraries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You can create animated GIFs, photo booth style images on demand.  Just tap the new plus button in photos and select either motion or mix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a time when I want to put photos together and you try to you try to encourage auto awesome to do it for you.  Now you're manual.  Awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Just OK.  So now you can scroll through all the photos as well as highlights by date.  Profiles now display total content views on both Android and the Web.  So you can see how many people are looking at your stuff.  A new navigation menu makes it easy.  This is Steven Grove's post here.  Actually, Dave Bezbers.  I'm sorry.  He reshared Dave Bezbers and Dave Bezbers is the guy in charge now at Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, that's he took over from that.  That's Bez.  Right. Right. Right.  Yeah.  He took over from Vic.  Dave was not his name because it was Bez.  But Bez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We call him Bez.  So follow Bez if you want to know what's new and different and exciting.  Wow.  That's a lot of new features.  It goes on and on.  I'm telling you, maybe maybe it was good that Vic left.  Maybe Vic was the roadblock on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, like he like Dave got all this done in in 10 days.  Right.  He did.  It's been in the hopper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So the new app will roll out gradually to Google Play.  If you haven't got it yet, expect it.  I haven't checked to see if I have it yet.  I haven't.  I didn't have it yesterday, but I may have it now.  A new Google Glass app.  Let's say we talked about that.  The nod.  Google Maps adds elevation profiles.  This is kind of cool.  When you're on a bike route, it'll tell you how bad it's going to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was just trying to get that to work.  And now Google Maps says it can't find my house.  It does not like you, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You've been deleted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I think this is this is pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I know.  But I do like their bike reading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I use that a lot.  And it'll show you the elevation that you're going to go over.  It only shows you it on the computer, not on the phone.  Oh, actually on my bike on the San Francisco street.  I have to get off my bike, get my laptop out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But what it's for is before you leave, you look at it and you see if you want to go that way.  Right.  Right.  It seems that by the time you're on your bike, you probably know what the elevation is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Actually, that would be handy if it was on the phone, because I rented a bike in San Francisco and I did not plan my route.  Right.  And basically going vertical.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't want to do that.  I did something even dumber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Matthew, when I lived in San Francisco, I bought a moped.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it can't get up the hills, right?  You have to walk this heavy thing up the hill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, right.  It was the stupidest thing I've ever walked.  That's weird.  You need a more powerful moped.  So you're telling me the Vespa can't go up those steep hills?  I think it only shows you profiles if they're quite long routes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not showing me ones around town ones.  But if I say I will cycle from San Jose to San Francisco, it'll give me it.  You can't get that from me yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I figured out how to wipe out about three quarters of the population of San Francisco if you want to.  Just make it snow.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, that was my favorite thing about the Google self-driving car.  What's this white stuff on the telegraph?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Eww!

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was the comment in the Google self-driving car story last week, is that they can...  They've never driven in snow and they get very confused by rain.  It's like, these were clearly prepared by Californians, weren't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes, but Volvo says by 2017 you're going to be driving a self-driving car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Seattle, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Ah, that's not good.  Our show today brought to you by Shutterstock.com.  I love Shutterstock.  Anybody who uses images, whether it's on a menu, in your blog posting, in your presentations, you should know about Shutterstock.com.  I know there are many competing companies offering you royalty-free images, but Shutterstock has an amazing selection.  37,268,513 royalty-free stock images.  They added 270,000 new stock images this week alone.  All beautifully curated, many from professional photographers and artists.  But this is the thing, in my opinion, that sets Shutterstock aside from everybody else.  They have the best search anywhere.  Really, really sophisticated.  Okay, so let's say Jeff wants to illustrate privacy.  Normally, privacy is not a thing.  How do you search for privacy?  Oh, look at that. There you go.  Privacy, privacy, privacy.  Now, let's say you want to search for German privacy.  I don't know. Is it going to find anything? I don't know. Let's find out.  Yes, it did. It's got German.  I don't know why she's in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She's a dog on a side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You will not violate the privacy?  That's a German Shepherd privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  German Shepherd.  Nicht stören. Do not disturb.  So, Daten Schutt. So you see, this is amazing. I mean, really incredible.  Maybe it's because they are in more than a dozen countries.  That's probably why you can get German privacy in stock photos, illustrations, and vector art.  You can narrow it down by color. They have a color wheel.  The search refinements are amazing.  You can say with people, without people, editorial, non-editorial.  The color wheel means you can actually say, I only want blue German privacy pictures.  I mean, it's just incredible.  But you need this because you do it in your blog post. You want to have an illustration.  It's perfect.  Don't forget the footage tab at Shutterstock.com too.  Incredible royalty-free video.  A lot of it with alpha channels, which means you can un-agree.  I don't know if you have, that one's not available.  If you have it on a green screen, it'll look gorgeous.  Here's the thing. I want you to sign up for an account at Shutterstock.  You don't need to use a credit card or pay for it.  But once you have an account, you can get the free photo and vector of the week, the free footage.  You can also use the lightbox tool to save stuff that you see for inspirational purposes  or to share with a colleague or client.  When you decide to buy, all I ask is use our offer code TWIG514, and then I'll get you 20%.  They have, of course, package deals, but the one I use is a subscription.  We get 25 images a week for the company.  A day, I'm sorry. 25 images a day for the company.  And that really is useful for all of our work.  Our presentations, our media packages, things like that.  Shutterstock.com.  Free to try. If you decide to buy, use the offer code TWIG514,  and that will save you 20% on your first purchase.  And if your first purchase is a billion dollars, as the YouTube purchase of Twitch is,  that's like $200 million.  Can you explain Twitch to me?  Yeah, I love Twitch. You've not used Twitch? Oh, you're, that's right. You're over 30.  I don't like games. I grew up, Leo.  Game streaming.  Justin Khan. Remember him? He did the, this was crazy.  He did Justin TV. It started out with him with a camera on him.  Remember those early Justin videos where you follow him around?  And then he had other people doing it, and then that inspired him because he had so much traffic.  He had to learn about servers and stuff. He had inspired him to create Justin.TV,  which we use, a lot of companies use to distribute video, live streaming or otherwise.  And then they had a brilliant idea. How old is Twitch.TV? A couple of years old now?  They had a really good idea.  Why stream just, you know, stuff like this?  Because most of the video on YouTube is gameplay video.  So Twitch is just, you watch people play games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I cannot imagine anything more stultifiably boring than that.  My daughter does that all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, everybody, everybody.  She watches the Minecraft videos all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So these two guys, actually they've got a pretty good setup.  These two guys are playing this new game, which isn't out yet.  And everybody's very excited about it.  So that's them down there.  They must have a TriCaster or something. They're green screening themselves onto it.  It's just XSplit.  Oh, XSplit will do that? That's awesome.  And then, and then they're describing their play.  Which channel is this?  It was just on the front page. It's, oh, it's GameSpot doing it.  So these are pros. But there's lots of individuals.  So you pick the game you want.  Look at World of Warcraft.  How many World of Warcraft channels are there?  Quite a few.  Oh, good life, people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's no weird watching sport, is it?  It's exactly like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's my, I rest my case.  Yeah, no, I didn't watch sport either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Some of these, this guy, most of these have, you know, a few dozen viewers.  This guy's got a thousand people watching him.  He has a total of 11 million views.  He's got a hundred thousand likes.  And here comes an ad.  So he's making money off of this.  I know a lot of people who want to make their living playing video games.  And for them, this is it.  The rumor, this was broken by variety Sunday afternoon.  So far, apparently, there are early stages in the negotiations.  But the rumor is that Google's been negotiating to buy them for a billion dollars,  which is actually a good deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In fact, good for Justin.  I mean, I'm happy this can be for Justin.  He's a real pioneer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But the real question is, why isn't Microsoft buying them?  Microsoft already has a relationship with them.  You can broadcast on Twitch direct from your Xbox One.  And many of these games are Microsoft games.  This would be a smart move for Microsoft.  I have to think that there's a bidding war going on right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did you ever hear about Twitch plays Pokemon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, we talked a lot about that.  So they wired up a chat room on Twitch.TV so that you could be in the chat room and give commands to like Pokemon Red.  It was like a really old Pokemon game.  And so every there's tens of thousands of people in this chat room pressing up, up, up, up, up, up, up.  And what chat originally the way it was, it was random from the people who hitting a key would just randomly pick an action.  So what you get is a pretty random gameplay.  And then they added the democracy mode where people could vote and the most the highest vote getter.  So it was switched in and out of democracy mode.  Is that still going on?  The Pokemon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I was just looking it up.  I think it finished.  They played several games.  It said peak simultaneous participation, one hundred and twenty one thousand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Jeff, if you think if you think that what we were talking about is boring, this is really well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I met with Eric Martin, who's the general manager of Reddit.  And so he talked about the Reddit.  There's a Reddit side of that.  There's a live Reddit, a Reddit live thread embedded in it, which is our new product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Here's the final Elite Four run and ending, including the final battle with the Elite Four.  Ladies and gentlemen, the excitement was palpable.  So on the right, Jeff, these are people saying this is what we want to do.  And as you can see, there's it's pretty anarchic.  Oh, yeah.  Right.  It was a social experiment as much as I think it was fascinating.  It almost brought Twitch to its knees.  This is three months ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Watching a live edit of Wikipedia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So they're not they're in anarchy mode right now.  You'll see up at the top, it says democracy, anarchy.  And is that Chad, is that bar showing how close to right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you can see the arrow, it's moving towards democracy, democracy, but they need to pass that second gray bar in order to get into them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They're never going to win this game until they get to democracy mode because it's too chaotic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I believe they want it in anarchy.  You're kidding.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Fascinating.  And sort of irritating at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, the music is incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But the chat, you can't this is only the chat with just the commands in it.  The actual chat room.  There's other chat as well.  Right.  There was I mean, there was basically the Twitch chat.  Right.  And they had named every single Pokemon.  They had favorites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They had it was really it was a social experiment.  Yeah.  You nailed it, Matt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So red is over, but they continue to play other games.  Oh, yeah.  They're continuing with Pokemon Crystal.  Yeah, it's incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think this is one of the most interesting things.  And the popularity of this is no surprise to me.  I think this is very, very interesting.  Lots of ways to monetize.  They've got promoted games, as you can see Game Spot, which is a game website.  It has a as a promoted channel on the front page.  Lots of ways to monetize this.  Maybe he asked my daughter Baja Blast takeover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I asked my daughter why she watches because we were somewhere and she was watching someone play Minecraft.  And I said, well, why are you watching them instead of playing it?  She said, well, they have all kinds of mods that I don't have or that I can't run.  And so I'm watching them play, right, because they have these special mods.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But also, if you had those mods and you wanted to learn, I mean, that's why Chad's show is so successful.  OMG.  Crap is because that's how you learn.  In fact, I was playing black the other day and everybody in the chairman says, oh, no, why are you trying to win this game?  Just go watch the YouTube videos.  It'll tell you how to play.  Well, that's what's the point of playing a game.  But people love that.  Who's the number one talent on on YouTube is PewDiePie.  What does he do? He plays through Minecraft and other games and swears a lot.  Is PewDiePie funny at least to that demographic to 11 year olds?  Michael gets up in the morning.  First thing he does is start watching those videos.  And the last thing he does when he goes to bed is watch these videos.  I mean, that's that's and he you know, I hear him chuckling.  PewDiePie has one thousand seven hundred videos.  He has currently he has twenty nine.  I'm sorry. 26 million subscribers.  Wow.  Twenty six.  She's almost twenty seven million subscribers.  Let me just pick one of these and play it.  I mean, I know I have to blip it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You should do Goat Simulator search for Goat Simulator.  We love that game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Sounds good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sounds good. PewDiePie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can search on his channel if you go to his.  Oh, don't worry about it. You got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, there's a young kid whose whose dad helps him make videos of game reviews.  Really? And he's huge?  He's like nine or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Seven. Almost eight million people have watched this video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I feel like being a goat.  Me too. Let's play. I am a goat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I know I can lick things. This is the biggest star on YouTube today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What the f*** was that? Oh, that guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I get points for becoming a ragdoll.  He's what? Swedish?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hi there, sir.  Something like that.  Oh, why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I can't. I'm sorry. I can't. What the f***?  He's not even funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How the jokes were they on when they made this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The biggest star on YouTube today.  So that's why they're going to buy Twitch.TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He is Swedish. He likes our vid, Ulf Gelberg.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is why I despair after 37 years in media.  Maybe they're trying to buy Julio and they just misspelled it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've got it auto corrected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They wanted Twitch and they thought they were getting Twitch instead.  By the way, according to The Verge, Microsoft was in there bidding away.  The company has only raised $20 million.  So if they get sold for a billion, there's somebody making some money there.  They have not yet even turned 20.  They have not yet even turned a profit.  By the way, that's the key to getting a big acquisition deal.  Otherwise, they multiply your profits times some arbitrary number.  Is this Justin's company?  Yeah.  Yeah, good for Justin.  I mean, there's a lot of other people at this point.  But he was the faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just one note on PewDiePie.  Does that mean how Justin gets a cut?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't know. Maybe.  She was like the second person on Justin.TV, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's the last stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Justine's doing okay.  I wouldn't worry about iJustine.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  According to Wikipedia, PewDiePie moved from Italy to the UK for better internet connectivity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's why I'm moving to Austin, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  These economic migrants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And there I rest my case for why we need an open internet.  The PewDiePie drain.  Ladies and gentlemen, we can't afford to lose any PewDiePies.  According to The Verge, Sam Byford and Ben Popper writing,  Twitch has said to have evaluated possible bids and decided on Google's YouTube as the best fit  to help the company scale in line with its massive growth over the recent years.  Well, it is a natural fit.  They're doing the same thing.  Of course, they have plenty of service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a Microsoft fit with Xbox as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I can see why Microsoft would bid for it.  In fact, according to this article, Microsoft and others have made serious approaches to Twitch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it does make more sense.  That would actually be a problem.  Yeah, because then it would be Xbox and none of the other stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, there's other stuff.  Oh, yeah.  YouTube apparently introduced an API at GDC last year.  But the game community didn't embrace YouTube.  It was Twitch that really got the mind share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This says Twitch accounted for 44% of all US live streaming traffic by the way.  Okay, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Enough said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're number three in terms of bandwidth used after Netflix and YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're on YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, no, they're not.  They're on Justin.  They're basically the Justin.TV platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Basically, Justin.TV got taken over by video games and they said, we don't want this on Justin.TV.  And we need offices to be able to mitigate all this gaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So right now there are almost a quarter of a million people watching League of Legends games being played.  The cost must be huge.  Yeah.  Yeah, no kidding.  I think that's probably the reason that they're entertaining in equity.  Yeah, that's like perhaps on the volume.  And only somebody like Google or Facebook could really reasonably.  I guess Microsoft has the server capacity, but that's a big deal.  And by the way, it's a very long tail.  And that's the other thing.  This is long tail stuff.  You've got a few big, big, big PewDiePie types.  But really these big numbers in traffic come from thousands of smaller ones.  Apple's number three.  Yeah, I misspoke.  Twitch's number four.  Beating Hulu, Facebook, Valve, Amazon, Pandora and Tumblr for live streaming video.  Bigger than Hulu.  Bigger than Hulu.  That's not saying that much.  No, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But still.  Well, but Hulu is the repository of all these big networks.  And watching somebody else play a game is bigger than that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I know you don't understand it, but truthfully this is it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, 25 million is pretty big in network terms, isn't it?  Huge.  Does anything get 25 million viewers these days?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  God, no.  I mean, MSNBC is sometimes lucky to break six figures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, but a big, a big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, 10 million is big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  A big network television show can still expect to get 10 to 15.  Yeah.  Maybe even top 20.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but if he's got 25 million subscribers, he's already like naturally above that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, they're not all watching at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  Well, who knows?  They have no lives.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  They may be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, no, you see, okay, yeah, but those are different figures.  Okay, so the subscribers and the live streaming.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's still funny enough.  I know I'm just weird here.  I know most of the world plays games.  I know I'm weird at this.  I know I'm weird.  Right.  But playing the game myself, at least I kind of get it, watching somebody else play it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I got the most views that we've ever gotten on this network probably were people playing video games.  Father Robert playing the Goat Simulator, me playing Skyrim.  When Brushwood first played the Lords of the Old Republic, when these new games come out, there's a lot of interest.  And if you have, frankly, PewDiePie shouldn't be doing that well.  If you have somebody really funny, really interesting doing this, it appeals to everyone.  It's really fun.  And that's how you learn how to play.  And I think kids do.  Why do you think PewDiePie does so well, Chad?  You're our local expert on YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I truly do think that his humor is what people want.  What you saw was the start.  Things get absurd.  So he is funny.  I believe they're, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He's funny to a kid.  The truth is YouTube is a kid network.  Well, absolutely.  Any of the demographics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But also he's grown so much with the medium that he can now put resources that other people don't have.  All that editing, almost no one else can do that quick style of editing for six hours of content.  He does a lot of editing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's not live streaming.  So he wouldn't work well on Twitch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, but I thought the point you were making was on YouTube the best content is video game content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's why YouTube is saying, wow, we better get in this live streaming thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was saying just the other day, I think YouTube is a place for video games because that's the only type of content that can make money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  But it's also the way things propagate.  So Minecraft, a big chunk of how that propagates is people watching videos of people building other things in Minecraft and going off to build them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But that's not exactly true.  A lot of the very, very popular stuff is Let's Plays, is watching someone else play the game.  And it's because they connect with that personality.  It's entertainment.  Entertainment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not like Yasi Krosho does those brilliant, very funny video game reviews that are five minutes long, that are a bit more classic thing.  I've watched those and enjoyed those.  Those are more adult, believe it or not.  But I suppose, yeah.  It's like what we're doing here.  We're just talking to mics and we don't edit this down to a show.  See what I mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is not youth-oriented content.  Here's John Oliver on his show last week tonight talking about the right to be forgotten.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  This is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's talk about something else.  The internet.  In Europe this week, there was some potentially significant news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is said the internet never forgets.  Until now, that is.  In a huge ruling, the highest court in Europe ruled that Google and other search operators like it must delete search results if they are requested.  They're calling it the right to be forgotten.  What if 10 million people suddenly approach Google and say, by the way, you know that story about me running over a squirrel on my bicycle while drunk and naked?  I want that removed.  Okay, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That is way too specific to be something that he just came up with off the top of his head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The case originated in Spain.  A man there argued that when a Google search turned up an auction notice of his repossessed home from back in 1998, that somehow that being out there was a violation of his privacy rights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That Spanish man is Mario Costeja Gonzalez.  This is his photo, which was on an article from the New York Times about his crusade to remove links mentioning his debts from 1998.  In doing so, he is now world famous for being that Spanish guy with debts from 1998.  The only thing I know about him is the only thing he didn't want me to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The right to be forgotten.  I played way too much of that.  I'm sure we're going to take down now from HBO.  That's the new John Oliver show on HBO.  I love John Oliver, so I give him a plug.  Let's see.  Google and Apple of... did we talk about this last week? Have buried the hatchet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I don't think we did actually.  I've talked about it many, many times.  Did I tell the story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's a great story because Motorola and Apple were suing one another.  They said, you know what? This isn't going well for anybody.  Let's just drop the case. No licensing.  In fact, we've agreed to work together in areas of patent reform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the main thing is they realize that their common enemy is not each other.  It's the trolls.  They're only encouraging troll behavior.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm hopeful that this means that Apple has recognized that even though they've won two cases now against Samsung,  that the awards are diminishing.  Samsung in this case actually won a little bit back from Apple.  And it's just bad PR and it reveals stuff that Apple doesn't want revealed in Discovery.  All of this is just bad for Apple all around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Samsung is not in the settlement. It's just Google and Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But I'm hoping that this is the beginning of a kind of general detente.  And of course the thing you want to see is if Rockstar goes away.  That's the Apple-Microsoft consortium that is really the Nortel patents is designed to go after.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The problem with this is that this settlement was used by certain commentators to say,  well, this shows the patent system is working because they've settled it.  It's like, no, they spent $200 million in legal fees trying to fight it first.  And the depressing news today is that Senator Lee has refused to bring the patent reform bill forward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He said, now he's not refused. I mean, his point was he doesn't think he had the votes to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah. Basically, there was a, his head of staff has just, former head of staff has just gone to work for the patent control lobbyist group.  Oh, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's a little suspicious. He had sponsored the bill, Patrick Leahy.  I think he's a good senator from Vermont on these issues.  He said in his statement, there was a lack of sufficient support.  We've been working for almost a year with countless stakeholders on legislation to address the problem of patent trolls or misusing the patent system.  This is a real problem facing businesses in Vermont and across the country.  We have repeated concerns. The House passed bill went beyond the scope of addressing patent trolls and would have had severe unintended consequences on legitimate patent holders.  This is the issue, of course, is what is a patent troll?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing. I mean, this is the problem is that a lot of these alleged legitimate patent holders aren't. They're people who hold very serious patents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They're not what we call non-practicing entities. They don't actually make anything. They probably didn't even hold the original patent. They bought it.  Right.  So, I mean, I think there are certain litmus tests that you can use to see if somebody's really a troll or just somebody legitimately.  Well, the guy who won the intermittent windshield wiper case against, I mean, that was an amazing story.  It took decades to resolve. And he had a real case. He wasn't a patent troll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The point is that the reforms, the patent law is out of balance. It doesn't currently make sense.  It is causing us billions of dollars of unnecessary costs every year to sort of say, oh, the balance isn't quite right to fix it.  No, the thing is out of balance. Past that bill, you can always pass another bill later if it overreaches.  And that's the problem here. And the fact that he gets to veto this thing when it passed the House by 200 and something to 50 or something.  Yeah, that's a flaw in the system, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jeff Roberts has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  325 to 91 it passed the House.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jeff has a source that said the process failed because Leahy didn't want to choose winners and losers.  So in other words, he lost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's chosen a winner and he's chosen the trolls as winners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This 42 state and territorial attorneys general sent letters in support.  Google and Microsoft and hundreds of others companies urged senators to pass this bill.  But Leahy says there was insufficient support.  So all right. Yeah, I'll blame Leahy.  I think you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He has said he has veto rights over this. He's applied his veto. And that's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right. That is an awfully powerful thing. One guy to kill this bill.  And we do, we do, of course, feel like this is a very important bill for us here at Twitter.  The podcast community is threatened by a patent troll.  And so it's not this is personal.  Yes.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I guess that's it. Right.  I mean, he says we'll talk about this next year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're going to try and readjust it in the next session.  But the point is, is we've got now got to wait like for that to go.  It's not the end of the fight, but it's still really annoying because it looked like we were getting really close.  And the thing is, this was there were several bills introduced and they were consolidated to this one.  And now they've been shut down on mass.  So there's a lot of action going on in this this this year.  I mean, probably a lot of it is fixed patents.org is good.  That's that's run by engine advocacy and that that gives you ways to contact your senators.  But I would still recommend doing that. Go go there and complain to your senators to say what just happened.  We were looking, you know, we thought you were about to fix this.  You let me put us down. Fix patents dot org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Very disappointing.  And now that you now that you mentioned it, I'm not too happy with Patrick Leahy.  Huge cost. Yeah. Huge cost to these.  Cost to innovation cost to everybody. That's just the companies that are sued.  Google Glass being handed out to medical students at UC Irvine.  Several medical institutions have been testing glass, but the School of Medicine at the University of California Irvine is issuing glass to its students.  Fully incorporating glass into its four year curriculum.  First and second year students will use the device in anatomy and clinical skills.  Third and fourth year students will wear glass during their hospital rotations.  Get ready for a doctor to come into your room wearing glass.  I think it's a great creepy.  Well, he's wearing a stethoscope. What the hell, you know?  That's interesting. That that might be a very what they don't say exactly what software they're going to use or how they're going to use it.  I hope it's more than just taking selfies.  But they is there specialized medical software?  There must be. I'm sure there will be. There will be. If there isn't glass.  Glass did lose its lead electrical engineer.  Adrian Wong took a job with Oculus Rift.  Oh, he was the lead electrical engineer on glass.  He'd been there since December 2010. He was came from Sandia National Labs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's now. I know I don't want my doctor to wear Oculus Rift.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where are you? I know you're here somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow. He holds 10, by the way.  Actually, they do. Because because when you do the surgery, the arthroscopic surgery, yeah, it's a robotic orthoscopic.  Basically, he was he made them better off in Oculus Rift, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This guy, Wong, was listed his on Angel List his time at Sandia as being a former spy gadget maker for the US government.  He has 10 patents, including wearable computer with nearby object response, wearable computer with superimposed controls and instructions for external advice method to autofocus on near eye display and unlocking a screen using eye tracking information.  This guy's kind of a wizard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, you know, I think this is, you know, there's probably quite a bit of movement back and forth all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have to say one of the speaking about the medical thing, one of the first sort of Google Glass implementations that I thought really made a lot of sense was the doctor who used it while he was operating.  Yeah. And it brought up a bunch of patient information that was crucial to him while he was operating.  He would have had to stop the operation, go to his computer, pull up the patient's info.  I mean, it all happened while he was doing it. That makes total sense to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But I mean, how much detail can you get? The text has to be pretty big. You can't put a lot of lines of text on Glass, can you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, and it was he was looking at things like contraindicated sort of medicine or sensitivities to specific.  I can't remember the details, but it was, you know, fairly specific information. It wasn't reading an entire, you know, patient history.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  OK, Glass, search how to do open heart surgery.  That's what you do. Search Aorta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Where is that? Search YouTube. Search YouTube for Aorta.  YouTube videos. Aorta removal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Actually, the new head of Google Glass is a marketing executive, Ivy Ross.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They need some marketing help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  She has a rich tech background, served at Mattel, The Gap, Disney, Coach and Old Navy in marketing.  But she's also was working at Bausch and Lohmann in the early 90s, Vice President of Design and Development for Outlook Eyewear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But what are they? Are they marketing this product or are they marketing some product to follow?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, she's the head of Glass.  Yeah, she's the head of the whole thing.  Not just marketing. She's the head.  The head. Yeah, the head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got somebody at Rochester Optical came up for me in Google Plus saying you complained a little bit about your glasses, Jeff.  We have some really great lenses and frames. Want to try them?  Sure. Why not?  So much money has been thrown into this thing.  When I spoke at Google yesterday, when I put on Glass, they were grateful that I put it on.  You put on an Audible Chrome?  No, I'm not there. It's the one place on Earth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But really, how many people were wearing Glass in the audience?  Like maybe four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think if you laugh at somebody for wearing Glass at Google, that's probably a fiery...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You shouldn't laugh at them. You shouldn't laugh at them. But you may not be wearing it yourself.  All right. That's it. We've talked it all. We've talked about every story. Is there any story you guys want to rehash?  Anything you see in the list? All right, Jeff, we're going to get you a number.  The Metaphorsia story is interesting.  There's Kevin D'Artagnan Marx.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is that? What's the story there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Wait a minute. Who's Athos? Who's Porthos? Who's Aramis?  The four musketeers. You're Aramis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I love how Jeff has a net neutrality banner on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's taken me a while to parse all of this. I see.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Is that Darth? That's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Who did that?  Here, let me check who in the chat room, who I grabbed that from.  Thank you, chat room.  I grabbed that from Ben.  I didn't do this story because I feel like this is a developing story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But do we care about the lawsuit that accuses Google of AdSense fraud? This doesn't seem like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I can't figure out. And I also have a conflict of interest. I didn't even know what this is.  I repost, I work with them in networks and stuff, and officially I'm an advisor. And I didn't know anything about this.  But I have a conflict there of unknown nature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  A lot of class action lawsuits are just relief, you know, kind of fishing expeditions.  So I don't know what the evidence is that there is any fraud or anything done on AdSense incorrectly.  People for years have said there's issues, but nobody's ever really got proof. So I'm going to dismiss that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And part of the issue is that it's not very transparent.  The only time you see the fraud is in the quarterly statements of how much the cost of sales was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If you use AdSense, you just have to trust that you're getting what you're paid for.  Google is passing through most of the money.  And yet Google's not keeping it all. It's an unheard of business where they count it all and they go, here's your share.  Yeah.  It's a black box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why the Matt Hohey Metafilter article is interesting because he talks about how Metafilter's been around for 15 years or so.  I think it's 15 years. It's a long time anyway.  And he gives you a graph of the revenue they got over time and you see these like steps in it where Google changed the algorithm.  Because part of Metafilter is AskMetafilter, which is people asking for advice.  And at some point that started ranking really, really well in Google.  And then they were able to sell ads on that and pay for the 10 employees or so that were taking over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's a study going around called Peak Advertising that describes the hypothesis that perhaps advertising already reached its peak.  And people are harder to reach these days because they're prone to ignoring ads.  And he said that happened to Metafilter. We reached our peak in late 2011, early 2012 and has seen a swift decline since revenues are at the 2007 level as of May 2014.  And of course Metafilter has more staff, has more expenses, but the revenue has gone down.  But he also says live by the Google sword, die by the Google sword.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But he said, I mean, I spoke to him last year at XOXO about Metafilter and things and he said, they're seeing, he mentions this further down,  they're seeing the climb of views from mobile, which means that the ads convert less well.  So they've been steadily losing revenue from that.  Even though their views are about the same, because as people start moving their views from the computer to the phone, that reduces the amount of ad revenue they get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Matt, the interesting thing here is Matt was the first person I know who started a focused blog that made money from Google ads.  I think it was a DVR blog, as I remember.  And it was really incredibly early. Yeah, PVR blog.  Oh, I remember that. Yeah, that's right.  PVR blog and he started that and just as an experiment, not only put that stuff up.  And so then he got ads on Google.  He started making money. He started making decent money because he was the only guy writing about PVRs and it showed, you know,  I learned a lesson from that about specialization and networks and all this stuff.  And so he's always kind of lived by Google to the extent that he's always been.  But yeah, you can't make a living just on that.  And you are vulnerable to bad players also coming in and ruining the algorithm for you.  That's ContentFarms. About.com is a decent company, but it got hurt badly by ContentFarms learning from what it did.  Well, I love Matt, Howie.  And I thought Metafilter was great, as he points out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Maybe Metafilter belongs to three or four Internet companies.  He's announcing layoffs and he's asking if people want to help Metafilter.  Yeah, I just put the funding link in the chat.  Help fund Metafilter.  Because the thing is he charged a $5 subscription fee for Metafilter, but it's a one time subscription fee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's a, you know, that's the problem is if he's got ongoing expenses.  So he's what he's asking is, please, if you want to stand up for Metafilter,  that'd be great.  I have to say that Metafilter does feel a little bit old school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I say that understanding that someday Twitter will be in exactly the same position where we'll probably have to say,  yeah, you know, nobody ever watches videos anymore.  But I'm taking this as a reminder to go and look at it because there's good stuff there.  It's always been.  It's always been a great thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I don't know why Reddit would be any more out of date than let's say, I mean, Metafilter being more out of date than let's say Reddit.  I mean, it doesn't. It's very similar in a lot of ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a blog with comments with a good comment community basically.  Dig in that form die.  So yeah, there is a there is a half life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I've always used, you know, when I talk about the blog, I'm talking about the blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm talking about the blog.  I'm talking about the blog.  There is a there is a half life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I've always used, you know, when I talk about online community and comments and so on, I've always used Metafilter as an example of one that's really, really successful.  I mean, it has lasted a long time and a lot of it has been just the community sort of policing itself.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they do have a moderators and it's been doing a great job there for a long time in setting up those community standards that they do behave that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, this will be the test if the community steps up.  And by the way, when you go to Metafilter.com, you'll see right at the top an important message about Metafilter that will take you to that information and also to a funding link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Matt's really one of the he's one of those pioneers who's unsung.  Metafilter and NPR.  I don't think he's done early blogs, you know, but he just he doesn't have the attention that others have.  Right. Because he doesn't have the ego that people like me have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right. Well, we've interviewed Matt several times on Twitter.  I think the world of him and Metafilter.  He's a great guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But he's got a great point about the peak ads as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, it's not just that maybe it may not be Metafilter, maybe Google.  Yeah. And he says, we'll never know. It's a black box.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's something I've heard from that from other people as well who rely on advertising.  You know, we do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's one of the reasons we rely on ads that we sell or our partners sell.  And we are very more it's funny, more inquisitive than mainstream media.  We we talk to our advertisers a lot about how the ads are working, what we can, you know, how we can work with them to make them more effective for our audience.  And often the response we get is, gee, nobody ever asked me that before.  I mean, your ads are like 1950s television ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're very old fashioned.  Yeah, we're very old fashioned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And they're and actually Leo's ads are effectively native advertising, right?  That's the sort of goal that lots of media companies are trying to get to with native ads and sponsored content.  They're trying to get to ads that are just content.  They're just like the rest of your content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We try not to think of it in that way, but it is.  I mean, I think it's pretty obvious when we're in an ad, we don't try to hide the fact that we're in an ad, but it is part of the overall content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. And the best part is that you talk about the thing and how good it is.  Right. That's what makes it so effective.  It's not just a pop up window or a, you know, pitch man.  It's the kind of ad it's hard to ignore.  But it also it has a personal value to it.  And that I think makes so as opposed to the wallpaper ads that appear everywhere that people ignore.  I know. I mean, I'm looking at an article on the MailOnline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The MailOnline is a really good example of a website that is just larded with ads, right?  I mean, just larded with ads.  And Charles wearing a given glass.  I could tell you. Yeah.  I saw that. I just saw that.  I see the article.  I am very attuned as I'm sure most people are just not.  I don't know what those ads were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, I think they're pretty and especially if you're younger than 30, I don't even think your I registered.  So click through rates are point zero zero zero zero one percent.  Many of those are accidents, you know, or drunk people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So so I don't think in fact Google is I mean, we don't know because it's a black box, but I don't think they're probably lying about this.  I have a feeling that there's more likely the case that they're just less.  These ads are less and less effective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's but that's you know, if you look at Google's positioning stuff on this, they now talk about threading the ads together across the different domains.  So they will show you an ad on a website and then show you a different ad on mobile that's related to that.  Smarter.  The other option in the we've tried to see if you go to their talks where they're actually pitching to advertisers every now and then I go to a conference as one of those and I drop in and see what the story is this time.  And for the last couple of years, it has been very much.  We understand that the website pure website advertising is dipping, but we have and they have a plan mobile.  And there's search ads on mobile are a very powerful thing because they they they want to be taking action directly from them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Or you can do what twitch.tv is doing into it to a mountain do takeover.  I mean, it's hard to miss that ad.  That's a very expensive ad unit, by the way, when you do it, this called a takeover.  I you know, I like an appropriate placement for the for Mountain Dew.  I like our model and and our ads work very well for our advertisers and I hope work well for our community.  And I hope work well for our community.  What we're trying to do is is is we don't think the ads will work unless our community likes them likes the content likes the companies because we you know it's easy enough to fast forward through them.  So you know we that we take that pretty seriously.  And Prince of Wales does look good in Google Glass.  This was today in Winnipeg.  I wonder what his royal reaction he's by the way believed to be the first royal to try on glass.  He actually was trying on app designed to help workmen keep up with the jobs they have to do.  Sure.  You know, I'm picturing the Queen with glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We are not of you.  Update on the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We began the show with the Guardian says the nest smoke alarm is returning to sail.  The nest smoke alarm is returning to sail amidst reports of a full recall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The press release was really about the warning in April.  It wasn't something new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right. Well, it was pulled from sale in April and then a press release from the US Consumer Product Safety Commission sparked a flurry of reports that the company was initiating a full recall.  Nest confirmed to the Guardian the CPSC release was just about that release in April.  They just were a little slow.  No further recall is planned and they plan to put them back on sale.  I think.  Let me see.  Well, it doesn't say that, but the headline does say the alarm is returning to sail.  I don't see that anywhere in the article, but maybe I'm missing it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Here it is.  We'll be bringing the Nest Protect back on the market in a few weeks.  So I apologize for the error.  And I fixed an update.

Matthew, you got anything interesting?  A story you're covering?  A tool you like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Actually, I was trying to think of one and I came up with the New York Times Labs have come up with a tool called Vellum.  I don't know if you've heard of that one.  No.  V-E-L-L-U-M.  I'm sure Jeff has because it's his beat.  No, I haven't.  No, it's, so they didn't launch it or anything.  I just sort of saw someone mention it.  And so I think it's an experiment, but it's a, it basically pulls in links from your Twitter stream  and sort of lays them out on a page.  So it's a little like paper.li or there was another one that did something similar, but it's very well designed.  And I know after a couple of days not checking Twitter, I know that's hard to believe.  You know, I went back to try and to just sort of catch up and see if anybody had shared something interesting.  This is me.  It just pulls in your Twitter stream and pulls out links, shows you who shared them.  So it's quite handy and it's very well designed and fast.  This was very much a business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One of my students was going to start and she didn't.  So, yep.  You snooze, you lose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  A simple reading list for the links your friends are currently sharing your Twitter feed puts the spotlight on content.  Links are ranked by how often they've been shared by those you follow.  Hey, this is good.  I'm going to try this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, I really like it.  I've been using it for the last couple of weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This seems like something I could really, let me, let me, instead of doing my regular Twitter account, I think I'll follow the,  I have a links for Twitter account that is news.  So this would be actually a very useful little reading list for me to keep up with the tech news.  Retrieving.  Look at this.  This looks good.  Tech news today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's quite simple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That makes me want to go in and kill off some people.  Oculus and Palmer Lucky being sued by CTO's former employer, Zenimax Media and id Software.  Best new apps in the app store.  Silent Circle raises 30 million dollars, moves to Switzerland.  That's that's the that's actually an interesting story.  That's the private email system that Phil Zimmerman of PGP is doing with Levar Levinson, Ledar Levinson, the guy who was shut down by the Edward Snowden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, who wrote a spectacular and frightening piece about the history.  His story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's really poor Ledar.  He's he's really been bullied by the US government and not rightly so.  We had him on triangulation some time ago.  He talked about that story and there's a little more detail in the Guardian piece.  Sad.  Remembering as an extreme sport memory athletes.  That's a New York Times article.  This is good.  It shows you the sources on the right.  I like it.  Vellum.  It's at Vellum dot NYT labs dot com.  Thank you, Matt.  That's a good one.  Let's say hi to Kevin Marks.  What do you got for us?  Huh?  Huh? Huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to show you Bridgy and BRID dot GY.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So this is another game.  You're the guy who showed us 2048.  This isn't a game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is an indie web.  Oh, thank God.  The 2048 is.  Bridgy, right?  I can tell you that.  Well, you just dragged me about my 2048.  I'm sorry.  Did you ever see the nuclear fusion version?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Stop.  Just stop now.  Stop right now.  It's not too late.  Let's do Bridgy and then you can show us the nuclear fusion.  So Bridgy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is this is like Internet plumbing stuff.  Is this Tontex thing or is it something else?  This is this is this is indie web stuff.  So Tontex involved with founding that.  But this is actually by Brett who's built this.  So what it does is it connects the stuff that you post on your own site back  and forth to Facebook and Twitter and so on with a series of different  different tools that we've built for Indie Web.  So the point is that you can post if you have a post that you make on your site,  it can propagate that to Facebook and then send you back the comments to your  site.  We just broke Bridgy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh no.  We snuffed it.  Oh dear.  Actually the front page is OK.  Just some of the some of the links within.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I will warn Ryan that you're doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Everybody go to BRID.GY.  We're going to do a little bit of a torture test here.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is the point is what it does.  The point of these web mentions is that it's a way to communicate that you've  commented on a site back and forth.  So the Indie Web technique is that you write a post, I link to your post,  and then I send a ping to you to your web mention and point to say I've mentioned  your post and then you can make that appear on your site as a comment.  And this is a tool to make that track back kind of or kind of like track back.  It's more like being back to track back was not verified.  So it was very easy to spam.  Right.  Whereas this actually verifies that the site has linked to you and makes the  connection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And this is a concept that Indie Web Camp came up with called Posse.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Publish on your own site.  Syndicate elsewhere or share elsewhere.  OK.  The basic idea being that anything you write you should primarily post on a  domain that you control.  Yes.  And then post links to it or copies of it on other domains.  Because that way when those other sites go away you haven't lost your rights.  Right.  And that's something I've been doing more recently.  Previously I've been using Blogger, which hasn't gone away fortunately,  but I've been using my own site and posting things there and then copying them to  Blogger or copying them to Medium and so on.  That's a great idea.  I don't do it yet with tweets, which other people do.  Tandem does do it with tweets.  I don't have a place to post tweets on my own site yet, but I should do that.  But the point of Bridges is that it will propagate the network comments back to  your open website, which means that if you've got something set up that is that is  Indie Web and supports Web Mentions, that comments on that article on Facebook and  Twitter and Google Plus and so on and Instagram will come back to you.  And the thing that was just added was Web Mentions for large blogging platforms,  Blogger, Tumblr and WordPress.  There's a way to set that up so that when you write a new post on Blogger,  it will send Web Mentions to any links you mentioned in that post so they can  display them as comments on their site.  And conversely, if someone mentions your post elsewhere, you'll get those comments  appearing as part of your comment stream on that site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So it all ends up in the comment stream?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are there plugins or do you have to?  It uses the API.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So for the various, depending on which page you're using, there are plugins or  there's API calls.  So the Blogger one, it calls the Blogger API.  I think WordPress is a plugin.  And I think Tumblr is an API.  But I use Disqus as my commenting system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think Disqus does this as well.  I mean, that was the whole point of Disqus.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm not sure it does that fully, but it does some of this.  But it's not using the same protocol.  So it's not as, you know, you're then depending on another.  The point of this is this is a switching point that replicates the web mention  experience, which is a distributed protocol for these concentrated places.  But the goal should still be that you're building web mentions in a distributed way.  So it's not dependent on this.  But this is like a bridge.  It's a way to connect these things back and forth.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And it sounds like it's going to be impossible for a normal human to implement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You should talk about fragmentations.  I don't know if we have time.  What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Fragmentions.  Fragmentions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fragmentions.  Sorry.  Fragmentions.  So, Fragmentions.  This is an idea I came up with another IndieWeb thing.  And the problem, let me see if I can state this well.  The problem is you want to link to something on the web.  But most places on the web don't make it easy for you to link to part of the page.  Basically, there's a couple of methods that you can mark part of the page as linkable.  You can put an a name tag or you can put an ID on it.  And then if you put a hash sign after the URL and the ID, then you can link to that piece of it.  Now, this is, it's been in the web platform for a long time.  But the problem is actually finding those IDs is quite hard.  You mostly have to do view source or the site has to work to give you a link that you can get from it.  And you can only link to the places where there are IDs.  So, what I wanted was to link to, you know, thinking about the use case of linking to something.  What you normally are doing is quoting them and linking to that quote.  So, you're saying somewhere in this long 400 page post there was this quote that I thought was interesting.  I'll cite that and I want to link to that text.  And so, what I came up with was this fairly arbitrary syntax, which was instead of one hashtag, put two hashtags.  And then put the words separated by plus signs.  Which means it's human authorable.  You can write these by hand fairly easily into the address bar.  And then Jonathan Neal, who's one of the IndieWeb guys, wrote a script for this.  So, it does two things.  First, you can put this script on your site.  So, if you make one of these URLs, it will link to that text and you can then highlight the paragraph.  And then secondly, he made a Chrome plug-in for it, which means that you can do this to any site and it will do that.  It will link to and highlight the text that you're linking to.  So, that was something that we put together a few weeks ago.  When was this?  Oh, it was almost a month ago.  And the value of this is actually conforms with what you want to do.  And then more recently, he added the feature to the Chrome extension that if you select some text and right-click on it, you can get a fragmention link from that.  Which means that actually creating these links gets much easier.  Yeah, that's nice.  So, it will then create and highlight the link.  You can copy and paste that.  So, that was added to this as well.  Very cool.  The thing is, once we found that we added it to some of our blogs and we added it to the IndieWeb account Wiki,  and then we found we were using it all the time, because generally you want to link to a piece and even with a Wiki that's fairly well structured, you may want to link to a paragraph within a longer piece.  And we found that this worked quite well.  And then a week later, or a couple of weeks later, I got a ping from John Borthwick talking about the app now.  The app, the Read Later app.  What's that called?  Pocket?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Instapaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Instapaper.  Instapaper.  So, this is Marco's app that Borthwick and Pater worked together.  So, the basic point of that is you get a Read Later button in your browser, you click on any too long article, and then later on when you're on the bus or sitting at home with your iPad or whatever, you open it up and you read the long form thing when you've got time.  And the new version of this, they added a feature that lets you highlight text in it and then share that out on the web.  And what they did was they integrated fragmentations into that.  So that if you highlight a piece of text in one of these long form pieces and then post it out to Tumblr or Twitter or whatever, it will create a fragmentations link that then goes back to that page.  And then they modified their browser extensions, which are for Chrome and for Firefox, to support this as well.  Which means that like any of these things, you need to have script in more than one place for this to be useful.  But it has a reasonably stable failure mode, which is if the browser doesn't understand what you're doing, you just get linked to the top of the page.  But once you add this, it starts getting more useful.  So it's one of these ideas that makes a lot of sense to me, and it's a starting point for richer kinds of linking in the web.  And have a look at it, try it out, see what you think.  I think it's a great idea.  Yeah.  The original post is kevinmarx.comfragmentions.html.  And there's links in that to the various other places about that, the Chrome plugin and so on.  And the main discussions going on at the...  Indiewebcamp.com  Indiewebcamp page on this.  Hang on, I just placed that in the wrong window.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Indiewebcamp.com slash fragmentation.  Fragmentation.  Fragmentation.  Fragmention.  Fragmention.  By the way, when you search for this, Google is going to always say, did you mean fragmentation?  You mean fragmentation.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I remember when...  It's a terrible idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But it says what it does, which I like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Dave Weiner and Jay Rosen, I think, both had links to specific paragraphs in their blog posts.  I think Dave was the first one to do that.  So that you could link directly to a paragraph instead of to the...  That always seemed like a great idea to me.  We all do it.  We all do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Because as you point out in your original posts, Kevin, links don't get deprecated so fast.  And so what I always do, I Google a passage.  And that always works better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's true.  And that was part of what made me think of it.  I went to the annotations workshop, WTC, talking about this, and realized that actually the most robust thing is...  Google it.  ...some text.  And then that made me think about, oh, if I want to cite part of a page, then we should do the same thing.  And you get into debates about what happens if the text is edited or how do you support punctuation and so on.  But the starting point is having a piece of the text that you can apply those kind of algorithms to and creating those.  And if you go to the Fragmention page on the IndieWebCamp, there's links to lots of other variations of this idea that have happened over time.  So yeah, I'm not saying this is completely original, but it's a practical implementation that actually works.  We've got a bit of support for it.  And the syntax for it, I think, is better than the other syntaxes that have been proposed previously, which is one of the reasons this has taken off.  And try it out. See what you think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And there's a WordPress plugin, a Drupal plugin. There's a lot of different ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but basically it was put together like we were like noodling about ideas in the IRC for IndieWeb.  And Jonathan said, oh, I can implement that. Hang on. Give me 15 minutes.  And 15 minutes later he said, here, here's some script that does it.  That's really neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And you know, this IndieWebCamp is really starting to show some real interesting results.  I'm glad you're doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's been sort of ticking over for a while, but we're starting to get working code in more than one place.  And that's when you start getting takeoff.  Find out more.  The next thing is to try and then get platform vendors to integrate it as well.  So the other IndieWeb news this week I should mention is one of the IndieWeb open source projects, Idno, is now a company called Known.  Known, K-O-N-W-N. If you go to withknown.com, they you can see what they're talking about there.  Basically, it's a it's a holding page.  But the what this is Ben Wordmuller and Erin Joe Ritchie have put together this like up to date publishing platform.  That's like a modern blogger or a personal Twitter or whatever you want to call it.  And they've it's been an open source project that Ben's been working on mostly for most on his own for a while.  And Erin's been helping with the design on it.  And they've just quit their jobs and done a startup to go and work in incubator to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is what we used to call life streaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  But it's but it implements all these IndieWeb protocols.  It implements web mentions.  It implements RSVPs, which is a variation of web mentions that lets you actually invite people to events and have them say yes or no.  And then it bridges those back and forth to Facebook and Twitter and so on.  So there's there's a lot of nice subtle stuff in this.  It's a way to give you back control over your own postings and still propagate them out to Facebook and Twitter and so on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And it's fairly mature. You can install this now.  Is it working?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They are setting up a hosted version of it.  You can you can install it now, but you have to set it up yourself with a PHP hosting service to make that smoother.  So at the moment, yeah, the point of this is to make the install process more easy than getting stuff off GitHub and doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But the principle the principles one that Dan Gilmore wrote about and he and I talked about, you know, the idea that so many people have kind of moved away from a blog that you have that's your own and and are posting content on Google Plus or Facebook or Twitter or lots of places that are effectively owned by large corporations and are siloed to some extent.  And that we're losing a lot of the sort of, you know, the principles that IndieWeb supports where you you kind of control your own content and you and you let you share it with whoever.  But but your your site is the central place where it exists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I like this. And now I think maybe, you know, when live streaming started, it was a little maybe early.  But now that we are all using these silos aggressively and Instagram and Twitter and everything would be nice to have.  This is a known stream.  It would be nice to have somewhere that they could just all go that you own.  Yeah. And it's a friend feed.  I love friend feed.  I miss friend feed.  Me too.  Problem with friend feeds.  Everybody. Nobody used it.  They just ported their stuff into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Like, that's the thing.  So this is this is the like, in some ways, the inverse of that.  This is you post it on your own side and then it goes elsewhere.  Your stuff into Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I like it.  And I want to set up my own.  I want to change my blog to a known stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Excellent. Go for it.  Think Ben, he'll help you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  OK. Well, maybe I could just download it from GitHub and we'll see what happens.  Yeah. What the heck.  All right. Jeff Jarvis has been very patient with his number.  The lights have gone out in his house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it's right. It's darker now.  And that's the way that's the middle of the night.  Maybe I'm pink.  I promise if I put my hands up here, then my skin tone gets OK again.  And if I put them out here, they don't. Why is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  She told your hands on your computer screen.  Your camera is because your face is not enough landmass for the camera to iris down.  It's better. You need a big face. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I always thought I had a big face.  You just need to be a bigger percentage of your dark room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you put the lights on behind you, it would it would help.  But then you would be pretty much done.  So I'm going to cheat on my number. Sit like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wrote a piece on Medium this week because I realized that for 40 years,  I've been writing on computers for 40 years.  How's that kids? Since 1974.  Wow. And I realized that all that time, I have had this twitchy habit, necessary habit,  of hitting the save button in the day of word processing or now the control S in the age of Microsoft.  And I use Google Docs and I use Medium to write and also WordPress,  and they all save automatically for me.  And so that whole notion of that little save, save, save my fingers.  I'll just do it like my reflex is gone.  And with it, pardon me, I'm getting choked up here.  And with it goes the kind of moment for reflection that I used to have.  And so I wrote a piece about how computers affected how I write and how that affects.  And it's got a lot of good responses.  So I thought I would just plug it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Good. Goodbye control S, which is how we used to save documents back in the day.  I can't remember the last time I did that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I go through my early days on VDTs and how switching from monoscreen to H&J.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is fun. I'd love to because I'll write this with you all the way.  Well, I didn't go quite so far back by starting writing on computers when the personal computer era began.  But so George R.R. Martin, author of The Game of Thrones, turns out writes on a DOS machine using WordStar 4.  So control KS still works for George. Classic.  Wow. He revealed this on Conan the other night.  And it was like. Control H. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did he say what machine it is? Is it old K Pro? I don't know.  What could possibly still run WordStar? Jesus Christ.  Wow.  Amateur 64.  WordStar 4. My Osborne 1.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  3 would be the classic. 4 is a little bit, you know.  Modern.  Too modern, yeah.  So Kevin Marks, I'm going to cede my time for my tool of the week to you for nuclear 2048.  Hang on. I've just got some breaking news.  Breaking news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Breaking news is that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This show is never going to freaking end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apparently AT&T messaging is being used to steal single letter Twitter accounts.  I just got this from Tantek who has T.  What?  So a link in orange, a tweet from Orange Photo saying this.  And Twitter.com slash J, which was Juliet Melton's account, has been taken over.  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So what you would, if you had AT&T, I presume the way this works is they, you know, they  oppose you with your phone number and they get Twitter to send a reset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But definitely at least one has been taken over and they may move on to other Twitter accounts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Turn on second factor authentication everybody right now.  Yes, exactly.  Not that that would fix it if Twitter is letting stuff leak through.  But, you know, there may be other.  Maybe it's a chance.  So has T been stolen?  No, T hasn't been stolen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But J has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Tantek doesn't have a phone number so he's safe.  There's only 26 of you who have to worry about this.  I'm under school.  He doesn't have a phone number?  Add numbers is 36.  Tantek doesn't have a phone number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Doesn't have a phone number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's decided he doesn't believe in phones.  And so he's he has a what you call it a thing that creates Wi-Fi from a phone account.  And he uses an iPod instead of an iPhone.  OK.  He's always slightly ahead of his time Tantek.  He has his own way of doing things.  He sure does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Matthew Ingram, always the journalist looking digging deeper.  He jumped right on that one.  He doesn't have a phone number.  Matthew is it Giga?  Oh wait a minute.  Nuclear 2048.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the summary of Tantek just said if you use AT&T mobile for your cell service make sure your phone number is removed from Twitter, Gmail, Facebook profiles and so on.  Because if you are using SMS for two factor auth that means you can be taken over.  In fact.  Make sure you don't have your phone number or financial institutions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We talked about this on SecurityNow yesterday.  Fellow demonstrated how you can bypass second factor authentication if and what I did as a result is immediately removed all my phone numbers from the second factor authentication page on Google.  If that phone number becomes known somebody impersonates your phone number gets a voicemail sent to it.  He keeps you busy calls you so your numbers busied out gets the voicemail number then calls back gets the code and logs and resets your password.  So that's actually something we talked about yesterday and it's interesting it's being used against Twitter already.  Right.  Did not take too long.  One more time the nuclear fusion variant.  OK.  I'll find it for you.  I have a link to it.  It's newbricks.github.io.  Right.  Fuse your way to iron.  So you start with two hydrogens.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You turn them into deuterons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Turn them into heavy water.  And then you get the deuterons.  H3.  And then you turn them into H4.  H3.  Oh this is hard but it's a good way to learn chemistry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because actually you can only turn certain match sensors with two others.  So then you can accidentally make it into beryllium.  I've got beryllium.  Which has a half life.  So as you keep moving.  Oh no it's counting down.  It's counting down.  So at the bottom of the page there's a guide to what you have to do.  There is this problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is this Twitch for Oxbridge graduates?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you can get stuck at magnesium because that's stable.  So if you accidentally make magnesium you can't carry on.  How often does that happen?  You've got to be careful.  Do not accidentally make magnesium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Or you will be so sorry.  There's a deuteron.  There's two berylliums.  Let's merge the berylliums.  I can't merge my berylliums.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Basically what you need to do is make oxygens and then merge the oxygens I think.  Oh I get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's not merely merging the same.  You have to now make chemical.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have to keep making four heliums and adding four heliums to things.  Except that if you add it to neon you end up with magnesium which means you're stuck.  So you can get past that.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is way too complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can get past that to silicon by adding two oxygens.  So basically you want to make oxygens and then add them together.  And then you can use that to build an iron.  I've got an oxygen.  Okay so careful.  Don't accidentally turn it into a neon because then it's very fragile and could potentially turn into a...

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is tough.  This is a hard game.  This is good for chemists.  I don't know what the hell I'm doing now.  I've gone beyond my chemical knowledge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well you know it plays a bit like 2048 but then eventually you start realizing what's going on.  Yeah no I understand.  But I have to go down here and look at the tables.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean my fusion guide and my decay guide.  That's the key.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I like it.  That's Fe26.  Fuse your way to iron baby.  It's at dimit.me slash Fe26.  Ladies and gentlemen this has been a very fascinating episode in which we've already retracted the first story  and created beryllium.  If you ever want to be back again please come back on a Wednesday at 1pm Pacific, 4pm Eastern time, 2000 UTC.  Kevin Marks thank you for being here.  It's always a pleasure.  It was fun to be here.  Indiewebcamp.com.  That's probably the best place to go to find out what Kevin's up to.  I think this is actually a great...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And there's Indiewebcamp coming up on the 28th June in New York and Portland.  Awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I want to install IDno.  Or Idno.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or known.  Known.  Known.  Because apparently nobody understood what Idno was.  What is Idno?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Idno.  Idno. I don't know.  But I'm going to try that right from GitHub.  I'm not going to ask for any help.  I'm just going to see if I can screw up my server real good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well if you need help go to the Indiewebcamp IRC on Freenode.  I shall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's easy enough.  Secret instructions.  This is why we love technology my friends.  All you people on iPads are just going to have to suffer without us.  Mr. He's sitting in the dark but he is not in the dark in his mind.  His mind is a bright beacon of hope and light for all of us casting its warmth and its shadow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You look like the floating head on Red Dwarf now.  It's like, holy.
