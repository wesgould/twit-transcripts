Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Belated happy birthday to you. There was only one moral panic only one. Yeah, I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll be curious  What kind of reaction we get to the big story of the week which is  the NSO spyware  Of course  It was a big story on Mac break weekly because iPhones were impacted actually iPhones were more impacted than Google phones  But probably mostly because it was difficult for researchers to tell if the Google phones were hacked  NSO is a Israeli company that provides  Well, we'll call it spyware they call it is what it is, you know infiltration software designed  to get into people's phones  And  They claim that they are very careful  They have a board and they're very careful who they sell this software to but an  Investigation that has been going on for some time  Finally went public  The Pegasus project went public was stunned by Amnesty International and a  NGO  Called store. What was it? I forgot the name forbidden stories a Paris based  Journalism nonprofit. They got a list of  50,000 phone numbers  Clear where this list came from by the way. Yeah, there's no idea from  There they're a little cagey what they did is they did their research did a lot of research on this and then passed the story  Along to the Washington Post and the Guardian and let them write their stories on it  But so these phone numbers according to the poster cut were concentrated countries known to engage in surveillance of  Their citizens, but also known to been clients of the NSO group  It doesn't identify  No one identifies where the numbers came from  It's unknown how many of the phones were targeted or surveilled but  Forensic analysis was performed on the 37 smartphones that they were able to get that it were hacked and  Shows according to the post a tight correlation between time stamps  associated with a number on the list and the initialize initiation of surveillance in some cases just a few seconds  So it sounds like the list was auto generated as the phones were hacked probably then came from the NSO group  And that's why we might assume this 50,000 phone list is a list of all phones that have been hacked  The numbers on the list are unattributed but  reporters doing a lot of work figured out that  Many of them belong to well-known political figures including Emmanuel Macron the president of France  several Arab royal family members  65 business executives 85 human rights activists  189 journalists and more than 600 politicians and government officials including cabinet ministers diplomats military and security officers

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Several heads of states and prime ministers any and everybody that you'd want to shut down  It actually not shut down

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this this isn't the first issue of NSO  Back in 2019 the same organization WhatsApp  Said a company called citizen labs it is a research lab at the University of Toronto. They actually determined that  Governments were using the NSO software to break into WhatsApp accounts, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what's scary? What's scary about this is that the NSO group they collect?  holes flaws security exploits  Do not reveal into the company  Responsible for them, which is the normal way you would disclose these exploits so they can be fixed  But instead hold on to them and in effect weaponize them then sell these weaponized hacks to these  Governments they say we don't sell it to repressive governments only good governments  Although at at least one set was sold to Victor Orban the somewhat repressive

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All of this sounds quite

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Repressive yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The scary thing is some of these exploits at least that one of the iPhone exploits was a zero-click exploit  so for instance as an example  Khashoggi's fiancee Khashoggi of course the Saudi Arabian journalist who was murdered we think by the Saudi Arabians  dismembered in the embassy  For writing critical pieces about the Saudi royal family  Her phone was one of the 37 phones analyzed had been hacked  It was an iPhone was an up-to-date iPhone with the latest version of iOS at the time on it  And it had been hacked by a what they call a zero-click in other words  You get a message on iMessage  that  Without your acting upon it reading it even knowing it's there  Then compromises your phone and allows this spyware to turn on the microphone turn on the camera see all the data  You know the message is there in this case she did although it's possible  Once they compromise the phone to delete the message  So you you may not in fact ever know and most of these people did not know that they had been  compromised there is a tool now that you can download and  Look at your logs and find out if you've been compromised, but I think most of us don't have to worry  There they're pretty this looks like this software is mostly used by nation-states to spy on dissidents and other states politicians  So there most of these phones all but three were iPhones  Three were Android phones although that don't if you're an Android user that shouldn't give you any good feelings  I some schadenfreude, but maybe but maybe not  Feeling of security because that's only because Android phones delete those logs automatically and those logs are what we're used to and does this

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Have to be how do I ask this?  Does this have to be intentionally aimed at a given phone?  Yes, or this is not a mass attack really pass something on no and they clearly targeted

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  this is not a mass tech in some cases the  Compromise requires that the spy has to have access to the network  Maybe the phone network, so that's why it's often used by countries  You know governments who do have access to their country's phone network  It's always targeted and  There's actually I really liked there was a good article by one of my favorite crypto guys from Johns Hopkins  Matthew Green who talked about something called security nihilism  Oh boy when this comes up a lot of times in fact on Macbreak weekly it came up  And what are you gonna do if a nation state wants to spend millions?  In resources to attack a single individual. It's almost impossible to defend against them  Which you know you'll hear that a lot and it is to be fair some I've even said it's somewhat true  I remember a security expert saying look the normal person walking down the street in a big city is safe  But if a team of ninjas decides to attack and prove it  There's not much we can do about that. They better pack a lunch  But there's not much we can do to defend ourselves if we are the target of an attack  Matthew writes that that he says a case against security nihilism  A perverse reaction I've seen from some security experts is to shrug and say well, there's no such thing as perfect security  More concretely some folks argue this kind of well-resourced targeted attack is fundamentally impossible to prevent  At the extremes this argument is not wrong  The NSO is not some script kiddie toy deploying it costs hundreds of thousands of dollars and  Fighting attackers with that level of resources is always difficult  But

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a never-ending story

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, essentially still he says that doesn't mean today's versions of those products Apple and Google  Are do it doesn't mean they're doing everything they could be to stop attacks  There is certainly more the corporations like Apple and Google could be doing to protect their users  But the only way we're gonna get those changes is if we demand them well Apple  It's a little bit of a cat-and-mouse game. So Apple is always trying to improve stuff. They added something recently recently  Called blast door, which is an effective firewall. Here's I'll give you an example. The reason Apple gets hit by this stuff easily  I message  uses a variety of  Programs not all from Apple many of them quite old  To render the media the pictures the audio and the video that come in I messages  And those things are often vectors for attacks  We've seen this on on Windows as well as Apple stuff that anything that interprets data  Is potentially a compromisable something like Adobe Acrobat? Yeah Acrobat was the biggest one big constant ever constantly a problem  So Apple stuff is very hard to fix  Very old. They're very dependent. It would effectively require a complete rewrite of iMessage  So what Apple did is they put up a firewall called blast door  But according to Matthew Green and these most recent attacks even blaster was insufficient to protect people against the most recent attacks  Many of these attacks were against iPhones with 14.6. I was 14.6 on them  Which is not quite the latest because Apple released a new one yesterday interestingly right at the same time as a story came out  So  Apple needs to do more yes, they're doing blast door, but that wasn't enough. Maybe they do need to rewrite iMessages  Yes, it'll be expensive complicated and more  To Apple's concern is that it might cause incompatibilities and you know a certain percentage of people are gonna it's gonna break things  He says but we still need to do it and the thing we need to do is demand that they do a better job

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder what that percentage is because they always have the push to get people on a newer device  Because certain versions of the OS won't work on those older devices and nobody seems to fuss  Why not just continue to go down that road and say hey we're having some issues security wise and we really want to make sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everybody's up the snow the problem is because show these fiance said and others  I think I've said the same thing but I was using an iPhone because they're secure. Oh, yeah, there's that and a late model

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apple  added like a  There's us normal people who might not be worried like I mean  if you're in a certain field like if you're the president of a country or the head of the spy agency or  Head of an NGO or an activist  You would be interested in paying more for a highly secured phone and maybe Apple could create a package for those people  That's slightly more active would break some functionality, but still  And you know it can work on their existing hardware  I'm just trying to think like because not everybody's gonna want to do something because most of us value convenience far more than security

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So is there PCs? I mean you're right Stacey. It's it's if you use Google's  Hardware thing  Functionality, but it makes thank you for bringing the actual language in there. I appreciate that  What's the thing called again?  The Titan key thank you the Titan thing  So you lose functionality  But you believe you have more security  So the question is what would that equivalent be for people who are vulnerable by the way a vulnerable phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Titan keys were compromised at one point so yeah  Nothing's nothing's perfect. Nothing's perfect, but try and you got to really push Google and Apple  It's so important  You got to make it basically what Matthew Green is arguing is you got to make it economically  Unfeasible for NSO group to continue in business right now  They can do it because they can do these mass they can do 50,000 phone numbers. What about the phone companies?  They too  They're they're they're absolutely be a perfect example is all the phones including the late model phones  We all use have  SS7 in it which is a software defined radio that's used by cell phones  it's hideously insecure and is well known to be insecure and in fact the the the flow security flaws are  well known and  and and really can't be fixed that they're actually SS7 is not a  Software it's a proto set of protocols, but it's a very insecure set of protocols, and it's not been fixed

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we have Google doing monthly updates to Android  Air quotes security updates and Microsoft doing theirs is that not enough anymore. Is it safe to say that?  It's asking too much to do every it's enough to say semi-monthly for sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but  If if so, this is the question if you're a dissident or Stacey I hate to say it a journalist. Mm-hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean journalists are just as often. Oh, yeah. Yeah, just I mean well certain kind like I'm less worried about being hacked

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think the IOT industry is yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But yes, no for certain type of journalists  No, there are certain stories that I am very like if I  There are certain things when I report on them or I talk to people at specific companies  I I have a set of security protocols that I enact to talk to them  Just to make sure I'm not screwing their lives over not like literal lives

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But just like so they don't get fired, but you know I mean so so what should kashoggi's fiancee?  Do knowing that she and her fiance are that's why I think there's a market

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  some sort of I  Guess you could use just a burner  You could I'm trying to think of all the ways that people

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, well burners don't have I message for one thing. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  number two the if you've got a government involved when you know, I  Sat in the editor's office at the Guardian in the midst of the stonest story and they thought they were doing the right thing with burners  And no a preponderance of burners in an area is a great signal, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And these days by the way, a lot of burners are running old and right

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I  Want to waste money. Yeah, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's a it's a it's a bad situation and

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I guess so sell what do they what do they say is the benefit of using MSO? How do they?  With apparent legitimacy say this is a good thing to have. Oh god. You should hear their statement. It is it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  nauseating it is  offensive  Let me see if I can I can find it because if I gotta read this to you because I could first of all I  Can use a really nerdy voice for it  It is I was I was I was so offended. Let me see NSL group  Family denies false claims made in your report  Let me see. This is anyway, they deny it, but let me see why they say they're a good thing  And it's a long denial they say we had nothing to do with the murder heinous murder of Jamal Khashoggi  Are we can confirm of course offering no evidence that our technology was not used to listen monitor track or collect information regarding  Him as family members mentioned in your inquiry. We previously investigated this claim which again is being made without validation  So people presented evidence to the contrary NSL group. You're saying you're just denying it without presenting any evidence that it's not so  But the worst thing is  their justification  NSL group technologies have helped prevent terror attacks gun violence car explosions and  Suicide bombings the technologies are also being used every day to break up pedophilia sex and drug trafficking rings  missing and kidnapped children locate survivors trapped under  Collapsed buildings and protect airspace against disruptive penetration by dangerous drones  But they are wonderful aren't they  Simply put NSL group is on a life-saving mission and the company will faithfully execute this mission undeterred  Despite any and all continued attempts to discredit it on false grounds

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and if you look at I mean it's coming from Israel Israel is constantly under attack  Yeah, they are constantly dealing with they're in a part of the world where everybody hates them. So I can see  Paranoia is justified. I understand there there from their point of view  This is probably helpful their government's probably very excited to be able to keep an eye  By the way, that's another thing the Matthew Green says is we really got to tell governments to stop

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really got to tell governments just especially freedom-loving  Governments he said in a perfect world US and European governments would wake up and realize that arming  Authoritarianism is really bad for democracy  And that whatever trivial benefit they get from NSO because they use it is  Vastly outwited by the very real damage this technology is doing to journalism and democratic governments worldwide. So that's the argument the  You know the free governments that also use this really got to stop it  We just got to stop it. This is not he also says I'm not holding my breath for this to happen. Nope  So everybody benefits including our government our intelligence agencies  It is a shame but these exploits so, you know when when when flaws in software discovered they're really two roots  There's there's the white hats. There's people like Google's zero day and and and  Project and Travis Kalanick who then will do responsible disclosure. They'll call Apple is Apple  Here's here's it. You if you I'm giving you 90 days to fix it if you don't I'll reveal it  Apple fixes it he's then revealed but it's not that threat anymore to people are updated  That's the responsible way and then there's a large there's companies like zero diem and others that do this trend micro  Another one. Yeah, there are companies actually that pay bug bounties for zero days  So zero diem we've talked about this on them  Security now zero diem says we pay big bounties  Zero diem is the world's leading exploit  Acquisition platform for advanced zero-day research and cybersecurity capabilities  So some of these like zero diem  Follow this responsible disclosure praise. There are others  Like NSO group they go. Yeah, we'll give you a million dollars for that hack

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thank you. Yeah, and then they sell it along and God knows what's coming out of I don't mean to  demonize but out of Russia and China and  That isn't being sold to the open market. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, in fact, it's you know, that's the problem  You know, there's there's the responsible disclosure and then there's your responsible keeping it to yourself. You don't know  Yeah, and and you know NSA has plenty of these they don't want to burn them  We know after the Snowden revelations NSA can access these as well  so  You know, there's two there's two takeaways  One don't assume that because you're carrying an iPhone you're safe, right?  In fact, if you're carrying any smart device if you're connected to the internet  Exercise caution. Yes extreme caution and that's why great people like  Your friend Dan Patterson  He has so many Dan  Dan Patterson in years past has trained dissidents on opsec. Yeah on how to secure yourself  Yeah, and what not to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know Dan is quite careful to say the least with all of his travels, especially  Like at Davos, I've heard some interesting stories. So that's that's one thing is you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Know the risks, especially if you're a target and and do the right thing  The other thing is we all need to put pressure on companies like Google and Apple and say  You and you know, you gotta you gotta make sure you do everything you can to prevent this  I think they are but the thing is I wasn't saying I think Apple is actually taking this seriously though

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They always have right?  It's just they can't necessarily stay ahead of the well  Necessarily stay ahead of the well so this is okay again

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm gonna quote Matthew Green because he says they chose the easy  inexpensive fix blast or which is a firewall instead of the expensive complicated and  Potentially, you know breaking fix of rewriting iMessage to not be using all these renders  So so I didn't play Leo. Yeah, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I didn't I didn't play your role of devil's advocate last week, but I will this week delayed delayed host

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know no, no, no, you don't get your chance now  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Join it though the number of people of faddes and it's doubles advocating people  So just just just for the sake of the discussion. Um, the number of people potentially affected by this  Though each individual case can be profound is a small number. That's right. And  And so 50,000 and a billion and a half iPhones is nothing exactly  Yeah  The economics here of  Affecting everything you do on every single phone and potentially having an impact on the functionality  The people rise they see fine convenient, right? There is an equation that occurs there. Like how much does this affect our bottom line?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and they and yeah, I get all that I'm devil's advocate, okay, but but it actually goes to your point Stacey is at some point  I  Almost think the company should say okay. Here is every person level of security if you need this level  We're gonna provide them but you have responsibility to and that includes not, you know revealing  National secrets on a cell phone no matter what it must be doable because they give the president a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Secure phone a BlackBerry secure. Well, I'm very was it a black. I don't is it still was  I know it was for Obama, but I don't I mean we know that President Trump was using an iPhone  I thought they were on yeah, I thought it was an iPhone after that. I don't know what Biden uses  In fact, they don't want us to know right? Nope, but usually the way they secure these phones is by eliminating a lot of capabilities  Right. Yeah  The third thing I didn't I actually just thought of a third thing  We should put pressure on our own government not to use these tools and to yes encourage others not to because ultimately it is bad for

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Freedom but government is going to just about democracy. I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Surveillance as a tool safety protecting us what pedophiles we're getting pedophiles here. What do you want back doors to everything? All right  We're stopping drone violence

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Our I remember years ago speaking to this company Provo  They make hardware for protecting iPhone privacy Provo.com  And I remember in that conversation just sort of being blown away because  All I ever heard was hey the iPhone is the most secure phone blah blah blah blah blah blah  But yet there's still tools out there trying to protect this hardware now with all of these this software exploits  None of this stuff even matters, right? But wait a minute. All this is is you take your phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a very big and you put in a very big cage just a very big box and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they had a but they had a couple other things over the years  Oh and it blocks out the microphones and things like wow look at that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Whatever it is. It must be good doesn't fit well in your jeans. No. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Compromises Jeff you need a body person who carries your phone in their bag

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like I think what Dan Patterson used to do and others do now  Training people in how to keep secure is good. I mean, that's another good thing to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let every and we teach it a lot more in journalism school now, and you have to that's what Stacy said  It's for the sake of your sources. It's not as much for you at all. Yeah, but for your for your sources

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He has said that as well, you know, you're a terrible devil's advocate. You just ruled right over

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I just can't I can't keep it going you see I gotta grow some horns  Rationality reality  No

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  These are things I recognize I balance. I'm a little I'm a little depressed because I  learned yesterday that a  podcast  Called a call her daddy  Have you heard of this podcast before? Do I want to have heard of it? It was on barstool  She had the host Alex Cooper had a famous fight with the head of barstool because he only wanted to pay her half a  million dollars a year  so she's now sold it to  Pocket one podcast called car her daddy sold it to Spotify Spotify exclusive  for a  Three year contract twenty million dollars a year. Oh wow one podcast. What's it about? Wow  Bronschi talk and something female empowerment Wow  It's you know, I listen so after I heard this news I went I picked the wrong  Business wait a minute. That is my business

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the dog I picked the wrong hair color we just have a different version of this business and gender

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And makeup artists, but it's you know, it's the influencer. She's young  It's a it's this Gen Z kind of I listened to the most recent one and it was like  Just weird. It was like they were they apparently there was a thunderstorm and the house power went out and they were all scared

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Mm-hmm. We've never done anything about some thunderstorms on this show. That was the whole

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As the Jarvis house shakes, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's the Wall Street Journal  Call her daddy used to be best known for raunchy sex talk and pioneering concepts like the gluck gluck  9,000 to what I don't even want to tell you what that is  Apparently more more recently I  Don't know she calls her fans the daddy gang

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's about this basically a woman who talks to other women and has done a good job doing it and is rink it in the dough

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I'm hey, I'm thrilled for her, but I'm just like she's getting more money than you know  Shack

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well Joe Joe Rogan got a ton of money yeah, I mean yeah  I'm just I'm like look  I'm getting a whiff of this this young lady is doing this and she has a podcast that we don't know what she's a lady

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I feel the same way about Joe Rogan. Trust me. It's not  It's just I believe he's all she's just it's just bizarre. I don't  I  She claims a million downloads a month

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, then there's you look at the other side of it look at it the TV standpoint. What's that show called the view?  Have you ever watched that show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, wildly popular, but they don't get I guarantee you 20 million dollars a year. I don't dig

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Think they do. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Your day when you're a TV guide critic, how much did a network news anchor?  CBS is probably getting a ton of ad money for that show. Oh, I know they are but I don't think they get 20 million a year

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  For it Casey Hunt is getting a report for going to be installed by CNN is getting a reported billion million a year

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay  I would argue these people have more influence right? I mean, they're talking to more people than a million people a month  Mm-hmm, but you know, so I'm sure Spotify also knows what it's doing  They've decided to spend half a billion dollars to own podcasting. I think my biggest complaint isn't that she's getting all this money  I was a little like shocked but  Is that I think it's bad for podcasting because it's gonna be Spotify exclusive  The reason they can give her that kind of money is right because they can go to advertisers say we know exactly  Who's listening when and and all of that and we can't do that  We don't want to do that and it makes it hard for us to sell advertising frankly. So yeah, fortunately  I'm not I don't think our listeners are in the same demographic  As Alex Cooper, so that's that's probably good. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This says because she this the lat the kicker on the WSJ story is nice  It's saying that basically  People the guys hate her because she makes women feel confident and you know what? There's a big market for that  That's great well no, I mean like women are a huge market we spend a lot we oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You should get a daddy gang flag sweatshirt  You know, you should join the club  Listen I'll tell you what listen to a podcast and let me know what you think of it because the one I listened to was bizarre

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, I just want to I just want to so imagine so I heard about this thing called twig

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I listen to one yeah, that's true and they talk about no, but we're gonna talk about less because I  Think our mistake my mistake. I'll take full responsibility was focusing on content  Information trying to give you news that kind of thing helpful tips  mistake mistake  So next week we're gonna lock ourselves in a house without power in a thunderstorm and see what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Aha, see now see it has a lot of reasons why dark mode is bad for you. No, it's not a modern invention

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are actually downsides to switching your apps to dark mode  Who is what nitwit wrote this?  When Jeffrey Jarvis

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Basically the downsides are that it doesn't it it's it tells you it's saving power, but it doesn't actually say it doesn't save  monitors  Wait a minute doesn't amylid displays. Yeah, but not everything else is and not your main computers are not amylid

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, no, but all your phones almost all your phones are amylid now. Well modern ones  Yeah, we're not doing it because we care about the environment no

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Says here in fact says you could have an astigmatism which in fact I do have I do have  I do have a stigmatism. We all do because we read these are naturally adept at seeing things more clearly in the daytime and not

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So much at night see right? That's that's logical. That's not me sir evolved to see that just says

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but that just says you may not enjoy dark mode if you have an astigmatism  It's not saying that you know, so you're gonna I I do confess

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I I know the reasons why you shouldn't use dark mode. I've known him for years  and  It's why books are black text on white paper. That's because you're  Black paper  Because your ambient lighting in in the old days, you know, you were in a room that was lit  You don't want to be looking at something darker  Like behind you but nowadays we all sit in darkened chambers, right?  That's right  And the real problem is our computer monitors brightness are turned way too high and and I've known this for years  I'm it used to say this to people all the time turn down. Your brightness is way too high  Yeah, it's it's blinding but because it is we don't want it. We want dark  Yeah, so comment on that down. Maybe light mode wouldn't be so bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So so it says that that our eyes have to strain more it causes eye strain. That's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Your mother was right you so when you're watching TV turn on a light, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's see. I'm the person that I see better at night than I do during the daytime

Let's say and the emoji should be a geek  How about there you go, I got it, okay  It could be an angry person.

It's a year from now it and it's gonna be great birthday  Yeah, and you should go I understand Lisa and I are going and we were told by the  Organizers that if we get 60 people to sign up we can get a second cabin and I thought well how to do this equitably  How can I keep Jeff Jarvis out  How can I do this equitably I thought well go by  Seniority, so I asked Steve Gibson who is who's the second person to join the network?  There's some people before him, but they're gone  So Steve get no I think I think the second show I did was with a very behind the bricks  She doesn't work for Twitter anymore. She's a Canadian. So I know and then  So Steve and Steve has his wife Laurie. She said under no circumstances. Am I getting on a kovat boat? And so I think  Cruise yeah, she misspelled cruise  So the next one I think is is Paul Thurot and I asked Paul Thurot and he said well  The only cruise I ever wanted to go on was an Alaska cruise. I'm in so Paul and his wife Stephanie are gonna go  We would have probably been next I think Jeff I'm trying to think of seniority

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  More than ten years, right?  The geezer cruise

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's really good  So it's gonna be a lot of fun there's no polar bears, but I understand there'll be salmon grizzly bears and  Bald eagles so it's gonna end glaciers. Let's not forget everything  Alaska's made of if you want to know more cruise dot twit dot TV  There are cabins left, but I think I've been I think you should hurry  I know it's a year off and most people aren't thinking about what they're gonna do next July  but I think you shouldn't delay because  They told us if demand suddenly increases for this cruise. We can we could take some cabins back  So once you book you're good, but but you got a book if you want to guarantee they could take back Kevin's yeah  You know the cruise line and and I think that they're just as most cruise lines are at this point uncertain about what it's gonna  Look like in July true. Yeah, so they they they reserve the right to say hey  We're getting a huge demand for this trip, so we're not gonna promise  We're not give you all the cabins you promise we promised you only people have already reserved by then will be able to go good stuff  So reserve cruise dot twit dot TV. It's gonna be a lot of fun Paul Theron  And I will get drunk on peanut butter whiskey while our wives will dance

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  With bald eagles what if they just shake their heads in shame because that seems more guarantee

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do they will be doing that  She loves me but you know, yeah, you know and still be like, yeah, they doing that  Yeah. Yeah, that's basically what she says all the time. Why did you do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My husband does the same thing to me. He's like, what were you thinking? What were you thinking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why did you make the blinds only open by a voice command?  Oh boy  Retail stores  Packed with unchecked facial recognition our next story in just a moment  I just want to reintroduce our fabulous crew. Stacy Higginbott is here. She's the replacement  for  Stacy a good bottom who has the day on like I could try to do very realistic  I must say we've already had that jiff don't they see on iot.com  Can't prove from hands-on photography and of course the one the only the inimitable  Jarvis of buzz machine  calm  Moving along retail stores packed with unchecked face recognition according to civil rights  organizations more than 35 organizations demanding top US retailers cease facial recognition  Walmart Home Depot Target and  Even though Apple says it does not apparently I've saw a story that said Apple used to  so it's used it's used for  Detering a shoplifting I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Identifying known there's a couple there's identifying new shoplifters, but there's also identifying  People that you don't want in the store people you've banned in the past blackballed people  Yeah, like and those people could be banned for shoplifting for weird returns

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They could be banned for all kinds of things. So yes, and I did see a story about a young black man who was  kicked out of somewhere  Because facial recognition misidentified him. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just another day in face ID. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, cuz it's particularly  Inaccurate with people of color because they don't use black people in training. That's right  It's all a bunch of white at least at least not yet. Anyway, yeah on the other hand  Devil's advocate, but I kind of believe this Taylor Swift for instance  Who's had problems with fans stalking her and things has used face recognition at her concert entrances  You identify potential problem people and you know pull them aside if facial recognition were perfect  Yeah, we wouldn't have a problem with that, right? Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, we would hello. Hello. Yeah, we would why?  Um

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, okay, let's talk about having widespread facial recognition and what that means. Well, no, I'm just talking about that Taylor's let's start with a single

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exist that computer just somebody sits there with a list of with a page of photos a cop could do it a security guard  Hopps it's there. I see your photo on this list. Yeah, that's where you're starting

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It probably is not very accurate and and has to have a long list apparently for Taylor Swift  So if you could have face recognition and and it could be accurate wouldn't that be a I think a  Good and benign use of it or you disagree Stacey. No, no, no, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you use it for those kind of things, but they're also using it for like security in schools  Theoretically security in schools where they're banning people but there's no due process around this  So what we're doing is we're introducing a tool without any regulatory things. So  We had actually talked about this a couple weeks ago  It's a company that provides facial recognition software to schools and the schools that are using it are tracking students  Up to like five thousand times a day. So they're seeing everywhere the students go in the school  They're also using it to keep people they've banned from campus off campus including  former students and parents who have argued with security guards, so you look at this and you're like  It's a very it's a very useful tool but it's a tool that we really need to start putting  Guidelines around I would agree a hundred percent  Yes, so the problem is with these stores  Yeah, the problem is accuracy and lack of due process, right and lack of transparency and about using it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You go into most places. They say we are using video cameras. They should also say we're using facial recognition, right and  So this site ban facial recognition.com

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is putting social pressure on stores not to do it  They've actually asked the top retailers in the country if they use it and  Ask them to commit and there's a big tweet them button on an email button next to many of these  Ask them to commit not to use it. Walmart has agreed they will not use Kroger will not use in the future  Walgreens has not responded. So they might use Home Depot  Walgreens has not responded so they might use Home Depot won't use tar so this seems like it's working Lowe's won't  Albertsons does use it. Yeah, but at the same time HB does use it Macy's does use it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But at the same time a walmart could come back and just say, you know what?  Nah, it's actually working better for us to do this. So them just doing that on the on the surface  Yeah, there's no I mean they just say it there's no  Contract and then you have to think about whatever it is here in california with the whole  $950 being a misdemeanor versus a felony and people are just shoplifting like crazy. You think they care about facial recognition?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a problem in san francisco. Yeah people just coming and taking stuff and they're on camera. They don't care. Hey

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm only getting $200 worth of stuff and I can deal with a misdemeanor

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This story from a couple of months ago apple and its security contractor security industry specialist sued in massachusetts  Part of a multi-jurisdictional defamation and malicious prosecution complaint  Brought on behalf of a new york resident misidentified multiple times yikes as a shoplifter  Um, so there is a good example of a lack of due process and b inaccuracy  right  so, you know and  I have the same feelings about the police department using it. It used it. I guess appropriately and  with constraints if it were accurate, and it would be useful in

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Solving crime nothing is nothing is guaranteed accurate. So you have to have a process of check due process helps, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah  so if you have a guy at the taylor swift concert with an actual list of pictures of people and and somebody gets  Pulled out they don't say anything. They say excuse me, sir. I want to ask you a question and then identify do you have an id?  Right, that's two crosses. Yeah, I just want to cross check with this problem with your id could be a mistake. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but there's also the how do they how do they?  Communicate and share that facial recognition data and data about people they catch in those systems  Even if i'm just shopping at macy's if the police come and they're like hey there was a crime over here  We're looking at stacey as a probable person  You know with she in your store. This is a very stupid example

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm trying no, but I guess that's still going back to the due process side of things  They can't just come in there without a warrant. Right? Is that what you're saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  well that we don't we don't know if they can or not, right, so  They could access, you know my entire history if they wanted to based on private surveillance cameras if they  They need a warrant. I don't know. Here's the nightmare scenario for this poor kid

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In in new york. He's a he's an honors student  At bronx latin at new york city high school. He's black  Uh, he got a temporary learner's permit for driving a couple of years ago when he was 17  It had his height weight date of birth and eye color didn't have a photograph his learner's permits don't usually right  He lost it then got a permanent laminated copy that included his picture  He was detained  actually, no  Later that year somebody was detained for stealing store merchandise in an apple store  Handed over the temporary learner's permit the one he'd found  Even though the id says it's temporary not to be used for identification purposes apple then said ah, you're this guy  Even though the guy they arrested was six foot one and the students only five seven

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the ai doesn't even matter if there's still people involved. Yeah, that's right. In fact the due process the so-called due process was worse

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But then his name is put into this system. He's flagged  And and he got arrested again. Wow  Um

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway, yeah, we have to we have to have ways of rectifying errors in these computerized databases. Clearly. It's a problem for sure  Yeah, the gdpr actually gives people that right the current california privacy act is not so if we were going to look at a federal law  That's one of the things we'd interesting good to know good

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I heard that this was a there was some type of surveillance in the uk. I don't know  Much about it is that still going on where it's like a regular everybody sort of expects to be watched and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wherever they are out. They have a yeah, they have a lot of cctv around there everywhere  Okay, so in public places and on their roads. What about amazon's ghost stores?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean not only are you being photographed but every action you take in the groceries being photographed, but you know it  You you you I guess you know when you go in you know it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know how it works and if you didn't like it you can stay out of it, you know what's happening  You're getting a receipt of what what happened. That is one of the things that this

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Site claims stores are doing is if you go in a store and don't buy anything you walk out without buying anything  They send you a coupon. It's like come on back. We got a deal for you. Well, so you get a good deal  Yeah, but that may be a little creepy. I don't say that's too creepy. Ain't it? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you're like, I mean people don't want to think about I mean you don't want every single  Interaction you have with any part of society to be  Relegated to a transaction right? Like let's say you're just walking into a store just to look at stuff, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So here's a question for you jeff jarvis is is facebook killing people

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, let's ask the president

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't say don't ask him ask the other guy said they were but then he said well no  I don't mean facebook's doing it. They're talking about uh,  Vaccines and there is some evidence that facebook has not done a great job of  Blocking or taking down. Well, I put a different misinformation. Facebook can certainly do better. They could do better. They all could  Uh biden, uh said he meant to accuse a dozen social media platform users

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think actually it was a classic biden gaffe thing  Because I listened to it again  And I actually don't think he was trying to say facebook was I think it was trying they like these people who are using it  Right, right those dastardly souls and it came off  We're on and facebook reacted and and but the problem here is as as various of the things I put in the rundown said  This this kerfuffle is missing the point on both sides  Right, we've got facebook needs to do a better job government needs to recognize what's going on. It doesn't include fox  You know look at hannity's about face in the discussion  We need a a smarter discussion than than than ensued in 24 hours after this moment

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And i'm sympathetic because while it's not facebook killing people  Um, there's a lot of virus misinformation being spread and as I was talking about I think was before the show  Um, you know, I was sitting beside somebody on the airplane on the way home and said oh i'm not going to get i'm not  Going to put anything on none of my body who's clearly getting  misinformation about the at this point  I it's I know it's it's not officially approved yet  It's an experimental approve but hundreds of millions of people have received these vaccines  Yeah, a lot more people in that time have died of covid and i've got that have even been sickened by the vaccine. So  um  I don't know. I can understand the sentiment which is  We got to do something about this people are dying, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I think I think that the study and this is part of what you know, the fox went after  um  His press office the study that says that 12 people are promoting most of the most of the misinformation comes from these 12 accounts  it is  You can find loci of networks and attack them so this idea you've got to try to get everything possible  Yeah, yeah, be smart about it. Go after those don't attack facebook  Facebook should be doing something about those what will accept the research 12 people and they could get a lot done that way

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and farham farhad manju wrote in the new york times  It's the anti-vax movement is much bigger than just facebook and we'd agree on that  Yeah, i'm marjorie taylor green got banned by twitter for 12 hours  Seems like a weird ban but for 12 hours for uh saying  Um that vaccines don't work

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So our friend, uh, neerot weisblatt had I think a very good piece doctor  Uh, dr neerot weisblatt. Yes, the dichotomous debate sucks was her subhead  Uh, this is line 70  and  Saying what I think is very true is the is the it saves people it kills people those extremes are getting us nowhere  The discussion is dumb that way  um  It's not as bad as it's presented by the dystopians  It's not as good as the companies would present and we can always do better and so let's figure out how to do better together  God dammit. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait jeff, are you telling us to be best?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ha ha

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean both we've said that on the show both both sides are true  The internet has been amazing  And and technology has been amazing, but there's also and I wouldn't be covering technology as my life  Vocation if it weren't for the amazing benefits of it  Yeah, but there but the other reason I was gonna say if you had known you could get 20 million if I had known I could be  uh  Empowering women and make 20 million a year  I would have done that  Uh, no, I wanted part of what I wanted to do was talk about not just the benefit because there's you know  When I started there was a lot of cheerleading for technology  And what I wanted to do, I love technology  In fact, it was kind of the tagline at the end of the screensavers, you know, because we worked for ziff davis, which  It's uh, its motto at the time was love technology  Technology  And I would always say love technology, but back up your hard drive or love technology, but make sure you get vaccinated so  It's both it isn't it isn't one or the other  I've always said that and one of the reasons I do what I do is because I want to help people understand it  So that they know how to make the most out of it takes awesome, but it's not bad stuff. It's not perfect  There's a lot of you know scams and imperfections and a lot of places you can waste your money  You know, we got to get phone companies to make these things more recyclable and repairable  We got to get to get them to be more secure. I mean, there's all sorts of life. It's a process folks

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We've always got to improve. We've always got to do better. We learn how things operate. We learn how to do them  It took us a long time and a 30 years war to get over the beginnings of print

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But as I've said before those big wide platitudes of saving lives and killing people as the doctor said there those things still sell

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Clicks they saw clicks. I I do have to say  I don't know jeff if I agree with you that this is just  Another example of you know, gutenberg moment. I do think it's somewhat different and maybe it isn't but but I do I do think  that the the reach the the reach of  Social networks, especially the technology and the internet is so  Vast its speed is so incredible that it is an order of magnitude more risky than the printing press

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We were burning people at the stake  Because of the printing press, right? We were starting uh, peasants wars  We were burning downtowns because of what was said on the printing press. No, I think it was worse back then  I think I'd go with a pinker moment here and say that actually society is improving and we refuse to recognize it  But again, fair enough

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Higginbott had its up. Was that do you need some oil?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I I appreciate pinker. He's somewhere behind me on my bookshelf. I'm not recording bigger but the fattest book there is um  But I I think  What we see with social media is a lot more individual harms and it's much easier  It's kind of like email making spam possible. It's death by a thousand cuts instead of getting burned at the stake

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're getting whittled down, but it's also enabling people again who've never been heard to be heard. You've got to

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No one denies that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No one's trying to shut down  These platforms as platforms. We're just saying because some of the harms let's think about

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How to mitigate those harms that's all I mean without without having an impact on some of the potential

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, I don't think you cannot have an impact. I think that's kind of a silly thing. You're going to have an impact but  But understanding and looking at hey when that impact happens  How far does it go? Can people still come out from it? Okay, right?  Like you can't make legislation without without affecting

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Some people killing section 230 which some would say is what we should do would have a huge impact on the speech of right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not i'm not a fan of killing section 230. That's what i'm saying there. So we've got to have that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, tectard had a good article on um, uh net neutrality. Um, it was carl bode. I think let me see if I can  Oh carl, you know him. You should have him on the show. Really? Let's get him on. He's great carl

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, he's inflammatory  No, he never worked at kika home, but he  He's he lives up here in seattle now, but he's my buddy man. He's so smart

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you'll like his uh link bady headline axios parrots a lot of dumb debunked nonsense  About net neutrality. How did I miss that headline? Uh, isn't that a great one?  Uh, he this was uh, this was today actually I think it came out  Maybe that's why I made it missed it because it just came out  Um, he is pointing out this both-sideism that you see a lot and I know jeff  I'm sure you talk about it  I know jay rosen does all the time this this idea that news is fair and balanced when you quote both sides equally  As if they have equal merit. So he has the axios article he's referring to has a lot of quotes from

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, who is the reporter on that article?  It was at kim hart because if it was she used to work and do pr for the fcc. Oh interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Um  Let me see if uh, he doesn't actually mention it was margaret mcgill  Let me see which article is he talking about? Let's see. It's net neutrality battle looms from last week

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh margaret harding mcgill. Okay. Yeah, it wasn't kim. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Um, but apparently in order to write this article and I you know what? I think I would do this too  You get quotes from both sides, right?  um and  You know, you're not trying to inject an opinion in there you're trying to get the story

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yes, and no, I think there's a job to be and this is like a giga ohm when we we sat there  Like objective journalism isn't really possible. So, you know, you're gonna come out one side or the other  We always came out pro-consumer  That doesn't mean I didn't listen to all the sides like  But you know at the end of the day  Wall street the telecom companies they have millions of lobbyists. That's literally their job. They're paying for so all the consumer has is us

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I thought the job as a reporter was to report the facts

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You how you report the facts and whose facts you report. I can tell you like municipal broadband  Is unprofitable for municipalities on a cost basis in a lot of cases  So the the anti-muni the cable companies will say  It costs taxpayers dollars. It's an unprofitable business. They should keep it in our court  whereas the municipalities will say it's actually an economic development effort and we should be  Doing as much as we can to build up our broadband because it'll entice people to come to our area  It also makes our current citizens lives better. So it may not be entirely profitable  But it is a service that we think is valuable  and those kind of nuances are really hard to  Convey in an objective way, right?  Readers don't even want that they want you to say exactly what I said and then say

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I like which which machine should I buy? Right? Oh my god. Don't be objective

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's what carl here's what carl wrote  If you're a reporter  And you feel the need to give an industry lobbyist ample room to make various claims  You should at least point out where that lobbyist might not be telling the truth  So your readers might have some vague idea where the truth actually is that's kind of what you're saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's true. It's fair and that's I mean when I would report from you know, i'd be like hey atnt says this  Here's why they're saying this and here's their agenda in this here's their dog in this

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or here's what they could get out of it or here's where they could benefit well to support your argument that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The telco spent a lot of money to get heard and consumers don't  telecom giants  This is uh, yeah, this was stunning. This is stunning. It's a joint or a study from common cause and the communication workers of america union  telecommunications lobbyists  Spent  Million dollars on lobbying during the 116th congress the current congress. That's it's hard to spend 320  thousand dollars a day  Comcast the biggest 43 million atnt 36  million  And so when you wonder why we have monopolies in broadband why our broadband is worse than many other developed nations  more expensive slower  uh, it's because  congress  Is bought and paid for by these people all of these people we voted for  The study said the largest isps have used their outsized influence in congress to block any legislation  That would undermine their stranglehold over the broadband marketplace  Net neutrality is just part of it. In fact, oh, yeah when you bring up municipal  mapping municipal broadband, that's a really good example because  Uh, you know philadelphia started a municipal wifi service that was really quite good  And it pissed off the telecom so much. They went to the pennsylvania state legislature and said hey, you know  Mostly the republicans don't really want this and you know, you don't want government competing with private industry  That's that's not a free market and and they've actually got that law passed not only in pennsylvania now  But almost all I think 28 states  Municipal wifi is dead because they would have a point if there were no monopoly

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But when there's a monopoly, that's the issue. That's the whole they argue that there isn't a monopoly because it's it's facilities based

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you've got cable versus dsl believe me we could talk about this all day long. And by the way  Comcast headquartered  Philadelphia yeah att. Yep, texas. Yep. Texas has had like  Texas utilities couldn't put up smart metering systems for the longest time  Because it was a municipally owned wifi system or sorry a municipally owned wireless system wireless system. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, it's this is uh, this is from the vice article  Quoting the common cause study the groups found that one of the industry's top targets during the last congress  Was the save the internet act which would have restored net neutrality and the fcc consumer protection authorities stripped away during the trump administration  Amidst a flood of empty promises. That's what carl bode's talking about  You know the the telecom said oh no, you know if if without if you don't do this net neutrality thing  We'll do all this investment jobs will be saved. They fired people  They reduced the investment as soon as they didn't have to right telecom lobbies also fought against the accessible affordable internet for all act  Which included money to help fund local community broadband. They successfully derailed the resilient networks act  An attempt to shore up the puerto rican network resiliency after prolonged outages after the hurricanes irma  and maria  um 83 million americas live under a broadband monopoly usually a regional cable giant like comcaster charter  millions more including us live under a duopoly  consisting of either  I love vice an apathetic phone company  Or their local cable provider the end result is obvious spotty access slow speeds high prices  Yep, and generally terrible customer service one of the things i've been hearing about a lot from our listeners  Is that these companies?  have variable pricing  from block to block  depending  Depending on how much the market will bear. Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is why google was so effective google actually one of the most effective things it did was just by launching broadband service  announcing pricing  Whenever it said it was going to go into an area you would see the prices both lower  And normalize across the spread. Yeah a little competition goes a long way

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And by the way, that's the free market. Yeah, that should be yeah  That's called the free market a little competition spurs innovation  price  improvements

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right. Yeah, if you want me to have a show stacy complains about broadband and rails against the utility or rails against the isps

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How's your fiber going your fiber's good. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's lovely i'm not on it right now, but it's great  I don't think it's you want it right you want it because because my wi-fi is okay. It's so good  Did you not using it right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you're on your you're on your fiber to the house

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yes, i'm just not wired. Oh, don't tell me that i'll get very upset. I'm just no i'm on my ero pro sixes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's wi-fi six. Okay, you know, I have to say it's been very good. It hasn't been problematic. So  Maybe they fixed that collision problem that we always had in the past

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How about jeff bezos actual fiber? I was about to ask you about how about mr

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let the show last week talking about that. How about mr clean in space yesterday?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They acted as if it was somehow historic  Notice the big first human flight under a tiny little blue origin first human flight, of course, of course it ain't the first human flight  It's only 50 years  After the more than that almost 60 after the first human flight  Um, but the other thing though, and I hope you don't think i'm crude for saying this  But isn't it a little weird that this billionaire's  Rocket is so phallic phallic

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, is it just me best story? No, no, no, no, here comes the best story go to slate  It makes sense. Why does jeff bezos rocket?  It's an article that's called why does jeff bezos's rocket look so much like a penis we ask  Asked an actual rocket scientist so they talked to a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff's gonna go up into uh, well space-ish  and uh  Let's watch it  And the first thing she said is what?  What are they what are they writing in?  But it worked. Uh, okay, so let's let's see what the rocket scientist  said um  We spoke to daniel ramsbacker a propulsion engineer at nasa's goddard space center  Who requested?  We clearly stayed up front. He is not speaking on behalf of his employer  Um  Okay, let's get right to it asks asks slate. Why is jeff bezos's rocket shaped so much like  a male member  Daniel says well for lots of reasons. Honestly, I mean obviously most rockets are quite phallic  This one specifically they took the approach of pretty much all the commercial space programs where they go suborbital  So they don't go fully into orbit similar to what we at nasa did back in the 60s  I'm talking about the 1960s. So the rocket's relatively small  Everything in our industry is more or less based on heritage. It's like well, what are we using in the past?  What can we leverage? How can we reduce risk?  Or reduce costs so the rocket is

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  This

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Would you say the reporter interrupts because apparently matthew was getting a little nervous at this point  Would you say there's a heritage of shapes and rocketry?  Leading toward bezos's rocket. It seems to me this is this one's kind of a leap forward  No, well specifically for this this unusual rocket was the new shepherd the new glen is their next launch vehicle  Which is much larger  And designed specifically for the capsule that sits on top of the new shepherd. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So yes capsule sitting on top of it is designed for a larger it gets better shaft

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  for  the head  so that it won't  So the reason why it's a little bit larger is because the launch vehicle the rocket the next version is wider what you're looking at  In the rocket is basically a bunch of tax little tanks literally literally stacked upon one another all that that's all it basically is  Yeah, that had some computers  And the rocket engines at the base they knew they weren't going in orbit so they sized the tanks appropriately. It's a relatively small diameter

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It had a circumcision

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They designed the capsule for the next series of rockets see they didn't want to make the tanks too large  So all right, they reduced the girth of the shaft  But kept the capsule at the top the same size which gave it that  distinctive shape  Yeah, unfortunately  What advice would you give bezos if he wanted to make the next stage of this project the new glen or whatever even more phallic?  Oh, I would not do that  I think it's gonna end up making it worse for him  What's next for the future of rocketry the reporter asks? So are there any new developments that are going to make rockets look more like penises?  No  I would say they're gonna be more and more like just long slender tubes  This is probably the most phallic looking spacecraft. You're gonna see if I had to guess can I go now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This was the most hilarious  Everyone was wondering it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you think that will be bezos his lasting legacy in space that he built the rocket that looked the most?  like a dick  I don't think so. Hopefully you'll make it a little bit easier and cheaper to get into space. Well competing visions  I guess for the future there  Yeah  Just want to mention I am not representing my employer

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, yeah, so I just so was it just me he made it back to work. Yeah, I hope there was a

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A soft core very soft core porn movie called flesh gordon. Oh, yeah  And if you go to line 38 there was flesh's rocket ship

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh interesting. And by the way, somebody has saved this on pinterest  Yes. Well, yeah, see the little curve I think uh, add some je ne sais quoi  but it doesn't look like  Jeff could be in there. Um, I don't want to dwell on this too much longer

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are we still gonna have our e rating on apple podcast? I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or montana didn't like them. Yeah, maybe

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think maybe  They quoted  A  Developer named greg osuri who decided he had enough of the bay area. It's just a hell hole living here  He said the founder of a cloud computing company called akash  Network he left for his sister's townhouse in the suburbs of columbus, ohio, but by march  Mr. Osuri was itching to return he missed  City life meeting new people running to acquaintances on the street getting drinks with colleagues  I guess he came back to that hell hole in april. I'm sorry. Oh, you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He probably missed like talking tech everywhere. I mean because like whenever i'm in san francisco  I have to admit I get really sick of it simply because i'm sick of like yeah talking tech tech tech. Yeah, but  I mean if you're if you're keen on that, it's probably a real letdown to meet real people

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why I stay here in my hermetically sealed chamber  um  this

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm so wait wait wait wait stay on stay on bezos for one second. I'm just serious. Well first let us acknowledge  His pr  Staff amazing didn't work at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't catch that. Yeah, so he thanked amazon customers and employees for allowing him to fly into space  No for paying for yeah  He is he has said in the past that he considers himself a lottery winner for becoming the richest man in the world worth almost 200  billion dollars  um  Yeah, yeah, that was a little tone deaf and and then the cowboy hat

Transcript:  um  Yeah, that was a little tone deaf, but I think maybe  Pr probably doesn't have a lot to do with jeff anymore. Right? But do you see he's got a full time not after the fifth

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, wasn't that today the fifth? Yeah, he retired. He's done

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right, but here's my question to you if if you if money were and money and morals were not an object  And and the environment and everything else  Would you take it and if so, which ride would you take?

Transcript:  People getting locked out of their chromebooks and and the warning went out whoop whoop whoop  don't um  Uh update your machine don't don't turn it on again. Don't do it just yet  All right, and so but because I have my old old old grandpa  uh pixel book and the battery's going bazank and I thought that the  Uh switch on my on my strip was on when it was off suddenly boom power gone  Because it goes down it goes from like 65 to 0 like that  um, so  Okay, turn back on and i've always had this fear. What if I forget this password?  I know this password, but I you know, I go through lots of passwords  I use it and your google password is I hope long strong and random. Yes it is right  But i've had variations on it over time, right so I can I can mix it up  I couldn't get it. Oh, and I thought I blame myself. I thought oh geez. No, they had a bad update  I guess variation and variation and variation and variation and I then had to  um, and I gave up  And I was afraid I didn't know what the limit on the number of tries it was  So then I had to do forgotten password for my machine  Which means I had to go through all kinds of magillas all over I had to do blood tests  I had to get x-rays. I had to do all kinds of things and um, uh,  That got messed up in other strange ways, but because I could remember an old recent passport password  It let me restore. Otherwise, it was about to say okay, you can get your machine back fella  But i'm racing everything on it wasn't a big deal on a chromebook, right?  Uh, nonetheless, I remember the old password. I got it back and I thought well that was w jeff  And i'm not so sure it was double jeff. It might have been but I think I think I got struck by this  When was this it happened?  Uh, so was it two days ago? I forget. I don't ever since the pandemic. I don't know what it is. The story is from yesterday

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh, there's the google posted on the system sas pages working on it was last night. Yeah, okay good  Yeah, yeah, that's could have been the fix is out. It's updated.

They have  status not just of server issues, but of  bugs and other problems so  Uh fully resolved it says users unable to log in after updating a 91 0 4 4 7 2.165  Sweet that was fast. And if you got that update and you haven't yet installed it don't  But you shouldn't they've pulled it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I don't if you if you got locked out, I don't know how you get back in yeah, that's a problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They I mean they probably have flags on those records according to google the only options immediately regain access to your chrome os device  Will lead to the local data on the device being wiped it down. Yeah, if you can wait until the new fix  Uh is released though. Your device should automatically download that update as well  And maybe that'll fix it or you can manually trigger the update using the guest account  If your computer is downloaded the bad update, but not installed it turn it off. Don't do it  And of course, you can always power wash. That's the beauty of these things

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But one guy one report said he couldn't I don't know what I don't know. I do happen. But yeah, well, maybe he'd never

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What because if you are?  No one should use google maps while they're hiking  You need to use a dedicated trail app because there's not gps. There's not as many people  I mean, they don't send their vehicles out there. It just strikes me as like if  If you are going to go into the wilderness which if you're doing a like a real hike then  You need to prepare for it  You can't just grab I mean there's so many people getting rescued every year because they just walk into the wilderness with their smartphone

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the line goes  You know, I have if it's in scotland. I have to do this gonna do it  The line goes through very steep rocky and pathless terrain where even in good visibility it would be challenging to find a safe line  And in low cloud and rain and the suggested google line is potentially fairly

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, our google's emoji different from apple's i'm so glad you asked  I knew you would  Emojipedia emojipedia is the place to go  So the way it works the unicode consortium  The folks who define the emojis which jenny eightley is a member of yes, as is jeremy brook who is the creator of emojipedia?  They only give you a text description and a suggested emoji, right?  but uh every  Company can design its own. So  In fact if you go to emojipedia, you can see what apple's look like versus clubhouse versus discord  Versus facebook versus google look at all of these each one of them has their own  Style and look of emojis and so you could pick the the one you like the best  These are apple's emojis

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And when the when you when you?  Put an emoji in your email  You get it's a unicode character. No, it gets yeah, it's rendered by the recipient

Transcript:  It's a ghost in the bikini

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the bikini emoji no longer looks like it's being worn by an invisible person the face mask emoji now shows a face with its  Eyes open instead of closed  Uh because masks have become a universal way of showing kindness to others  Rather than a symbol true that see it used to show somebody looking sick interesting and then it showed somebody happy  So look, here's the old one. I'm sick. I feel bad. I'm happy because i'm saving the world  Interesting. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, yeah, and there's I think the apples have more detail although i've always had a complaint with a dancing woman  I feel like her skirt is a little too short. I just I just want to say the apple has made it a little

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  More provocative. She's she's risque. Did you have but did you have a problem with the bikini emoji? I don't i've never seen

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Where people just talked about nothing but donut emojis  If something really happened like lightning and thunder  Then I could imagine, you know having a real conversation  But just out of nowhere they spent I don't know half an hour not on donuts that might be okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But donut emoji I ain't gonna kid you jeff that's 60 million dollars is calling

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Rabbit  Did you guys last week talk about anthony bourdain and the deep faked voice?  No, sir. That was on the on the show to it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, because it had come out like during the show or right after by the way, isn't deep fake a little strong  Isn't it? It was an electronic personation right? It was something they had hired an actor deep fake makes it sound so so

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's um, no, it wasn't an actor. It was done. Uh, I don't know. That's what I'm saying. Yeah  So, uh, it's a documentary called road runner a film about anthony bourdain who I loved  Really did  Admired greatly  uh  The film had the usual, you know clips and so forth  But there were three places where the filmmaker morgan neville said he wanted to use material born where they had written  So it was his words. Yep, but he never said them out loud  so he went to a a software company and we this was something we talked about before which is  Adding and google's been good at this but there are a number of companies now that do this where they take  a speech  Synthesized by a computer but you know how lifeless and robotic that sounds and then apply an actor's prosody on top of it to make it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sound real actors what prosody? Oh how the way they say their inflections and the way they say their

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So so radio pro of you. Whoa

Transcript:  Now how much would you pay so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ten dollars, yeah, it's going down. It's a problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh, so and so i'm really intrigued by this because they basically made it sound like anthony bourdain was saying these  Words, it's only in three different clips  And frankly, I guess they revealed it. Otherwise, we wouldn't probably wouldn't even know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

I think podcasting is easy  Yeah, it is  You think i'd be doing it if it weren't?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no and I can hold y'all accountable for for being  Here's a question

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, do you think the one of the reasons subsext doing this is because podcasting is so hot and maybe they're hoping this will sexy them up  So somebody will come along and buy them up. Maybe uh, somebody called spotify spotify and get into the newsletter game. I think it's it's a smart

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a smart way to  Make your content providers happy and to give them a source of revenue  So maybe long term they're like maybe spotify but maybe they're thinking big like if their model is to be like  The infrastructure for independent content providers you have to have a newsletter content or events  Events  Uh, you need a website too because if you're running a newsletter, you gotta put your stuff somewhere so it gets searched  Yeah  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, all right. Let's uh, let's wrap this guy up unless you got something else you want to this made me think about  I saw a tweet from mr. Mike elgin  Tumblr starts testing post plus which allows users to charge their followers a monthly fee  Tumblr store around

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh, yeah tumblr's back because they got sold to automatic and automatic

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The wordpress guy he tweets he says charging for tumblr might be going too far  And I just responded why so and he says well because tumblr is mostly a static old-school medium that is perfectly positioned  To be to benefit from being one of the last remaining bastions of 100 free content on the internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hope they can do something with tumblr because I I think yahoo  Uh, you know tumblr was pretty interesting yahoo bought it  They didn't hurt it too badly  They left it alone then they they kind of started a censored content and then got sold to get sold to verizon was a part of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Verizon is when they started censoring content. I think yahoo did it before but

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Verizon obviously wasn't going to allow adult content on tumblr  And I you know, I feel like it's kind of fallen off the face of the list the funny thing is  Yeah, there's a lot of adult content, but it was also the easiest way to make a really good looking blog  And I have young people  Really young people like you know kids 13 14 15 year olds used it for their you know  Their their interest and I thought it was a great remember the founder of tumblr was about that a20 star tumblr. Yeah. Yeah  Yeah, that's right. I liked tumblr a lot david carp david carp alex carp was is now a millionaire. Thanks to spotify  No, that's somebody else  um  I think the next thing we should do because stacey wants to go have a waffle. She's already had her waffles

Transcript:  I'm just checking as a as a journalist professor. Where do you stand on this? Yeah, that's a good point

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He was making the same points in twitter  and so um  I thought that i'd get him to say oh you're right jarvis. You must get the cx9, but no he's hanging by

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The other one he likes he likes the that's him having an opinion man. Yeah, you were complaining

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think he has a very good point. He says the cx9 has a type c on only one side only on the left  Uh, which I think one of them both is that is that a stopper? I don't know kevin loves his books

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's nice to have one on each side because then you can plug in on either side exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And he thinks that the screen hinge thing is weird  So I need kevin to get a demo model to try to to lap test it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The few laptops that we've had for hands-on tech that had that interesting looking hinge  It does not make a difference sitting on your lap  It barely makes a difference sitting on the desk  But it it what it helps is just allowing those fans to not fire up and struggle as much because you're getting adequate air  so  Especially if you're gonna have all of that horsepower. I think cx9 looks better a lot better

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a pretty laptop. Don't you think yeah the cx

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Fancy the five that kevin likes is fanless and i've i'm fanphobic  Oh interesting you think you're right this one would be probably fanless in fact, you might want a fan because honestly

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a conceit that I think these faster processors really aren't going to run very well without a fan  um  This is pretty this is the executive chromebook. This is designed for which was of course

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Level office. I deserve this. Yeah, so which one which one would you go? I'd get the cx9 i'd go with the nine
