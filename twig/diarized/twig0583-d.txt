All right  Looks it looks like the cabin though. It's still a little  Relax relaxed and rustic and it's nice. It's a in the country. Yeah in the country. Yeah. Yeah, Jeff Jarvis is  Here couldn't do the show without the director of the townite Center for entrepreneurial journalism at the Craig Newmark  graduate school of journalism at the City University of New York and  There's his kovid Twitter list  Which is still good. By the way, I keep that as a column in my tweet deck

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just to see how screwed we are

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, we are now that we're going through wait. It's not the second wave

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Dr. Fauci says it's the just just a third peak of the first third peak of the first wave

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Germany and France are shutting down. So I hear

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In Italy too, it's not just us it's the whole world except for New Zealand South Korea Japan and China for some reason  Also with us. Mr. Ant Pruitt from hands-on photography  And hands-on wellness good to see you Anthony you too, sir. Yes. I  Tried this morning. I  Really did to watch the testimony  How long did you last in this well I I last about a minute then I turn it off I said no Leo  This is your job. Oh  And turn it back on then it lasts a couple minutes. I said, I don't care if it's my job. I  Give up. I  give up  Jeff it's your job. You watched it, right? It's your job. No, I did not

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just I just I take care of myself man when I saw a tweet go by early on that one  Member of Senate had said that fact-checking is censorship. That was it. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you watch it Matthew I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Watched it the way I normally watch these things which is through my Twitter feed. Yeah. So yeah, it's good to get the hot takes

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The you know, the issue is really section 230 which you've talked about a lot on this show many many times  Oh we have  Sarcasm is a  Ant knows we have it's all we talk about it seems like  But it made me as I was watching this I was thinking okay  Maybe we could maybe we could because even the Democrats are this point saying we need to we need to modify it somehow  right the notion of section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 is  that  platforms like Twitter Facebook  YouTube  Are not publishers when they act as publishers  They're as responsible as any publisher and in fact the senators were made a point of asking  All of them, you know, hey if you created some content that was  Bad  You would be responsible for it, right and they all said yeah. Yeah, we'd be responsible  That's not the issue. The issue is at issue is these sites like Twitter and Facebook  Where people like you and me are putting up content are not to be held responsible  for the content other people put on it because  You know otherwise you wouldn't have a conversation online. Yeah, they'd be sued to death for libel  So if somebody went into our chat room and said something libelous  They that if I could be sued well that pretty quickly I'm gonna get rid of the chat room now  I can moderate the chat room  But if Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg said there's 2 billion daily active users on Facebook obviously camp  In a timely fashion moderate everything even Twitter is hard-pressed to moderate everything  So I think we all agree that that part of section 230  You know probably should be preserved. That's really important. It gives them a  Defense now there's another part of it which says they have the right to moderate and  Maybe you've out affecting  Their status as a publisher right right that's important that doesn't make them a publisher  And we don't want to break that obviously because you want to give them the right to moderate  I I can't really understand what the goal is of this. How would you mind modify section 230?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So so the funny thing is Leo just struck me that what Ron Wyden who was the co-author of section 230 says is the section?  23 provides a sword and a shield  But the shield says what you just said you're not gonna get in trouble in Matthew Ingram post something awful on your site  You know you're safe right right which happens the sword is  You are free to take down idiocy the Jeff Jarvis says on your site right right?  So it just struck me that what's happening here is that from the left from the Democrats. They're getting in trouble for  The the sword shield the shield the shield because you're not doing enough. You're not taking down all this stuff  Right from the right they're in trouble for the sword  Oh, you take down hope he by hate speech you took down my speech

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you can't find a law that's gonna appease both because they have conflicting goals

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is there any type of balance that could happen with this  With all of the technology that we have is there some way to strike a balance to keep everyone happy because we do  Need to have some sort of moderation in there yet at the same time  We don't need Twitter and Facebook getting sued every 10 minutes because some

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly what 230 does it says we want you to have a conversation, but we want you to feel free to moderate  You should moderate. It's a good thing to moderate right, but what I've been

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But what I've been hearing in the hearing today was the arguments of the moderation was either too lax or too  stern  So where where are we going to draw the line because we got to have this in place if there's going to be some sort

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of happy medium, right? I think we got to admit we we have to admit that the entire premise of this  Hearing was in bad faith  So the whole reason they asked them to come was because they were mad that Facebook and Twitter  Restricted the distribution of the New York Post story about a hundred Bidens laptop  So it doesn't really have you know, we can talk about the principles and so on  I don't think I think very few of those certainly who we're talking about it today care about the principles of section 230  They're looking for a way to beat up  Twitter and Facebook for being biased against conservatives  Which a bunch of members of Congress continue to claim is is true even though study after study shows it's not true  But so they they need  Some sort of stick to argue there's always some sort of one-off though

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  where something's gonna look like is shutting down the conservative side of things and letting the  Liberal side just skate on by there's always going to be a couple one-offs

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Well it goes both ways right? So so so you have the the left is screaming at Facebook that they're there  Zuckerberg's too close to the right and doing  Things there and then you have the right screaming at Jack Dorsey the amazing moment today was was Ted Cruz  Saying to Dorsey who the hell elected you let's dig into that for just one second  Yeah, if anyone had elected Jack Dorsey, First Amendment would stop him from doing things related to speech  It's because no one has elected him that the First Amendment protects what he does with speech

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then we know the Constitution. I mean Ted Cruz is a lawyer. He knows this stuff  This is completely disingenuous  It's not like he doesn't understand what section 230 does or what the First Amendment does  This is I mean his in particular  The whole exercise was grandstanding to make him look like he's beating up on Big Tech

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So aunt I don't think the goal was to make anybody happy today. The aunt was performative  Just what Matthew said is can we we beat up on places that are unpopular?  They're made unpopular in the media narrative and the law is not going to solve your problem, right?  It's about our norms. It's about what we do

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And one I think the most interesting thing certainly of all three CEOs was Mark Zuckerberg saying  That he thinks section 230 should be modified. Yeah, let me read someone like let me read sucks statements

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then you could follow up Matthew  He says section 230  May this is in the this is in Mike Mazinik's article on tech tur from a couple of days ago. They already had  The what does what is gonna say in his opening remarks? I presume he followed this  section 230 made it possible for every major internet service to be built and  Ensured important values like free expression and openness were part of how?  Platforms operate. Okay so far so good  Changing it is a significant decision  however, I  Believe Congress should update the law to make sure it's working as intended. This is purely a political statement, obviously  Oh, is it ever I don't think he really believes that but he's trying to somehow appease these guys  we support the ideas around transparency and  Industry collaboration that are being discussed in some of the current bipartisan proposals  This is just word salad that means nothing and I look forward to us a meaningful  Dialogue about how we might update the law to deal with the problems we face today  Okay, that's me spoken my  Debate about section 230 shows that people of all political persuasions are unhappy with a status quo  Well, but for different reasons, right people want to know that companies are taking responsibility for combating harmful content  Especially illegal activity on their platform a lot of the questioning for Zuckerberg was well  You allow people to say to kind of imply that the Holocaust didn't happen. He said that's yeah, that's not against our rules  They want to know when platforms remove content that they are doing so fairly and transparently yes  They want to make sure platforms are held accountable. I don't think that's unreasonable say that the problem is that the devil's in the details  How do you do it?  And I think go ahead now you can go ahead Matthew. Yeah, I was just gonna say that, you know, whenever

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Zuckerberg says yeah, I'm in favor of regulation  I think you should you know check your wallet or or because he clearly has  An agenda and I think in this case  It's that he knows people want to regulate section 230 and what he wants is for that regulation to  To give Facebook effectively more power. The risk is  If there's regulation it could entrench face Facebook's power instead of that is make it harder for people to compete  and I think that's a real risk if he if he gets the  Interpretations of section 230 that he wants it could actually make Facebook more powerful

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's exactly Europe is exactly what Mike Mazinik says he says  Mark knows full effing well  That any regulations that Congress puts in place will simply serve to lock in Facebook's position  Facebook can handle the compliance costs the upstart companies that might disrupt Facebook will have a much harder time make no mistake about it  This is Mark Zuckerberg pulling up the innovation ladder  he climbed behind him and  and you know somebody else has pointed out that  In the current climate Zuck can't just buy a competitor as he did with whatsapp and instagram  He tried to do with a snapchat  So he's got to find other ways to protect his incumbency and this is a very convenient way to do so

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right and Zuck spent a hundred thirty million dollars to start the oversight board which the day after we  Did our last show opened up for business have they heard any  Appeals they just opened up to take them so they're gonna get  There were there were information sessions  It's got their secret laptops  They have a secret laptops tied into their secret system  and a whole  Ornate structure one thing I didn't realize I don't know if you knew this Matthew since we've been following it, too  Is that for each of the cases? There's a public comment period  So they we we the plebs out here can comment on cases that come up before the oversight board that the oversight board can go  Also go to outside experts, and then what's gonna happen clearly?  So I've also talked to the other side of this at Facebook where they're gonna receive the rulings from the oversight board  Then they're gonna have to figure out how to implement them so there's more cost and structure on the Facebook side as well  Yeah, you're right. This is all  Facebook has the ability to weather any regulatory storm

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But is there any influence from those outside?  comments to the oversight board we'll see what they do it's a bunch of smart people that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sorry, yeah  There's I mean there's people I think are very smart and and I respect Alan Rusberger the former editor of the Guardian is one  Of them on the oversight board. There's other people. I think they're gonna try to prove their independence  I think they're gonna try to come up with tough stuff, but we'll see proof and pudding is it all

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it all irrelevant since the election is a few days away  It'd be hard for Congress to do anything as a lame ducks in an lame duck session  You know I mean we'll see what the results of the election are maybe everybody will be in place as they were before but  I mean really this is just in fact Amy Klobuchar former candidate for a president and senator on the committee  Said this is just grandstanding the election is a few days away  Why are we holding these hearings now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is you can't come up with with with relief for the American people around kovat, but you can you can do this grandstand, right?  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and the only thing the only thing it suggests is that I mean Biden has talked about section 230  He's talked about wanting to  Do something to it. I don't know if he's thought about it deeply  But so it could you know, some of this stuff could continue even if he's a little people Matthew

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know tech people don't take people. I know policy people  I'm not talking about the platforms but elsewhere who are making who have made contact long since with the Biden campaign saying whoa Nellie

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, it's like it's a safe thing to say for anybody. We ought to do something about the weather. Yeah, good luck

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Good luck figuring out what to do. You know, it's raining an awful lot. What are we gonna do about that? I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The one thing I in terms of things to do I had a conversation with Alex Stamos a while back  who was the former head of  security effectively at Facebook about what he thought  Could be done to help prevent for example  disinformation from being massively distributed on Facebook and his thought was that the more something goes viral the more  Incumbent it should be on Facebook to monitor it and to do something if necessary  So if it's not reaching that many people then who cares?  But if it is reaching millions in a matter of minutes, then there's more onus on them to do something about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Still slippery slope, you know just because it's not  hitting two million people it doesn't make it a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Valid statement, you know, I mean that's the hard part is that everything  You know related to this is a slippery slope. There is no easy  Demarcation between what's viral and what's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We also don't know how big any of this really is we can't we can't get the data  There's this presumption that Facebook is a cesspool and my Facebook is not my face  And and so  How do we know how big it is we don't have the data the you know  I'm gonna plug once more the transatlantic high-level working group on content moderation and freedom of expression of which I was a part  Says that we need a flexible framework of accountability out of transparency  So we need to be able to know what data we can expect from the platforms government can ask for it  It goes to researchers then we get some sense of the impact then we worry about  About the interventions and what's working and what's not working  But now it's all guesses and I blame the platforms for that too because they're holding the data back  But then you blame government too because things like GDPR is what led Facebook to stop NYU from investigating the political  I was just gonna ask about that mess on both sides

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Facebook earlier this month shut down NYU's research project into political ad targeting

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They sought to shut it down. Did they actually shut it down? I don't know. Yes, they didn't actually shut it down

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, really? Okay. No, this is outside this one  Yeah, I think they were going to restrict it until the election was over

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they're using scraping tools. So it isn't in Facebook  But still if what they did is they asked I think they asked people to give them their Facebook feeds, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And yeah and allow them to scrape it's a browser. It's a browser plug-in. I think yeah  It looks at this. Yeah, but there's a there's a GDPR issue here  Is it's one matter for it to know what you saw?  But it's what then what your friends saw the targeting the way it was explained to me some time ago  Is that if a given ad is shown to ant and  You know what the targeting of that and that ad is you then know something about ant that ant may not have wanted  Anyone to know so there's a GDPR issue

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's also Ben Thompson wrote about this and I thought made a good point that some of the stuff that Facebook  Would be doing if it effectively gave the nod to this type of stuff would be things that are covered by the consent decree  In fact, yes both consent decrees in which Facebook promised not to do this type of stuff  so if it says oh go ahead or even just turns a blind eye to this kind of  Scraping it could be seen as breaching the consent decree because it might be fine for me to share my  What I'm doing on Facebook, but all of my friends and all of their stuff is in there, too  They didn't they didn't give their permission for me to share that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So while it's tempting to say oh see this is the unintended consequence of these regulations  It's preventing reasonable research from being done. Maybe it isn't an unintended consequence  Maybe really it is the right thing to do to say well your friends of friends information shouldn't be  Offered up even if you say yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just because you're running that browser plug Facebook should have sat down and tried to figure out  I think it's a bad luck matter what yeah, they should have figured out a way to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You and work with them right and Facebook and Twitter for the past two years at least  I've written about this have promised researchers all sorts of information  And it takes ten times longer than everybody said it was going to and then the amount of information that comes out is tiny and useless

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have to wonder if Facebook. I  Mean honestly, they don't want this information. No, of course they don't yeah  So it's a convenient thing that it's illegal and they don't want it but what I said to them I was at a meeting

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Brought together by people who are pretty anti-tech and and I Facebook is similar from Facebook was there and it's Chatham house  So I guess I shouldn't say who was there, but anyway  And we had the justice discussion  I said why the hell can't you just release this stuff and then and then you well no here's what's gonna happen  Once once I know about Ant and can come back at me and say you violated my privacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, everybody knows barbecues the best thing ever invented so  Nothing wrong with that. What's the harm? What's the harm in that?  Your insurance company might have something to say  All right, so  Should we just ignore these hearings? I mean that's kind of what after watching it for a while  I just tuned out because it's like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think if you it's grants you look at them  If you look at the last hearing the one that was sort of the final hearing of the ad was deep and meaningful  So that was right. So that had a lot of you know  thoughtful questions  Important questions there were things raised that were actually important there and it was a kind of a nice change  From some of the grandstanding circus sideshow stuff and so this one we kind of  Reverted to form and it's just people waving and screaming and about things that they are either deliberately  misunderstanding or don't understand

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I watched for about an hour now and sorry you watched for an hour and you're a better man than I am

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I watched for about and let me go ahead and tell you sir. I realized I didn't have my coffee this morning  To complete that hour but in that that hour that I watched I didn't see a lot of grandstanding  I saw a lot of tick-for-tack kind of talk or  like I said, they they actually did some research and didn't quite sound like a bunch of  Hates hand it this way grandpa's is just now seeing a computer for the first time  It was it was it was okay  It wasn't as bad as I thought it was gonna be but again, I still needed that cup of coffee just to get through that hour

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And  Frankly, this is you know, if you're a successful business the United States, this is you know an ex part of the expectation  It's not like these guys. I mean they didn't have to fly anywhere  You know they could do it from  You know, I just I don't I don't think this is gonna sway any voters for sure so no it has no value in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No  Most people didn't even understand I bet you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well people understand they understand in the in the in the shade of their political persuasion  Because I hear from a lot of people say see that post suppression of that post article  Prima facie proof that Twitter and Facebook right don't like the president and are you just gonna block stuff?  Right and then people on the left said well  Well, you know, I don't have to go into though  The positioning but that's what they hear and but I don't think it's gonna change anybody's vote

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they didn't even talk about how Facebook  Mother Jones wrote about it and Margaret Sullivan at the that's a really interesting question on it. Yeah, so they're suppressing  effectively left leaning news and then favoring Breitbart and Ben Shapiro  But the Sullivan example

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you're Facebook and you set a rule that says if you are paid for by parent primarily by a political organization  Organization then that becomes a rule set by which they say then now we're not going to consider you news  I'm not defending Facebook here, but we but they try to come up with scalable rules and that example from  From Margaret's column seemed a little bit

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not but I think it shows  So I think it shows you that those rules are  Inevitably flawed bright Breitbart is funded by conservative, you know  They just don't they just don't disclose it and so if you disclose it the way courier newsroom does  Or mother Jones does then you get penalized if you don't disclose it then you just get to be in the newsfeed even though  You're you're running effectively disinformation

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, so they have they have crews and they call people on the outside. I don't get anything for this  I don't know but they call they'll call 20 people on the outside to say let's just bounce stuff off  Do you mind talking to us and I always say okay any of the companies because I learned stuff too and they have people trying  To decide this was this was like a year ago. What's a news organization, right?  So they went through just this and they try to get other organizations outside to do it for them  Right. Do you have a list? We just use your list. You got a list. No, you don't know hell  So we're gonna come up with our own rules, right?  so they have a they have a sign up thing for news organizations and they set rules because people gonna make them set rules because  They want those rules when people go after them and yell at them and scream at them  Then they want to say but but but we got rules

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  so I guess the question is  Is do you think Facebook's operating in good faith in general and just it's a hard thing to do and they're doing their best  They can I I think it's a lot to accuse them of a bias one way or the other  I feels like in both agree in both cases. They're just trying to do the best they can it's and it's a far from perfect system  Is that fair you agree and how about you Jeff I agree with you

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I still think on both sides of the spectrum Facebook could could try harder  And I know it's easy for me to say sitting here in my little comfy chair. It's hard. They got 2 billion

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  daily users

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's a lot of traffic. It's a lot of traffic, but they're paying people  Come up with these solutions to you know, so try hard. So and I think they could do better. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree with you Leo. I think there's there's a few different layers here at the top. I think you can  Question motives at the worker be level  There are people who are trying really hard to come up with reasonable things and were there for a reason  I  Think that if the Australian stuff we talked about a few weeks ago  Let's say that they pass that law in Australia and Facebook says fine  Pulling news off of Facebook in Australia, I think they're gonna be secretly having champagne and smoked meat  In happiness because news causes a lot of problems and fine screw it. We're gonna go back to getting  Dates and life's gonna be a lot easier  And it sets a precedent that I think is gonna be dangerous for our industry and for our society because that's how people are finding  Out things and now they can't find it out. It's bad  But I think that's that's kind of where we're headed almost is can we can we get rid of this? It's a pain in the ass

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Matthew do you think Facebook is well intentioned but  It's just a hard thing to do. And so it occasionally you get these  mistakes  Or is it intentional do you think they have a bias me? Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He froze I think there's no question it's am I frozen you're back you're back. Yeah  But blurry  I think there's no there's no question that it's a very very difficult  Job, I mean billions of pieces of content are posted, you know every hour probably right and they have to moderate all that somehow  But I think you know, they're worth hundreds of billions of possibly trillions of dollars so  You know  Maybe they could try and invest in a solution. They say they're going to do and  And they could also be a whole lot more transparent about it  It's fine to just wave your hands and say well, we're trying our hardest but there's no way of knowing that it's literally a black box

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  now on the other hand Twitter employees are accusing Jack Dorsey of  absentee management hands-off  Delegating decisions not really participating and looking at his beard. He's clearly putting a lot of energy into growing the beard  Let's ask the same question about Twitter. Do you think Twitter is doing the best it can do you think it's biased?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or is Jack Dorsey doing the best he can I doubt Jack Dorsey's  Can he's got other I mean that's been a criticism of him from the beginning  He's running two gigantic companies, right and he's not very involved in either one, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But here's here's the other but here just just to play  Ping-pong here, right? But people say Zuckerberg should give up and delegate more power  He's too powerful in Facebook and then they say it's you know, it's exactly what I was going with right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because sometimes being a good leader speaks to how well you delegate  On however many different tasks you have where there's a big fortune 500 company or whatever even just a  Football head coach gets a lot of credit. I don't do anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I show up sit down and let you all do you hold that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, well, yeah, thanks to my great weight. Yeah  There's a big Politico feature I put up on the rundown about the Jayakade

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Transcript:  I probably probably block the hill  Okay, I'll get it from another source, let's see  Here we go, this is Fox News they should have better video. Yeah, let's see here  Senator Ted Cruz grills Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey is not coming through here either  Oh, there it is. Okay. Here we go

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thank you, mr. Chairman for holding this hearing  The three witnesses we have before this committee today  Collectively pose I believe the single greatest threat to free speech in America  And the greatest threat we have to free and fair elections

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We have to free and fair elections. Well, what let's talk about that. Is that really true is it?  No, it's social. It seems like social media  For all its flaws is about free speech. Yes  Well, but that's for the president as well as his detractors  do  Okay  So and certainly the the hyperbole of saying it's the greatest threat  That's a that's a little Matthew's point. It's just grandstand. That's a that's a little strong  Isn't it?  um, oh I just  I just lost the video  Here, let's play it again. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay. Okay. Okay. We distracted you. Thank you. Mr. Chairman for holding this hearing  Okay, three witnesses we have before this committee today  Collectively pose I believe the single greatest threat to free speech in America  And the greatest threat we have to free and fair elections  Yesterday I spent a considerable amount of time speaking with both mr. Zuckerberg and mr. Pichai  I have concerns about the behavior of both of their companies. I would note that facebook  Is at the minimum at least trying to make some efforts in the direction of defending free speech. I appreciate their doing so

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that fair? Do you think googled and twitter are doing less?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, he's this is what he's going to go. He's going to  Basically say but twitter takes down the new york post and so they're evil and awful

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and it labels trump's tweets, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, well did facebook did some of that too though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  From sharing those stories  And number two you went even further  And blocked the new york post from sharing on twitter its own reporting  Why did twitter make the decision to censor the new york post?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, we had a hack materials policy  Um that we when was that policy adopted?  Uh in 2018, I believe

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In 2018 go ahead. What was what was the policy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the policy is around  limiting the spread of materials  That are hacked  Um, we didn't want twitter to be a distributor for hack materials  Um, we found that the new york post nice jacket

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It showed the direct materials the whole look is very confusing to me. I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That it fell under this policy

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now so in your view if it's unclear the source of a document, I see again. I can't watch it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just can't can't do it. I'm sorry. These are these are your friends. Why are you doing this to us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So twitter did take it down initially because they were concerned the material was hacked material  When they found out it was not they put it back up with a warning. No, what wasn't it? No, they were they

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They said the journalists  Complained to them and said well, we also put up a material. So that's not a good policy fellas. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they changed their policy

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was no it wasn't just that it was hacked material. It was that there was private information  In the material so both of those things are against twitter's terms of use. It wasn't an issue of disinformation  So they said that too they said it was election it was election manipulation

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Basically what I talked to somebody in in the company and and basically said whether it was accurate  What I want what I want you to what I wish you would do is some point you guys in town  So I'll just make some judgments and say  This is trying to manipulate an election. We can figure out the details, but it's trying to manipulate election clearly and we don't be part of that  And somebody said to me, yeah, that's basically what happened  Somebody said to me, yeah, that's basically what happened but then they've got to back up and they've got to put it in their statues

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they kind of and the risk to me  To me, I actually thought when they blocked the sharing of the link  That that was a mistake and I think jack dorsey  Admitted later that that was a mistake and that they should not have blocked  Anyone from sharing? I mean if you tried to share the link they would throw something saying no, you can't do that  it like I think  Labeling it is fine showing someone a warning is fine  Whatever reducing its distribution is fine  But but actually blocking people from sharing a link from a newspaper seems to me to raise all sorts of  And that's why I think everybody got their knickers in a twist, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's difficult  It's a nice jacket. I like that the beard I can do with that but the jacket's nice. It's a difficult thing to do and I think  Let's ask the same question we asked about facebook about twitter are they  Coming from the best of motives, but finding it difficult to the job or do you think they're biased matthew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think they're biased at all. I mean, I don't think they're organized enough to be biased to be honest  You know, um if anything they're biased is towards free speech, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Free speech right  They used to be the free speech wing of the free speech party was their slogan. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Man, they hate that that guy said that anyway

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, because frankly if you're all about free speech you don't block or  Ban or do anything you just let everybody everything go and actually biz

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think biz and ev both said the tweets must flow that was when they were being used as you know an information  Right vehicle during the era they did not anticipate the the the trump. Yeah, it's one thing to say that when it's egyptian rebels  It's another thing when it's the president tweeting, right, you know conspiracy theories about covet, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  so they're  well intentioned by accident and  But they're but they're struggling because it's a difficult thing to do. How about you jeff your your feelings on twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh, no, yeah, I don't I don't think they're they're biased as a company. I think that but that's  But even there there was a wonderful op-ed in the new york times  couple months ago by wesley lowry who left the washington post because of his  And it said that the notion of objectivity that is to say a lack of bias is fundamentally racist  Uh racist and that because it's who's deciding what's biased and what's not it's those who have the power to do so  And who has the power people look like me, right?  Then there's a very good book from lewis raven wallace called the view from somewhere  Which goes to the same thing where he was accused. He's he's trans transgender. He was accused of bias  Oh, you're too biased to cover lgbtq issues. Yeah, he was fired  He was fired as a result  and  Um, and he said and he says in his book, I think quite eloquently, uh,  well  A you know white people cover white people and it's not bias  B you're giving up my lived experience. You're saying that my lived experience is is not valuable in covering this you're calling that lived experience  Bias, so this whole question of bias and objectivity is is itself

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fraught it's a power word. Yeah, I forget who said it. Uh, someone said  Reality has a well-known liberal bias

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A liberal no doubt

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Although in canada liberal means something different as I I believe but a little different

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, a little in australia. It means a lot different. Yeah and uh twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  biased or not

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Not biased racist  I don't think they're racist either. But as I said about facebook, they still can try harder, right?  Uh  with both of these platforms the unintended consequences is  Everybody has a voice. That's a great thing  But it's also a little bit of a detriment that everybody has a voice to  To be able to get out here on these platforms and just say what they feel needs to be said and sometimes it's  Not necessarily the right thing to say  But there's a lot of good that can come from both of these platforms, right? Yep

Transcript:  Yeah, hello fellow kids. Who is that? I also like music band

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that was um

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Typically when candidates do this kind of thing  Um, it falls flat like hello fellow kids did  but um  I know doesn't feel like it fell so flat this time  like that it you know, it felt like it went to kids and then I  Spoke to them in a level that they could identify with she's young aoc. So yeah  Doesn't it doesn't so weird?  And it's not an effort. It's a valiant effort. I can't see a  Playing you know playing one of these games  But you know times have changed  Steve go to the theater  Yeah, he did go to the theater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh, we are as you know heading towards an election this tuesday. In fact the next time we uh,  Yeah, you've heard that perhaps

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Uh, are you just doing a digital story? So am I supposed to go vote now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you haven't voted i'm gonna send you out the door right now to vote you voted already haven't you yet?  Are you waiting in animal crossing?  That would be that's just a matter of time before we have our votes in animal crossing  but um  There is a lot being done  Between now and tuesday to kind of prepare for this  Uh, both google and facebook are banning election ads after the election  What's the point of that? I don't i'm not sure I understand that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because uh people claiming that it was lost or was rigged this is against this information  Yeah, it's it's trying to do not getting people all riled up right after the election. Uh stopping civil war that kind of stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Twitter is launching something called pre bunks  Instead of debunks they'll preemptively debunk false information

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But we not  Could we not use the term pre bun pre bun is not a good

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Says the writer in him

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They've never done this before it's not a reaction to an existing tweet with misinformation. It's just going to be  up at the top of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh feed that's just called distributing facts. I know pre-bunking sounds cool, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, no, it doesn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just terrible

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's looking all condescendingly at us you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wikipedia which uh, actually i've always has had very good news  Pages they have an election  2020 uh page and they've already done a lot of things  To lock it down before the election

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't want to  You know be overly skeptical, but the people that i'm concerned about  Are not going to see any of those things that you just mentioned. Okay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay. Yeah, I mean most people get their news from the tv  And uh, and they're going to go to their station of choice the station that affirms their existing beliefs, right? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So shan hannity is going to tell them what they want to hear right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's going to be there's no warning flags on the hannity show. It's always an interesting exercise for me to to  tune between msnbc fox news and cnn  And get really three different views of the world completely different narratives completely different narratives  and I think I will do that on election eve or election night because  um, I can imagine  Do you think do you think though that?  I think there I think there's been enough information put out  Uh, it's been hammered home over the last few weeks  That we may not know the winner  on election night  Somebody may be ahead on election night, but because there are we've already had  50 of the total voting  For in 2016 has already happened  Early voting most states they can't count it until election, but you can't count it  So those votes will be counted after the in-person votes. So you'll get this flood of in-person votes, but that is  Probably no more than half the total vote. In fact likely less  So what so I think that we've been pre-bunked  Pretty thoroughly by yeah, I think people have been warned

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But then you have something that he wants to cut off counting on election night  Which of course he has no authority to do but he'll say that and so anything that happens past that will somehow be seen as fake

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is weird disinformation to say oh, uh, it's he said it's illegal to not have the results come in right away

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it's not in fact, it's it's before the telegraph, how do you think we did? Yeah, it's completely planned for by

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh the constitution it doesn't even  Require that the you don't need it from december 10th. Yeah, december 10th  so  Um  He's he yeah, so I I hope I would think that you know what's going to happen on election night

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you know what i'm dreading is  A couple things one  We're not going to know and so you have on-air people filling time with speculation and meaningless lather two  When the polls close there is a fact we just don't know it yet  Right and so all this talk about the horse race continuing about oh we're going to catch up more in miami  Better better get them more in fort lauderdale, right is is ridiculous. There's a fact that's just not known yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's all it is. It's going to remind us like it's an entertainment show a lot of the year 2000 right where  Was it was that the one where tim russer had the whiteboard he kept going florida florida florida florida  Yeah, and it turned out he was right  And it was a handful of votes in florida that decided the election but not till the supreme court got involved much later  And the recounts and the endless thing so we didn't know it we didn't know in 2000 for weeks, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How long did it take a long time? So just imagine that imagine that with all the  Hanging chads and all that stuff that everybody was in the rumors and conspiracy theories  So imagine that but with twitter and facebook, so that's why i'm bringing this up

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, that's the tech angle to this is where are you going to go in this modern age from in 2000?  Uh, it was it was hysterical harry mccracken  Uh tweeted maybe I can find it a picture of how we kept up with election of results in the year 2000  Which does 2000 sounds modern doesn't it sure does?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  would this be a good time to seek out some twitter lists like a black twitter list or  Um, I mean this would be a good time to have some lists ready. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is unlike 2016 is certainly unlike 2000  Uh, this is a uh, it's a unique moment  we're in and I do think that the internet is going to be a big player in all of this as are the  24-hour news channels. I think bankers absolutely right  Okay, I thought we should cover that I don't know what else to say about it it's just uh,  The next time you see us, we're either going to be happy or sad

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have you seen evidence of effective russian interference or any other nation state interference? There was the  Silly emails that the iranians sent saying we know you're a democrat, but you better vote for trump or we'll know  I mean there was that I don't know how effective that campaign was but have you have we seen any effective interference from any country?  Not really  It seems not really  It seems not  That's I guess it's hard to say this is where it'd be nice to say whether it's effective or not  This would be where it'd be really nice to see those ads on facebook that are  You know own you have such a narrow slice. They're very dark  Is there there's no way jeff to do that or is there now our facebook?  There's no facebook reporting tool on ad campaigns or anything like that. Well, there isn't political ads. Yeah, there is  So we could see I remember last time 2016  There were a lot of you know, the russian troll farm created a lot of ads  designed to  Confuse and upset and things like that. I wonder if that's happening now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's definitely has been happening. I mean they took down a big  Big coordinated inauthentic behavior network as they like to call it  That I think they said was directed from iran  but  Whether they're effective or not only facebook knows for sure right if there's no way to tell  And if they're as you said, they're their intention in many cases is just to sow  You know confusion and chaos. So did that happen? I mean, I know lots of people who are confused, but is that why I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're confused because they're confused life is confusing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Whoa, okay. So I just I just  I just don't know what to do. All right, so this says  It is paid for by donald trump  Jr for president inc. Yeah a picture of joe biden the worst possible person you can imagine  We cannot let the extreme left radical left take over vote early  And it's the worst picture you could imagine it just makes them look as ugly and old as you can imagine  Let's see now you kind of go in here  The lots of donald trump ads lots of find your fine early vote often  I think if you if you go to the facebook  Political ad database put in the united states and then I just put in the word voting  And  You can see lots of them a lot of them

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you know a lot of new stories in the last a few weeks about how the trump campaign has run  Low on funds. They pulled their ad tv ads out of  Florida but I often think when I see that here that doesn't mean they're not advertising on the much more efficient  Facebook that's where they they did so well in 2016. Yeah. And in fact, I think they're spending considerably more this time  Oh interesting  So not having tv ads in florida may not make any difference at all  May not yeah  So in fact, here's the ad spend tracker for the last week october 20th through 26  Uh biden has spent 8.7 million on this is facebook  Kamala harris 1 million donald trump 5.67 mike pence  Really a laggard here 200 not 29 000 dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Um, but by what's to advertise about mike pence?  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh  So that's interesting. So this is the spending tracker on  This is on the facebook ad library page  But that's spent by the campaigns, right? Not

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By packs or other people. Yeah, I think in that case on their behalf. Well, yeah, this is for that. This has been a stressful time

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yet jubilant time of year for my mother because i've mentioned before she's in ad sales and she loves it  Right, so of course with these campaigns spending a gazillion dollars the other clients that she works with they're  spending  Just this much. Hey, have you heard any?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  broadcast

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Broadcasts. Yeah, she's a saint claire right? She's happy days. Yeah. Yeah, she's she's loving it. I'm thinking she's gonna get me a coffee maker

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have you heard any political ads on podcasts?  Uh a couple times I have i'm asking for a friend  We got no requests at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  from from either side

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I've got a couple times. I have so you have on your podcast site. That's interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a you have any guess  You can't have asked this question, but do you have any guess what the political makeup is of the twin audience?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's actually surprisingly mixed I think we've chased away I think we've chased away all the trump voters  Yeah, it's my fault. Yeah, but early on it's certainly on this show, but I think early on it was uh, pretty evenly mixed  um  and uh  You know, I don't think tech has a political bias particularly so  Uh, it was it was depends on who you ask  Yeah, well, it was evenly mixed and then uh because uh, I have  Done a poor job of keeping my  political uh  As my political opinions to myself, I think i've chased away

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everybody who jeff hasn't chased away already. Yeah, I I I can't I can't help myself. Sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's funny. Say, you know, uh  I hear  I get a lot of emails from people say how dare you even talk about politics, but  It's kind of part of the equation these days you can't not when we start off the show with testimony before congress having an impact on technology

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I get where a lot of those audience members are coming from because they're used to hearing about the nuts and bolts and the bits  And bites and things of that nature, but right now in 2020 this  This tech is politicized whether we want to believe it or not. It's politicized. It's also uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Kind of a maturity in general in the I think in tech coverage because for a long time it was you know  They just want to hear about the latest phone or the gadget or whatever, but I think uh  As as tech works its way into the mainstream it impacts everything  And I think it would it would be a mistake for us to not talk about the impact of tech as well as you know  What's the latest gadget?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right even with the latest gadgets though  What's the latest iphone or whatever there's some sort of political implications regarding  Where that thing is manufactured versus where it's designed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, that's that's a reality. All right. Let's take a little break. There is other stuff to talk. I have some gadgets  We can we can actually talk  We'll talk about some gadgets in just a bit. No more no more political talk.

Thank you net suite for supporting this week in google  And thank you  For supporting us by going to that special address. That way they know you saw it here net suite  dot com slash  twig I was  Avoiding getting one of these remember remember we were talking about it because I didn't want I don't have a facebook account  And facebook was insisting that you make a real account  With real information that you actually use if you want to use the oculus quest and then there was a story  Actually came out of a release by by facebook that if you used your facebook account on more than one oculus device  You'd be violating terms of service and they'd yank you  Uh, they have updated this now. This was corrected on sunday  oculus, uh  Says that's not that's not true  You will be able to use two different  Uh oc I have a rift and a quest and it says you know, you can use both  Without getting your account deactivated. I mean it's one thing to say oh you can't do that  But another thing to actually ban you  And kill your account  Honestly  It's just it just gets worse and worse and it's good news that they clarified it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But you know, what would be better news?  What not tying facebook to these are these bits of hardware? Thank you great

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Especially right now with  The pressure they're under

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It seems like a I wonder if it's going to hurt them  I guess I guess everybody that they might buy that might buy a quest as a facebook again  But I don't and it's going to keep me from buying the quest too for sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're crying. I know they're crying. I know they can't they can't

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can't live with me can't live without me. I know how it is facebook  Facebook can't live with apple  Uh, like so many others, they're not going to launch their cloud game platform on ios  because of quote apple's arbitrary  policies  Microsoft's doing the same thing. Microsoft said we're going to do a web-based version of our gaming platform xcloud  Sometime next year gook  Facebook says yeah, we'll probably do the same thing  It's the only way you can do it. Otherwise, you know, you can't get in the app store  These don't look like games that you'd die to play but maybe your mom would I don't know  You know, they're they're kind of more like casual games but it is a cloud gaming service they're joining google and so many others

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What do you think is meant by the arbitrary policy the 30% cut or

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I don't think it's the 30% cut because so microsoft  They told microsoft with xcloud  The problem is they if apple doesn't want anybody to put like anything that looks anything like a store  Or an alternate app store online so microsoft which has xcloud has a lot of games  They said you can do that, but each game has to be a separate app  You can't have a picker  An xcloud picker that says what game do you want to play? That's nuts. I mean you'd steam  If yeah, they don't want steam or epic to have a store  But it but it but microsoft and i'm sure facebook's position is this is these are streaming games. This is like netflix  This would be like saying if you want stranger things on netflix  You have to have a stranger things app and and if you wanted to watch the office on netflix  You had to have an office app. That's nuts  It's just a streaming gaming service and I agree with them. They are arbitrary  And this is one of the things apple is being investigated for frankly  This is one of the antitrust complaints that the house had europe is investigating them right now for this as well, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just wait till they start a search engine

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the latest. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that's the latest

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  so I believe I saw a headline when someone said that uh, uh apple is looking at starting a search engine and it's  Probably going to be the worst thing to happen to apple users

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this came from the finance maps right right? Yeah, remember apple man  This came from the financial times with unnamed sources  So it actually ties back to  Again this house report one of the things they dinged google for is paying  Companies to have google search on the platform. It's estimated they pay apple seven between seven and twelve billion  dollars a year  To have it be the default search on ios sounds like a terrible monopolist taking advantage. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's just good competition  Well, no one else could do it obviously I offered to pay six billion and but they outbid me

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a picture of tim cook and sundar pachai. This was a three years ago  Uh eating a vietnamese food in palo alto together

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All these who picked up the check I love this

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All right, and there's probably neither one of them paid  No, who knows? I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Um, neither one of them paid but this was apparently when there was some  You know difficulty getting a deal between google and apple, you know, but but this is a lot of money for apple  This is the the lion's share of their services revenue  Uh, so they needed the money and google really needs those eyeballs  So they made a deal  They were uh, the restaurant business  The restaurant in case you're interested is was  You'd like to go there and enjoy the same vietnamese food is called tamarine  Tamarine in palo alto looks good. Looks good. Looks good

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's go  That's why I still think they got those meals for free

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's that's the sound tim cook made when when sundar pachai wrote a number on a piece of paper and slid it across the table  Oh  Just add a zero and another good. Yeah one more zero  Uh, I you know, I don't think if apple does a search engine it would be a google  We've talked about this on windows weekly. I don't think it'd be a google style  uh  Keyword search for web page even google's moving away from that now  When you do a google search half the time you get a knowledge graph you get the answer to your question  Apple knows that's really what people want especially because most of the time this will be voice-based  They want siri to say something and they don't want it to always be google. So  Right now apple cobbles together a bunch of services  um, you know wiki you'll get a wikipedia answer sometimes sometimes you'll get a google answer sometimes you'll get a  an answer from uh  Uh, oh, what is that wolfram alpha wolfram? Yeah. Yeah, so I think or quora. Yeah  So I think it's not unreasonable to think that apple is doing that but especially since they hired john gendron  You know who i'm talking about say your name again  John g john g we call him. Uh john g. Andrea  Uh the search guy from google went to apple  um  Like a year ago two years ago  He created meta web and freebase  He led google search and artificial intelligence joined apple as a senior executive in 2018  Senior vice president of machine learning and artificial intelligence strategy at apple. That was a big a big get

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  With all of that in place. Do you feel apple can pull this off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah  Yeah, I don't think it's like maps  I don't think it's like maps at all  maps required  A lot of real world data gathering driving cars around  They acquired mapping information from a bunch of companies cobbled it together. I think apple  It is more like machine learning and ai. I think apple  Can say look there's a lot of resources out there including google  But siri should give you the right answer  You know, what's the worst thing siri does? I don't know if you guys use I don't think any of you use iphones  But no, sir, but when you use siri the worst thing everybody who knows it as an iphone knows it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me see what I found on the web for you. Here's what I found on the internet. I found on the internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the worst google assistant does that. Yeah, that's the that's the wrong answer, right? Isn't that all right matthew?  That's what you go. It's incredibly infuriating. Yeah  I could have done that. Yeah, what what you want is an answer

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And what publishers get mad about is when they give you an answer. Yes, that's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because you know, it'll be interesting I think it's so imagine apple does do that. You've got this massive massive company  That that controls a huge proportion of the sort of mobile device  Base and and an app store and 30 percent and all that other stuff  And now they're launching a search engine. Is that good? Is that competitive?  Or is it going to be just another thing?  You know that they're going to control that's makes it anti-competitive

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and I also I should point out that this financial times report is  Kind of speculative. I don't know if I don't know how well let's

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's change that name. I'll change apple out  With samsung is this news if samsung was doing this, you know, yeah, well they have a lot of resources. They tried already, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  right xp

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Huawei probably is doing it. Yeah, they have to

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean there's other players out there with deep pockets and a lot of resources that  I just don't see why apple is making all of them the news  But I guess it's because they have a gazillion handsets out there. That's right. In fact, they just

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  According to one analyst crossed a billion active

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  phones one billion active and I think they have like  600 billion dollars in cash or something. Oh, they have a huge cash. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But see I see I think people think when they read that article  Oh, they're going to do a google clone and I don't think anybody's going to ever do a google clone. No, I think that's done  Right google owns that  Facebook has searched but it's based on your social graph

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's always been off and it's always and it's terrible. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Twitter maybe could do a better job than they're doing  They don't they put no energy in this. What would what would it next?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, okay, but so i've talked about about uh, samir aurora and sage  I think there's a next generation of search. What samir is working on is expert based networks. Yes  Um, I think that that's that's the that you don't you want everything you want everything in the world fine  Yeah, go to google. What's there right? But we're going to give you  Uh some sense of the best now how the hell you do that  Questions and you're gonna have ted cruz yelling at you when the new york post isn't including the best  But we'll cross that bridge when we come to it  But I think that there's there's a there's a next for everything there is on the net  This is the post I wrote today about totalitarianism and journalism  But for everything there's a next generation  Right what facebook and twitter do is help everybody speak and I celebrate that but it doesn't really help everybody listen  It doesn't tell you what's worth listening to  What facebook does is connect you with somebody you already know so you can share stuff  But it doesn't really create communities. Not really  Uh doesn't doesn't introduce us to strangers  There's a next generation of everything we see on the net waiting to happen  So does apple have the imagination to think what search could be?  I doubt it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  When you can you give me an example of this network you're talking, uh like network of experts

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  so, um, uh sage started with  um  Not maybe the best timing for this part of it, but they started with uh  Travel restaurants and hotels and destinations because it's a very set. Um, uh taxonomy of  entities, right you know, you know, that's a restaurant for sure then they started with a  a hundred  Handpicked people that they said these are our experts and then they went to the next  Network out from there and said who are they linking to who's in theirs?  And then out from there until they got to certain numbers where where you know  It's going to fall apart at a certain point  But they found they they could scale the quality of the information they were getting for these entities for these hotels restaurants resorts and so on  um  Really well by starting with a core set of experts  So I I talked to samir and I said well i've got a core set of of covid experts for you  You know, I wish you'd do the same thing there where I have in right there in my lower third  um 600 some epidemiologists virologists, etc  Um, you could imagine starting there with the people you trust and then see what the network comes out from there  Then what do you come back with when you come back with the things that they're writing that they're linking to  Um that they say now what's what samir is doing with sage is he's also building a structure for creators  To create homes for themselves on the net  Which gives them something nice to do and gives them lots of different business models for that  But it also gives them an opportunity for them to find a place to say  Oh, i'm an expert and I like this and this and this and this  So it's interesting if you get past something that has a  Travel has a clear set of entities medicine has a clear set of credentials  You get into other areas. What is expertise being in politics?  It ain't political reporters. I'll tell you that for damn sure  um  What does expertise mean in technology?  Well, maybe you could you could say who really knows their stuff. I don't know or it could be fact-based eliminate the opinions

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean  Really what google does is search for web pages right now. Yeah  Obviously, that's not something you're going to try to beat  But I think it's often the case especially with voice assistants that you are not searching for a webpage  Because there's nothing to click you're searching for an answer answers and that doesn't mean I guess you could say  You know, what's the best smartphone?  But I don't think that's a great  I think that's so  Objective that I just don't I don't know if that's a great what happens if I ask google that  Well, they probably send so you do some sort of cutesy thing with tech radar best phones in the u.s  T3 best phones 20 and 20 right so they anybody who know looks at that goes well. Yeah, that's somebody's opinion  That's not the best phone. So I don't wouldn't expect apple to put a lot of energy into that. But if you said what?  What's the what is the spec for?  You know, what processor does a phone use or how much is the iphone or how much is a pixel 5?  That's the kind of thing  People that you can give a concrete answer to I would expect that frankly  That's what I would want siri to give me that's always what we want when we ask siri something

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  Anything else we missed the chat room is is nominating. Thank you scooter x  This story I bought some time ago a great  Dash cam and had a camera facing me and a camera facing out  It had all these nice services a little more expensive, but it came with built-in cellular service. It was called the owl  cam and I told everybody to get it and then  They just folded at the beginning of the year. I think because of covid but they just disappeared  From the face of the earth. They got purchased  by a company called zirgo technologies  Which sounds like a fake legit  Sounds like they kind of like the evil villain in a flash gordon movie  zirgo  Which is the leading provider of industrial iot solutions?  Apparently is bringing the owl  cam back  Uh the the company called call pass which does gps and asset tracking integration says we're taking over the owl cam  brand from zirgo  and um if now I have an owl cam  I'm hoping  I'm hoping that uh, this will it will suddenly come to life again  Um, yeah, they said uh, approximately 40 of existing owl cam owners have already purchased our new owl cam plus plan  I'm going to get online and do it  Uh, you have to pay for your lte service now, but that makes sense. That's one of the reasons they went out of business  the free lte  We're committed to providing the best possible continuity of service and experience that we can  frankly  Jason ashton ceo of cal pass said most people don't care who's in charge. They just want the damn thing to work  Uh, yeah  Yeah, so yeah, so I will um  And zirgo is going to continue making the owl cam  So if you go to owl cam  Dot com you can revive  your owl cam

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yay, and there's no like nsa back doors in there or anything. Oh who cares? It's just the street and me

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was fun  One of the things I liked about it is you could communicate with it from anywhere so I could scare people who are driving my car  I could say hey  And then I have a great video of them crashing so  That was lots of fun  So yeah, that's how you prank I hope I didn't I might have you know what?  Do you remember seeing it at the last leo's garage sale aunt, I think I put it on the table

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think that's why it sounded familiar to me. I think I'm like, did you did you snag it?  I did not but when you said owl cam I was like, why does this sound familiar?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Burke did you snag the owl cam? Who got the owl cam?  It was not there says Burke. So maybe I saved it. Maybe I had high hopes  That someday it would be reactivated  Anything else  Anything else? I think it's a good time for us to do our last ad and get you guys ready  for your picks  of the  week  Our show today brought to you by wasabi hot cloud storage not the green ball next to your sushi. That's wasabi  Uh horse radish. This is wasabi hot cloud storage spelled the same but it's a very different thing  It is cloud but it's cloud done right. It's one fifth the cost of amazon's s3  Significantly, it's so affordable sign it's faster than s3 uses the s3 api, but because it's so affordable  It's actually less expensive than buying hard drives on premises  In fact wasabi so affordable you can you can store data in their cloud for less than just the annual maintenance fees  On the same amount of on-prem storage, that's amazing and I have to say it is safer  It is better in every way than on-prem storage  So if you're a company that's generating data on a consistent basis like we are like a lot of companies are  Don't buy more hard drives. Don't buy storage as uh sans don't buy don't buy nases just  Check out wasabi 11 nines of durability  That means on average you you might lose one file every  649,000 years check back with me in 649,000 years  Let me know because I don't think you're gonna lose any data because here's what they do  They have active integrity checking where all the objects you store on wasabi are checked every 90 days at least  They're hosted in premier tier four data center facilities that are not only highly secure. They're fully redundant  So if at any time any data seems like it's been changed  They've got a copy on another tier four center they can get it and your data is secure  It's encrypted by default  Even if you don't specify it because of course that's the right way to do things  They follow all the industry's best security models and design practices access control mechanisms like bucket policies and access control lists  My favorite part is you can designate data as immutable  That means it cannot be erased or altered not by ransomware not by fumble fingered employees  Not by you  You have to go through jump through some hoops to modify it  That means you could put your data on on wasabi and know that it's secure and safe and will not be encrypted  By malware will you know? I mean, this is awesome. HIPAA FINRA  CJIS compliant now. Come on. Tell me that's better in every respect than on-prem storage  And you know while the cost is very low. I can make it even more affordable. You could pay as you go  A lot of people do that  But they also offer something called reserved capacity storage  If you know ahead of time as most people do we're going to need this much storage over the next few years  You can buy or reserve capacity ahead of time in one three or five year increments. You save more the  More capacity and the longer the term  So you can bring the cost down even lower and wasabi unlike s3 never charges for egress  They have the s3 api completely compatible, but they don't charge for api requests. They don't have all those crazy storage tiers. It's just  highly secure disruptive technology that's turning the industry on its ears  Storage, it's 80 cheaper and up to six times faster than the industry leader. You look just do yourself a favor  If you're shopping around calculate the savings for yourself  You can actually bang on it for a while. See if it works with all your s3 compatible tools  It will start a free trial of storage for a month go to wasabi.com  Click the free trial link and enter the code twit. That way they know you're here to hear. Okay  W a s a b i wasabi.com offer code twit  Wasabi is just amazing. If you know, you're going to be using hard drives. Don't buy more  Just buy wasabi  Tell the boss wasabi.com slash twit boss. We're going to save you big time

My number is 92 and it is a shout out to the awesome mr. Lewis hamilton  I'm not going to talk sports ball, but I am going to talk sports just briefly  Mr. Leonard  Lewis hamilton now has the record for most victories in formula one  passing uh, michael schumacher  I used to watch f1 back in the late 90s and then I just sort of got out of it and  Recently started picking it back up again after chatting with mr. Ian thompson twit guest and uh,  and uh some some other folks and  Just watching lewis hamilton. It's been great to see  His uh superior performance on the track and he is now the all-time leader in victories  But it also made me think about some other things if you look at the second link there  He was uh  You know people didn't particularly care for the fact that he now has the record and has some snide comments and  Then of course they come back and say I apologize for saying that yada yada yada. He's got the best car  So that's why he won all the races when in actuality  There's a couple other mercedes cars out there in the same tracks just as he is but he's still winning the races  So why not just give that man his credit when credit is due.
