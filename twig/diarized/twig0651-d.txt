Transcript:  I went to one once.  A new diversity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hello, Jeffrey.  Hello.  Wow.  What happened to your the color is good now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's it's some kind of weird thing with the stars.  I don't know what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you're I shouldn't say good.  Your room is great.  You have the pallor of a cadaver, but I think that's normal.  Yeah, it is.  Yeah.  OK.  But the room looks perfect.  The light, you know, I think it's because blue light outside the windows is snowing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I used I put the blue light on the on the ring.  Yeah, yeah.  It looks good.  I like it.  If I turn that off, what happens here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's just see.  Let's just see.  Nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely nothing.  Absolutely nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The ring light is not doing anything, Mr.  Influencer.  Also with us.  He doesn't need a ring light.  He's beautiful.  All on his own.  Mr.  He is indeed.  Ant Pruitt.  He's got the light of the sun as his hair light, which is kind of ironic.  Oh, partly TV slash op.  That's right.  Hello.  How you doing?  Oh, good to see you.  And Stacey is the day off, but we are thrilled to get Kathy Gellis back in house.  She is a pro professional lawyer and geek covering tech, international  law, civil liberties and their convergence at CG count cell dot com.  Also a tech dirt contributor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Lawyer and geek is redundant.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Aren't all geeks lawyers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Depends on the lawyer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you know lawyers are geeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you know, I think this is a, I think this is a Venn diagram.  There's overlap, but, but there's also people who are in one circle and not the other.  Is a geek a wonk?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, not necessarily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I don't think so.  I mean, I think at this point, geek implies technology, which not all lawyers, even if  they're geeky about the law, aren't necessarily tech focused.  And some lawyers aren't even geeky about the law.  Like they just do their job and they don't really care how it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The word geek used to be a real insult.  In fact, if you see, if you ever get a chance, I'm not sure I recommend it, but  Guillermo del Toro's new movie, Nightmare Alley is about a carny and the role of  the geek is prominent in the, in the movie and it will take, it will ruin your  appetite for the word geek.  I can tell you that right now.  Um, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I prefer to think that I was just paid a compliment and let's leave it at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's leave it at that.  Yes.  You have a, you do have a violin behind you.  Are you going to play that for us later?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We haven't tested the audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  You, you could break all of our screens.  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I don't.  I mean, I was afraid you wouldn't be able to hear it.  Not that you would suffer from it.  I avoided that implication.  Thank you very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See how quick we turn here, Kathy, just auto-dive.  You made me feel welcome up until like two minutes into the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't go away.  So Google has come up.  Yes.  With another way to protect its users privacy.  Who would have thought they're in that business, but they are, uh, privacy  sandbox, uh, and it's now been, uh, apparently cleared by the UK regulator.  So remember, we have to go back through the backstory on this.  Uh, last year they said, we're going to phase out third party cookies.  Uh, and they mentioned flock, which then was a non-starter.  Now they're onto something else called topics, but the whole idea is to replace  third party cookies with a bunch of new standards called the privacy sandbox.  And the UK competition regulator, these competition and markets authority has  formally accepted Google's commitments about how it's going to develop the new  standards so they don't harm competition or unfairly benefit the, uh, the goog.  So it's not, which is funny because Google doesn't even know.  I don't think anybody knows what privacy sandbox is as, as  the regulator says it will continue to supervise Google to make sure that  it does the right thing.  Uh, this story from, um, seeking alpha, which is a business, you know, a stock  website, Google is building its privacy sandbox on the Android mobile operating  system and move the follows Apple and cutting back ad tracking on smartphones.  And, uh, seeking alpha mentions this because it's hurting a number of social  media companies, including meta, which fell 3% again this week, snap.  3.4% Pinterest down a percent Twitter, the biggest loss 3.6%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And remember we have a story.  I think it was last week that publishers, uh, I think it was spring or it was,  yeah, it was Germany attacking, uh, Google and attacking cookies.  Now suddenly as they see cookies going away and, and Google and Apple  advantage in different ways, they're screaming, no, don't kill our cookies.  That'd be wrong.  Cause they need them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, big ad tech companies also dropped significantly.  Magnite app, lovin app, lovin pubmatic, digital invest $2 billion in app.  A P P pub.  It was down 9% at the close of market.  Uh, pubmatic digital turbine iron source.  I think one reason that, uh, for that drop is a big transition in the ad tech market.  Spotify just bought two really big players in my business and podcasting  to, to, uh, uh, trackers that we actually use chartable and pod sites.  Spotify is basically swooping up the entire podcast.  Hello.  Anti-trust.  I don't, I think nobody thinks podcasting is such a big deal.  Right.  Who cares?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or it's taking over the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I think the, well, the issue that Dexter has raised is.  The privatization of media that had a public protocol is probably not the  way to go for any number of reasons.  Like, like the idea that anybody could produce a certain form of media, which  was in principle accessible to anybody was a good idea.  And when it goes into gated gardens, then it's not as available that we're not  sharing it, there's exclusivity and it's not really about getting the communication  out to people.  So we get the discourse on the messaging and sharing things.  And that's a loss.  Like overall, it's a loss, even though it's a win for that particular company  that can lock up everything, but that's not good for culture and society and,  and future speakers who can't get those deals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm curious, uh, for those of you who follow the, followed the blogosphere,  did blogs go through that kind of thing?  Uh, where, you know, cause that's what blogs were initially.  They were completely independent.  Anybody can start a block.  Anybody could still start a blog.  There was some consolidation.  Was there also a consolidation in the metrics in the advertising side?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the worst thing that happened to blogs was Google closing Google reader  because Google reader, when it came on the scene, obliterated some other readers  that were free and available and getting built up around them as projects.  It killed those.  And then when they closed it down, how our blogs via RSS is a fabulous way  of doing internet communications.  We wouldn't really need these private platforms and social media platforms.  If we actually had these open protocols where you can stylize them yourself and  get whatever you want and put it together and you just need a tool to do that.  And they killed everybody else's tools and then they killed their own tool.  So then we're in a world where there's no tools.  So therefore the open protocol is no longer useful.  And everybody had to go to a private platform if they wanted to do  that kind of communication.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it's interesting as RSS does live on.  That's how podcasts are distributed.  And that's the open platform that you were talking about, Kathy, for podcasting.  And that's exactly what Spotify is trying to, I don't want to say kill,  but trying to own basically.  And when somebody like Joe Rogan goes exclusive to Spotify,  essentially they kill the RSS feed.  You have to have a Spotify app to listen to Joe Rogan.  And, you know, we're very proudly RSS based and want to continue to do that  because it means the largest number of people can hear what we do.  But we're ad-based.  And so what's interesting is that Spotify is going after us in the other direction,  because if they can eat up all the ad platforms.  So they bought Megaphone, which is the primary,  one of the biggest companies for direct ad insertion where  and we use it.  Now they're buying up the companies that do ad metrics.  You know, there's no Nielsen for podcasting.  So chartable and pod sites are used by advertisers and podcasters  to demonstrate effectiveness of advertising.  If they own that, pretty soon they're eating you at both ends.  You know, the RSS becomes less and less valuable and your ability to monetize.  The only reason you can do RSS is because you can monetize.  If that gets shrunk away, pretty soon Spotify.  And I think if people love podcasts  and I presume anybody who listens to our shows loves podcasts,  they should be concerned about this because it is a great  democratic medium that's open to all.  It's freely distributed.  Nobody owns.  But there are big companies like I heart, like Spotify,  Apple, I would guess.  Amazon's buying Amazon just bought just to deal with Guy Raz  to own, you know, Wonder is going to own his.  I built this podcast.  So this you're seeing this more and more and more and more.  And by the way, which is like, if anybody wants to write me a big check,  I'll take it. But.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's been nice being on your show.  It's a bad. It's a bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a bad trend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you were trying to get in.  But with that said, sir.  OK, so that's Joe Rogan and maybe four other people that have been  bought into these different platforms.  What's the timetable and how much money is it?  How much money is it going to take for this to be a lot more of a locked in process?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's what I'm saying. And if they if they don't have to buy podcasts,  if they own their ability to monetize, if advertisers have to go to Spotify  to buy an ad, it doesn't they don't need to own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is Google's model with advertising.  Google did that with all of advertising.  Spotify is doing it with audio.  You still have 43 percent, supposedly, of all websites are served by WordPress.  You have an openness.  It's not WordPress.  It's not the hosting that mattered.  I think Leo's point is exactly the point that Moxie made a few weeks ago  about Web 3 that supposedly centralizes it.  It doesn't. There's one or two centralize.  Eyes of the needle you got to go through that are centralized.  The whole thing is de facto centralized. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But wow. But we should point out  blogs still exist and people still do blogs.  RSS readers still exist.  There are, you know, I mean, the independent blog is.  Look at Tech Dirt.  They still exist.  I just think I want to go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I don't want to poo poo that it does exist, but it's  I don't know the invest people.  I don't think in general think about consuming web content through neutral tools.  It does. We talked about we don't use browsers anymore.  I don't think people think of it as necessarily.  They're not either aware of the tool or they don't have the tool  because it takes a certain level of aforementioned geekiness  to be able to to know what you're doing.  Yeah, I feel like people have come to the idea that the  the gateway to the Internet is one of these privatized services  that's serving you up the world in its algorithmically chosen way.  And people don't realize that there's an Internet beyond that,  which is a problem for any number of reasons.  A, it's not true. B, it's limited.  And C, it's a red flag to the policymakers who are like,  well, these privatized platforms are terrible.  So therefore we need to obliterate them.  And we're going to pull the rods out of the Internet policy that enables them.  But it also takes down the rest of the Internet, too,  which nobody seems to remember actually exists.  It's we we've become centralized.  I think by accident, I do think that like the Google reader  loss was significant because it was a free, widely available tool.  And it didn't require a ton of geekiness.  And if everyone's using it, then there's vernacular around it.  So everybody knows to use it.  And your your neighbor can show you how you and people can figure it out.  We stopped making that investment.  So now if you want to do and you want a reader,  I don't even know what reader I would use, but I could, OK, figure it out.  But I'm not sure everybody could.  But people can figure out how to log into Facebook and start getting content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dave Weiner, who created RSS, is apparently watching and says there are  we've got to get you on, Dave.  Oh, yes, please.  There are more blogs today than there ever were.  But I'm sure Dave, like everybody else, bemoans the loss of Google Reader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wonder how people read the blogs, because like people, yes, they read Tector.  And I know some people read Tector through RSS, but I'm not entirely sure  that that's the only way that essentially.  And this came up in other contexts.  People may go to regular  URL links that they just happen to browse to via some other mechanism  or they find it or they're just pulling up Tector.com on their browser page

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  every day to see what's up there anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And obsessively reloading it to see how many posts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, in some ways, what's taken the place of Reader is Twitter.  Yeah, yes, but they're in is.  Go ahead, go ahead, Kathy, finish your sentence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, that that may be the problem.  Yeah, Reader got replaced by Twitter,  but that's not exactly the same sort of tool.  That's all all of a sudden a much more.  Somebody's done some curation, whether it's the people that you're following.  It's people or Twitter itself.  As opposed to an RSS reader is you've just told the browser,  check these sites and when there's something new, show it to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, as Dave would say, it's not a true river.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I yeah, his by the way, his his his blogging  platform is fantastic scripting dot com.  He he writes many posts a day.  In a very traditional kind of old school blogging style.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He of course, David vetted tremendous numbers of things.  But one of the things he did at scripting, I think they will correct me.  I'm wrong.  But I know that J.  Rosen was was about this, about this, too, was to be able to permalink  to a paragraph, to a thought by which medium had for a little while.  And then and then and then got rid of that you could comment on that.  There's all kinds of thoughts like that.  There's there's a lot of advancement left to be had in blogs and in distribution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That idea is actually ringing a bell with Ted Nelson is deemed the father of HTML.  But the HTML we got is different than the HTML he had imagined, where he really  sort of wanted a dynamic thing with the the the words in one place were  inherently connected to the words in some place else.  And if you changed one, it reflected elsewhere or it was much it was more.  I'm not quite sure how it worked, although in theory there was a way, but it was  something supposed to be much more dynamic and linked as opposed to just a  pure markup language was just that static, essentially, which is what HTML  actually the one we got actually is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to blogs will find a way, though.  I mean, I think the human spirit and creativity is like water.  And so now we've got mail news, newsletters, you know, mailing lists.  We've got Twitter and there are still I use and I've mentioned it before.  I'll mention it again because they seem to be really improving their product a lot.  Sumi dot news, S-U-M-I dot news is an RSS reader web based entirely.  Yeah, you mentioned them before.  Yeah, it's pretty cool.  And I use it.  That is nice. Yeah, they've gotten more and more  sophisticated in terms of of what they can do.  I pay twenty two bucks.  I think you can use it for free for up to five feet, but I try twenty two bucks a year,  which is, I think, a reasonable price.  And it is my it's how I do news gathering now  because I'll go through all of the sources.  This is by source.  And then there's another way you can look at it as a as a stream,  a chronological stream yesterday.  You can do it by topic.  You can do it by day.  I think they've done a nice job.  And this is I think it's different than a Google reader,  maybe a little more usable than Google reader.  I've made the text very big.  This is what it looks like.  If you're having to pay, though, is a significant decision.  You can take it out of dark mode.  Don't worry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The having to pay, however, is a significant difference from Google.  I agree. I agree.  I will not pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But notice the free version went away.  So maybe maybe that's part of the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, part of my point was Google reader came,  drove away anybody else's potentially.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then went out of business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I agree. And then went out of business, which was that that two step was really devastating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Thank you, Google.  Sumi dot what? Sumi.  S-U-M-I dot N-E-W-S.  Sounds like something you'd say to a lawyer.  So sue me. I don't know who does it.  I don't know where they came from.  I just found it one day, probably saw something on Hacker News.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they're good at just never say that to a lawyer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I remember in the early days of the Macintosh, it's beep sound was called so sue me.  And I always wondered, why do they say that?  Why? Why?  That was a terrible beep sound, by the way.  And we're going to get Kevin Marks on in the near future.  And of course, he is a big proponent of the Indie Web, which is the idea of promoting.  And this is super geeky.  You can't do this unless you're fairly sophisticated.  But promoting websites that, you know, link to each other,  that are open, that are connected, that, you know, you own your own content and all  all of that stuff, you know, which which Dave also centralized basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And, you know, Jeff knows I'm a big proponent of this.  And, you know, I really like the idea,  but it hasn't exactly taken the world by storm.  But that's why I run in Mastodon instance instead of Twitter and so forth.  I just recently tied Mastodon.  This actually worked out really well into my own Indie Web style blog  so that when people want to make a comment, they do it on Mastodon.  And it becomes part of Mastodon, but also part of the the blog.  And I like doing it this way because then there's a conversation in two places  and it's not Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that was the value of blogs to me was when someone  the most valuable interaction to me was when somebody used their blog space  to link to and say something about what I said on my blog space was fine.  Leave a comment was fine to have a track back.  Remember, Tectorati?  Yeah, that was all great.  I was fine to then be quoted and linked to on social media.  But that blog to blog communication to me is what taught me  entirely different view of media in the first place after 9-11.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there's a track back has been replaced by something called Web mentions,  which is an Indie Web thing, which is actually really, really cool.  Web mentions are very similar to trackbacks.  You'll feel familiar.  So somebody mentions you in their blog.  It goes back into your blog.  And it's a way of creating a kind of decentralized, federated  network of that conversation that's independent.  Exactly. And it's independent of the of big companies.  But all of this feels like it's underground.  It's subversive. It's not where  all of the stuff is all the stuff's happening at Spotify and Twitter and Facebook.  That's what the normal people are aware of.  The masses are aware of.  In some ways, I don't I don't even mind it a little.  That's a little twee of me.  But just the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you're trying to get away from the masses, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I kind of like the idea of this.  The whole poloi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the whole poloi.  I want a bespoke website.  I like the the tagline of my website is right like nobody's reading,  which is unfortunately true, but it  but it's kind of I like, you know, when blogs were fun and,  you know, all of this stuff was much more fun when it was a  just a bunch of geeks and, you know, small group of people.  I don't know how you make something a mass market.  That's the next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, because you don't want a mass market. Right.  That's what the Internet killed is mass.  Mass is a century old concept brought on by the industrialization of media  before the line of type. Watch out.  My book proposals out there.  Here it comes. And  I would get to Gutenberg.  We can get there very quickly if you like, or it could be more painful.  I know it's slowly  before the industrialization of media.  The average circulation of a daily newspaper in the United States was 4000.  Right. Every circulation of everything was small.  That's the way media were, plural.  And and industrialization is what changed that and brought the mass on.  No. So the goal now is to have the mass.  The goal. You can't have everything.  You do want to be a tree.  You do want to talk to people who are relevant to you and authoritative  to you and interesting to you.  And so I feel guilty about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, you shouldn't. You shouldn't.  OK, that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just don't insult everybody in the process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Esoteric media is fine.  Indie media is fine.  And but I don't think it follows that we have to be afraid of the mass.  Sometimes you do want everyone watching the Super Bowl and talking about it.  Sometimes you do want common moments of culture.  I don't think the fact that  individual scattered media can essentially group up attention is inherently bad,  except when it turns out it's eaten all the independent stuff  because we've oriented our world around the mass and so heavily favored it  that now it's completely trumping and driving away the independent,  which I think is the tipping point where we are.  Because Leo said something about blogs will win out.  And while I agree with the idea that people will keep speaking  as long as they have the ability to speak, I think we are in a regulatory world  increasingly where blogs will not get to win out.  The public protocols will not get to win out because they're going to get  obliterated by everybody reacting to the mass stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree with you about the unintended centralization of everything.  And it's probably not this particular audience that gets this.  But Mr.  Laporte, think about the folks that call into the tech guy every weekend  and think about just your general crowd.  And you say, what browser do you use and how many times there was a pause after?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't even. You're right.  They don't even know browser. What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Even with my even with my my children, you know, I'll say, hey, check the browser  or even Queen Perot, I've said, check the browser.  And they're like, the what?  It's all they know is either this app or that app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, it's the Internet.  I don't know how I got there.  And I agree with you.  There ought to be.  Mass market events like the Super Bowl, I agree with that, Kathy,  and there can also be smaller social groups.  And we are not I don't know what the if the Dunbar number is accurate or not,  but we're not meant to have massive social networks.  We're meant to have a small group of people that we know  and we communicate with.  It's bigger now than it ever was.  Our tribe, it could be hundreds of thousands.  Thanks to things like Twitter.  But I think it's more satisfying somehow if it's a smaller group.  So this is this is where I quote Andre Brock Jr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  in his book, Distributed Blackness, which I mentioned on the show before,  which is a brilliant view of black Twitter.  And it's paired with, in my mind, an earlier book called Black Software  by Charlton McElwain from NYU.  McElwain went through a lot of the early efforts to have community  space for black culture online and how a lot of them got  co-opted by companies like AOL and so on.  And then along comes Twitter and Andre Brock's telling.  And Leo, I did the exact same thing where my first thought was,  well, Black Lives Matter brought everything to the mass, that's success.  And Andre in his book and then in conversation said, no, you're wrong.  The goal is not to talk to everybody.  The goal is not to be out there observed by everybody.  The goal is for me to have a space in which I'm comfortable  and I can have my own joy and my own language.  And he uses a wonderful word, jouissance, that there's a jouissance  in the Twitter that he lives in.  And his goal is not the goal of mass media to be with everybody.  And just to be contrarian, because usually that's Leo's role,  but I'll take it on for a second.  Oh, yeah, sure. You're Mr. Agreeable.  Go ahead. Yeah, I am. I am.  But it's because football is a mass medium that we see in it.  The damage to the players, the structural racism that's on the floor right now,  the potential for cheating and horrible ethical things.  The mass is also a seduction of corruption that has to be watched carefully, I think.  Maybe this is all reaction to the industrialized media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, maybe we're kind of cravings.  It's kind of funny.  By the way, I think that's a great point.  It's kind of funny.  By the way, I want to thank the chat room.  They tell me that the creator of Sumi.News is Alex Mengoya,  M-I-N-G-O-I-A, who has 53 followers on Twitter.  Outstanding.  He has embraced the jouissance of the small, intimate Twitter group.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I don't know why I'm fighting this pretense.  If being obscure is like a sign of success, I am the most successful person ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, I'm running a close second then, Miss Kathy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ne-Yo used to be the second most popular person on Twitter.  Number one, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was number one before Ashton Kutcher came along.  Yeah, but I only had 5,000 followers.  It wasn't hard to be number one until the celebrities showed up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Weren't those the nice days? You liked Twitter, right?  They were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And in fact, you know, the nice days, I think of Pounce and I think of Path  and I think of all of these small social networks.  Sometimes, I don't know, getting big, getting industrial sizes is the death now,  which is good because our audience is shrinking.  So we're fitting right in.  I mean, I think part of the problem is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Our audience is shrinking, it's becoming more intimate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I come from mass media.  I come from mass media and I never really was fully comfortable with mass media.  I like that intimate feeling, honestly.  I think it's one of the reasons radio still and podcasts still exist  is because they feel much more intimate.  Even if there's...  You don't know how many people are listening,  but you feel like you have an intimate connection with the person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't want to poo poo the idea because I don't disagree that there's value in it.  But I also think that there's value in having national conversation,  conversation where the community that you're tied to is bigger  than just a small group of esoteric interests.  You want to make sure also that we don't become a completely siloized society  where only like...  Laws, like legal blogs.  I mean, that's a really interesting phenomenon.  I was a legal blogger.  I am still a legal blogger.  So for years and years and years.  And lawyers can talk to lawyers with this medium.  But the real interesting thing is when lawyers can talk to non-lawyers  and we're explaining and demystifying what's going on in our silos  so that other people can know because other people need to know  this is law that affects everyone's lives.  So the more esoteric our channels are,  the less likely we're going to be able to share any of our thoughts or insights  or anything that other people need to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or the medieval's advocate again.  Put it on my Leo hat.  But I think that when people try to perform for a mass  and try to get all kinds of traffic,  we end up in cats and Kardashians lands.  They're not real.  If people are in their own communities and feel comfortable there  and talking to people who have shared experience and interest,  pardon me, and need and circumstance,  then the question is how do you build bridges among those various communities,  among those various groups?  Not to get up to a mass, but to make strangers less strange,  to connect, to understand, to listen.  That's the challenge for the next generation of the internet, I think.  It is a paradox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's built to speak, not to listen.  It's a paradox because there's bad value in both.  They sometimes say the most important politics is local.  Clearly, that's the case.  And yet we do have national and even global issues  that we need to solve nationally and globally,  and we need to discuss nationally and globally.  But I am reminded of the Planters Mixed Nuts Super Bowl commercial  where the debate is over whether you should eat them one at a time or not.  And this is the conclusion.  The nation is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Who knew America would tear itself apart over a relatively minor difference of opinion?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And there you go.  I mean, even Planters Nuts is mocking us  because we can't agree on anything.  I think it's a paradox.  I can live with it being a paradox.  Cathy, you're right.  We need mass action.  But at the same time, I think we'd agree,  what's most satisfying as humans is something on a smaller scale.  That's why we do this on a small scale, the four of us.  That's why no one listens to this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm so like... I was feeling so grateful that you invited me.  Like, at last my voice will be surrounded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's all relative, Cathy.  It's all relative, you know.  Well...  What a bunch of downers.  You know, sometimes it surprises me when I see cable news numbers.  Which, what is it, Jeff?  It's like a couple hundred thousand on a very successful cable news show.  You know, when you think everybody's watching.  A couple of hundred thousand.  You know, we get that many listeners on many of our podcasts.  So it's very... It's hard to know.  Numbers are funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I'll give you one of my numbers for this week.  The top 25 US newspapers in print.  Top 25.  Total circulation.  You want to guess what it is before you look?  Top 25.  I'm all added up.  How many papers do the top 25 newspapers sell?  Oh, it's got to be 20 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  15 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  This is just dangerously close to all that ancillary copyright stuff.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We can go on for hours.  Ant, what's your guess?  Timber B?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was going to go a low number.  I was going to go more like 400,000 or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no. It's 25 newspapers.  No, no, no, no.  25 newspapers.  Yeah, it's got to be...  I'm going to estimate half a million each.  12 and a half million.  Okay.  3.1 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, it's a lot smaller than that.  And People Magazine, which is circulation has basically not changed  that I know of in the last 10, 15 years as far as I know.  Its circulation is 3.5 million.  So People Magazine is bigger than all of the top in print.  Yeah.  Than all of the top 25 magazines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you want to know how many people watched a QR code bounce from corner to corner for 60 seconds on the Super Bowl?  You want to know how many people?  Hypnotized.  112 million people watched the Super Bowl.  There, Kathy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's your mask wasting their time.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, except I was not part of this mass because I couldn't watch the Super Bowl because I don't have cable.  I don't have an antenna and they killed off low cast.  So I didn't get to be part of the public conversation, even though the public conversation was happening over public airwaves.  This is not good policy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, wow.  That's an excellent point.  That's an excellent point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have tech dirt posts along these lines.  Basically, I don't understand how these plaintiffs are networks that have spectrum licenses and are putting out programming over the spectrum.  But they've become so ravenous for the what has essentially been concocted to pay them to be retransmitted.  They want that money more than they actually want the advertising money from over the air broadcast.  And so the law is now tipping in the favor of creating like a weird form of copyright for programming, which is not something doctrinally pure.  And the consequences are anybody who's tried to provide a rent and then tennis service has been blown out of the water with species copyright claims.  I mean, the courts think they're not species, but doctrinally, they're terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And by the way, they still get the advertising revenue.  Don't think they're giving up much advertising revenue.  They get both.  I'm not entirely sure how happy their advertisers are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're double dipping, but I don't know if their advertisers quite realize how hostile it is.  Like if you're buying a Super Bowl ad, like it was interesting.  I saw somebody talk about this.  Oh, Alan Alda was talking about what a Super Bowl ad in 1982 cost for like how many for 30 seconds of 30 seconds.  He put it as airtime and he was like, oh, 30 seconds.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And he he said it was like $430,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then he said that the kiss that he had with hot lips was longer than 30 seconds.  They called it the $430,000.  And then he was joking like now it's one point two million dollars.  You know, I'm not quite sure I'm up for it, but I'm willing to try.  And so that was essentially his tweet somewhere along the line.  But he he pointed as airtime.  Advertisers thought they were buying airtime.  That's even the word they use.  I can't see their ads.  How can I watch the ads?  And now I think we're in this point that if you don't want your spectrum to be received by the public,  spectrum is a public resource that the public should be able to benefit from without having to make a capital investment.  And if you don't want to give them that programming, which is why we licensed it, then give it back.  You can just be all the time, but don't hoard this public resource that the public can't benefit from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree with you 100 percent.  I don't think we're ever going to see a change, but I agree with you 100 percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's also why I think Musk carry is bad law.  Yeah, they already got the benefit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Having said that, and despite the fact that, Cathy, you weren't able to watch it,  the Coinbase QR Super Bowl ad, which cost them not $400,000, not $1.2 million,  but $14 million for 60 seconds on the Super Bowl, was apparently extremely successful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People wouldn't know what to do with QR codes had it not been for the pandemic, I would predict.  But I think that made sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The bouncing QR code, which was really basically an old school screensaver with a QR code,  which I thought my stream was broken.  Right, John?  We're sitting here.  We're doing Twitter at the time and there's a bouncing QR code.  I think, oh, we lost our signal.  Google's trying to tell us something, which I'm sure a lot of people at home thought.  A lot of people thought that.  It was so popular, it crashed the app.  It's widely agreed by advertising experts and people doing the metrics that it was well worth the $15 million  or $14 million that they spent for that ad.  They got a lot of attention.  Can anybody remember?  I mean, I remember the QR code.  I had to do a Google search to remember who the advertiser was.  Go ahead, Kathy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I feel like we need to do a public service announcement, which all my cybersecurity friends  were up in arms after this commercial.  Do not scan unknown QR cards.  Let us tell our listeners, do not do that.  And the fact that we just spent $14 million teaching people to scan unknown QR cards  may not have been money well spent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's fair to say that if it is on network television, it's probably safe to scan it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But Kathy's point is still right, is that then you get in the habit of doing it anywhere.  I don't know. Did anyone even vet it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sure somebody vetted it.  And by the way, I mean, when you scan it, at least on an iPhone, it pops up a URL.  It doesn't automatically take you there.  So you have a second stage of clicking that you have to go through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, this one, but this is a major hygiene problem for people's cyber behavior.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In fact, we know there's been a click and we know there's been QR hijacking attacks  because you could put a sticker over a QR code on a subway ad or whatever.  And we know that happens all the time.  And it'd be a great way to fish somebody is to have a site that looks exactly like Coinbase's  and then come up and ask for your password.  So, yeah, you're right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  But so, Kathy, did you get to see the Super Bowl commercials, at least on YouTube?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I saw some of them.  I want somebody to play an ad that highlighted three and I saw one of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff is dying for me to play another crypto.  By the way, crypto was huge on the Super Bowl.  And I have had amazing.  I have really mixed feelings about this.  Bubble money.  Yeah.  I just, you know, we've talked about this before, you know, and I think there's, I think  we even talked about it when you were here last, Kathy.  I mean, I agree that there's interest and value in the technologies and blockchain and,  you know, not all cryptocurrencies are evil or bad or I'm not even saying they are inherently,  but I have, I think there's a lot of potential for scammery going on and pyramid schemes  and so forth.  And I worry.  And of course, as soon as I say that, what do people say to me?  They said it in the chat room, they say it on Twitter, say, okay, Boomer.  Yeah, you don't understand it.  You don't get it.  And that was the premise for pro.  I think this was the best Super Bowl commercial.  Oh, I think so.  And this, I'll play a little bit of it.  You know, it seems to me, Kathy, it's a news conversation.  It seems to me fair use.  Plus, why would any company that spent $14 million on this Super Bowl ad mind if I play  it again?  Oh, you think you because you're Leo, is it chilling effect though?  Isn't there Kathy?  Is it chilling?  I'm going to my disclaimer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am a lawyer.  I know your lawyer.  I'm happy to talk about chilling effects in general.  The fact that it's given you pause.  Exactly.  No, this is not the world we should be living in.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you advise Leo not to play it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She says she won't give me advice and I'm not going to ask her for advice.  It's okay.  It's okay.  I'm going to take a chance.  So this was a very funny ad that really responds to that exact issue of, oh, the people who  don't believe in crypto are just old timers like Leo.  So the premise is that Larry David, through the ages, has mocked every possible invention.  Here's my favorite, the toilet and on and on and on.  But at the very end, of course, Larry's sitting at his desk and I don't know who that other  guy is.  Some other person.  Is he a celebrity?  Could be.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Is showing him a crypto exchange.  By the way, they've had Tom Brady doing their ads.  FTX has a lot of money.  A lot of money.  A lot of bubble money.  And here somebody's explaining to Larry.  It's a safe and easy way to get into crypto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't be like Larry is their tagline.  Don't miss out on crypto.  Really an advertising.  Don't be like Larry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wonder how much he got paid.  To be the, you know, he's spent his whole life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I hope he got it in dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He got plenty of money, trust me.  He's the creator of Seinfeld, if you don't know, stand up comic.  Created Seinfeld, has an excellent HBO show called Curb Your Enthusiasm.  Curb Enthusiasm.  In which the entire premise is, I don't think so.  So, and the tagline, be more like, and it's really the same thing as people were saying to me.  Okay, Boomer, if you don't believe in crypto, if you're not a believer, then you're just out of touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, but to those folks that says that to you, I get it because, heck, just look at Fiat.  I mean, we literally take, what's this?  This is a half dollar and this piece of whatever metal this is and give it value at random.  And we honor it.  It's all fiction.  Yeah, that's true.  All of society is Fiat currency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But there's a little difference.  That's backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government.  For now.  You can pay your tax.  Well, yeah, for now.  Tell me when it's not and I'll stop using it.  And we all agree the value of a dollar.  But I could tell you, if I had a coin, which I don't, that was a Bitcoin, you couldn't tell me what it was worth.  True.  And tomorrow might be worth something completely different.  The volatility alone, there's also the environmental impact, which is not trivial.  My biggest concern isn't any of that.  My biggest concern is that all the people who's going to see these ads are people who are going to go, oh, yeah, see, it's OK.  Crypto is OK.  I'm going to buy me some.  It's going to be a pump and dump.  We turned down an advertiser.  I won't say the name.  By the way, we have Crypto Coinbase is an advertiser.  BlockFi was an advertiser.  We have some crypto advertisers.  By the way, the thing that we were advertising for BlockFi was not the thing they paid 100 million dollars to the SEC for in a fine the other day.  It was a normal credit card that you got crypto as rewards, which I have no.  I mean, that's great. That's fine.  I don't have a problem with that.  We did turn an advertiser that wanted you to invest your retirement in crypto.  And I thought, I don't really want to promote that to people because that seems like a bad idea.  And maybe it's not.  You know, if you if you'd put in 50 dollars and Bitcoin 10 years ago, it would have been a great thing if if if currency speculation is there's reasons why it's yeah, it's not a sound financial strategy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Highly regulated.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Reliable.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Highly regulated.  So the other Super Bowl two, the other Coinbase, Larry, I thought Amazon was interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The one where they had Scarlett Johansson and Colin Justin, they were reading her mind and his mind.  That was very funny.  They've echoes always done.  Amazon's always do good echo ads with which was a technology ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then Polestar was snarky about about Elon.  Well, what about all of the EV ads?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, yes, yes, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Chevrolet as well.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the one commercial I did see was the Scarlett Johansson one, the Echo one, the reading the mind.  And I thought that was awfully daring of Echo to do because everyone think I don't think people thought they were it was a joke.  I think they thought that's what's actually happening.  And the degree to which that's correct is somewhat brilliant in a way to to mock the fears exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.  It's the same thing.  It's to inure you to the idea that it's reading your mind.  It's like, oh, no, no, no, are you kidding?  No, we wouldn't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I can see why they would want to maybe strategically do that.  I'm not entirely sure it wasn't a miss.  It's risky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  Why raise the issue at all?  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  Very good point.  Very good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've read on so many parades today.  This is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not as many as Cory Doctorow's trained on a comprehensive synthesis of the technological, ecological and political critique of blockchain.  Ism.  Ism.  Ism.  Blockchain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ism.  Read the post that he wrote about.  It was people were passing it around in the smart.  The Rosenthal's critique.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  From his Stanford economics class.  Can the critique was, can we mitigate crypto currencies, externalities?  And I presume that is all the environmental harm and.  Right.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Cory kind of defines as only Cory can and does.  I'm summarizing the lecture.  Where a permissioned blockchain.  Which requires a centralization also enabled a level of quality, safety, assurance, a permission less libertarian blockchain.  Allows all weeds to to blossom and send their flowers everywhere.  Right.  So that's the it's not unlike Moxie debating Web 3.  I think we're fundamentally debating the architecture of the net always.  And we should.  But I love it when we get different perspectives around it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a very good article, which I feel completely incompetent to.  Yes.  Same here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why I put up a Twitter thread about it.  It's the it's the Reader's Digest version of Smart Web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's the always go to the last paragraph.  I figure if he's got something I can understand, it'll be in the last paragraph.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Summation.  Am I wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I read a lot of these things.  I read the first and last paragraph and then scan the nation.  Rosenthal concludes his talk.  He's talking about that original Stanford professors talk by affirming that he values decentralization.  And it is that value that causes him to reject blockchain ism.  He reminds us that the billions pouring into the Web 3 bubble are bets on attaining scale and dominance.  The only reason to pump billions into a blockchain technology is if you think that you can corner a market and make it back.  Right.  In other words, Web 3 investors see high barriers to entry as a feature, not a bug.  And they're committed to centralization.  Centralization.  And of course, that's I mean, that's just arithmetic.  You don't pour billions into something unless you think it's going to make money back.  You're not doing it out of altruism.  You're doing it because you're going to make money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which goes to scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But this is a thing that I think corrupts so many technology and policy arguments that, yeah, OK, people.  People do things for the sense that they'll be a reward.  But, A, it isn't always a financial reward.  There can be other forms of rewards.  And B, profit does not necessarily mean windfall.  And we end up building systems that are keyed for windfall.  And all that we really need to solve for is just profit, which is not necessarily the same thing at the same scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's your scale.  That's your Super Bowl.  Right.  That's the problem with the blockbuster economy is building things around huge.  Is it you know, one of the promise of of early blogs and RSS and the Web and Leo's 5000 followers on Twitter was we were post scale.  Now, I always argue scale is a friend and an enemy.  Scale is a friend in so far as more people can now have the means to speak and be heard than ever possible before.  And I think that's the way that Mike Basmic constantly reminds us that content moderation scale is impossible.  So people have expectations of a certain world.  And so scale opening up to more people, scale, good.  But defining success as taking over all of that bad.  Could we have a post scale world on the net?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think I agree.  I don't mind if big occurred, but I think solving for and building our systems around fostering big because big is somehow presumed to be best.  That's a mistake. We should be solving for the most voices, not the loudest voice.  Although I might say that I'm not sure or the smart.  I take the smartest like that would actually possibly solve smart to smart to whom is the issue.  Well, I mean, so we have loudest, I think the things that like, oh, we can get the most attention in the room and that necessarily doesn't correlate to the value of what the message actually is in the first place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me take a little break because we're way behind on making money.  And that's important to me. So thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we just talked about it. Let's talk about solving for profit.  Yeah, yeah. Solve for profit.  Not a blockbuster. Just a profit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't have to solve for profit. I just have to solve for breaking even.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, that's my point. That's my point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just solving for breaking even and I'm happy.  It's great to have you. Kathy Gallas is here.  She's a intellectual property and Internet expert in her law practice at CGCounsel.com, a tech dirt author and a very welcome contributor.  The usual suspects are also here from Hands On Photography.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And Jeff Jarvis, you know, yeah, yeah.  From his Bedminster adjacent.  Also, our sponsor brought to you by Noreva.  This is, you know, here we are. We're sitting in the first day of the new new era.  No masks in our studio.  The mask mandate has been lifted.  A lot of people coming back to work still and reasonably so.  A lot of people concerned about let's let's you know, let's not go crazy here.  Let's let's socially distance.  Let's do it right.  And there are still people who are going to be working from home for some time.  So that means you now have a conference room that has to serve a variety of needs.  And you may be starting to think about, well, what can we do from an audio point of view to make this work better?  You probably immediately think of the traditional system, which is going to be complicated software experts coming in measuring, doing a site survey,  then a dizzying array of separate mics and speakers and digital signal processors.  And of course, wires everywhere. Very invasive, very expensive.  Could take you offline for days. There is an alternative.  Our sponsor, Noreva.  They have a patented technology, the microphone mist technology that solves this.  One or two integrated microphones and speaker bars.  It's just it looks like a speaker bar, which fills any room with thousands of virtual microphones.  No dead zones. Everyone can be heard everywhere in the room.  No matter where they are, no matter how they're socially distancing, no matter how they're facing your associates who are off site,  don't feel disadvantaged because they can hear what's going on.  Meeting and class participants can simply talk.  They can move naturally in the space. They could be heard well.  Thanks to continuous audio calibration, your rooms are instantly and always ready with optimized audio.  You don't need an outside technician. In fact, your IT department, if you've got multiple conference rooms,  has a single console for all of your Noreva's that lets them monitor, manage and adjust the systems anywhere they are.  They don't have to go even go from room to room. It's so easy. You could install it yourself.  It's just like installing a sound bar.  And I said one or two because in a normal size, you know, a large room, 30 to 50 feet, one's probably enough.  But if you get even bigger, you can get more than one.  It saves you time. It saves you cost. And it works better.  Noreva, N-U-R-E-V-A.  I think it's time to ask yourself, do you want to go with a costly, complicated traditional system  or make the leap to simple and economical with Noreva?  It's so good. It's so easy. It works so well.  And by the way, it also looks great. You know, you just it just kind of it's invisible.  In effect, you know, you don't see all the wires, the microphones and all that stuff.  Learn more in Noreva.com.  N-U-R-E-V-A. Noreva.com.  Thank you, Noreva, for the best way to get great audio in your conference room.  All right. That was a that was a very interesting, good conversation.  I like it. I like it. All right, Metamates. Let's talk about Facebook.  We're Twitmates. We're Twitmates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I really wonder why we're all presuming that's where the emphasis is in the spelling of Metamates.  Like, why not Metamates or something like that? Metamates or Metamates. Metamates. Metamates.  Metamates. I want to go with Metamates. I'm hereby declaring that's how we do it. Metamates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Mark Zuckerberg, apparently without smiling, although I think that's pretty common, announced it in all hands.  The Verge was watching that that was the new name for every.  Now, I think Mark got a bad rap on this, by the way.  I understand what he's saying is, you know, we're like shipmates.  We need to look out for each other. He's just trying to get her to pull in the same direction.  I don't think that's so bad. It's a little tone deaf, you know, but sometimes the boss does that.  I've probably done something like that. I never suggested Twitmates, did I?  I don't think so. No, but I understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wouldn't have come on if you had done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But he certainly did refuse to use the word podcast.  I use netcast for a long time and I think it's a better word for it, to be honest.  I see. They did that. I'll defend that. Yeah. As you should.  Neologism sometimes can sound a little, I don't know, clunky and Metamates or Metamates or Metamates or whatever it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The last pronunciation sounds like a good tequila.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Metamates. The tequila for the feed.  They've also rebranded the feed. It's not a newsfeed. It's just a feed.  That's the name for it. That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There were a couple of changes that actually seemed like you're paying attention and bringing in some important thoughts  into your new vernacular and then there's some that just feel like, no, you're completely missing the point of everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The whole meta, the whole real naming your company Meta is odd.  But now here we are a few weeks in, we're used to it. I think all the mocking of that has gone away.  I'm not done. You're not done? No, I'm not done.  Meta is better than Facebook. Let's face it. Facebook is a terrible name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I mean, I think the problem is Facebook may be a terrible product, but I don't think the name of it is necessarily bad because in anything,  it gets to the point of what was actually sort of good and useful and valuable about Facebook that made people want to use it,  which was the idea that you'd be connected to your friends. That was a nice idea.  So if only that were the thing that was actually delivering on and delivering on well, I think it would be a great name for a great product.  The problem is it's a failed promise that it isn't meeting and making worse all the time.  Calling the whole company Meta, maybe it is a more appropriate name given that they've got their fingers in so many pies, but it doesn't really redeem it.  It doesn't solve any of the shortcomings of the Facebook product. And also from a trademark perspective, it was just weird.  Every single trademark the lawyer I knew was like, what did you just do? Are you paying attention to your lawyers?  You just gave them like a tiny amount of time to turn around a really impossible registration task after they've done everything to preserve your other trademark.  It was just it was a it was a it looked like an impetuous business decision and that I can't be impressed by that even if it accidentally turned out to be a not completely terrible one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's as if Mark read a book.  In fact, there are books like this. I don't know. Is it Noam Chomsky who said language determines culture?  That the words you use are important to determine it and how you feel about things.  And so remember, it used to be that the company's slogan was move fast and break things.  Clearly not the best slogan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they wonder why everybody hates them because they broke everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It worked. They changed it to move fast. They left out the break things. It was understood. It wasn't it was implicit, not explicit.  On Tuesday, they announced they're now the slogan is now move fast together.  What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like we used to move fast together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now that you say it, that isn't really great, but it did register as a significant improvement.  It is better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although it does call up the potato sack races where two people's legs are tied together.  I don't know. Handcuffed. Handcuffed together.  The company's OK.  Besides metametas, the company's companies.  I'm going to do it. Metamets. Metamets.  The slide deck says employees will be expected.  Now, I remember for years people would say God first, then country, then family. Right.  If you work in if you're a metamete, you're meta first, followed by your meta mates, followed by the individual.  That's the new secular Trinity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why is this getting defined in a mission statement? Any corporate document at all? Period.  I hate mission statements.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Zuck said the company's corporate values will be live in the future.  Not a good plan for those of us who have to live in the present and be direct and respect your colleagues.  It sounds like they're really doubling down on cultish. Like each other. Like each other.  Will you like each other? Start working together.  Maybe this is a response to a problem. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think some of it reads as a OK, we're going to improve in a couple of areas.  And I could kind of see some of the language be like, you know, anti-harassment.  And, you know, if you've got a culture, you might as well foster a good one and fine, use the right language that might help.  But yeah, it also doesn't read as anything that at best it's naive and be worse.  It's heavy handed in an inappropriate way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does it make you feel better that Douglas Hofstadter coined the term Metamates when asked by a Facebook executive what his advice was?  He said, call yourselves Metamates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wonder what people were calling themselves on their own volition. Like a spontaneous word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the word we hear all the time, which I find obnoxious, is my team, my teammates.  It's always the team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Instagram apparently had a phrase which is a reference to a navel phrase as opposed to a navel gaze.  Well, yeah, I was going to say.  Shipmates self. Shipmates self. That's your priority.  So Meta has made it Meta Metamates me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It sounds cultish to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, so actually I've been thinking about this.  Comrade, you got a problem with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It sounds like magic words.  Like with what Anne was saying. It sounds like just add these magic words and all of our problems will go away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's going to get locked inside too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now I got a beef with Mr. Jarvis. You said you don't like mission statements.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't like the process of trying to figure out what's the mission statement versus the one of the other two things you always have.  The values and the something else. No, you need them.  We're redoing ours at the school right now. I agree with all that.  I have been through so many multi-session meetings tearing apart it.  I hate the process.  It doesn't really get so often to the real mission that we have.  It's a bunch of flowers around the vase or is it a vase?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then you also said you didn't like the term teammates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Only because I hear how I hear it used all the time.  It becomes exclusionary too. I've got my team. What's my team doing?  Disagree please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you accept that you need a corporate culture and how do you create that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the work you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Corporations are all siloed one way or another.  The whole team aspect of it makes a ton of sense to me.  They're all sort of siloed but at the same time they have one shared goal which is profit.  Each team is working whatever they need to work to get to said profit.  As they're speaking to one another, we're co-workers but it's my teammate.  I think teammate at least for me resonates better as someone that's got a shared goal.  We're on that same mission to try to get there together and not really cutting each other off at the kneecaps or anything like that.  I've played sports all my life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a point. I was the dork who was always left off the team.  You see? You get it now? I was never picked.  I was on the team but sat on the bench so I think I can weigh in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, you may.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I hear what you're saying but I think it's a little bit different about Silicon Valley where I hear something a little bit different.  I think it's mapping to the way the companies are organized.  Silicon Valley companies historically have been very pod driven, smaller units as opposed to hierarchies.  Annalise Exinian wrote a book that I read in the 90s about.  She mapped out the difference in Silicon Valley culture versus the Route 128 digital equipment corporation type culture where you had one big company and a whole bunch of branches out.  The question was which version of corporate culture could be more nimble and innovative.  The answer was Silicon Valley.  Silicon Valley is still like that with all the startups but now you've got these companies that are just astronomically large, astronomically quickly.  We talked last time I was here about corporate governance issues of what you do when your company is that big.  I don't think it's necessarily correct to say that the team is where all teammates own the one big Silicon Valley ship.  I think the issue is that different budget and different hierarchies have been distributed down into little pods and that the teams are actually how people map into their pods.  When they speak of their team, they're thinking of my pod has jurisdiction over this type of issue, this type of project problem.  Then they've got different people within that.  You may even have your lawyer, you may have your coder, you may have your QA person and the way they pass off tasks and get things done.  I think when they're speaking of it, they're speaking less in terms of what their job is and more the unit of the company that they're sitting in, which is interesting.  Sociologically, an organizational theory, the fact that that word emerges I think is a really interesting thing to study.  When I was in Silicon Valley before I went to law school, I don't think we really had this.  This is something that has evolved and it would be really interesting to know what drove that evolution and is it an effective innovation and how the corporations are constructed.  I think that's what it's reflecting. Many pods within the company and that's when people say my team, they're referring to something much narrower and not the whole big.  I don't think when they say a Facebook employee says my team, they mean that little thing that they work in with the people that they work with and not Facebook writ large.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That I get.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's so funny. I really have to force myself to care about talking about Facebook because I just don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's what I was trying to say a few weeks ago. I think it's kind of choosing to make itself more. It's hoping to be more irrelevant.  More irrelevant?  It's hoping to be less discussed.  More or less discussed.  Right, because they don't want the eyeballs.  They don't want the scrutiny from the government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's just slide on at the scene.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They used to be out there talking about the news all the time. They're not there. Now the interesting story to me is today, this is very inside baseball, but Nick Clegg being promoted to former Deputy Prime Minister of the UK, been in charge of PR.  Now he's the president of policy and Mark is saying I'm handing him policy responsibility. Mark will do product. Cheryl will do business and Nick will do policy, which is to say all the hard stuff that nobody wants to do.  Government policy.  It's government.  And corporate policy, I would say. What is the policy of Facebook? How does it present itself? I think that's now Clegg, which is to say every tough question that arises.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is better to be a Deputy Prime Minister or President of Facebook? I think President outranks Deputy Prime Minister.  And a lot more money. A lot more money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's California, not cold London. So you know, you win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  President of global affairs. So maybe he's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  CNN wouldn't have wanted to use that title lately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, really? Maybe he's...  Maybe they just painted a target on his back, do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, obviously he stood up and said, I'll take all those tough things. And he's much savvier about politics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, certainly he's a politician, right? So that's a good... Nick Zuckerberg wrote in a post announcing the move, Nick will now lead our company on all our policy matters,  including how we interact with governments as they consider adopting new policies and regulations, as well as how we make the case publicly for our products and our work.  So it's a communications job as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah, he already had that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. So he's going to keep that.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I've seen him speak publicly a few times and I was impressed in one respect, which is because he's a politician who was good at having that tons of attention put on him.  He knew he was very good at being wound up and then let go to go speak and advance the talking points.  That if somebody gave him the right things to say, his faculty was to be able to explain them and consistently and stick to those talking points and try to be persuasive with it.  The problem is I'm not entirely sure organically he has the intuition that if somebody hasn't loaded him up with the talking points, can he intuit what it is that he should be saying and create that position?  And I'm deeply troubled that somebody who did not grow up with a First Amendment tradition is busy advocating for policy that so directly affects First Amendment issues.  Don't think he has the instinct for it or even really the expertise to understand how to navigate that.  And I really hope he's got good people behind him who are doing the winding up and sending him forward.  And sometimes there's evidence of that.  I'm troubled by the idea that we have taken this high powerful person from this political system and dropped him in this really important role that he's going to impart substantive leadership that will not be terrible to the policy landscape.  I'm not concerned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What qualifications, if you're going to have somebody in charge of policy, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.  No, no, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Question, Kathy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you're going to have somebody who's in charge of policy writ large, what qualifications do you think that person should have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's interesting because one of the things we're looking at in the Silicon Valley space is jobs that didn't exist even a couple of years ago.  I would probably like somebody who either has legal experience or business experience or economic, like some deep faculty in a particular area that's relevant and the capacity and longstanding demonstration that there's a reason they're in that job.  Because they think there's something important.  They understand how to advance it and they think that this is the vehicle within which they want to do it professionally.  Somebody will pay them, but their day job is to go out and advance the ideas that they thought needed advancing.  Somebody who organically, if not being at this job, would be doing the same thing somewhere else, you know, should the economics of that opportunity line up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, so if I'm if I'm Mark and Cheryl, that's not the qualification I'm looking for.  I'm looking for somebody who can absorb our corporate goals, irrespective of the First Amendment, but absorb what our corporate corporate goals are and then fight diplomatically to keep them alive in these varying jurisdictions, each with its own expectation.  You know, honestly, the First Amendment only applies to the US.  Facebook's biggest growth areas are outside the US anyway.  So all his job really is to do the diplomacy to get Facebook what it wants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe. I mean, if what you're arguing is they they basically need it.  They put the job at top is a mouthpiece job.  And if that's what they were hiring for, he's a great hire because he's great at being the mouthpiece.  I'm thinking that's not the way I would do it because he also doesn't round out their own faculties either.  They don't really have the intuitive understanding of what the policy should be.  So there's no they don't want that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't want it. I guarantee you it's a one way street.  They're not saying what do you think we ought to do?  It's Mark's in charge of product.  Mark is, you know, single minded.  I know what Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and whatever else we acquire should be.  I know what I want to do.  Cheryl is making sure the money, everything's running right.  The business is running right.  He's he's the linebacker that's keeping them from getting blindsided.  He's the guy who's protecting them.  He doesn't have to he doesn't have to know or have any input at all into the policy.  He's there to run interference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But he can't he can't serve them if he doesn't understand the ecosystem well enough to sort of counsel them to not  do disastrous things within their own silo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree. But that's not what they want.  Well, they got the right guy.  They don't want somebody coming to the table saying, oh, no, you can't do that.  They don't want to hear you can't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They well, there's ways of phrasing that there's ways of empowering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a better way of doing that.  Or here's here's or here's what's going to get us in trouble.  They don't. Yeah, they might.  But they don't want to hear that either.  They want well, well, but they need to hear it.  I think Kathy's point probably is need to hear it.  I think Kathy, I've argued this for a long time.  Elliott Schrag, who was the predecessor, who I knew and I know, Clegg, they both have communications and policy under the wing.  That should be separate.  Communications is exactly what you're saying, Leo.  It's make it go away.  Make nice and all that somebody in house has to have a tough voice with authority and and respect around.  No, we shouldn't do that.  That's going to get us in trouble.  That's OK.  Discussion or this would be a better way to do that.  Or why do we exist?  And what's our mission statement?  Does this really meet our mission?  I agree.  That should be the CEO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's good corporate governance.  But that is not I don't I mean, look, and I say this is a business owner, too.  And having seen this up close in a lot of other businesses.  And Kathy, I'm sure as a corporate counsel, you know, you see your job as advising them to, you know, to stay away from the spikes in the road.  But honestly, the the startup guys idea is no, no, I want to do this.  I'm going to do this.  I know what I want to do.  I don't want to hear why I can't do it.  I want you to make it so I can.  And I agree that's bad corporate governance, but I think that's how Mark thinks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, I mean, it's been a thing as I've trained up as a lawyer was a concern because as a lawyer, you know, I'm a worry ward.  I can see the trouble everywhere.  And I remember talking to one of my former bosses from when I was working in a startup and we had a conversation and he's like, I don't want you to tell me no.  And it was really an important lesson for me is learning to be a lawyer to figure out, OK, you know, I kind of need to tell him no.  But that's obviously not how I can say it.  So from a practice standpoint, training up to be a lawyer, the exercises and like for product counsel and corporate counsel, like we learn our job by learning how to point out the trouble spots and not say no.  But you the way you do it is you sort of do what you want to do properly and wisely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. A good first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I'll tell you as an honor what I often think is, yeah, yeah, that's what lawyers do.  Their whole job is to avoid exposure.  They're they're over cautious.  I understand. I got it.  And now we're going to go ahead and do what we want to.  But here's another.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's another problem I want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want to raise another problem because sometimes what was happening is that the lawyers were actually being permissive and they might have been correct.  Where if we look at this where we were like, I don't know, 10 years ago, there was a lot more you could more clearly do.  And the problem is, is it was legal, technically.  So the companies did it.  But it was so antagonistic to consumers, the public and therefore their policymakers that it blew up in everybody's faces.  And you sort of needed somebody who could look at the long game to sort of say, yeah, you could do this now.  But your advice shouldn't just be built on what is true today.  Your advice really needs to be key on the entire product lifecycle.  Like it's going to be in the market for a while.  And what happened, like, you know, for a lot of these advertising models that have all those surveillance issues and the privacy issues where, yeah, you could do that five, 10 years ago.  But now everyone hates you and they've dropped a clunky regulation on your head that isn't good for anybody because in reaction, because you antagonized all these people, somebody needed to be able to.  And this is, I think, goes to the job of what like supreme policy person that a company should do is you've got to be able to have that long view so that you can counsel also for the short view and consider like which are the battles you want to fight, not just today, but in the long run.  You have to understand your business.  You have to understand what you're trying to accomplish and you have to understand how it's going to bounce off of the rest of the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is why lawyers often rise to vice president and president and corporations because they have that perspective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe I don't know if they all do, but they it would be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've often had to work for lawyers.  No offense.  I'd love for you to be my boss, Kathy, but some of them not so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, fair enough.  I feel the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Since having had them yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  All right.  Let's talk government.  There's a lot of action all of a sudden.  I think I think it's because the debt ceiling is going to expire and we want to they don't want to think about that.  So they're thinking about big tech and all the other things that are much more palatable.  We'll talk about that in just a little bit.  Kathy Galles.  It's always great to have you.  Thank you.  And we'll save a little support portion of the show for ancillary copyright if you want to bring up anything.  Save an hour or two.  A couple hours later.  Later on in the show.

Let's start with Kathy's article 10.  The top 10.  A listicle.  I didn't write that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's just a TechTurk article.  It's a listicle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you didn't write it.  It's from TechTurk.  I didn't write it.  Baron Shoka and Ari Cohn wrote this.  The top 10 mistakes senators made during the Earn It markup.  That was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Should I say there were more than 10?  There were more than 10.  These are the top 10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This was last week.  Earn It is that awful bill we thought we had killed.  It's back.  It's back, baby.  The Judiciary Committee approved it unanimously, sent it to the Senate floor.  I'm not sure when it will be brought up for a vote.  Here are the top 10 legal and technical mistakes the committee made today.  Number one, encryption is not threatened by this bill, says Dick Blumenthal.  He always says that.  He always says that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just so we know, I know that experts tried to talk to him and tell him how it was going  to affect encryption, and he did not want to be informed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What was his response?  Don't tell me, I got my fingers in my ears.  Or he just doesn't believe it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There was ostriching that basically occurred when expertise was provided to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ostriching, I like that.  I like that verb, yes.  That's a good new verb, ostriching.  Patrick Leahy did propose an amendment aimed at preserving companies' ability to offer  secure encryption by providing that a company could not be found in violation of the law  because it utilized secure encryption, or if it fails to undermine the security of their  encryption, in other words, no backdoor.  But there is new language in the EARNIT 2022 version that basically undermines that.  Those activities cannot be an independent basis of liability, but the courts can consider  them as evidence.  Okay, fine.  You're not liable, but we don't like it, and we can consider it as evidence.  So, mistake two, the bill sponsors readily conceded that EARNIT would coerce monitoring  for CSAM, child sexual abuse material.  That's, by the way, the red herring that this is all based on, is that this is somehow going  to make it harder for child pornographers, and of course it's not.  In fact, it's quite the opposite, and that's what we learned with FOSTA-SESTA, is that  actually just pushed them underground, it made it harder to prosecute them, not easier.  And I'm sure this will have the same effect.  Meanwhile, compromising everybody else's security.  The Leahy amendment alone won't protect privacy and security or avoid triggering the Fourth  Amendment.  This is all pretty technical.  Cathy, can you summarize what's wrong with EARNIT?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Everything.  Okay, thank you.  That's a job.  Well done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bravo.  That's all we need to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I will follow up with a few broad strokes.  Part of this is this pretense that I think a number of members of Congress sincerely  believe incorrectly, which is that Section 230 protections are some sort of benefit, some  sort of subsidy that platforms get, and that if they're not going to be perfect enough  for us, we should take them away, send them to a timeout.  No dessert with your dinner.  No Section 230 for you.  That's not the way that Section 230 is constructed at all.  It isn't a particular privilege or benefit or subsidy.  It's a essentially procedural law that makes the operation of the First Amendment meaningful  when it comes to platform-facilitated Internet speech, aka all Internet speech.  It means that we can have it and we can have services of any size, any scope, any focus  point.  They can exist.  And so this idea that, well, if these platforms aren't perfect enough, we will take away their  privilege.  This is a bad one.  Look at it in the title.  EARNIT.  You want to get this benefit?  Well, you better do exactly what we say.  And that's just flawed from the outset.  And you jeopardize all Internet communication, essentially like what happened to FOSTA when  you take that away or make it conditional in some way.  It stops being useful.  And the platforms we depend on to facilitate all of our online ideas and transactions can't  exist.  So that's a fundamental broad stroke mistake of EARNIT.  And basically all of the reform, repeal, 230 laws that they keep proposing, it's really  predicated on this false notion that it's a special benefit that we're giving out.  Then this one also became like this Voltron of terrible with tying in encryption where  your ability to offer encryption was also sort of a privileged thing that you got to  do.  And the way that this all works functionally means that nobody can provide encrypted communications  because to do so essentially puts them in jeopardy.  And that's where the technical arguments get into.  But Congress saying no, no, no, it won't.  When other expert observers are saying yes, yes, yes, it will.  The yes people are correct.  And it's just not a good thing to blunder into.  We need encryption.  We need it for cybersecurity.  We need it for foreign policy like dissidents who would like to resist attack by totalitarians  and such.  Like this is a really terrible time in history to take all that away.  And that's what bills like this do.  And the people pushing it just don't they're ostriching.  They don't want to hear that there's these flaws.  And it's really unfortunate.  And they're hiding behind terrible content that yes, does need to be addressed.  But the thing that you might want to do if you want to go after CSAM first of all is  how about providing resources to prosecuting it?  And like that's low hanging fruit.  But this bill isn't about going after the low hanging fruit.  This is about pulling down the whole house of cards that the Internet depends on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So why are they doing this?  What is it?  Is it to look good?  Something must be done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a lot of that.  There's a lot of that.  I mean, there's some general that that's the impetus for a lot of Section 230 reform.  I don't even like using that word because it's garbage.  The idea that it needs reform or can be reformed without being obliterated is false.  But the push to change Section 230 in any particular way is there is some legitimate political  pressure because people are bothered by bad things that happened on the Internet and would  like their politicians to do something about the bad things on the Internet.  And there is legitimate political pressure that many in Congress are responding to to do  something about the bad things on the Internet.  And at the moment, the only thing that seems accessible to them is to take down Section 230.  So that I understand.  But some of them are they don't get it.  They think there's political points to be had in taking down big tech.  And they really don't.  Let's go with that ostriching term.  Like they don't want to know how anything works.  They don't want to be told.  No, they just want to forge ahead and score the political victory without ever bothering  to understand what's at stake.  And it's not about good policy.  It's about like winning.  And that's nobody's going to win if these things get through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is Schumer going to take it to a vote?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  The Senate is such a complicated place right now.  And like there's gridlock and people are out with covid and there's other people still  not behaving well and selling mugs about January 6th riots.  So there's a whole bunch of balls in motion.  And maybe some of this is grist in the mill.  But we can't like you know, we can't be complacent about it.  Each of these bills that have emerged present real dangers to the Internet as we have it  would like it to be, et cetera.  And other communications and the ability to communicate and the ability to communicate  in an unsurveilled way.  This is all bad stuff.  So whether it's grist in the mill or a real effort, we have to treat it as real.  And this is a threat.  And the politicians need to understand there would be a political cost if they push it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It feels like their pollsters are saying you're going to do well by taking a stand on big  tech.  Both Amy Klobuchar and Dick Blumenthal seem to be responding to some need to be seen as  a champion against big tech.  Klobuchar keeps announcing, Bill, this is a new one, the Nudge Act.  I think it's nudge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't want to give her the Yiddish pronunciation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like the Nudge Act.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I find it offensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She doesn't get that kind of benefit.  She doesn't get it.  All right.  She's from Minnesota.  She can't call it the Nudge Act.  It's Nudge Act, nudging users to drive good experiences, N-U-D-G-E, nudge on social media.  If you haven't had enough retronyms yet, the Senate's got many more for you.  Nudging users drive good experiences on social media.  She says, will hold platforms accountable for the amplification of harmful content?  Okay.  She had previously introduced a health misinformation bill, which fortunately, because it was blatantly  a violation of the Constitution, disappeared.  But now...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My headline on that one was she proposes a bill that if Trump was still president, would  have led to the deaths of legions of Americans.  I was very impressed that the word legions popped into my vocabulary.  It was not good because she's really trying to have somebody decide...  First Amendment says Congress shall make no law.  She really wants to make a law.  She wants to decide her.  She wants a governmental role to decide what speech is okay or not.  Even if in general broad strokes, I might agree with her sensibilities about what is  beneficial and what is terrible.  No, you don't create laws like this because the good guys are not always in charge.  Yes, yes, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this one asks the good guys, the National Science Foundation and the National Academies  of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine to look for something I think is kind of like hunting  for the snipe.  It's a content agnostic intervention that would reduce, this is quoting, reduce the  harms of algorithmic amplification and social media addiction.  So okay, you eggheads, get on out there and find something that won't violate the First  Amendment.  Now, fortunately, even if this bill passes, I can't imagine that much will happen except  the NSF and ASEM will get some checks and they'll get to work on a committee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not the egregious part of the bill.  She wants to, I mean, I think Mike Masnick wrote the post on TechDirt and he makes the  point of like, you know, study is good.  Let's study things.  That's fine.  And that's a perfectly reasonable government role.  But that's only part of the bill.  The rest of the bill is now government will act on what they have learned.  And you better do it.  That's the part that Congress has now made a law affecting speech because it's decided  what is the good speech and the bad speech and therefore everything is fine.  But it's content agnostic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is not what Congress should do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's only content agnostic before they do the studies.  The whole point is to come up with a study so it's no longer content agnostic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Congress shall pass no law that is content agnostic.  I think that's in the First Amendment, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the UK is going after legal but harmful speech, thus making anything that anyone believes  is harmful illegal de facto.  And then global charts kind of do the, oh no, we're going to encourage the good stuff,  which means we're going to discourage the bad stuff and we're going to anoint what is  good.  That is why we have a First Amendment.  Stay out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Shush.  I mean, I'm just amazed at all the countries in the world demonstrating as we speak why  the United States rolled out a First Amendment and we're busy trying to trash it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't that funny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's haha funny.  Haha funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, the thing that's scary about both the Ernie Act and this is that for completely  different reasons there's support on the left and on the right.  So this actually could pass for completely different reasons from the left and the right,  but they do agree, let's do something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  These days, bipartisan is not a good word these days, in my view.  Yeah.  Right?  Because the right thing is supposed to be the high order.  If certain people agree with you, you may want to think twice about why.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I found myself in a very unfortunate political position watching senators I really  don't feel comfortable with for most of governance fight her bills and be grateful for the opposition  that they were filing.  This is a terrible time in American government, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Her co-sponsor is Cynthia Loomis from Wyoming, who as a perfect example has completely different  she doesn't like social media companies whining.  She doesn't like social media companies censoring content she wants to see.  So anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, because actually to clarify the point I made, there's people on both sides of the  aisle pushing for all these terrible bills and there's people on both sides of the aisle  fighting all the terrible bills.  No one can agree.  Yes, true.  And so I was grateful for one of them who I do not, I would like to not have this person  in office again, but they were fighting the bill and I'm like, and they were making sense  while doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's very difficult.  It's difficult these days.  You know, I mean, Liz Cheney seems like a hero.  What?  Mitch McConnell finally sounds sensible.  What?  So it's, I don't know.  All bets are off.  And then US Copyright Office.  This is from the Torrent Freak website.  Explain this.  US Copyright Office consultation triggers massive upload filter opposition.  This is the digital copyright act.  Tom Tillis's digital copyright act attempting to replace the DMCA.  I'm not against replacing the DMCA, but this one changes a lot of things.  Tell me what is the DCA propose?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, so actually the Torrent Freaks wrote about it as being the thing for the DCA, which  is Senator Tillis's idea of what should replace the DMCA.  Promo in the DMCA is, okay, we're kind of in a tricky position.  Safe harbors are better than not having safe harbors.  Although Section 230 immunity is better than that because safe harbors are conditional  and we've lost entire platforms while they had to litigate whether they were entitled  to the safe harbor at all.  But better to have a safe harbor than not.  The way the DMCA is constructed, however, well, I would generally argue that the way  the DMCA is articulated, fine, it can pass constitutional muster, mostly because I want  to make sure that we keep the safe harbors because that's fine.  But the way that certain provisions have been interpreted judicially means that it actually  has a gigantic First Amendment problem.  The DMCA leads to prior restraint in the wake of government coercion of if you do not take  this content down, you will be legally liable in an obliterating way.  That's not okay, all this prior restraint.  And with a number of provisions, the DMCA now has trouble.  But there's a bunch of people who think the DMCA is not protective enough to copyright  interests at all.  Senator Tillis is on board with that to say, like, what do you mean if we take stuff down,  it might go back up?  Like that is terrible.  Up with this, we shall not put.  And so he's pushing for a change to the law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Take down and stay down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For instance, I mean, not fixing the First Amendment prior restraint problems of taking  down non adjudicated content at all and like how an amphibious that is to the First Amendment.  He's not talking about fixing that.  He's trying to have more of it with even more long lasting consequences.  And he'd like so there's language in the DMCA about technical measures.  He would like to make sure that there's technical measures that must be employed to basically  have upload filtering of like you don't even get to say it in the first place.  It never even forget notice and take down and stay down.  It never gets to go up in the first place.  For instance, is one of the things that technical measures to do or technical measures could  always automatically take stuff down.  And he thinks that would be an improvement.  I think it would be a First Amendment disaster.  There's he's I think doing a private study.  And then I think what the Torren free articles about is there were comments submitted to  the Copyright Office for a notice of inquiry or some sort of study they were doing.  Disclosure I did file on behalf of tech dirt something for that study, but we haven't written  in about it yet because in theory there's going to be a hearing coming up.  But what I think this article did is wrote it looked at the comments that had been submitted  and summarized some of the pushback that the idea got, including I noted from independent  copy musicians and creators who said this isn't going to work for us.  This is just going to limit the availability of the platforms we need to get our stuff  out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's clear that automated takedowns don't work and automated filtering is going to be  just as bad.  If not worse, EFF writes robots have no place filtering creative content.  That was the contents of their comment that they filed February 8th on this proposal.  Like the guy who recorded his kitty cat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But robots are supposed to be more efficient.  Yeah, they're better.  Human, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, some of this is probably a misunderstanding in members of Congress and regulatory agencies  about the effectiveness of robots.  Robots I mean, they should be perfect, right?  And they don't understand they're not they're not only not perfect, they're far from they're  often wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're crushing and he's he's he's devastated.  He likes robots.  You like robots, aunt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that would be no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was there was the case of the guy who posted, I think something like 10 hours of  his cat purring.  Oh, yeah.  And then EMI said, we own that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the cat should start it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cat can't. It's not a human.  It doesn't get copyright in it.  Remember the monkey selfie case?  That's what our takeaway was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So content ID, which is YouTube's notoriously inaccurate, incorrect system for for and we  get pulled down all the time, by the way.  You see, you heard me, Kathy, the chilling effect of me playing a Super Bowl ad.  You know, we could easily get taken down.  And how much worse would it be if we never even got up in the first place?  They just said, no, no, you can't post that.  There'd be no there'd really be very difficult to appeal it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this guy, if you do, that's devastating.  That's a harm. It's a harm that the First Amendment is supposed to tolerate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Even the takedown is a harm, by the way.  Now, this guy didn't get a takedown.  He got demonetized.  YouTube user Didja Haven uploaded an hour of video loops featuring his cat Phantom purring.  Didn't didn't get a lot of downloads or anything.  A year after he posted it, YouTube said Phantom is pirate purring.  The EMI Music Publishing and PRS both claimed a part of the loop.  Now, no one knows why.  Perhaps somebody used his cat purring in a song stealing from him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That can happen under these under these plans of.  Yeah, yeah.  Everyone is having way too much faith in the robots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We got pulled down.  We had a clip of perfectly open public domain clip from NASA,  which is, you know, open and public of a rocket launch and government speech.  Yeah. Of a rocket launch, which National Geographic used to take our show down  for a significant amount of time, a considerable loss of revenue,  because they had claimed it that they owned it, which they should be able to go

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  after them. You should be able to have that's not a defense because that means

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  again, that's the right to hire a lawyer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it is, although what he's alluding to is one of those provisions, I said,  that's not been well interpreted, which is 512 F and 512 F is supposed to give  a cause of action for if somebody basically sends a bad take down.  And the problem is the way it's been interpreted, it rarely works.  So therefore, it's not functioning as a deterrent because you really wouldn't  have to go sue if everyone was afraid you would go soon.  Right. So nobody fears us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's the problem.  And I, too, I want to live in a world where everybody fears me.  I think that's that's that's the right way.  I think so. Let's take a little break.  There's more still to come.  Our show today brought to you by HackerRank.  If you are doing technical interviews, you will love this new tool.  HackerRank's come up with I love HackerRank.

Sarah Palin went to court, sued the New York Times for defamation.  Yes, they had a pretty bad editorial, badly edited editorial,  which they corrected the next day.  A day before the jury came out with its verdict, the judge threw it out,  saying it was not malicious. You can't prove malice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Point of point of information here, may I ask our attorney  just before you even get to the special?  Does that happen very often, Kathy, while the jury is still out?  I mean, the commentators that a judge says no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yes and no.  I think the idea that there would be his decision, which would  essentially trump the jury decision, the jury.  And he made the point later that the jury is thinking about facts.  And they were looking at the factual analysis of whether the alleged facts  rose to the level of actual malice that she needed to prove.  And the jurors ultimately found no.  But meanwhile, he, as a matter of law, was saying, even if the jury was like,  yeah, that sounds like bad stuff, we think it probably does.  As a matter of law, it couldn't possibly meet that standard.  Why would he do that? Typically, typically, if that happens,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  they have been typically I've been in a jury, a jury trial, federal trial,  where the judge after the prosecution rested, stopped the case.  It said it's entrapment before the defense even got to stand up  and long before the jury went to deliberate.  So that's not unheard of.  The judge could say, look, this case doesn't rise to the this isn't it.  It is weird that he would wait till the jury got sequestered and then say,  oh, by the way, it doesn't matter what they do.  And to further add one more point, jurors admitted  they knew what the judge had said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the problem with this timing is that happened.  The jurors were told not to pay attention to coverage.  That was really hard to do.  So him to announce it either before and just discharge the jury  would be an option or for the jury to come back and then for him

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  to thank them for their service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then they go away. And then he says, you know, like it.  Let's say they brought back a verdict in her favor.  Then he could say, I know the jury has done this, but as a matter of law, this  yeah, that happens all the time.  Yeah. The problem he that got raised with his timing is the jurors.  The jury was supposed to be deciding this independently,  and they might have been influenced.  I think it doesn't put her in a great position for an appeal anyway, though.  Part of the problem is she really wants to take out New York Times versus Sullivan.  She doesn't have good facts to do it.  And now she's got a really crazy procedural posture because I think  and I'm guessing here, I haven't seen this by other experts, but her appeal is  kind of her strongest argument is the timing was a problem, not like  she can challenge him as a matter of law.  And that's one avenue of appeal.  But the bigger issue was that his timing impugned the jury because otherwise.  And the reason why I don't think he just dismissed the jury full stop was  he's backed up by the fact that the jury also agreed with him.  So she's kind of got to she's got a double verdict against her.  But I think her strongest argument is that the second part, the jury part  might have not been quite as kosher.  So thank you for that.  So that's why you should have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You should have said something before the jury was sequestered or after.  No, we should have probably waited for them to just wait.  Wait for them to come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't want to interrupt, but I wanted that context for what you're now going to go into.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, Sullivan is the 1964 US Supreme Court decision that established  the malice standard in a libel suit.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, no, you were going with the story.  Yeah, you interrupted you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we've we've told your story, but if you like to tell the story is done.  Thanks very much.  There's no more story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was the story.  So it'll be interesting to see.  Yeah. And yeah, I mean, yeah,  nothing more to say about that.  But it was played on the Super Bowl.  I could I think if I play too many of them, then it becomes a question.  Yeah.  You could. Hey, good news.  Google Plus is dead.  Did you know?  Yeah, well, we mentioned this.  Paul Mike Elgin, we mentioned this when we years ago said,  yeah, Google's pulling the plus plug on Google Plus.  But we also said Google will be doing a business version of Google Plus.  You might remember Google Currents.  Now that's dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So we take a moment of silence.  Like what is going on here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I bet this was an instance of someone just writing this on the whiteboard.  Google Plus for businesses.  OK, we're going to call it Currents.  All right. We'll see you next month in the next meeting.  Yeah. That was the end of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, Google wants to add benefits to their work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it was a pandemic, so nobody could see the whiteboard anymore.  They all left it up and it is not erased on it.  And then they all left.  They didn't see the whiteboard anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. By the way, after two years, whiteboards are very hard to erase.  Let me tell you that.  Yeah. I get a lot of it.  It's shellacked. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know if this is good news or bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You get permanent marker to get the permanent marker off.  Oh, yes. Oh, so if you accidentally write with the wrong marker,  go over it with a dry erase marker and then it will become dry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It dissolves the permanent marker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It does something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's some paradox.  There's some philosophical statement about the universe,  but I can't figure it out. Too stupid.  I just want to be temporary.  It erases the permanent.  You see, that's a confusing concept here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the former the former president, the man from Mar-a-Lago,  has launched Truth Social.  It's out. It's up.  Is it out? Well, his first post is there.  Don Jr. posted it on Twitter.  And here it is, Truth Social.  Five bucks a week if you want to follow the truth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you don't get in at all unless you pay or you're waiting list.  Join the waiting list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, what's funny is you don't pay them.  You get you donate to a Republican.  Yeah, well, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that's 10 times more expensive than the Sumi news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, that's exactly right.  So, yeah, Trump teases first post on the new Twitter like Truth Social.  I don't know. How do I see the post?  Well, you can go to the New York Post and they have it.  All it says is your favorite president is about is get ready.  Your favorite president will see you soon.  Much like a proctologist.  Biden's doing the union soon.  Yeah. Is the state of the union today?  No, March. No, March. March.  OK. Yeah. Time for some truth.  John Jr. wrote it'll launch as early as Presidents Day.  I bet you that's right.  The App Store is a preorder  again, five bucks a week.  And it looks a lot like Twitter.  Last time I checked, it was based on Mastodon,  which is the open source Twitter clone that we use. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And didn't they get in trouble about that?  Yeah, because they didn't admit it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're supposed to tell people.  I guess we won't know until it's public.  I bet they're going to make a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Here's a mock ups advertises site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  With Jack's beard and account at Jack,  I'm just a guy trying to make it in this big world.  OK, it does.  It looks just like Twitter.  I mean, you can make Mastodon look just like Twitter,  so I don't know why you'd want to, but you could.  So I don't know what the software is.  Are you skipping over Peter Thiel's investment?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you said five dollars a week? Is that what you said?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Five dollars a week.  Yeah.  I was going to join it, but then I saw that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll just keep my Gab and Getter accounts.  I'm happy with that.  And Parler.  Parler.  Got the Parler.  Oh, Parler. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I need to get a Getter account.  I need to get that locked down.  Well, maybe you want to join Peter Thiel's conservative dating app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The right stuff.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, all incels and Karens was my...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One point five million dollars he's putting into the seat.  I don't know. I'm sorry.  Go ahead. You guys talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Leo chokes, but we're not...  I think I took my mask off prematurely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  You're OK, sir. You're OK.  We're not going to speak that into the universe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fortunately, I have no...  I don't believe that actually causes COVID speaking into the universe.  I do think not wearing a mask could, however.  Yeah, Peter Thiel who took himself off the...  He took himself off the board, right?  Of Facebook.  Oh, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was such a funny thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was because he wants to pay attention to the...  To all these conservative candidates.  He's writing them checks.  He could have still left the board.  There's got to be a backstory here why he left the board.  I'd love to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, let's...  I don't know. I shouldn't...  I'm just guessing, but it's interesting.  Two things have happened on...  Two things have happened on top of each other.  He left the board and Nick Clegg just got promoted.  So I'm almost wondering, like, was he an obstacle to this musical chairs  happening sooner?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know what...  Why would he be? I think he'd be a fan.  Nick Clegg was a big Brexit guy, right?  I think they'd be fellow travelers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no. He wasn't that extreme.  Oh, okay.  That act.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no.  And I'm seeing other tweets go past of, wait, what?  Like our conversation earlier that this just...  That Clegg is just too prone to just make political wheels and deals,  and that's no way of, like, steering a ship where you've got really important  policy considerations to deal with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Big article, big gossip article in the New York Times yesterday.  It took one, two, three, four, five, six people to write it.  Emily Steele, Jodie Cantor, Michael Grinbaum, James B. Stuart,  John Koblen writing about what happened at CNN.  What a story that is.  And as soon as they filed it, of course, the other shoe dropped.  And Jeff Zucker's right hand and apparently close personal friend,  Alison Gaullist, was also fired yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Left the company, Neil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leaving the network.  Yeah, that's what they said about Zucker.  Yeah, he's decided to spend more time with his family.  It's really a gossipy story.  It's great. I've been reading...  Do you read Puck News, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm about to subscribe.  Craig Newmark just sent me an article from it.  I think the world of Julia Ioffe.  I think Dylan Byers is good at media.  Eric Gardner?  Yeah, so I'm about to subscribe. I'm going to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I remember when Baratunde joined, I wasn't sure.  But then when this whole Zucker thing happened, and of course,  they've got Dylan over there who is an expert on all of this,  I said, I've got to follow it.  We have a free podcast, The Powers That Beat Podcast,  so you can listen to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The lead story right now is about my old boss, Steve Newhouse.  Oh, really?  And Zaslow, and who's the real power behind Discovery,  which is going to own CNN.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a good time.  So Puck is not cheap.  It's a hundred bucks, but I want to support those guys.  I like them all as journalists,  and I like the inside Hollywood, inside media gossip.  So yeah, I joined it.  All right, I'm doing it right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ooh, the Inner Circle. What's that?  How much is that? $2.50 a year.  Did you do that?  No, I don't need to be in the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not a Davos kind of guy.  I don't need to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that price point is the Trump price point.  So consider the quality that's getting delivered at each service.  You get more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Easy decision. Very easy decision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So yeah, you know, there's not a lot of content,  because there's only about eight of them.  But I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what's great.  You know, I actually stopped subscribing...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry, go ahead.  No, I was just going to say with it not being a ton of them,  there's probably like ridiculously targeted, solid content.  It is. That's exactly what it is.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's no fluff to it.  There's not more than an article a day,  but there's...  And the podcasts are pretty good too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had to check out the podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's free.  And you know what?  I think you get a lot of the value out of that.  Out of that for most of the podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I actually stopped subscribing to The Atlantic,  even though there's great stuff there,  because I just got overdosed with hot takes.  It was too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, apparently you're alone,  because nearly a quarter of Americans get their news from podcasts.  Speaking of hot takes.  This is from Pew Research, of course.  That's an amazing number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's great that I lent my speculative contributions to this podcast.  Exactly.  This is the place.  Increase the erudition of the American people.  This is the place, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because I remember when less than a quarter of Americans even knew what a podcast was.  So it's great they're getting their news from podcasts now.  Yeah, primarily younger people.  Primarily more men than women.  Pretty evenly divided racially, Hispanic and Asian.  Slightly higher than white and black.  Tends to be college plus, college educated.  More than half some college.  Tends to be very, very, very wealthy.  So if you're trying to reach very, very wealthy people.  You know who to call.  Interesting.  It's an even split between right and left.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But there's an absurdity to this.  Because now people are going to say, oh my God, podcast.  I'm going to do a Marshall McLuhan moment here.  Is that people get their news from everywhere.  Everywhere.  That's the real answer.  Everywhere.  We are in a media ecology where everything is media at some point.  And when you hear it on the street or you look at a billboard or you listen to a podcast  or you read the news or you follow a Twitter link, it's not like you've given up everything  else.  And now suddenly the only thing I do is listen to podcasts.  I don't, I ignore everything else in life.  But podcasts, that's how I get my news.  That's what this implies.  And it's a stupid question.  It'll be good for you all to listen to podcasts.  I'm all in favor of that.  But now watch, it's going to be a target in the back.  Oh yeah, Joe Rogan.  That's why the world will screw it up.  Podcasts.  Everything was fine until we had podcasts.  Yeah, true.  True.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's do the Google changelog, John.  Get those musicians in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Google changelog.  Man, time has flown by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's almost done, kids.  Don't worry.  Big Gmail redesign starts rolling out to personal accounts.  Look for the explainer from Google.  Collapsible panel, app window, status indicator, show hide button for collapsible panel, and  etc. etc.  So if you're a Gmail user, get ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is change.  I'm not sure change is good.  I don't like it.  I'm scary.  I don't like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm picking kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is pressing my buttons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stop it.  It is not yet widely available, but it will be rolling out end of the month probably.  That's probably when you'll get it.  Finally, the end of Google's free storage plan.  Not finally.  I'm not looking forward to it.  I'm just saying we knew it was coming.  It has happened.  Anybody with a Google Apps for Education account in the US used to get unlimited storage for  free.  Not so anymore.  That's why Microsoft has jumped up and said, hey, over here.  Over here.  We got something.  They're offering a discount to people who had the legacy Google Workspace accounts.  Google Drive's new filters make search easier.  They're rolling out to everyone.  You could search.  You see here, there's location.  There's a file type.  There's people last modified by title.  But I thought Google Search was dead, sir.  This isn't Google Search.  Google Drive Search.  Reddit has taken over the world.  Who said Google Search was dead?  Not I, for sure.  It's in the rundown.  Reddit people say Google Search is dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Reddit is the new search engine.  Oh, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to derail the changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google Doc's getting...  Don't worry.  You cannot derail the changelog.  Google Docs is getting AI generated summaries, collaborative email templates, and more.  I'm just going to skip right over that one.  Android 13, every change thoroughly documented.  You should tune in all about Android.  They'll be talking, I'm sure.  I just got the beta of 12L on my Pixel.  And it's not a new version of Android.  It's a new version of Android.  It's a new version of Android.  It's a new version of Android.  It's a new version of Android.  It's a new version of Android.  It's a new version of Android.  I'm going to put it on my Pixel.  And it's nice.  It's solid.  They did the third beta, third version of the beta last weekend.  It's nice and solid.  Apparently, Pixel 6s and other Pixel phones will be getting the next 12, 12L in March.  It's the same user interface?  Yeah.  I think you might be worth trying it since you have a Pixel 6 you're not happy with.  Okay.  Google Home 2.48  Brings Android TV remote to iOS and tweaks Wi-Fi graphs.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Whatever that means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know what that means.  And honestly, I don't really care.  Google Play Store now shows new app install progress directly on the home screen.  These are minor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Some product manager is going to cry.  They're going to be listening to this episode.  You'd burst into tears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The tech guy said he doesn't care.  The tech guy said he doesn't care.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not.  It's not going to happen.  And this actually is probably the biggest story of the changelog.  Google has...  Remember they bought a company called, I think it was Neverware, for their cloud-ready version of Chrome OS.  Neverware figured out a way to get the open source Chromium OS on third-party old PCs.  I tried it when it came out.  It kind of rejuvenated old PC.  Google bought the company.  And now they're bringing Chrome OS officially to older PCs and Macs.  Follow the light, children.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Come to the light.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a really great idea.  Especially the Intel Macs, which is the only kind it will work on.  People are buying new Macs.  It's hard to put Linux on a Mac.  Now, my experience with cloud-ready, when it happened, was it was a little difficult.  It didn't work with all hardware.  But maybe this will work better with the help of Google.  It doesn't take very long.  Paul Therotte did it.  He said it took them longer to put Chrome OS on a USB stick than it did to install it on the old PC.  It just takes a few minutes.  And that's what Google blog posts said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think next week's show, you need to start off doing this so you can go to Terminal and make sure it works just right.  That's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, this is a great way to take old machines and give them new life.  It'll be great for schools.  And not just old machines.  You can improve your PC or your Mac.  I wouldn't do it on a new machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That machine would be kind of nutty.  No, Chrome OS is better.  Is it?  Is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it?  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think so.  The race to connect to Tonga is wonderful graphics if you want to geek out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so remember Tonga had a horrific volcano eruption and did it cut the undersea cable.  Tonga went offline.  Oh, I'm sorry. We didn't leave the...  Oh, and that's the Google changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, we can't do that. The boundaries are all wrong.  Let's put a cap on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The race to reconnect Tonga.  This is Jeff's pick of the week.  How engineers will replace the undersea communications cable severed.  It's got pictures.  Jeff likes pictures.  Wow, yeah.  This is what an undersea cable looks like.  It's got a tar soaked nylon yarn outside.  Ultra high strength T-way is inside.  No, it's cool.  And the repair ship.  You know, you did this for Stacy.  She loves this kind of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did do it for Stacy and I forgot she's not on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She loves undersea cables.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm partial to undersea cable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, actually, I say that and flip it like, but I kind of am because it's a really critical connection and really interesting things happen.  Like we're talking about Jeff is talking about the industrialization of communications.  That's part of the industrialization of communications.  Where are the undersea cables?  When did they drop?  When did they get run?  Are they secure?  Like interesting political geopolitical situations are contingent on where are the undersea cables and whom do they reach, etc.  So actually it is fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You may remember that the first transatlantic cable was a telegraph cable.  Yes, it was in the 1850s.  Severed by a ship almost instantly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Where you put them is important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but this is why I'm bringing up this illustration here.  The cable is lowered carefully to the seabed and then there is a sea plow and underwater.  I didn't know that.  Sea plow in areas of high fishing activity.  It cuts a furrow in the seabed for the cable and then a little remotely operated ROV descends, inspects it and buries it.  So that is pretty cool.  That's one way you saw that.  Did you know that?  It inspects the trench that it dug?  Yeah, yeah and buries it.  Now unfortunately it can only do about 2500 meters so it can't be used everywhere.  But that's pretty, pretty, pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's Larry David Day here at TWIG.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You've heard of DRM in printer ink cartridges.  Now Dymo is putting DRM in their paper.  Oh no.  Did anyone tell Mr. Birch?  Yep.  If you're a Dymo label maker owner, you may want to be aware of this.  It won't be now.  Yes.  So the paper is very, you know the ink is expensive but the paper is also expensive because it uses special paper.  The trick is how do we DRM?  How do we copy protect the paper?  Well these are thermal papers.  They don't use expensive ink.  So Dymo has figured out a way to DRM these.  The latest generation of Dymo's desktop label printers use RFID chips in the labels to verify that they are official.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So not only is the paper I think not recyclable because it's heat sensitive, now it's also e-waste.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is such an improvement.  I think it's probably, you know obviously it's not in the paper, it would be in the cartridge, but you know the thing that holds the paper.  But still, yeah, no, yeah, that's a bad idea.  But do do do do do do do.  This is Jeff's story so I'm going to do it.  Robin Hood, or is this yours?  Whose is this? Robin Hood and Twitch?  Yes.  Yeah, Jeff wrote the headline.  Robin Hood and Twitch got together the results.  Trading TV.  You know there was a big ad for social investing on the Super Bowl.  This is all the rage now.  If you don't know how to invest in you can take advice from idiots that your friends are your friends.  Which seems like a bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I invested in a company and lost my investment which has some irony given what it was.  It was a social investing company to the extent that you, it was really brilliant.  I started my company with a guy named Ricky Tata.  I like his name too.  So Ricky Tata figured that you could basically, everybody could be a mutual fund.  To the extent that you had to share your actual trades so they were verifiable with the platform.  And then if you're a great investor Leo, I can follow you and when I make money you make a little spiff off of that.  So you want to invest well and I want to come along with you.  It really made sense.  It didn't work because it was too early and too complicated and that's that.  It's too bad I lost my money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And his last name was Tata.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think if I'm Larry David you can be JB Smoove, Jeff Jarvis.  That was a really fascinating story.  Oh sorry.  Alright, let's wrap things up.  It's been so great having you Kathy Gellis.  I don't want to put you on the spot or anything but we give everybody a chance to pick something at the end of the show.  If by any chance you would have a pick for us, this would be the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was thinking about a pick but then I needed to find out if it would trigger copyright problems for you.  So I have not actually had the chance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's never going to trigger copyright problems to talk about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well listen, it's Huey Lewis right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've been meaning my pick.  Oh you had Huey Lewis last time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You picked Huey Lewis last time.  You're going to pick Huey again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're always safe with Huey Lewis in the news.  Of course you are.  So I would like you to invite me back in the future.  Well I always recommend Huey Lewis.  In a pinch, go with that.  But have me back and I will double my picks for next time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can't knock her logic sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sounds like blackmail to me but okay.  I'll go for it.  I do want to mention that our dear friend Amy Webb's new book has finally come out.  We knew it would be a Valentine's Day gift.  The Genesis Machine is all about biotech and the biotech synthetic biology revolution that is about to hit us.  She co-authored it with a biotech expert scientist.  I'm not finished with it but I'm really enjoying it.  And we've asked, invited Amy to do a special triangulation.  I'm hoping we can do it Saturday.  Is that up? Is that on?  Yes.  Still working on it.  But possibly we'll do it in the club right after the radio show, 2 o'clock Saturday, 2 p.m. Pacific.  And then we're going to get Amy on another show, another twit soon.  But Amy's book is out so I'm going to give her my pick because she does some great stuff.  Synthetic biology is poised to change everything we know.  If you thought the information revolution was a big deal, this is going to be even bigger.  The Genesis Machine now available on audio as well as on Amazon as a book or in your favorite bookstore.  Jeff, number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, not a number, it's a thing. It's an appalling thing.  Maybe not, depends on your life.  Would you want to live? It's this new concept.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do, actually. I've already put down a down payment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Story Living by Disney.  Yep.  Disney's had communities they've built before like, oh, here's a downtown.  This goes beyond. This includes content in your life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait a minute. Am I going to have a Mickey in my living room? Is he going to come serve me tea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you might. They're trying to figure it out.  So if you go to storylivingbydisney.com, you can learn more.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We need to find out what Cory Doctorow thinks about this because he was a really big Disney fan and he also doesn't like dystopia.  And I think he might be very torn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think this is a new novel for Cory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, everybody loves Disney. It doesn't mean you want to live with them.  But, you know, Disney, wasn't the downtown kind of a failure or was it a success?  I seem to remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I was trying to look it up and now all you can find is this.  The first one in Rancho Mirage.  Oh, OK.  So you can live there. It's a 55 plus community.  That's Palm Springs. Yeah, no, I'm moving there.  You're eligible now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, here's a guy. Look, he's playing a guitar. So that's good.  They've got restaurants. Your dog can eat at the table in Disney World.  They've got lemons. They've got limes. They've got oranges.  I don't really see much to recommend it right here.  And they've got a desert.  Where's the Disney?  So if you're not going to retire.  There's the Disney Park. Where's the?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're going to have this wonderful service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it's called Cotino, a story, a story living by Disney community.  So that's a complicated. I got a questionable fontography.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not impressed with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That looks how many fonts are in this one, two, three, four, two, two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But like the T, it's not a T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where's the top? And the O seems to be falling over maybe because it's over 55.  I don't know. Welcome to a dynamic, creative oasis set within the stunning landscape of Palm Springs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Talk about your language defining culture.  What is that word saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cotino.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can you please come up with an alternative pronunciation for us now, Kathy, since that's your specialty?  I can't even read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, well, Uncle Walt be there.  Well, I guess it's Coeno.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff, I'm going with Coeno because I can't see the rest of the T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's not a T. That's an I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's probably a T, but we're not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you can't see it, can you? Because it's so thin.  Maybe if I make it bigger.  There we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You shouldn't have to, but no, I'm calling it Coeno.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, if you're over 55, you can't, you know, zoom it in.  I don't need to humor Disney. They're not paying me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tell it. Tell it.  Yeah.  Well, here's a question for you all.  If you were going to retire to a themed community, what the not Disney, just anything in life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bioshock. I want to live in the Bioshock world.  It's underwater. There's giant robot enemies.  I don't know. This does not, you know, I feel like this is kind of half thought through.  Like, here's a picture fading out of people doing yoga because he's fading out.  And then here's a guy who's just holding a Disney cookie cutter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I think those Disney cookie cutters are fascinating because I don't think they are actually the Mickey logo.  And I think the reason for that is because they don't want people running around making cookies that are the Mickey.  So I think it's actually a different mouse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's some other mouse. It's not even Mickey. It's just a mouse.  Smart, smart.  And by the way, I don't think there's any water in Palm Springs, but maybe that's a fake beach.  I think this is very odd.  Dystopian.  Well, it doesn't really say anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It doesn't really rise to the level of dystopia yet, but Cory will find out.  Oh, wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Disney is not the developer of Cotina, a story living by Disney.  The buy, I guess, is kind of the giveaway.  By Disney Community or the builder or seller of homes within story living by Disney Community.  It's like Trump World.  Third parties developing and building are independently owned and operated.  Disney does not guarantee obligations of and or provide any warranties for the construction of community infrastructure,  recreational areas or unaffiliated parties who build homes in the community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Disney just did a deal that's like all the gravy for us and all the risk for you.  It's just the name.  You want that? OK, fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's precisely a Trump deal. That's what Trump does.  Isn't that what a franchise does?  Pretty much the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No guarantee is made that the features and amenities depicted by these artists' renderings or otherwise described will be built or, if built, will be the same type, size or nature as described or described.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's legal.  You know how like everything Disney is fiction?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So is this entire availability of club membership and operation of club facilities are not guaranteed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You will take it and give you and like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't believe a web page just made crypto look good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is hysterical.  Disney.  This is I don't you know, my favorite line is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For a solid investment, go with Bitcoin.  Like I don't understand this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got to read the disclosures and then then then you'll know it's not by Disney.  OK, well, so anyway, I thought it was just.  Mr. Ant Pruitt, I think it's time for a pick from you, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sure.  My I have to.  My first one is from the folks at Boris effects.  I've been playing around with some video stuff, especially with hands on photography and trying to show people that you can get into video editing as a photographer.  And I've been playing around in Sony Vegas, not Sony Vegas Vegas Pro Sony used on them.  And since I have Vegas Pro Boris effects was sending out promos and they announced that they have particle illusion.  This is a standalone particle application.  It allows you to create some pretty cool effects.  You got to do this tomorrow.  Panic all for free.  Yes, yes, exactly.  Moral panic.  Right.  So that's that's one of my projects.  It's free.  They don't charge for it.  They do have they have a free version, but they also have a paid version.  You can I think the paid version is fifteen dollars a month.  But these are like ridiculously high end particle.  Look at that.  Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you had moral panic right in the middle there, that'd be so cool.  That's a good one.  Yeah.  But it works with Vegas Pro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It works with Cotino by Disney.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It'd be perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How could they they need an ant for all their graphics?  Oh, look at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They could have so much more fun.  Welcome to the Cotino waterfall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I'm going to be playing with this a little bit more.  I have some things in mind, including moral panic, as you all say.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's Boris FX.com.  I've used their stuff, too.  I like their stuff.  I think they're good.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And my next pick is since I've changed my set here and turned on sunlight to cut your life.  It's very open and nice.  It screwed with my monitor.  You know, I'd go to to to work on an edit and things didn't look right from a color.  Because lights coming in that I'm not used to having.  So I was like, I should probably tell people to calibrate your monitors based on your room setting.  And I use a data color spider screen calibration tool.  Mine is old, but they have them online and Amazon for fairly cheap.  And they really, really work.  And they really make a difference in making sure you get your colors right in your photo or video editing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I call these a screen sucker because they go right on.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But this would have looked that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. This is a good way to calibrate your monitor.  That's good.  And there seems like they're less than they used to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. They're a lot cheaper than what they used to be.  And it only takes about 10 minutes to do it.  If that, you know.  And lastly, I just wanted to say thanks for the people.  I guess people are filing their taxes and getting their tax refunds because I've had an influx of prints or old school NFTs  I've had this here recently.  So I just want to say, hey, go out there and buy some more of my old school NFTs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A print is an old school NFT.  It's a fungible token.  I love that. I'm borrowing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Before there were any NFTs, we used to put these on paper and people would put a piece of wood around them and we'd call them prints.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We were talking about this previously on the show because I have NFTs out there.  But as I said, my audience, they want prints.  So yeah, prud.com.  Because they're smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because your people, your fans, your smart enough people to appreciate your art are themselves smart.  They're not going to get taken in by any audience.  Are these your best ever pictures?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is like, these are like the best pictures.  Or have you got more?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not all of them.  There's a couple that I haven't put up there for sale because I have to think about how I want to price them.  Right. These are pretty top notch.  Love them. Yeah, they're really beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Great images.  You sell them on Fine Art America, but if you go to AntPruitt.com, you could probably find them there, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  AntPruitt.com slash prints.  Nice.  Easy way.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you, Gantzer.  Thank you, Kathy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go ahead.  I just want real quick.  So I went to the Chrome for PCs and Macs.  It's kind of wonderful.  Google is calling it the free upgrade for PCs and Macs I've been waiting for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's fantastic.  That's great.  You know, I will definitely think twice now about getting rid of older Macs because I think it's turning into a Chromebook.  That's a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Now, is this still dual bootable or?  No, no, no.  I think it replaces it.  Totally wipe it and that's it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's some Macs that I mean, there's PCs, lots of them that are just so old that you really don't want to put.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Once it is bootable in Chrome, you can put Linux on it.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, that's right.  It's sort of on it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  OK.  Nice.  It's a good.  I mean, you can always just put Linux on a plane.  It's a little there.  It's not Linux on a Mac is hard because there's so much proprietary hardware.  If Google's done the job to get this working on a Mac, I think that's really good.  A lot of schools have old Macs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mm hmm.  Take it up with the really decent hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kathy, I really appreciate you coming by.  You always up the quality of the conversation.  Thank you so much for being here.  At Kathy Gellis, G-E-L-L-I-S on Twitter.

Transcript:  Yes, fine.  Do you play sad?  I like another invoice and I'm not quite sure if that's going to actually help or hurt my  prospects.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'm wondering, do you play like Frankenstein did, long, sad songs in the background to  haunt people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I played for like seven or eight years when I was a kid and then basically didn't touch  it for 30 years and now have picked it up in the pandemic and it's better than I would  have thought.  I'm jealous.  It's not a great violin and it doesn't have a great bow.  So I'm not terrible, but it's not inducing me to stick with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm jealous.  If I could play the violin even badly, I would love it.  I just love that instrument.  So it'd be fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway.  Yeah.  Well, it's true that if not played well, it can sound horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, it's a very easy instrument to drive poorly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

And I got to ask him all kinds of questions.  I turned it around because I wanted to interview O Doctor.  Ah, so yeah.  And his whole parenting, because he has a podcasting on parenting too.
