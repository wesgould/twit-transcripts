Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I've held on you for like two weeks. So yeah, it's your fault. Did you go on vacation do something fun? I hope anyway, I  Yes, once was a migraine day once was a vacation as well. It was like an appointment date, but it was a fun appointment  I hope you had I went to an escape room. Oh, did you really? Oh  Yeah, how'd you like my first time I loved it it was a really great experience I went with  my daughter her best friend and then my best friend was able to come and fun we  Had a 25% success rate and we failed on the last clue. So we did not

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Escape it's very disappointing. What was the scenario of your escape room?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ours was called the experiment and it was some guy working with sound waves and  we had to like do a lot of cool stuff with sound and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Patterns we did a really fun. I think we kind of intended it as a team-building  exercise escape room in San Francisco  So it was a did you go John? No, it was a bunch of people from work  and the scenario was there had different ones that  There was gonna be a  nuclear meltdown and we had to get to the cores and pull the scram the cores before the meltdown and  There's a timer and stuff and it's fun because there's puzzles physical puzzles  It was really challenging and we you know what the thing blew up three seconds before we got to  But you had they had they had this the couple that did this was very geeky  So they had VR helmets and drone. He had a pilot a drone. There was all sorts of really geeky stuff  It was really really fun. I can't remember the name of it and I really wonder if they're still there because I have to have a  feeling this is a  difficult business to survive

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that reminds me the VR  fired it up again yesterday for my niece and  And  Facebook is not  Necessarily required it still works without a Facebook account. Oh, hallelujah  Yeah, you just can't get some of the although their social aspects. I ironically they have pulled the oculus quest to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because I saw that people are getting big raccoon eyes  From the mask apparently they're allergic. So they've actually pulled it off the market. I also read a story  Maybe it's a little overhyped that there are people whose Facebook's account have been hacked  And of course, it's almost impossible to get anybody at Facebook to respond to this, you know  They have a you know, I've lost a control my account. There's this whole process, but I get calls all the time the ratio  I can't get in I can't get in I've been trying for weeks and months. So at least one person went out bought an oculus quest  then complained  Got it fixed and returned to quest. Ah  So that's one solution by a $300 device to get a Facebook's attention  Wow, yeah, I would love a quest but I I  Don't gonna count on this loophole forever. They they said they want you to have a Facebook account. So that was it for me

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it works it's just some of you have one  Yeah, the some of this stuff. No, I had that rift that you gave me but it still works with just  Yeah, the regular games that are local to know they're fine. Yeah, they're fun. That's all I care about. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you play beat saber? That's that's the one Michael likes. It's really fun. Very active Burke says he's one of the people who gets  oculus quest raccoon eyes  He reacts. Do they have what do they have? Is it nickel? I don't know. It's um, I  Doubt they put nickel in the foam, but you never know right? No, you never know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a that's a common allergy that people had with like smartwatches, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's the rubber glove stuff for people can allergic to latex latex?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe they have a latex in it. That'd be more more likely. So you won't need a Facebook account for that rift you have  but  Supposedly the oculus 2 does so West 2 does so I don't know. I  Wouldn't count on it not needing an account  All right, we are doing all of this because we really are we dragging our feet

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're going kicking and streaming. You don't have to do it Leo. You're the boss. It's not a democracy  You're the you're the dictator. You don't have to do it. Just don't do it. It's okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is a story this week that we have dealt with on every show  And we're finally rounding it out I'm so sick of it I  Mean we said look everything that need to be said Stacey was great by the way  Thank you for joining us Sunday on Twitter. It's really nice. I felt so waffly

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm just like this is so new

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's true, no you were good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But we were talking about of course apples what Ben Thompson calls apples mistake in  Stratechery I think Ben kind of said it and this was the this was to me exactly my problem  Apple announced new protections against child pornography  See Sam detection they announced and they that everybody agrees they announced it poorly because they conflated three different completely different  Technologies as if and everybody assumed they're just kind of one thing  One of the technologies scans photos on iCloud photo storage  Using the database from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children  They have and they are a government founded and funded but not a government organization  But they have a database of images child pornography images, which they've created a perceptual hash  With using computers the idea of a perceptual hash is even if the picture is modified made black and white or cropped  It should still show up. They measure  distances in the picture and things like that and  This percept they have a database of hashes just numbers fingerprints of these images  Which Apple and others use by the way, Google's been doing it on Google Drive  Google also does it in Gmail attachments Facebook's done it for years  Dropbox most cloud providers do it actually which is they scan the images you store on the cloud  most most of the time I believe during ingress and you know so that  They can be encrypted at rest. But as you're uploading them, they're not encrypted yet. They scan them on the way in  Just what they do is they run the similar perceptual hash technology. This came from Microsoft  They put it in the public domain or they gave it away to Nick make years ago to against these images to see if there's a match  Apple says one match won't do it. We want to avoid false positives  So there's a threshold you have to have a certain number which they won't say of matches if we see that many matches  We'll then report will suspend your account report you to the National Center for Missing Exploited Children  Actually, there's one step in between they will upload a copy of the image  To a human at Apple who will look at it verify that it is in fact child pornography and then  So somebody will see that image. Well, they want to they're at all costs avoid false. I know yes  Exactly job. They want to at all costs avoid false positives. They don't want to cue somebody  In incorrectly say say doing this we will have a one in a trillion chance of false positives  Which is a completely made-up number. How would you know you don't know?  But let's assume they've done a good job of that Ben says this is a good system Apple kind of needed to do it  We were talking before the show. I don't want to steal a number from you Jeff, but Facebook has been doing this last year in 2020  They reported twenty point five million  images child pornography images Apple reported 265  So Apple has been avoiding it. They're certainly there. They've just been closing their eyes to it and  We suspect we all surmised it Apple has probably been under a lot of pressure to do something about this  So that's one thing they're doing  Another thing they're doing which is I think problematic and Ben says  This is the mistake  They are also putting this NECMEC database on your phone  This will come with iOS 15 and I phone an iPad anything with iPad or iOS on it  And will then compare images on your device  They'll compare the hashes and with a similar result that  Is really upsetting to people they don't like the idea of Apple scanning their phones something that you own  For any reason at all. There's a third level advocate in a minute. Yeah, I just want to give you the lay of the land  We've all heard this but I'll try to do it fast. The third thing is something for kids  Images being sent to or sent by kids will be scanned in a completely separate way  unrelated to the NECMEC database or perceptual hashes will be scanned by some technique Apple hasn't really specifically described for  being  pornographic and  Not necessarily child pornography but pornographic and then the kid will be warned and say you don't want to see this  If and then if the kids is no I want to see it  And then if the kid says no I want to see it  They said what you look you really don't want to see this if you see this we're gonna have to tell your parents  And if the kid says I don't care it will then tell their parents and the parents have to turn this on I  Don't really have a problem with that. But I think that the fundamental issue Ben does have is  None of this stuff should be happening on your phone  This isn't this isn't Apple's to  To do and what the EFF CDT Matthew Green many others have said there's a petition going around with last time  7,000 signatures, I'm sure it's more than that from some of the most prestigious cryptographers and  internet thinkers  Says this is a slippery slope Apple if you do this for child pornography  You've effectively announced that you have this technology  You will be put under intense pressure to do the same kind of thing for homosexual images in countries where it's illegal to be gay  For they worry some some are worried about trans kids who are in transition sending pictures and getting busted  and and  beat by their parents things like that, so  That's the in a nutshell if I I hope I've said that accurately  That's a good explanation. That's basically what's going on and people so I'll do a devil's advocate here playing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  my Leo hat on  Two things one is  Either we mean it or we don't that we want to stamp out all possibilities of  Child porn and  If we do then we've got to acknowledge that priority and if we don't really mean it  It's only in certain places then do we really mean it?  second point is  The line between you know as  As Google announces tensor coming on to our phones  The line between oh, it's in the cloud or it's on their server. It's on our phone becomes more and more meaningless and  And the back-and-forth of where things are and where they're  Analyzed for whatever reason is going to become more and more meaningless. So you could see a point where  Fine I don't have to put any of my child porn photos up on the cloud  I can have tons of them on the device that Apple provides and  Apple has the mechanism to find it out and do something about it and do we as a society  What's our priority here the worry about the slippery slope which Lord knows I always agree with and always worry about  But it's a classic case as I think Stacey would say we need to discuss this because  There's two priorities here in conflict and  And I think that there is an argument that says if we mean it about child porn then we mean it about child porn  it shouldn't be anywhere and  That we're all going to accede to this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anybody want to respond or shall I Jeff did a great job with

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Saying what I would say so good job Jeff. You're right  Oh  I'm a little concerned because you were playing devil's advocate  We should of course establish that nobody here is arguing in favor of child porn

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everybody agrees as this is reprehensible at all. How much do you mean it? Yeah. Yeah. Well  This is my problem with what you said you could say that about a lot of things  The question is how far are you willing to go?  Should I put a camera in your house to make sure that you're not looking at child porn in your private collection?  That would work. Should I go that far? How far do I have the question is how far do we want to go?  And that's why in the United States in the Constitution  There is an amendment to prevent unreasonable search and seizure  There is an amendment to prevent unreasonable search and seizure that there is a it is it is presumed  I think by that Fourth Amendment that yeah, you could eliminate all crime if you were willing to keep station police in every house  but we don't do that that there that we have a  Constitutional limit set on how far we'll go to stop all crime

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but we're about to have that world and that's why we need to have these discussions because  When we have cameras everywhere it is completely possible to say to someone hey, you know what you've been convicted  You're you're  What do they call them?  You have a history of that arrest or I don't know. You're a predator  Register you go  Sex offender. Yeah. Thank you. Sorry. So we we might be able in the future  We could do it today actually say hey, you know what your registered sex offender  We're gonna need you to put this camera right here if you want access  But we already do things like take computer access and broadband access away from people who commit computer crimes  But we don't go in their house and watch them  Well, we don't today  It's possible that you could use things like so is your the question is is Apple's cloud your house?  No, is your phone your house?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's it actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've had like if you look at the way we're treating phones at the border, it's not your house  Right if you look at I have problems with that too, by the way  Well, yeah, and that's why we need to talk about this because what they what the court's done is suspend the Fourth Amendment

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In border crossings. They say it doesn't hold right? You're not protected. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  we need to have this conversation because we need to build new laws to  Meet us where we're at with the type of technology we have and so, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right. I think the Constitution here's the thing  I think the Constitution is actually really good on this and that you really  Shouldn't have there is such a thing as unreasonable search and seizure and the courts have been very good at saying there's the line  Now I agree Stacy there. I don't have any problem. I have no problem with cloud storage. That's my stuff on their computer  I have

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Computers into Best Buy we've actually said hey if you bring your computer with child port on it into Best Buy and Best Buy  Technicians find your child porn they they have a duty to report

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't have a choice. They have a duty to report and that's fine. I don't have a problem with that  I have a problem with us snooping in people's private homes, but I think you raised a really interesting question  Somewhere in between their cloud and my home is this thing this smartphone  What is that and that's a right you raise a really interesting question there Stacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh floss weekly this morning Doc Searles and and Sean Powers and Jonathan Bennett  They were talking about this because yeah, it even made it to the open source show  But the just the thought of who what exactly do you own as the computer?  Is if you own this phone, what are your rights to this and and can you just say hey I own this phone  I don't need you snooping on and I know this says Apple iPhone, but this is my phone  You you don't have to write to snoop on my phone  Versus going to say a Facebook and put in your stuff on Facebook servers. Then yeah Facebook says, you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, we don't want this on our on our servers. I think that is so actually the conversation going on in this country right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, what protection but we've the phone have we've had it before so watch out here comes a Jeff moment in history  Should we have a drum roll for this?  It's a moment  History

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bring back the harps the medieval harps. Yeah, so do we ever they never left  So so I don't listen to it afterwards, yeah, I never hear it either that's why I shouldn't be held responsible

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, go ahead. That's right. So in my fun in my fun moments and boy, I'm a fun guy. I am reading  Or just read the history and present condition of newspaper and periodical press the United States from the 1880 census  and  in 1835  The postmaster general was dealing with the case where the southern states  Said that state laws restricted the circulation of incendiary newspapers. Guess what they were incendiary about  abolitionist newspapers and were  Requiring the US Postal Service to  Find out what was in that mail newspapers but other things as well and prevent its circulation into those states Wow  So that as President Jackson said  I must invite your attention to the painful excitement produced in the South by attempts to circulate through the mails  Inflammatory appeals addressed to the passions of the slaves in print and in various publications calculated to stimulate them to insurrection  And to produce the whole the horrors of a servile war  So boy, Andrew Jackson was a real winner real piece of work winning and then and then there's I'm now reading this book  Which is really really good. It's amazing  The man who hated woman about Andrew Cobb stock the guy who was at the Postal Service  Who tried to get rid of pornography and abortion and women's rights and free love and all this other stuff  So the the Postal Service right was that same kind of analog here to your phone well

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not your home. I was under the impression. They can't do that. Can they can they will since then since then your first

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  First well your first-class male is  Sacrificed except against a warrant. This is the argument  I've made many times in the show

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I am older and that's by the way how your house is protected as well  Because if if there's reasonable cause a judge can issue a warrant and police can come in and look for child porn

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But this is the problem with why the right was written to the technology of the US mail first-class  Rather than to the concept of private messaging  This is why your DMS and your emails are not protected like your first-class US mail is  Because it was written to the technology and it's being enforced to the specific of well your US mail first-class protected  But nothing else is now in the mails itself  Postcards as we said a couple weeks ago are not protected because they can be seen  And if Cliff Claven sees you have child porn your postcard. Well, then Cliff has to turn you in  and  Neither newspapers to at the time right they were just they were just being carried  And in fact there was there was a time when newspapers were delivered free by the Postal Service within the same county within 30 miles  As a subsidy to newspapers, right? So so there was a question there about well, what's a newspaper or not?  What's incendiary or not? What's subversive or not? And isn't that echoing?  What we have today in all of these discussions whether it's political  Insurrection as it was then or whether it's pornography in the form of advocating  abortion  Let me read the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sexuality, let me read the Fourth Amendment because I think it's very clear  This is this is in the Constitution the right of the people to be secure in their persons  houses  papers and effects  persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable  Searches and seizures shall not be violated and no warrants shall issue but upon probable probable cause  It's very recent in legal history that that came to become a doctrine I understand but but it is our  Constitution it is it is the holy  You know wasn't interpreted this way until fairly recently. I understand but I agree with your I think persons houses papers and effects  Means my person things on my person, but I think a phone could very reasonably qualify as effects

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think your papers or your do your papers have to be in that interpretation  Do your papers have to be in your possession or if they're your papers? No, no, I think and they're seen somewhere else

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think this implies the males. I think it applies in your personal space, you know your person  How's that your car? That was the other issue?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is why sending documents and pornography over the cloud become a problem or sending them off of your device  How would they get on your device without transmitting through it like the internet is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I could put no no, I can I could take a picture and put it's on my device. It hasn't gone through the internet  Okay. Well, that's true. So and and by the way you affirmed this  Apple says all you have to do to disable this is to turn off iCloud photo storage  Which is an option Apple says not our problem. Yeah, if you turn off iCloud photo storage  The database will be on your phone because it's gonna be on every phone, but it won't we won't be doing any scanning  so I think  That's maybe Apple's way of saying you don't have to do this. You don't have to put up with this  but I think the four look  The Constitution seems very clear and I think we should honor it and I think your  Your phone counts as either papers or effects or both. It's your stuff and it should be secure from  unreasonable search and seizure so

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I just looked up probably I'll get I'll get as I use the words child porn in a search

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  USPS and child pornography look at the chilling effect, by the way  They're watching

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, okay. I think the chilling effect is my god. What if you actually pull up child porn not for me  I don't think Jeff's worry is that the feds are coming after him  I think Jeff's legit worry is he might see something he cannot see in this situation

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and if I do see it if I do see it I have a legal responsibility to report it and if I don't report  It in the right way. I have liability of the yin-yang. I could up a jail  Yeah, the law this is this is part of discussion is we're moving lines  No, no governor Cuomo the line for you didn't move you just didn't know it  But we are moving lines in terms of you went of our have to  He screwed over my school. So to hell with you governor  soon to be ex-governor  And so we're having us as again Stacy would say we're having this discussion. So what is the discussion?  We are intolerant and properly so of child porn. We are intolerant of  Insurrection we're intolerant of other things. All right, what is the protection of?  Society against those things how far are we willing to go as a society and when we say to Facebook or Twitter or  Google or Apple you must get rid of this laundry list of things  Okay, why does this stop at them then the USPS says that they investigate things?  Most things now involve both the US mail and the internet. So the Postal Service is involved in in this  Do we say that's the right thing because we all in fact do hate child porn and want to stamp it out or  Where is there a limit here? That's a discussion to be had and well and as we as we  Put other things on the list of intolerance as I would agree with pretty things on that list  Then we've got to decide in each case how far we're willing to go are we gonna require  Facebook and Twitter and Google like Germany does to take down certain things or else their asses brass or  Are we gonna say that that's their right to do and when they take down Rand Paul off YouTube  And I got people after me on Twitter today say well, it's Google sensory. Oh my god. Well, that's Google's right  Yes, Google's right, right. So  This is the discussion we're having  Level where where what's what is your personal effect is changing, right? Yeah, but I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But this is directly an answer to your hypothetical. Yes. We're against child pornography  We're against a lot of things but there is a clear bright line about how far we go  We could do a better job of law enforcement across the board  But we aren't willing to  Violate the Fourth Amendment. That's why the Fourth Amendment is there because there they didn't want the British coming into their houses. I  Mean it was a very real concern for for the framers. So I think it's pretty darn clear and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Anything different in this discussion than the last ten you've had on this. Yeah, actually there was it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you're the first ones ever argued that we should that we should do that was advocate  Yeah  Yeah, I  Think I really again. I just want to say I think Ben nailed it search the cloud. That's fine. That's your cloud  You don't have to put up with that  But stay off my personal effects and that's the phone. Let me give you one more hypothetical

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What if we have so discourse is?  Federated right discord discord is federated. Yes. Yeah, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe this is a bad example. No, I think the company runs all the servers. It's not technically federated  All right. So let's imagine there's a good thing. There's a mastodon which is we have a mastodon instance at twit.social  That is federated. I run my server many other servers out there including by the way adult servers

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you run do you end up trafficking anything from any other servers other than your own you do unless you block it?  So right, so let's just say you don't block it. Let's just say right  And so you're part of a federation where stuffs moving through your servers by default there are a list of servers now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to say when you install it there is a canonical list of servers you can review and the people who run it  Don't put child porn servers on there so you could conceive of somebody  porn server, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does it surreptitiously? Yeah, it gets through it is on your server that is sitting in your living room, right?  You didn't do it, but it's there in your house  Hmm. What say you sir?  Where's the line there in a federated world? I'm trying to help out the with the architecture changes. How do we deal with those those?  new situations

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's it. I mean, I don't I don't think you should be held culpable for it if  It's reasonable that you had no idea if you took an affirmative step of some kind to  Host it then clearly you're culpable, but I will let's go to the next step

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What if what if there is a presumption that that there there there's easy?  What's it called? Nick Nick Nick sick Nick Nick mech  NCM EC

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nick  Center for child and for missing and exploited children, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, so this so there's an easy way you're technical technologically  Well, that's the thing there is an easy way to do it. Apple should take didn't for a long time and now does so that's it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a perfectly so should everybody who has any host does that sort of thing? Should they be responsible? Should they carry?  Yeah, should they be around this is that percent? Oh hash is that I that's an interesting question. Yeah, I think it's reasonable to say that  I don't I wouldn't particularly want to do it, but you're right  I'm hosting if I'm hosting material other people put there and I don't make an effort to  Check it. I should have some sort of system to check it. Yes. Hello section 230 to right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's it's it's it's it goes to intermediary liability, too  And so it raises all of these interesting questions and and and I think we have to have so Facebook's a good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Discussions, they're liable for any bit of child pornography that's on their service, right? That's they are liable

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They are they are they are expected to go hunting for it and they do

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they also it's tolerated if they miss something they it's understood they're doing their best, right?  Yes, I think in their case stuff and I think that's maybe what Apple is starting to feel the heat about is  Are you really doing your best if you only found 265 examples?  bingo  And I obviously Apple decided  Whether proactively or in response to heat that they ought to do something about this and I commend them on that fine  I don't have any problem with them scanning the their their  iCloud  Do we all agree? That's fine  Anybody disagree? No. Yeah  Does anybody disagree now you I know you were being?  Devils advocate, but but in reality does anybody disagree that searching the phone is a step too far. I  don't know I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Feel like that's something we have to come to as a group  The way they're searching the phone  Feels like a good  Option if we really are serious about preventing child child porn, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the technology has been proven to be so good  In the hashing I've never heard complaints that the hashing got the false  positives

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay. Now I will bring in that's interesting testimony  from somebody who does perceptual hashing who  actually thinks that  Apple is over stating its capabilities  This is from Renna founder comm  this guy  Does forensic that pardon me? Who's that who is who is rent a founder? It's Oliver. He lives in Berlin  Yeah, but he does forensic perceptual hashing so he actually knows a lot about the perceptual hashing technology  He wrote a piece called the problem with perceptual hashes. I won't rehash the hash  I'll let you read it if you're interested, but he he says here's an example of a false positive  We find we're trying to find this image  The algorithm finds this image and it's because the way the algorithm works  He says in the context of a hundred million photos, which isn't that many they do fail quite often and they don't fail in acceptable ways

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So here's where we could get audits  So this is a really interesting one of the controls in using AI for things is going to have to be public  Audits of how well this works, right? So it's possible that we could say to Apple. Hey, you know what?  It's a big step. We're asking, you know, you're asking us to take let's test it out. Let's give you know  We'd like to move over to research

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's completely we'd like to know more because Apple's claiming this one in a trillion and as Oliver points out  That's just a made-up number. There's no way you would have any idea of how  Many false positives you had that's that's the issue is exactly what you said

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and if you do send it to people to check in the final version, that's a really good parameter  so I mean it  This guy may not be completely wrong, but he may be overstating his case as well  So somewhere in the but if we had a way to test it  Then you know  We could we could actually come to this with the right information to say is this a good idea or not the same way?  We could have a conversation about hey, should we let?  Algorithms determine if people get bail. Well, let's take a look at what happens when we do and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And also facial recognition would say that if if someone can get  Arrested and shot down because of bad facial recognition, then I agree with you  We shouldn't allow it in that case. But if there are the checks to say this is just  one  Signal and there are proper checks in like warrants. Yeah, but I would evidence there's no warrant

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That system I would point out I  Mean, it's you're not gonna go to jail  But let's say you're falsely there's a false positive in your flag  It's sent to Apple somebody unknown person at Apple is now looking at your private pictures  And it may say oh, you know, that's just Leo's pick. That's not child pornography. It's okay  That's the animal abuse we found  Yeah, but I'm just saying  That's that you're not getting arrested  But your pictures your personal pictures are being sent to an unnamed employee at Apple for review  If there's false positives and and you know, this is what Oliver says  Does it Apple have the manpower in place to iron out their shortcomings their algorithm shortcomings we can only hope so  perceptual hazards are messy  The fact that an image the simple fact that image data is reduced to a small number of bits leads to collisions and therefore false positives  When such algorithms are used to detect criminal activities, especially at Apple scale many innocent people can potentially face serious problems  And so that's a reasonable cause for concern. I think Stacey you nailed it Apple needs to demonstrate  This one in a trillion they need to they need to show us not just say look. Here's some hand-waving  We're gonna do it. You could trust us  And I don't think it should be on my phone, honestly

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think having the person involved is essential simply because every algorithm is going to  Things are going to be not what we want  I don't know if y'all did the New York Times did a great thing about it was there the bail algorithm and they talked about  Like building equity and justice into these and they showed the trade-offs that you end up making  And I know that's new voting. We all hate that. I end up putting against that in California

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was at first because I hate money bail. I think that's a bad solution  But I was convinced by the NAACP and others that you know, the algorithm isn't better

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so so if you look at that we've got to realize that the algorithm is not going to be perfect  It's going to mess things up, but we need to know where it's gonna mess things up and then we have to have  Steps in place to say, okay  Well, this is how we will fix this just like Facebook with their you know, didn't want to show was it nipples?  So they wouldn't show breastfeeding moms, you know, someone had to get involved. Yeah  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  or the classic now is the is the  child  Napalm photo Associated Press from Vietnam  right it ticked off every box naked child in danger and  As we've discussed the show before and so it's not just the algorithm  It's also then the human being and that guy's a human being said take it down and the human being made a decision that was  Journalistically insane

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, right and you posted in the show notes something that they were discussing on floss weekly this morning  Which is Mike Maznik's article on tech dirt  The end of ownership how big companies are trying to turn everyone into renters and this ties into that this dovetails into that because

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's really the question post that but we did talk about yeah  About that and I thought you put it link. I think that's mr. Jarvis is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the question is it do I rent this phone?  This is my phone does Apple on this phone, you know Apple probably would say, you know  You might think you own this phone, but we have the right to do this because in fact, is it your McFlurry machine?  Yeah, there's another one  So there's another one fat  It's really fascinating and this is what we talk about on this show and it's I don't think it's easily solved  But and I suspect Apple is gonna go full speed ahead, but it's good. They had the conversation  Everybody's talking about this. It's interesting  This is there are some privacy issues that only we talk about and you know our circle and  All which means all the people listen to our shows and there's some things that have really the  Get the attention of everybody and I think this one did  Am I wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's it's a in Cindy or everyone has an iPhone and  Most people have a pretty visceral reaction to child porn and privacy. So this was a wonderful confluence of events

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and then Jeff would point out  That's why whenever  Somebody you know police agency wants to go a step further in surveilling you they always invoke women and children  Because nobody's in favor of child-borne moral panic. Yeah, it's the this is the  epitome of moral panic

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who Leo said it? Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At least I invoked you when I said it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nice try to hide behind me fella. Yeah, you're moral panic. Yeah my moral panic

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This week a time for a quick break and then let's talk about what Samsung announced this morning  We also have a Google changelog Jeff Jarvis Stacey Higginbotham and  Pruitt  This is a good group I feel like we're all is and we can talk  You know about difficult topics honestly and with with candor because we're amongst friends. Yep  Actually, we've had good conversations on every show about this. I don't think we've come to a solution but  Wait, do we get to the study?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's just a series of trade-offs we have to work from and boy people hate that  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually and in this context Chatterham's reminded me of Cory Doctorow. I just love Cory Doctorow's yeah  Article Canada has the worst internet ideas. They're about to pass a harmful content

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Regulation just awful. Oh boy. It's like they took the worst of the world. Yeah, put it in a law

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, a requirement to remove lawful but awful speech that is allowed under Canadian law  But effectively now also banned under Canadian law  24-hour deadlines for removal  a de facto requirement for platforms to install algorithmic filters to  Identify and misidentify and remove prohibited expression and huge penalties for failing to remove banned  speech

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Plus no penalties for erroneously taking down permitted speech, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Plus a Chinese-style national firewall that will block websites that refuse to comply. Oh  Boy, holy moly. Oh boy. It is awful. Oh my goodness. Oh Canada. What have you done? Oh Canada?  It is not yet law

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But but the politics would point toward it passing. Yeah  Anyway, this is this is why this is why Jeff  gets nervous  About well, we should get rid of all the stuff we must do this and then look how an extent look out  is the German hate speech law and right to be forgotten and  Nets tg and  So on and so forth end up  Metastasizing in Australia and Canada and otherwise sane countries forget the insane countries like Turkey and  Hungary and China  Even in the same countries now this this pardon me moral panic gets the point that people say something must be done  So let's just do it. So you have Amy Klobuchar as bad law. You have a lot of really bad 230 laws in the US  That's what worries me. I'm not defending Facebook or even Google or Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Defending the internet and the freedoms we have there does seem I'll back you up on this a knee-jerk response to the threats that the internet poses  That in almost every case are worse than the problem and this is clearly one of the presumption I saw Kevin Ruse went after

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's gonna kill me the now CEO of  Instagram formerly I had of the newsfeed at Facebook Kevin system. Thank you. No, no, no, no the current  This is so embarrassing and I'm sorry  So Adam is sorry said something I say all the time just  Yes, the internet does has bad things but also has good things  He says I think the good always the bad and roost just goes after him. How do you know that?  Well, Kevin, how do you know that's not the case either? It's just a  statement of feeling  That's an impossible data set together  But but the knee-jerk response is someone defends the internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here comes the journalist. Oh, I can't be actually I can I can answer Kevin's  With a simple thought experiment would we be better off?  Today the way it is or if there were zero internet, right?  And a corner which would be a better situation  Which is the one you want to live in today's internet turned off internet, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh and also if we turned off Facebook completely today  Would all of our problems of racism and hate and lies go away? No, but a lot of them would

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe Mark Zuckerberg would go away. Oh, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I might have to disagree with you on that one. I hate Facebook as much as I hate Facebook  It is nice to know that there they've given voice

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To say people that don't necessarily voice and and Jeff said that of course the chief example of this is the  Video that was posted  Of George Floyd getting George Floyd. Yes without that video. There'll be no prosecution. There would have been no conviction  There would it would have been just another day. Yes. So you're right  I mean, maybe she would have posted on Twitter or somewhere else, but that's where it was posted Facebook. Mm-hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you were you were headed into a nice commercial break. Yeah  What happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tried not to get too involved in this comment or this the section you want to break. I just want I just I just

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just want a little credit for having demolished Kevin Ruse's argument. Thank you. Yeah, did I not?  Yes, you did. Yes, you did

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Plus you now you've you've earned the money the sponsor is going to bring you. Yes. Oh don't think it goes to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not to me talk about how to make some extra money

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, actually, actually this is a really, you know  I sit down as an old guy and lecture my kids and young people all the time  It's something somebody told me and actually I was probably in my 30s before I heard this  But they said put money away every day for your retirement  The magic of compound interest and I have to say looking back. I thank God I got that advice  I was working somewhere where there was this brand new thing called a 401k and I have ever since  No matter how little I got paid put at least a small percentage of my income into a 401k and today I  Have I can retire I?  Was able to buy a house  You know we could talk about diamond hands and stonk memes and rocket ships that is not gonna  Do the job day trading is basically going to Las Vegas.

Transcript:  She's got issues, but boy our last one had issues  He he does we we we read it can't say that word by the way no more. That's right. That's right  He

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You've been quomoed I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Think it was 2.5 million dollars to rebuild a floor that we went ahead and rented that I have to raise money to pay  The rent on and it's not rebuilt. You know it's funny

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  before covid  Cuomo had a terrible reputation and then he was he was so front and center and and it seemingly so in command and did a good  Job in a I feel so used and so dirty  Thinking I liked him for a little while. Yeah, everybody liked him. So this is how it should be  But it was only yeah, same thing, but I did about New York something about New York all the best people cover  But but the good ones moved to Florida, right  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Samsung do what stays oh no, I was gonna throw a story out there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But let's talk about Samsung. We'll do that quickly and then you could throw out your story since I said yes word

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The galaxy full did everybody start saying no worries. Why did we all become Canadian?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Australian this is Australian. No worries, mate. No, no worries. No walking furries, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When did we all become Australian by the way, we all did everybody says it it's better than the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Late 1980s, you know what Australians say when we start saying my bad is that from the States? I hate that  You mean you did something wrong  That's not a good Australia. That's cockney. Yeah. No, I don't know. I can't  Michael for the transportation cane on the brain. So  Look at the price  Twice of the galaxy fold  Galaxy zed fold 3 now. I have a fold 2 which I paid fifteen hundred dollars for it is now  $1,700 and 99  1,799 buckaroos. Nope, that's beyond  Never doing it mr. Pruitt wins the lottery

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's still not gonna do it mr. Pruitt is too smart to spend that much money on a damn phone  Right mr. Pruitt that is correct, sir

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I like to think that anyway that the only credit I can give about this phone is the the digitizer  Tech that they put in there to where they split it up into two different digitizers to work with the fold  While you have a lot of money  Fold  While you have a stylist and you can actually go across the stylist without any issues  Across the screen with the styles without any issues. That's as it I've had a fold to it's been

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't really like it. There is  Baseball has it there's this guy  A good-looking guy  he was  Mario Mendoza second baseman for the  Our shortstop, I'm sorry for the Pittsburgh Pirates  Who is batting average about 200 they he's been memorialized in baseball with the phrase the Mendoza line  If you're batting average is below 200 one in five hits you're below the Mendoza line  We need a Mendoza line for phone prices and I think I gotta say anything above a thousand bucks

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What are you smoking no can't do it too much

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's that's more than a laptop 1799 that's is it crazy obviously a Samsung doesn't think so

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or do they do it just to say look how cool we are they're very good about

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Trade-in a lot of people are getting their flip phones or their or their fold three with trading in old  Samsung phone and getting enough off so it's not as crazy, but so it goes from

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  1700 to 1200 yeah still yeah, no no Stacey. Oh, sorry. You were starting to say something nice up on you. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that's okay. I was I was just thinking about oh  there there is an audience for these high-priced phones and  Eventually, I mean it'll come down in price as the component scale. I mean it's not though

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the thing the full two was $1,500 it's going up nobody nobody's buying it what's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's only for working on it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Miss optimism

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Again, I'm excited like that. They're pushing so hard on this concept  It may turn out to be economically unfeasible, but I like what they're doing enough people  Hopefully we'll buy it that they're like let's keep trying and maybe we'll end up pushing the price down  I mean like at $1,000 would you buy this phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nope

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't mind the price so much. I'm not a fan of folding phones as I said  I had the fold to pay the crazy 1500 bucks for it  After a while with not a lot of use the screen  That comes with a kind of almost a rubbery screen protector started a bubble and so I peeled it off against my better instincts  Remember the original Samsung Galaxy fold you peeled it off. It broke it in this case  I looked I read on reddit and stuff  They said you can take it off and in fact Samsung has a service that will replace it for some fee  But I just took it off and it's fine and it's much actually a much nicer phone  But I don't feel I feel like this is a flimsy technology now. Maybe they've they've improved it  They say the protective film is now 80% stronger  Okay, I  Feel like anything that's foldable is not gonna be so it's so Stacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You seem excited about the potential for it. What's the use case for folding?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That you have a smaller footprint of a device that then you can expand your screen size  It's like a tablet in your pocket. I mean, that's that's all it is, but it's a pretty powerful concept  I agree I dig that I would say if you could figure out how to  if you're thinking ahead to like software development on this thing and  Designing for two screens right two separate screens running together  So you could either have one app on each side or a unified app running across both  Then it becomes interesting if you think about  having VR apps with you know, one eye getting this information another eye getting this information or kind of  Interactive screens that are and I'm just thinking about like we need these kind of middle ground hardware steps to get us to  That future where we're like throwing up screens everywhere and tap and stuff. I don't know. I'm excited just cuz I like I  Like innovation. I like people trying and if it's a dead end, it's a dead end

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you know, I completely see you I could play and Samsung makes so much money on its it has a hundred different models  And they make so much money on the other models that I think it's reasonable for them to say okay  And we're gonna offer one model. It's so expensive  Nobody, you know, it's a fair limited limited number of people but we can try things for instance  the camera on the  Inside is  Goes through the screen. There's no hole punch. There's no notch. That's cool  Yeah, that's good. I mean we want to see those kinds of innovations other phones will eventually have them  I'm sure actually the new Google pixel 6  It has a through the screen and fingerprint reader which others have done before but I'm that's that's you got us

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's got to be innovation. So miss Stacey. You're saying this is more like a pilot  Program is how we should look at this. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can't like they're trying an idea  It is maybe Samsung doesn't think they're doing it but that's what's happening here

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They pitched gaming  Content, you know watching movies  They pitched you know, this is this is they showed how  Applications can much as you would on a computer have two panes or even more  You know as you read your email the lists on the left the mail is on the right  All of those things are nice on a bigger screen  You know some of this comes from the fact that  Apple's just completely dominant in the tablet space Samsung's the next biggest competitor  But I think Apple just owns them with the iPad and okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So is that a different way to say that this is a way to to?  Blaze a trail toward reinvigorating the tablets. Yeah. Yeah. Well and remember that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know  Samsung's does sell tablets, but Apple doesn't have anything in this kind of smaller mid-range  So there's something that's somewhere in the continuum between a phone and a tablet  Samsung's for years was laughed at for making the note  People said oh, that's such a big phone nobody and it and it was a huge success  And because of it now everybody else is making big phones, right?  Samsung showed the way with a note so it could very well be something like that. They've they've have a history of that  I would not buy when having had the the fold to I don't think the full three is gonna be  You know things like the aluminum in the fold threes hinge is now ten percent stronger. Oh  Well, that's a relief

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Somebody coming out of the lab waving a report

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's just the marketing people like well, okay  We got a little we don't have metrics on these yet, so let's focus on this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a there is a problem with these phones because you can't really put a case on them  the Samsung case that they sold in the fold to was just a shell that went over one side of it and  so you're carrying this thing which costs a horrific amount of money is  Undoubtedly very fragile and you don't there's no even way to protect it  When I was shooting pictures with my fold to it's like don't drop it Leo  $1,500 down the tubes. It's just scary. And so there's there's issues, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and I feel like from a marketing perspective if if Apple had brought us a foldable phone  They would not be telling us the hinges are ten percent stronger. They would distract us from the frailty of it by telling us  Now your phone is like a book or a world with you know, right?  Y'all would be more excited if Samsung's marketing team were a little less, you know  We got to address this issue of the the wimpy the wimpy fold, you know, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know  There's a reason Apple doesn't make one. I guess

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they'll make one of Samsung can make this feasible and I guarantee someone at Apple is thinking about foldable phones and oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sure they have prototypes you bet

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think with their phone this I'm sorry  Folding phone aside. I got a tweet from Monkman last week basically saying okay  Thousand dollar phones. Why is it not worth it to me? Don't I use a phone every single day and  My logic is okay if I use it every single day  That doesn't necessarily make it worth thousand dollars if I can't run certain things on it on a smaller screen  That a laptop can do for me on a bigger screen. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mean I'm the guy who paid twenty four hundred dollars for an iPad. I'm not  No, no, I'm not completely  averse to  Overspending on technology. It's just wrong  But I don't anticipate sitting in a tree in a beautiful yellow print dress  Staring at my folding phone. This just doesn't look like something I'm gonna be doing  It's it isn't quite big enough to be honest with you. It's big  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Great. What about the flip the flip? Have you looked at the Samsung flip? Because that's basically a flip phone  That's even smaller and I think that's kind of cool looking. That's a that looks great

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Another nice engineering feat looks looks great and they added the larger  Outer screen on it. It's actually functional. That's that's great  Still not paying a thousand dollars for it

Yes  It's 120 Hertz main screen  It's got a lot of the features of the top flagship phones these days  I have to say I'm much more excited about the pixel 6 which was probably why Google pre-announced that right?  Because that now I'm not even tempted. It's like I know a pixel 6 is coming in a couple of months. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Haven't bought a Samsung phone since the Galaxy Nexus. Oh, I know you're a Samsung guy for some reason  Never I I like the note.

Transcript:  Have to say the cameras are pretty good in Samsung. They do they are over  Yep  You know if you look at Paul Thurad's Instagram, he's been posting  pictures using his wife's  Samsung Galaxy s20 and  They really look good there. It's a good camera for what he's using it for which is yeah kind of he's in Mexico  He's just going around taking pictures of food and stuff. Yeah, and it's it's great. I mean, these are beautiful images  They're not aunt Pruitt beautiful. Oh looks great. They're nice, right? Yeah, I totally agree. Yeah  So that's I think that's the market and the camera and in the galaxy is gonna be similar  I think just as good but what's neat about the galaxy?  For this this is the case for the fold you get a great big viewfinder  And when I was shooting pictures when I wasn't worried about dropping the thing  It was really nice to be able to see an image

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The size of a print right? Yeah, that's that's cool inside of light room

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I've been lately I've been using my iPad for doing photo editing because it's nice to see it  You know on a beautiful screen at just about that much on it. You gotta do something with it. I know  Okay, that's actually that's actually the truth that's that's the real reason I'm  Our strongest aluminum frame yet, it's super strong yet like 10% stronger tempers it's like a suit of armor  But what is the suit of armor protect the interior parts of the hinge they're really protected

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, we get we don't good today recognize that problem though with the hinge  Yeah, I did enjoy that little  motion-gravit that they put up to show how they've  Addressed that problem because it's been that much money and a drop of water get in there and ruin it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's oh or sand people were getting grit. Yeah early phones. So I would I maybe I should get a flip  What do you think this one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Magazine  Women and they decided to make it purse size because all the men decided that's what they should do a purse sized cheese

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is what I don't like about the flip is  It's it looks like a clothespin on the side. There's this gap  Oh the air gap Microsoft did the same thing  I don't like that. It bugs me  It should fold flat. That's good. So CD so well, it's so the screen doesn't hit a screen. Yeah, that's definitely I agree. Yeah  All right, I'm not gonna buy it I just I just got completely turned off. All right, it's fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't want to spend a thousand dollars on that phone  No, but I would do it for like 750 well with trade-in effect

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's somebody in our discord who's getting it. I think for 400 or something with trade-in so oh nice  But I've only got a pixel. Yeah, you'd have to have a good trading. Did you notice them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Previously they wouldn't even mention Android right there never said patients. Yeah, but now with wear OS it was sort of  Jarring to hear them even mention wear OS  Teaming up with the Tizen version, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm actually I think this has been this is good for both Google and  Samsung finally Samsung admits that yeah, we're using right. Yeah, you got a problem with that  and and I actually I'm gonna buy this watch because  The problem with the wear watch all along was Google specified the hardware platform  And it was a really anemic Qualcomm processor that had poor battery life now  They're gonna use a much more modern Samsung processor. That's what Google got out of this Tizen deal  so I actually ordered a  Galaxy watch for classic because it's got that I really have you ever used one of these with a spinning bezel the bezel

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would be the route. I wanted it to go. Yeah, I  Always like their original gear for watches and I'm sorry  Sounds like somebody's phone is ringing here in the house that they won't pick up  But I've always liked the larger watch faces just because I have larger hands  So back then you had to have a galaxy phone and all of that stuff with it. But now I like this option

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm thinking this and the pixel 6 and  And maybe this is my answer to Apple's privacy. The privacy issue is just go to a privacy folk much more privacy centric  Device I don't know. I didn't buy the LTE version because I don't want to be always  Connected to the network. I  Don't know. We'll see I'll get it. I'll let you know I'll give you a review  I'm sure Jason will have a review of both the flip and the fold. I  Pray to God he's not buying it with my credit card  What was what was the story you wanted to bring up Stacy now that we've covered that I was excited about Google's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  work on protecting teens and  There were a couple good things that I thought was worth talking about just probably because I have a teenager  but like, you know, I've complained a long time about like  Most of the policies are addressed to like kids at the age of 13. They're like, oh 13  You're an adult now according to the DCMA and sorry not the DC may you're on your own

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, or DACA or whatever it is. I can never all these  I dream of being 18 someday

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So yeah, basically you're on your own. Here's the whole wide world of the internet and you're like  Yeah, 13 year old really isn't ready for that. So Google's done some good things. They they've talked about  Not advertising certain classes to them, but I really thought was great that it lets kids pull their images before the age of 13  yes, and  That's so key because you know one your parents we didn't do this to our kid  But parents put up images that kids may not want we had this I wish you could everybody could do this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But this is not the right to be forgotten this is well it is but it's the right to be forgotten for it under

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the right to be stupid when you're a kid and not have that haunt you for the rest of your life

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Mindy Brooks general manager of Google kids and families  Wrote wrote up a blog post  If you are under 18 you or your parent or guardian can request the removal of your image from Google image results  That's not gonna remove it from the web obviously, but if you can't find it on Google it pretty much is pretty much doesn't exist  I have to think that gosh if I were in high school today  Does this remove it from Facebook? No, it's still on Facebook, but at least it doesn't show up in search, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. It's not if someone searches for your name  Like if you search for my name you get all kinds of images  But you know they aren't because people didn't have smartphones when I was a kid  You're not gonna find the I feel stupid images of me smoking a cigarette, you know, right while robbing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She only would do it while robbing liquor stores it wasn't yeah, yeah  It wasn't like I was a theater kid

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  occasionally like I remember because we used to have to get our photos developed and so like I would give them to my parents and  They would take them to like Walgreens develop them and then I remember getting in so much trouble because one of my friends was  Smoking a cigarette one of the pictures  And my parents saw  Yes, so those are the kind of things you're you're oh I did I was not allowed to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, I wasn't allowed to hang out with him anymore what and this by the way, this is this is Apple  This is the kid in the photo mark becomes the equivalent of Apple yeah, that's worse, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, that's a good point. Our pictures weren't private when we had to get them out of all

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, there were a bunch of cases about that you couldn't I mean if you want to look up child porn and photo development

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You go right ahead. I'm not going to give me your kid a bath and take a picture of it got people. Yeah trouble big trouble  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's actually a really good point  Actually a really good point

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Only we said it earlier  Anyway, I just thought this was really good and worth like I'm glad and it's because of and I should point this out  It's because of Google's doing this because of new regulations being introduced in other countries  Which to me is a signal that regulations can be helpful in driving  companies to do better because clearly  Google really didn't care about this until that point. I completely agree with you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  well, I'd say it's another way to look at it is  The way right to be forgotten exists I have a lot of objections to but it does it does take somebody sitting down and saying hmm  Forget regulation forget courts forget all of that  What power should an individual have over their own stuff? Yeah, it's an interesting question to then explore which is what Google's done in essence. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm glad you brought that up regulations, that's a good one  Okay, yeah and then well and we'll do it in the changelog  But there's other things Google is doing to give kids and families a better experience online

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, like turning off autoplay by default for kids under 18. We've talked about that a lot. Hallelujah  And they get break reminders, which I don't know about y'all  But when I'm in tik-tok and they give me the break reminders, do you ignore them?  Are they telling me? Well, I feel bad about them. I'm like, oh, you know what? They're probably right  But then I'm like, I will not let this app dictate me so watch two more videos and then I go off

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, just to show my independence. I'm gonna watch two more and then I'll take that I'm getting off

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll show you algorithm also

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  for kids for under 18  The default upload setting will be private for YouTube videos, which I think is a good safeguard  Absolutely, you could make it public, but it'll be private by default  There's also location history and other changes  But we'll talk about that in the cool changelog, which is still to come  Marjorie Taylor Greene strike for  You know baseball  Baseball you only get three. Yeah  She's got four one more though. You get five strikes on Twitter one more and she might get banned forever  I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna go out on a limb here make a prediction that that's her goal and you will have a fifth strike  Coming up to bat as we speak. Yes and swinging away  Last month last month Twitter instituted a five strikes policy  She has been banned now four times for tweets saying that coronavirus not dangerous if you're under 65  Not dangerous if you're under 65  And not fat  Actually, who's gonna ban Joe Rogan for saying all you got to do is eat right and not get fat. You'll be fine  Who's gonna ban Joe Rogan for though? His his company should Spotify ought to be saying something. Yes, they ought to be  You know, that's the problem with misinformation. You can't you can't shut it down. You can't  You know, I'm not gonna lie to you about that  The tweet was labeled as well there's there was an example today Leo, yeah of

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What was it I don't think I put on the rundown a  Somebody at Facebook or Twitter as we took down Russian disinformation that the vaccination turns you into a monkey

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know at some point has anybody wait a minute, but I'm just curious has anybody been turned into a monkey  Just well, that's the thing asking anybody's gonna believe that I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You give people no agency at all. You think that they're so stupid at some point  Maybe you let the stupidity out

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it just shows  Yeah, why cover for them? I  Don't know. I you know, I have mixed feelings because of course people who do believe  People like representative green and might in fact get influenced by that and get sick and die  You know, she's spreading bad information  Let's save some lives but

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then you have no data on  What the actual impact of these kinds of lies is we scream about how they're out there and my god every single morning now  Mika on morning Joe is screaming about Facebook being the source of all evil in the world  Yeah, and I repeat if we turn it off  It can't fix anything. Yeah, and I hope we will later get to the story about the sooper about

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think she should have been banned or no?  Sure, sir, I think they should do more actually have a banter they've just taken down the offending twice and I think they should  I think she's awful and they should she's not getting the message. Obviously. She wants the garden party rule

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well, this is their garden party  Yeah  If you can't if she came to my god forbid if she came to my garden party and said what she said  I would tell her to leave because it's my garden party. This is Twitter's garden party

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ron Paul  Banned from YouTube for seven days starting yesterday  He posted video claiming that cloth masks are not effective. Now that is more hazardous because a he's a doctor  He's a physician  Swords. Oh, yeah. Well, he's what an ophthalmologist, right?  I mean, it's not exactly his specialty, but he he get to get an MD to do that  The other problem is it's not true and it might discourage people from using from cloth masks  He says the most of the masks you get over the counter don't work  Of course Ron Paul immediately when Rand Paul and Rand I said Ron daddy  Daddy runs big daddy's big boy son big boy Rand  Paul took to Twitter to express his disagreement with YouTube's decision quote a badge of honor  Left-wing cretins at YouTube banning me for seven days for a video that quotes two peer-reviewed articles saying cloth masks don't work

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then you have Glenn Greenwald who's the band appears to?  screaming about how how this is an awful and evil that they would get rid of a US senator and they shouldn't do this and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a tough one we did that we did that survey that Twitter survey shows how hard it is to make these decisions  Yes, I think  you know and so there's a lot of things you could say that would be untrue that would not get you banned from Twitter or  YouTube but that there are things that are dangerous to public health  That you know, you probably don't want people to I think that's actually wrong. It's already. Yeah, I think that's the wrong standard

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that because we don't really know the danger I would argue  We don't we don't know how much people really are influenced by this and this alone and again  We're gonna get I'm gonna insist we get to the story later about about YouTube and political radicalization and the study thereof  So I think the standard is not that in this case, I think the standard is the Garden Party standard of saying  We just don't want you telling whatever the effect is  We just don't want this here on our place and it's our right not to have it and we're gonna tell you get off  No, I think that's the way to do it and and that requires them to set standards  And they're scared of that but I would like to see them start to set standards of their own  View of what should be on and off their platforms

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's do that YouTube story  Is that did you put that in here somewhere? I'm looking for I did

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Would it be under YouTube? Could it be under there? I don't know  Probably it is line 68. I know you don't like the line number. No, no, I love my way to get YouTube's algorithm

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is apparently according to a study?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By a bunch of people with Arab names, but okay, no no no no no no no including yes  David Rothschild and Duncan watch well, you know the Rothschilds

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, I'm just I'm bad. I'm sorry commission. I am so sorry. Don't forget. I even said this  Examining the consumption of radical content on YouTube is a study from Stanford  Oh, no, I'm sorry. It's edited by Stanford. It is a study from University of Pennsylvania Harvard Temple  Colorado UC Boulder  My son's alma mater Santa Fe Institute Microsoft research in the Annenberg School of Communications  Okay, I guess those are okay prestigious. I  Don't see Yale in there, but okay. I'll take Harvard. There's a reason why  Daily share of news consumption on YouTube a social media platform blah blah blah  We identify several distinct communities of news consumers including  Pick the one you think Jeff's in far right  anti-woke  Far right is small and not increasing in size over the observation period while anti-woke  I'm sorry a four-year period from 2016 and both grow in consumption per user

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But yet the anti-woke is very interesting because it is a huge growing part and it's not just you know  it's the Harper's letter, it's the  intellectual dark web people it's the  New York Times op-ed columnists who complained about cancel culture and  They don't realize how much they are being used by the far right which is what comes out of the study  Is it the the the sites who think of themselves as anti-woke don't think they're necessarily far right  But their viewers are far right and their messages are being used on the far right and it's a really interesting  Pickup that I haven't seen anywhere on this kind of new  school of  Thought so anyway keep going

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  representative panel 300,000 Americans  Looking at their individual level browsing behavior on and off YouTube January 2016 through January  We found news  I'm sorry December 2019 news consumption on YouTube is dominated by mainstream and largely centrist  sources  Consumers of far-right content while more engaged in average represent average or was it a small and stable percentage of news consumers?  but consumption of anti-woke content  grew steadily in popularity and is correlated with consumption of far-right off content off platform however  This is the point you wanted to make there's no evidence that engagement with far-right content is caused by YouTube recommendations

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  systematically so I  You can't get access to it because I'm a professor. I got access to the whole paper and read it all and  Thank you my library nor and they also looked at the pathways

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nor is there clear evidence that anti-woke channels serve as a gateway to the far right or right right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the pathways they looked at and they said the pathways by which users reach far-right videos are diverse and only a fraction can possibly  Can plausibly be attributed to platform recommendations? Where are those platforms primarily?  50% of far-right and right videos and more than 30% of anti-woke videos are begun after visiting a  Right or far-right news domain such as Fox News bright bar com or info wars calm  Or they're saying is is ain't just an algorithm on YouTube it ain't just YouTube it's  overarching not just the web it's also overarching media and  And that that's what we have to watch here and understand and so I think it was it was a good sensible report  Now the problem is because they only put out the summary people started reacting to that and and if you read the whole report  It's very good now some researchers say the problem here is they couldn't see what was being recommended to people and that's right  We want YouTube to release more data here so we can get a better sense of this  But they have what's important about this study is that they can see not just their YouTube behavior  Which is so often the case with these things because they use the Nielsen panel. They saw their behavior across multiple  Domains, but multiple media and multiple domains among media, which is really important Zainab Tufiki who is also a professor

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, and so got to read this said you got my hopes up  But that  Just said they didn't have the recommendation they they didn't have the recommendations so  But they acknowledge that fully in the paper. They need they need data from YouTube is what they mean you always need more data. Yes  Yeah  So I think this is a good preliminary study. I think it isn't you can't always say that you shouldn't do every study  Yeah, yeah, but it's not it's maybe premature to derive a hard  Conclusion from this but it's interesting and and we need to know more

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The hell was that what was that?

Transcript:  The firman paladins.com site and they said you're running an ad blocker they  Wait a minute, you're kidding me. Yeah, no ad blockers allowed. Oh man, I had to whitelist them  Uh university big I thought really good take down  Cory doctoro had two count them two links to his plural pluralistic dot net blog today. This is  The other one end of the line for uber. I thought this was really  Good. He says uber is a bezel  Be zz le it's a term. I wasn't familiar with he defines it as the magical interview interval  When a confidence trickster knows he has the money  But the victim does not yet understand he has lost it  And he makes a very strong case and quotes, uh a um  A blog that has been for the last several years  Talking about this, you know google. I mean uber's it's naked capitalism.com hubert horan  26 analysis 26 analyses of uber  and their uh quarterly results  In the conclusion hubert comes up with hubert comes up with as well as cori is  This was never designed to make money, you know, we all think oh, yeah uber's gonna make money someday maybe when self-driving vehicles  Never it was a con of amazon as well in its day. Yeah, but there is no there is no path to profit  for uber  Um, he said the pretense that self-driving cars would eliminate their labor costs. They knew this would never happen  They spelt spent billions on a doomed effort  Then had to bribe another company with a 400 million dollar investment to take its window dressing away they sold it  Uh uber didn't need self-driving cars. It needed us to think it would have self-driving cars  That way the company's saudi owners could raise investment capital from subsequent  Investors also known as suckers says cori all the way up to the ipo cash out and walk away whistling  innocently  He says uber's almost out of cash at this point  and uh  You know uber loses as we've mentioned many times before a lot of money billions, but it claims it's making money  He says how does it do this? Well, it lies  Simply uber is choose boring old generally accepted accounting practices stacy knows that is gap  And gap and invents fast fanciful new forms of mathematics where losing money is good actually good stuff  Yeah, every quarter it releases new lies laid out like a profit and loss statement and every quarter  Hubert horan shows it's losing money  Uh, it's mid 2021 cori says now and it uber is going broke  Uh uber bailed or got kicked out of russia china india and southeast asia  um  So interesting a true accounting of the last quarter has uber losing 38 cents on every dollar it took in  3.7 billion of its assets are actually worthless paper  from failing overseas ride-hale companies  uber's cash reserve declined 4.7 billion dollars in 2020  And 937 million more in the first half of this year  They've got 6.7 billion in the bank down from 14.6 in 2019. In other words at this rate

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're gonna have a problem. So I just interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you say the same for lyft?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, probably  the point yeah, the point korey's making is  while uber  The problem with uber he says wasn't just that it was a rapey crimey crooked grift. The other problem  Well, is that the other problem with uber? I love korey doctorow. He's the best writer ever the other problem with uber  He's also super smart and analytic the other problem with uber is that it's doomed and only exists today because of accounting fraud  And the real problem is it's ruined cities  because they've deferred investment in  uh public transit public transit

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it has made it impossible both uber and lyft took out all of the competition and there's  Like we see this actually on bainbridge island. There's an argument to be made for local  Taxi companies rise. Yeah  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So yeah, but it's also given work  And every time i've talked with uber driver  Um, they're not making a lot of money, but they love the freedom of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  right, i'm not saying that that's a bad thing and at  yes, but  It might help that small segment of uber drivers and I don't think it helps all the uber drivers  I think there's probably a segment of uber drivers who really who it works for them. The rest are there because  they have to be and it is an option or  They try it and it they realize it doesn't work for them. Like I get really mad because my brother is  uh, he's a door dash driver  and  He's like, you know  I really want to buy a different car because I don't want my car to have all these miles on it and i'm like you  Are just subsidizing their business. That's exactly what i'm saying the back of a person who is not  financially savvy he's  basically he's  Very poor. I mean it dry. It makes me very angry

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could make the point korey does that uber has victimized drivers. They've also victimized restaurants  uh  because  Uh using seo to trick people into thinking they were ordering from restaurants directly remember uber would set up  fake websites with that restaurant's name  Non-consensually opting restaurants into its delivery service subsidizing meals to set prices below break  Even once uber had diverted a restaurant's customers into relying on its service  It put the screws to restaurants forcing them to pay quote marketing fees  On pain of having searches for their business diverted to uber affiliated ghost kitchens  Thousands of locally owned restaurants will not survive the pandemic  Thanks to this parasitic conduct  Like doorman in hotels  And uh uber is you know uber one prop 22 in california. They spent more than 200 million dollars to get it to pass  I voted for it. I'm  Having some second thoughts it formalizes he says worker misclassification allowing employers to fire union workers  We hire them as independent contractors and take away their pay benefits and rights  Uh horan by the way is a transportation analyst  Um, so he has some you know knowledge in this  All right, you know and by the way, massachusetts. I think is now going to have its own prop 22. They're going to vote on the same  uh the same thing

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Um

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I think his point is uber is going to go away. They're going to run out of money  The con is done, you know, they everybody got rich through the ipos and so forth and of course the  Investors are going to be the ones that lose their shirts  Lose their shirts, but they're also going to leave behind them a wreckage of  Bad city infrastructure lack of mass transit restaurants out of business and underpaid workers who now have cars  With a lot of mileage on it  And and uh no job

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and I would also say in addition to all of this  We can't just look at uber  We have to look at the people who funded them and recognize that this is a pattern that plays out across the industry  in terms of saying  We're gonna fund winners. We're gonna prop these people up with as much money  Let them outspend their competition and then suddenly we're gonna pull the rug out from everybody and they're gonna look up and be like  Oh shoot  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nothing exists. Well, and he even blames the wall street journal, which basically republished uber  Press releases as news stories  Uh uncritically so there is a always do that. Yeah, there's a there's a you know, there's a system  It's called capitalism. It's called late stage capitalism

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am really distressed about late stage capitalism right now when it comes to the launch of the smart like  smart surveillance technologies and the need that we have  Like iot could totally help us do so many awesome things  Uh, like track pollution it could help create circular economies where we're actually smartly like fertilizing our plants and  All that good stuff, right?  but we can't believe any of this because  The companies that are trying to sell us these things they just greenwash or say that this is happening, right? But a lot of their  The services they're building just feel like they're trying to nickel and dime us to death and it's such a frustrating dynamic

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let us wishful thinking to call it late state capitalism. I don't think it's late stage at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just capitalism plain old capitalism  Yeah, it's unregulated. You know what it is. It's unregulated cap unfettered capitalism  Because I believe in capitalism. I think I think  The market has brought us a lot of innovation. Not everything should be in the market health care is a good example  uh for-profit health care clearly doesn't deliver good results, but  You know in general, it's a great engine for innovation and it's done very well by us  But there there are problems with it. And if it's unfettered  It becomes predatory and I think this is a good example of predatory capitalism  So maybe it's not late stage. Maybe it's just you know, maybe it started with tulip bulbs. I don't know  Uh, let's play some drums and do  the google change  I love that guy. I gotta find out whose voice that is. He's good. The voice sounded different to me just then

That would be no, please please  And would you like a headphone jack?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would because it definitely sounds better. But at the same time i'm sort of used to having earbuds for phone calls

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know I really like headphones  I actually bought an expensive 115 dollar  DAC converter  Oh nice plug into my phones. Yeah, so I can plug in headphones. It sounds better. It's a good DAC  Yeah  Um, but geez you shouldn't have to buy 150 accessory

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But okay, mr. Lafort you're gonna make me ask so you put a DAC on your  phone  Wouldn't you rather listen to that music in your home on your much bigger nicer speakers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But sometimes you you know, like you're in an airplane or whatever you you want to have okay good quality  I use those sennheiser i300s, which are really your  Yeah, uh earbuds sounds so much better than a bluetooth

Transcript:  Michael's friends 18 years old  They're listening. They're playing the beetles on his phone  I said I have bluetooth speakers if you want or we can put it on the stereo and release it. No, no  No, we like it this way  Kids today what's wrong with them  They should understand vinyl vinyl was no no, we're not going that far but really  Phone speaker is not the best which I was like  I was like really my generation and jeff's too probably  I mean we listen to transistor radios, right all of our original music with big antennae  And that's by the way true. I remember reading about keith richard and keith richard's autobiography talks about  Listening, you know to pirate radio on the bbc and a little tiny  Tinny speaker, but that's you know, that's what he heard and he loved it still so maybe I don't know  Yikes. I don't know. Anyway, the pixels launching with a headphone jack. That's the story. Hey, here's a great story. I love this  Google is launching a program. Microsoft's done this others other some banks do this to hire more people with autism  They're teaming up with stanford to make its workforce more neuro diverse  This is is fantastic I have friends who have autistic kids who are great workers  They're honest. They're hard workers because of their neuro diversity  There's some things that they don't handle well like sometimes interactions with people  But they are really good at doing the jobs. They're assigned  Google's Google cloud's autism career program will work with experts from the stanford neuro diversity project to train as many as 500  Google cloud managers and others who are integral in the hiring process to work more effectively with candidates who have autism  I would say there's probably a lot of people on the spectrum in google already  Oh, I would imagine yes, but this is this is this is a really important. I think very very good  I think this is a big step in general and and you know wesley faulkner's been our shows talking about this  He's actually he gave a great speech about  neuro diversity  That we should we have to be able to do that  That we should we have these notions that everybody should be like the same  And if we can if we can embrace neuro diversity, sometimes that's where genius comes from the worst pressure

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think on all of us and especially on our kids today is the the idea of normal normal  Terrible idea. No one is normal. There isn't such a thing as normal  It's it's it's a construct that holds them to something so that when they all feel abnormal because we all are because there isn't a normal

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, it puts terrible pressure on i've had that same conversation with my kids  And that's the problem in a way with social media because everybody puts that best picture the best face forward  Aren't I having a great life?  and that's not even normal that's that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  comparing yourself to a lot of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kids and I see a lot of like tik tok and other social media videos that celebrate people who they're like just like  I have a dhd. This is what I do. I think we're moving in that direction. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like it's great. Yeah, I think that's good to see because i'm not seeing that. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, maybe it's maybe again. It's part of my weird algorithm. They're like stacy licks goofy people animals

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tick tock ant more tick tock. I'm telling you. Well, no, I take I take that back from an instagram standpoint instagram  Is doing much better with eliminating selfies and things like that to me  But it was a lot of the whole  Braggadocious type, I really don't like the influencer thing, but I know we're

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hope we're getting away from that because it's a stupid business model

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and frankly there's lots of influencers doing different things like i'm following a bunch of curly haired influencers because I have curly hair  And i'm like, oh, I will totally buy that. Thank you. I love curly hair. Curly hair is the best hair

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Our daughter nothing's my wife to let her go with the curls. Yeah, please we're all very happy. It's gorgeous

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But this is nothing new  I mean magazines with photoshopped or retouched photos on the cover have been the problem for years causing body image issues and so forth  So this is nothing new  but uh  Yeah, i'm really glad in fact, maybe in the long run. This is what jeff's been saying is this is going to be a positive trend because  Neurodiversity will be celebrated on social net media and people will feel a little bit like oh I guess  I guess i'm not so weird the other thing that happens and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And  Dana boy has always been great about this talking about her own childhood  Is that the internet allowed her to find that she wasn't the only person in the world like this? Yes  There wasn't a question of normal. It was just a question of finding others who shared  her view of herself  And and how valuable that was and and and how how saving that is?  And so to me, that's one of the greatest things about the internet and facebook has screwed it up  No doubt  But but one of the advantages of being able to find people like yours is not echo chambers  It's being able to say i'm not alone  and  And to find people you can share with and that has tremendous value and this is why I extol  The courage and value of sharing and being open is because you can't connect with somebody until you share that about yourself

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would submit that we exist because of that especially back in the late 90s when tech tv started  You know, we made it cool to be geeky and and people would watch it  I could hear from people all the time as teenagers who felt alone in their kind of passion for technology and geekiness  And they found tech tv and they said oh, this is great.

Transcript:  did you were you allowed to use a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  browser there was a periodic table on the um, uh  Board but I remembered it from chemistry. We had to memorize the weight. You remember the atomic weight of lithium  Just lithium and like hydrogen and oxygen. I mean like just the basics  What is I don't know either one not any of the fancy ones

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You might remember the number like this number three because it's hydrogen helium lithium  But the atomic weight  Atomic mass is six point nine four six point one. Yeah, you know, I was gonna say nine three. Well, that's close enough

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow, wow not for the escape room. Oh, you would not have escaped. What's the boiling point of lithium?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know the boiling point 1330 degrees  Celsius  That's hot

Thank you all. Thank you. I'm serious. Thank you every one of you bless you  You keep this show afloat  Because we only had one ad so that gave you some idea  Twitter ai bias contest shows beauty filters hoodwink the algorithm  What does that mean and explain?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well, they put on a contest to  See how images and things are are being pushed into twitter feed even down to how twitter crops  some some images out  and  They did this contest because  They wanted to make their ai better and two people figured out  Okay, this is what's happening and this is why this is happening and twitter said, you know what?  Thank you. We need to fix this and get this better and give people a better

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  twitter from an image standpoint twitter was it got a little trouble earlier this year because  Uh people found out it's cropping algorithm favorite images of white people over black people

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's not good of them, yeah or age or people that were older was cropping out older people. Yeah, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait, tell me what I never understood. Where is it cropping that not being a it's power

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's in the app  So you don't see the whole photo they just crop what it thinks is right and it tries to find the most important part

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  which is  Fine from the ai standpoint to to try to you know, make the subject stand out in it in the image  But at the same time, oh, I see  So here's an example

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm looking at a tweet  And the picture isn't the whole picture. This is when I click on the picture  I get the much more of the picture  But they've decided to center it on on that I get it people people. Yeah. Yeah, that'd be my bet  Yeah, and if and white people over black people which is not so good and in fact over women  Yeah, in fact, uh this researcher bogdan, uh, kulinich  Found lighter skinned younger and slimmer variations. They post they posted  the same photo in a variety of different ways  to see  How it would be cropped if you if you got skinnier lighter and younger it increased your  Your salient score by 35 28 and 29 respect percent respectively  So big difference, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just like the fact that we we we've talked about ai and and the bias in ai for the last year and a half and  Said these these companies they need to do better and they need to hire people that look more like me  Um to help get this better and here's twitter saying you know what we got to get this right  So how about someone help us out and thank you for helping us out. Let's get this in action

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and credit to twitter because they  Yeah sponsored the contest the prize was 35  Yeah, they called it a bug bounty for algorithmic bias. That's good for them  And uh won by a researcher from uh, switzerland  That is a good one. Thank you an

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Didn't know that's what you meant or I would have gone straight to it  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He said twitter ai, uh, oh god twitter. No twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And now we're gonna take a break and come back with uh picks of the week next  Stacey Higginbotham kicks off our picks of the week as she always does with something we like to call stacey's thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, so the thing I have for you is the 3m filtrate air filters  I got two of them and since we were talking about air quality sensors, I thought this was a fun  device um  I can take you to show it to you  I have two versions  I have a big version that's designed for like a big room and then I have a smaller version that is designed for like  A like a bedroom filtre  Yes, and so it's wi-fi connected here's the app a wi-fi connected air filter  Yeah, so what it's telling me is it's telling me two things one I can just go in and i'm like  Oh, this is it's not on right now  Uh, but it's telling me my air quality is really good right now in my family room and it tells me my filter life

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I should compare this I should compare this to the purple

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So and this is where it gets fun. I can also add my outdoor  So right here it's taking generic aqis from the area, but I can add a purple sensor  To this app and then it'll just pull directly from my purple sensor to tell me exactly what the air is outside of my home  And so this is  Again as we head into wildfire  I'm really interested to see what happens because right now it's clear that the filter is degrading by one percentage point each day  It's kind of nice to know that yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You just guess normally

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you usually it'll it'll tell you at some point  And it'll give you your actual parts per million. Let's see pull this back some  I don't know if you can see that. It's the 2.5 and it's nice. It's parts per billion for 2.5

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Micron particles 10 micron particles. So they've got a little chip in there  There

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's pretty neat. Yeah, it's it's tracking your particulates what it isn't tracking though is vocs  So if you're familiar with air quality monitors, there's like the aware that tracks carbon dioxide in vocs. This does not do that  This particular one for their air quality index they're giving us goes from zero to  I want to say like 200 and something

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um, this is great. I need to order filters. So i'm gonna order these that's really are they much more expensive

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You would ask that question which is a totally reasonable question

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't find a price on the website. They just send you out here. I'll click a link and  Probably send me to hold on. Sorry. I'm like  smart mpr  the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm good. Oh, that's the filters. I want the pick your size. Oh my gosh air purifiers. Here we go

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm gonna get a 20 by 20, which is pretty darn big. In fact, it's bigger than mine  And let's see best buy has them in stock  For  Oh lord, it's always so many clicks 2199. That's not bad. I mean, i'm sure that's more than a  non-smart  Filter would be but still  It's not through the root. It's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh my god, I can't get to a price this is crazy. Oh, I got one 2199 for the 20 by 20 his screen

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait, that is  That has to be for  The filters what else is there not the purifier it's a purifier

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I thought you were talking about the filtrate filters for your air conditioning  Which do the same thing by the way?  They they have a chip in them that's bluetooth capable. No these this this does too see it's got an app and everything  Oh  It's an air filter  For your you know, you're frustrating stacey your your furnace filter

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, filtrate is or 3m is frustrating stacey. I'm just trying to okay. The purifier is like 80 bucks

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they have an air purifier as well, but they also you can buy these  Inserts as you know, you change when you have filter furnaces you have filters for the intake  Yep, and you can change those you could get these instead and it has a sensor in it and it would tell you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How does it get the power to tell you?  magic, there's a there's a bluetooth sensor in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a battery-powered bluetooth sensor. They're only designed to last for three months. So they're not worried

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's battery in it interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So and then you're supposed to land  Well, it's it's a filter y'all that's one of the things like 3m's filters they do their particulate filtration by  Hydro-statically charging it or something. So over time the the charge dissipates  I don't know if it dissipates at a rate of one percent of the overall efficacy per day like they seem to indicate but  Yeah, anyway, that's a terrible pick because I don't know how much it costs and i'm very frustrated myself

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know, but we we found the filters, which is pretty cool  So this is a good example of a twitter  Bias in the cropping algorithm. Here's a a tweet of 90s audition polaroids from casting director  It features juliette louis vince von jason priestly, but oh my there's benicio del toro elijah wood  Ben stiller cropped way out of that  So I think there's a ben stiller filter

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
