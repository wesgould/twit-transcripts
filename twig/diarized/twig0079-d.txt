Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I've had espresso.  I'm going to talk fast.  Uh oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  She's in trouble.  Oh, we're having a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Faster than usual.  Faster than usual.  Uh oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh no.  Android.  Gina, Jeff's not here this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's so sad.  We miss Jeff a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's in Switzerland.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, he's, I'm sure there's a chocolate fountain and he's, you know, convincing  with important people.  You know, I get it.  I get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Chocolate and cheese fountain probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was definitely fondue involved.  You know, there's got to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But we got some good replacements starting with Danny Sullivan is here from, now it's  searchengineland.com now, right?  That's right.  So we want everybody to go searchengineland.com and not the other one.  Yeah, excellent.  Not the other one.  Not the other place.  Danny, Danny spends a lot of time covering this.  We were talking about preparing for the show ahead of time and we said, Danny, you're the  one person who doesn't really have to.  This is your life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm ready to go.  This is exciting.  I'm like, oh, I could talk about that.  I could talk about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I know that story.  I know what's going on there.  I hope.  We'll see.  Also joining us right now.  We've been trying to get them on for some time.  A good friend of Gina's, Mitch Wagner, also a San Diegan.  Hey, Mitch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, glad to make it this time.  I got the day right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And you're with what is the CMO site?  Tell us about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The CMO site.  It's an online community and group blog for CMOs and high level marketing executives at  large companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The marketing elite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Meet.  Yes, they do.  Yes.  They work feet into there too.  Meat to beat their feet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Very Sinatra.  In the Sinatra at the Sands, 1965, he tries to make a joke and I've listened to this album  a thousand times because it's one of the great albums of all time, one of the great Sinatra  albums of all time.  But he says, welcome to somewhere.  And he says, we're the elite meat to eat.  And if I rhyme that, we're out of business.  And I'm trying to figure out what the heck rhyme could put them out.  I don't understand.  Anyway, everybody listen to that and send me emails.  Explain it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But he was talking about Twitter.  Like if you tweet, he was 40 years ahead of his time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it was.  It was 1965.  Well, I'll tell you what.  This is not the show about Frank Sinatra.  This is the show about Google and the cloud.  And there are lots of things to talk about.  It's too bad Jeff's not here because Jeff in the past and Jay Rosen and others have  spent a lot of time talking about and explaining to me what demand media is.  Demand media went public today.  An initial public offering, the stock market, it valued its shares before the IPO at $17.  It went immediately to $25.  Now it's fallen a little bit, about $23 a share.  Danny, what is this?  Demand media.  What is this?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Should I buy stock?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe this morning.  Yeah, it's too late now.  You know, I mean, it's really hard to say.  In some ways, this is the first huge, biggest SEO driven company we've ever seen.  They have taken the idea of search engine optimization to its perhaps ultimate end where  they are literally creating content based on what it is that they can see people are  searching for and targeting areas that they think are most valuable, what they can sell  advertising against.  And it's actually very smart and really shouldn't be controversial at all either.  I mean, if you think of all the self-help books out there or all the shows that are  designed to give you practical advice, if somebody's got questions and somebody else  is giving them authoritative answers, you wouldn't have a problem with that.  Where the controversy comes in is that a lot of these answers sometimes don't seem to be  that great.  I mean, I think all of them aren't great and they do have good content.  They do answer questions.  But sometimes you can encounter the same answer answered multiple times, sometimes in low quality,  sometimes not really an answer.  And then they also can get lumped in with other content farm kind of sites where you  don't get answers at all.  You know, you search for something using a question, you're searching the form of a question  and you just end up with a lot of garbage and kind of getting a run around.  So I don't know if that's the future or not.  I tend to think one of the problems with a company like that is that anytime someone  gets really big on Google's radar, it's a danger sign.  You become very dependent on that.  And one of their biggest drivers of traffic is coming from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So Google can put them out of business by changing its algorithms or somehow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google could do that overnight.  I ironically heard itself along the way because a lot of demand media's money comes from the  AdSense units that they carry from Google itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So maybe the stock market's figuring, well, Google's never going to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and they could do that.  They might assume why would Google shoot itself in the foot?  But while AdSense revenue is a big deal to demand media, demand media's AdSense revenue,  I don't think is anything but a drop in the bucket to Google overall.  More important, the teams at Google that are in charge of search quality literally do not  care what AdWords has to think.  They just don't.  It's like a reporter in the New York Times newsroom.  And you can imagine that some advertiser comes running in saying, hey, you're doing this  thing on some big company and we don't like it.  They're going to pull all their ads.  And the reporter will dig in and be like, well, too bad.  And that's the kind of, I don't want to say rivalry, but that's the kind of division that  you really do have at Google.  And I've seen that sort of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it's not like they're a big moneymaker.  They went off at a higher price and they sold more shares than the market would expect.  In the prospectus, they say they lost three million dollars on a hundred seventy nine  million in revenue for the first nine months of 2010.  They didn't have fourth quarter numbers, but they estimated fourth quarter revenue,  71 to 73 million dollars with a net loss of one point nine million dollars and not even profitable.  And yet Wall Street rewarded them and said, hey, we want more.  Is that the back, baby?  Yeah, well, there haven't been a part.  It could just could be actually that there haven't.  This is the first tech stock IPO of 2011.  There were very many last year.  They were all Chinese mostly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nobody could buy any of that Facebook stock that's not even being sold publicly anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it could just be a thirst for any technology company.  Now, Matt Cutts responded to this.  First of all, why would Google not like demand media?  We know why they might like them.  Why would they not like is it?  Do they pollute search results?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Google doesn't like the idea of anybody building a business on its own back,  which can sometimes be ironic.  That's what everybody does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, Google me.  I don't have a business either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When you when you have a company like demand going out and saying we generate all this  stuff at Google, there's an implication or suggestion in there that they know how to  manipulate Google and they can just make it happen.  And you can imagine that is not going to go over well with people at Google who feel like,  no, you're not manipulating us.  We have our own independent algorithm and maybe you're successful in some regards, but  you won't be successful in others.  But nobody manipulates us.  Right. That that would be their view.  And so I think that would be the first thing that would cause some people at Google to  be uncomfortable about demand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is demand media gaming Google?  I mean, is there a case for them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've not seen anybody put forward any evidence that they've been violating Google's

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  guidelines. They're doing they're just using the system as as it's configured to their

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  benefit. And one of the advantages they have is that their domains are powerful.  You know, how carries some respect?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He how is he how owned by demand media?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's one of their it's one of their their properties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it's still their main property about dot com, which is similar is not it's owned  by The New York Times. Right.  In fact, this made this interesting, but I made media more valuable, at least via its  stock price, the higher valuation than The New York Times.  I know. And now a story is coming out.  The New York Times, in fact, tried to buy demand media to merge it with about dot com.  So even old media sees the value of demand media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is funny, because a year ago you had New York Times, a lot of newspapers saying  that they couldn't make money off of search engines and they had to put up a paywall.  And in fact, the New York Times is about literally about to do that.  Right. That's why they want to buy these guys.  Hey, they figured it out. But demand media doesn't have a paywall.  They just do it advertising. So, you know, they're just very, very smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And, you know, one thing that I think we talked about last time we talked about demand is  that any good blogger or web publisher watches the ways in which visitors reach the site.  We did this at Lifehacker the whole time.  I mean, it wasn't I mean, it's pretty much exactly what demand is doing.  They're looking what are people searching for, what information do they need?  We're going to find it. We're going to package it in a way that maybe is more useful than  the than the list of links that you get on a topic now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  In fact, sometimes it feels like old media judgmentalism that, oh, well, this is an

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  upstart, an Internet upstart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. This idea that they're gaming Google.  I mean, you know, I think the same way you could put, well, that they're servicing their  visitors, you know, they're serving readers.  I mean, you know, you can look at it either way.  And certainly some some of the articles from some of the demand properties are kind of  crappy, but not all of them are.  I mean, you know, really, it really depends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're kind of I find the articles there to be kind of mediocre at best.  We were joking before the show started that I was looking up how to do a hard reset on  the iPhone. And one of the things that came up on these content farm was 350 words on  turn it off and turn it back on again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All right. But I'm going to put my I'm going to put my hat on as Mr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Demand Media. I don't know who he is. But so I'm Mr.  Demand Media. Look, I don't care.  I mean, that's old media. That's old school saying, who are you to judge the value of  my articles? At least people come to them and click on them and read them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In the immortal words of Captain Kirk, who do I have to be?  I'm just a guy. I'm just a guy at 10 o'clock at night.  He's trying to remember how to do a hard reset on the iPhone.  And I'm not doing it. And on that site, this happens all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So your contention, Mitch Wagner, is that it pollutes the content is low grade pollution,  essentially.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I found that if you're looking up my thumb up, I haven't done the study on this like Danny,  Danny has. But I found if you're looking up either health information or you're looking up  Mac and Apple related information, which is two things I do a lot, you know, the first page or  two is garbage.  It's just all word of mouth and people asking questions and a lot of these content farms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We've gone through this with Google before, where you had a lot of link farms.  And for a while about I can't remember, two or three years ago, Google was just crap.  And then they fixed it.  Yeah.  And now I've seen there's a kind of a growing drumbeat from a lot of people saying Google's  search results are getting less and less useful.  Are you hearing that, Danny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. And in fact, it's even accelerated over the past six weeks.  We had a TechCrunch piece that kicked off the latest round at the beginning of the year.  That was followed up by two or three different pieces that came off after that, where people  were saying, you know, the results are crappy.  The results aren't as useful as anymore.  They're just they're being dominated by all this stuff.  I don't know that that's actually true, but I do know more and more people are talking  about it. I did an article that looked at one study of a consumer poll that found that,  you know, it was like 90 percent of the people surveyed still said search engines overall  are useful and I still find what I'm looking for.  But the same survey found that like 70 percent said the biggest problem wasn't that they  couldn't find what they were looking for, but there was a lot of noise.  So I think there's a perception that there's much more noise here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Even Google thinks so.  I'm looking at a blog post from our friend, Matt Cutts, who's been on the show a number  of times, who is a Google engineer in charge of, in fact, killing spam on the Web results.  And he wrote a couple of days ago, January brought a spate of stories about Google search  quality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. And he and he linked Jeff Atwood's coding horror, tech crunch and rewrite Web  in that spate of stories phrase, which I loved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He says Google search quality is better than it has ever been in terms of relevance, freshness  and comprehensiveness.  I mean, what is there an objective measure of that?  I guess he says there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's one of the things that that I covered in the story that, hey, Matt, you  didn't even link to it.  Yeah, let's see those evaluation metrics.  Where I've been talking about and I actually wrote a piece way back in 2002 called In Search  of the Relevancy Figure.  And what I was saying was that you you you want people to people want to be able to say  this search engine is better than that and be able to quantify it.  But we've never had that because the relevancy of search results is so subjective.  So instead, we are so called authority metric.  Well, authority are just are they relevant or not?  You get these proxies.  We've had people say, well, you know, Google must be better than being or being better  than Google because one has more pages than the other.  Well, that doesn't tell you anything.  Or that one's fresher than the other.  That doesn't mean that they're necessarily more relevant.  We literally do not have a commonly accepted standard of rating the search engines to know  whether or not they are better than each other or worse and whether they've gotten better  or worse over time in terms of the quality of their results.  The internally they will tell you that they do their own testing.  But that's their own measure.  And it's not something that the external people externally necessarily are going to agree  with.  And surprise, usually in the years I've been watching the search engines, their internal  metrics tell them that they're pretty good.  Right.  So what I'd hope is that Google being especially would get together, find some third party  to figure out a way to go through and test whether or not they are more spammy or they  are less relevant or if things are improving.  And I don't think Google's had the incentive to do that before because everybody just accepted  that they were the best.  But now it's been a turnabout where everybody except the best.  More people seem to be more inclined to say, oh, yeah, I do think that they're worse, even  necessarily worse or worse than some of the other search engines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's at least some competition.  I mean, you can at least say, well, you know, let's look at Bing and see how it's doing.  But isn't it ultimately let me ask you this, Mitch, isn't it ultimately you said, you know,  you didn't like the results, but isn't that ultimately subjective?  Is there an objective measure of relevancy?  Isn't one man's garbage and other man's, you know, treasure?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I don't I don't know if you're looking for specific information like how to do something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't think some people need to know you turn it off and on.  Maybe they need to know that.  Maybe you're maybe you're an elitist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Press the button. It's off.  Press the button. It's on.  How hard is that?  I mean, I think one site, by the way, I wanted to bring up that I think does a really good job  on this kind of content farming and does content farming ethically is Lifehacker.  Because I don't I don't really read Lifehacker anymore.  But when I have a question on how to do something, if I type it into Google, I see a lifehacker  link up by the top. I'm like, yeah, that's it.  That's going to be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, I loathe to use the word content farm and Lifehacker in the same sentence.  I mean, that makes me that makes my skin crawl a little bit, I'll admit, because there's  something sort of, you know, that there's a negative light right there.  But but the reality is that Lifehacker has some of the best Google SEO of all the Gawker  sites, which is a huge network of sites.  And a lot of that is just because our headlines are generally how to do X, you know, and  it's which people that's what people search for.  People search for how to use eHow, figure that out a long time ago.  Lifehackers headlines are very literal.  They're often just very step by steps.  And so they so yeah, they get they get a lot of traffic and Lifehacker editors watch the  comments and watch the the keywords that bring people in and watch the emails that come in.  So we very much that the articles that you see on the site come from direct requests  from readers. So they come up and search results.  I I search for phrases and I find Lifehacker articles that I wrote in like oh seven.  I knew that I forgot.  Yeah, I forgot I knew that I forget.  So so yes, I mean, I think, you know, this calling it a content farm or calling it a  site with with good content and high SEO for good good reason.  And that's that's there.  There's a continuum there.  It's really hard to say what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So so good content is not like porn or is it?  I'll know it when I see it.  Yeah, I think it is like porn.  So there's there we could we could I think you're right.  I think if the four of us sat down and I fired up four pages, we could pretty quickly say  which are the good ones and which aren't right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Would we judge some of it by the number of ads on the page?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, if there's an ad covering the entire page before I look at the article, then that's  going to that's going to rate on it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I got to mention, there's quite a few prestigious websites that do that.  In fact, almost all the tech sites now do that.  I hate it. Yeah, me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Me too. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Most of the mainstream news sites now.  But the big says this is really disingenuous.  Page loading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Watch this ad for 15, 14, 13.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And then and then skip this ad.  It's like, well, if you're going to put an ad up, why put a skip this ad link?  Make me watch it. I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What I would like to see and I've actually seen this.  I visited a company that competes with Google, which I can't name, but internally, who has  been developing a search engine and internally, they had a simple web app with Google on  one side and their product on the other.  They would search and then they would submit the results if they felt like Google got it  better. So all we need is a very simple web app that just lines up Google against the  other search engines. You search for a term and then you report, you know, you report  something to a sort of some sort of third party or, you know, I don't know, the creator  of the app to say this is a search in which Google's results were terrible and this one  was better or whatever.  And that would be pretty cool crowdsourced way and public way, transparent way to say  the results on Google are better in these cases and worse in those cases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Matt Cutts says as pure web scam spam has decreased over time.  In other words, just junk attention has shifted instead to, quote, content farms, which are  sites with shallow or low quality content.  Sounds like demand media.  Right. In 2010, we launched two major algorithmic changes focusing on low quality sites.  So they are, they say, doing something about it.  I don't know.  I mean, it reminds me of when when spyware started to come out and the antivirus companies  were very reluctant to battle spyware because they didn't want to get sued because spyware  or adware was, you know, just an ad.  It wasn't it wasn't malware.  That's changed, I think, over time.  But it does remind me of that is couldn't I mean, how is it very judgmental to say that's  low quality?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But then I'll give you an example of where it comes up.  I so I got I've got two boys and they're both in elementary school and they are making fun  of Justin Bieber once.  And I've used this example before, but I said to him, well, you know, you might make fun  of him, but he seemed to be pretty successful.  And they said, oh, no, no, he's not successful.  You know, he probably not made any money at all.  I was like, well, he's probably done a little better than you guys.  So we went back and we went to do a search and bearing in mind, like, I'm, you know,  a search expert, right?  You know, what I do is find information online.  So we go off and I start doing some searches just to find out, well, how much money has  Justin Bieber made?  And you start doing that search and what you do is encounter time and time again, answer  sites, Yahoo Answers, answers.com.  Oh, my God.  Cha Cha, you know, Wiki answers, answers this, blah, blah, blah.  And none of them have the answer.  None of them have the answer.  They have people guessing at an answer.  They have people pretending that they know the answer.  Sometimes they have answers that have nothing to do with it.  Yeah, OK, that would be bad to me.  That is shallow or low quality content.  And they're doing well because more and more people seem to be comfortable and performing  searches in the form of a question.  Relatively few other websites on the Internet actually write content in the form of  questions, right?  They don't tend to do the SEO like what Gina was talking about.  What you think? Well, gosh, someone's going to sit down there typing in.  How do I this sort of thing?  So their competition space is lower and they have these authoritative domains.  And I think that's what, you know, Matt and Google are saying that they're grappling  with. Some of these things sometimes do have the answers.  They do have good quality information.  And some of them just don't.  And should we get rid of them?  And is there in the most important because they're there, are they blocking the real  answers from actually being found?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. I wonder to what extent people the general run of searching public will have  to we'll find out.  I mean, I think it took most of us watch it more closely and it took us a few months to  realize if it's an e-how link, I just don't want to click it.  I guess the question is, should Google put it in the results then or rank it so highly

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Then that gets into the question of do they start blocking specific domains, which they  have been extremely reluctant to do.  Can't you say don't ever show me e-how again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you log in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You used to be able to do that through search Wiki.  And I think they may still have that.  But it was on a page by page basis.  And in fact, after Matt's post came out, he did another follow up thing.  This was out on Hacker News and we did a short piece on it at Search Engine land where he  was saying we might come back and give you the option to block whole domains.  Yahoo actually had something like that as well.  And I can't remember exactly what it was called at this point.  But you could say I just don't want to see anything else from this domain.  And that would solve the problem, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because then I'm judging I don't like the domain and I could block it.  I mean, you can always do minus site colon e-how dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you know, it's too much trouble.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't remember if Blacko has a slash tag.  Blacko says that they have certain slash tags over there.  They're designed to keep content farms out and other lower quality content.  But I can't remember if they created a slash tag that if you use it automatically drops  out the most common Q&A sites.  That would be interesting.  Who's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Blacko.  Spell it.  B-L-E-K-K-O.  Blacko.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we actually we haven't talked about Blacko on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We talked about when it first came out.  That's the one where you do the slash.  Yeah.  And I mean, most of the time, I think a slash tag explicitly includes sites.  So this would also solve the problem if you had, you know, you if I create a slash tag  on tech news, I'm not going to include a site.  I could say I'm not going to include a site that has interstitial ads.  I mean, I could I could do anything I want.  But that's so but nobody uses Blacko.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not yet.  But I mean, what's what is interesting is here.  Google came out and they said, well, we're going to, you know, we're going to come out  and try to compete in this space that everybody else has been crushed in.  And what they've done phenomenally well in is convincing people suddenly that Google  has a spam problem and that they do their own pushing out there.  They actually launched something called a spam clock.  I think it's at the spam clock dot com.  And they said, this is the amount of spam that's coming along.  They have convinced some people that they actually have a better search algorithm, even  though they don't necessarily have a better search algorithm than Google.  They're just using Google, aren't they?  No, no, they're crawling the web and they're doing their own searching as well.  But they're getting themselves counted with, you know, the big players because there's  so few big players left.  I just did a thing the other day when the Academy Awards came out and I was kind of  curious, well, who was getting you to the right place, you know, for the nominee list  right at the very beginning.  And it was like, OK, I'm going to compare Google and I compare Bing and oh, yeah, I'll  black go because that's what I'm left with.  If I'm talking about Google, Bing, it drops off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's quite a cliff.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It drops off fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Google Bing Blacko.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of fun to say, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I do. Now I'm starting to like it.  I'm going to blacko you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not on the first date.  No, no black going on the first day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. By the way, who was the best?  Because I have to say immediately, I get up in the morning and I want to find out who  the nominees are.  And I Google Academy Award nominees, but there are a lot of articles that don't have a  list. And so it was not easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I found it was a pretty close tie between Bing and Google.  Both of them. And then I looked within, say, 15 minutes of them coming out.  Both of them had their news boxes at the top.  So there were lots of news articles about it.  But I was thinking I just want to find the list.  Right. And and Google lifted at number one the Oscar website's home page.  You went to there and the list was right at the top.  Black being listed, the actual nominees page at the Oscar site.  So you kind of want to give them an edge, except that page was exactly the same as the  home page. Blacko, which, of course, has gotten some praise in very places, was  listing a page that was 404 on the Oscar site.  Oh, so that's a failure.  And, you know, they're going to have to step it up to to to be fighting among those  other players. Bad blacko.  For news like that, I probably would have searched Twitter for like something that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  happened that got announced in the last 10, 15 minutes.  I probably would have just searched Twitter.  Yeah, there's social search jumping right up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And in fact, it was Twitter that even alerted me to the fact that the nominees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I saw that. And then I said, oh, let me get them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Mm hmm. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My mistake was going to Google at that point, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I should have just read the tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think the tweet that I saw actually had a label on it.  The tweet that I saw actually had a link.  So I didn't actually even. That's what happened to me, too.  I mean, once in a while I'll go to search.twitter.com, especially if there's like a reality  show airing on the East Coast and I just want to know the winner, that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So now I can just blame the curation.  By the way, and I'll make this my tool of the week a little bit, Matt, actually, there's  a Chrome extension that Matt mentions in his blog post so that you can report.  I think this is probably the best solution to this is let users say, hey, I found a  site, but it really sure wasn't what I was looking for.  Sure wasn't the information I needed.  And you can now use it. There's a Chrome extension you can use to to tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Are the reports public? I want the reports to be public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I doubt that they are, but I would love that.  Yeah, I don't think they are.  Yeah, yeah. That's why I would love to see a third party set up something like that,  where the community can post can post bad search results and have it be public so that  other people can can also see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is it something like the Académie Francaise preserving the purity of the French  language by deciding?  I mean, I sometimes feel like a little bit this is a little bit like old media saying,  well, that's not good that you hired a five dollar writer to write a silly article about

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  something. Well, it's I think if you go back again to what Gina was saying about what  life hacker was doing or what things other sites may do, it's not I think that demand  media is necessarily or any some of the content partners have done something wrong.  It's that most of these other publications existed because they're covering that  area. Right. You know, they didn't say, I know, let's go figure out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It started from their own interest as opposed to what the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So for some reason, it was an area that they actually had people dedicated to do.  And then you've got other players coming in saying, hey, instead of figuring out what  particular area we ought to cover on and specialize in and perhaps provide exceptional  coverage in, let's cover everything anybody's interested in that that is most likely to  make money and let's pay as little as possible to the people to create that content,  which is a which is a clever business model.  But it kind of rubs you the wrong way. Right.  Yeah, it rubs me the wrong way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And then there's the whole the whole separate issue of just driving down wages  for writers, which is a writer myself.  I'm not exactly in love with.  Yeah. Well, that's what I have.  Yeah, we've been having this argument on the CMO site with a bunch of people defending it  and my coming out and saying, look, you're just better off working at Starbucks.  Write your own blog in your spare time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And you'll feel better, better about yourself at the end of the day, too.  And you'll have insurance and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I finally had to come out and say, look, I'm not being metaphorical here.  I mean, literally go to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hey, do you get free trendy lattes if you work at Starbucks?  Because I might do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The trendy latte is so big, you have to take a Starbucks break in the middle of drinking it  because you don't have enough energy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, apparently you're not far off.  Apparently 30 ounces is actually bigger than the capacity of the human stomach.  So you really couldn't or wouldn't want to drink it all at once.  You'd up up.  And and who says you don't learn something on this week in Google?  Let me tell you, ladies and gentlemen, we're to take a break.  I do want to talk a little bit about, you know,  a little story that broke the day after we did Twig last week.  Eric Schmidt steps down.  Whoops. I guess we should have led with that.  Talk about step up. Step up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Step up. He was elevated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He was elevated out of here.  Whereas John Cooper said he was elevated right out of the building.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right out of the building.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I do want to talk about interstitial ads, actually, now that you brought it up,  Gina, because TechCrunch, actually, Mike Arrington posted a very interesting  article on TechCrunch yesterday apologizing for the ads on his site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hmm. Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We'll dig deep into that in just a little bit before we go much further,  though, I would like to say hello.  Hello to my good friends at Ford,  makers of the fine Ford Focus Electric, my next car.  It's going to come out in 2012.  But yes, I will be replacing my lovely Ford Mustang,  which I deeply love with the Ford Focus.  First of all, because I want to be a good citizen and I like the electric.  But also, it's you know, they've upgraded the Ford SYNC, which I have  to the now the new my Ford Touch now understands ten thousand commands.  Of course, it's true hands free dialing.  Call Gina Trapani on her cell and boom, it does it.  I get it. It's playing the music you want or the podcast you want.  Play this week and Google episode 78. It does it.  You know, it works with your iPod, your iPhone, your Zune, your  all the all the different devices.  In fact, if you've got a an Android phone, some of the Android phones  like the Droid X, it will read you your text messages as they come in  in a lovely female voice.  It's just it's just fantastic.  Now they've got Pandora and Stitcher.  So that you don't you know, you can listen to the radio you want.  Well, Stitcher, you can listen to us just cue up a bunch of twigs.  The Ford Focus Electric for 2012 has lithium ion batteries, very high capacity.  You can charge it from your standard 120 volt outlet, but they also will.  They're going with the folks at Best Buy.  The Geek Squad will come in and install a 240 volt outlet.  I'm not kidding in your house for three hour charging.  I can't wait. It is a beautiful vehicle.  You know, you want to see the inside of it. Go to  Focus Electric Power dot or dot com.  Focus on the nonprofit. Sorry.  Focus Electric Power dot com.  And you can learn more about this amazing vehicle.  It is just so beautiful.  I saw it at Blogwood and then again at CES.  By the way, John C.  Dvorak and Paul Therotte are going to test drive it next month in Madrid.  And we're going to get a report from them doing that.  But you could find out more.  It's almost like it's like a virtual test drive.  There's going to be an iPhone app, an Android app that lets you  check your battery levels and and tell it to charge during off peak hours,  things like that. Complete control.  Just so slick and very affordable.  Focus Electric Power dot com.  Thank you, Ford, for supporting this week in Google.  Now, that's an interstitial ad.  I mean, that's a that's traditional broadcast ad.  But we were just saying how much we hate that when a website  and the thing is, it's before you even get to the site, you have to  you have to look at an ad like this.  TechCrunch will load in just a few seconds.  Yeah. And actually, this is Mike Errington writing  RealBlogs don't have interstitial ads.  He said, I've fought this for years.  Apparently, AOL is putting these ads on TechCrunch.  They got to pay for buying it some way.  Yeah. Mike talk.  Mike is, you know, I'm convinced Mike has a strategy to get out of  with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was going to say, I would love to have been in on the meetings  that happened after this post, because I have been on in on meetings  like this at Gawker, which is a much, much smaller company than AOL.  And they are never pretty.  So I would love to have seen the AOL folks, sales teams,  faces after he posted this.  Although I give Errington a lot of credit for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's manly.  I mean, first, he goes after Josh Topolsky, the Engadget blog,  and AOL, probably the most most profitable AOL property  and calls them all sorts of names, wrongly, by the way.  But, you know, I'll defend Joshua to my dying day.  I think Engadget's great.  And I think they do a great job.  But now he's going after the ad department.  Now you're in trouble, Mike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's pretty entertaining.  I don't really give him a lot of credit.  He took their money and now he doesn't want to work for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's pretty obvious.  He says, whoever did it.  I'm going to try to stop it, which will probably involve six hours  of eternal meetings in at least one PowerPoint deck.  So at least, you know, it's going to cause me a lot more pain  than it's causing you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I guess I've just I've written a few of these like we  we really screwed up with our ads on Lifehacker myself.  And whenever it happens, it's always this very traumatic experience.  Although I think Mike is a lot more.  He just has a kind of temperament.  That's a lot better for this kind of stuff.  I'd be honest with you. I was projecting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I wouldn't want to be in that meeting with Mike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, there's always there's always the question of how much AOL  is kind of aware of this and sanctions it as a way to build traffic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, maybe. You know, I've seen that happen in radio.  It happens all the time.  I remember Don Imus used to work with a guy named Pete Franklin.  Franklin was in the Imus was in the morning.  Franklin was the afternoon.  It was I think it's on WNBC in New York.  And they had a quote feud was I'm sure it was all play.  At one point, Franklin steals into Imus's studio and takes the microphone.  And Imus comes in the morning.  There's no microphone.  He actually did the did the show by phone.  Now, you've got to figure WNBC.  There's another microphone.  It's got it's all right. It's all. Yeah.  I think it's just it's probably just stick here, but I think it's fascinating.  All right. Let's talk about Eric Schmidt, because really, we should have led with that  Thursday during the Google earnings call.  Kind of a surprise.  Larry Page, Sergei, Sergey Brin and Eric Schmidt got on the phone and  Eric says, you know, April 4th, I'm out of here.  Actually, you know, what is he is the executive director,  executive chairman, executive chairman, which is a that's a  that's a made up title, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's hard to say.  According to the reports I've seen, he's going to be responsible  for a lot of external relations and partnerships  and dealing with government, which is a lot of what CEOs traditionally do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, yeah. He was off to do that right after the announcement. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's very strange to say that he's not going to be to say that  Larry Page is going to be the CEO now, but Eric Schmidt's going to be dealing  with all these external relations is like saying that someone's going to be a cook  now, but someone else is going to prepare the food.  I mean, in other companies, external relations is a huge part of the CEO's job.  So it's very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And they've got Sergey Brin to be the product guy.  This is kind of how Google used to be before Eric Schmidt.  Larry was the kind of the executive, right?  I mean, that's not what I seem to remember.  He was CEO before he was CEO.  And so this is just taking back his old job.  It did seem like very friendly.  But then we're seeing all sorts of rumors like this is from the New York Post,  probably consider the source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Google honcho Eric Schmidt, who announced his plan to hand over control  of the tech giant last week is eyeballing a career in TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Page six learns and I'd read you the rest of the story,  but there's some sort of interstitial ad covering it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's lovely. Listen, I'm from New York.  You don't you don't read the post. Let's not read the post.  All right. You don't believe that.  But there have been other reports of the TV show, which is just weird.  I mean, I just I think I've said on the show before Schmidt always kind of put me off.  Hey, this is a face made for TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Don't you want to don't you want to just tune right in and see  what old potato what old potato head has to say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're not right. You're not right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I have I have three theories as to what's going on here.  One of them theory one is from the guy who usually sits to the right here.  I think that was where I read it, which is that this has been foreordained

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  from the beginning. Ah, 10 years ago, they made a deal that this wasn't real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it wasn't really so much of a deal.  It was just kind of the idea that I think it was Jeff who wrote this, that  Eric was always kind of the regent who would rule until the true  heir to the throne grew up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My second theory, which is mine and by me, is that this is a man who's 55 years old.  He has I mean, how does he survive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How does he get up in the morning?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It got 100 million dollars just recently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, Google is not his first career.  So crying out loud, he's got his double AARP card.  Put him to bed. Give him some soup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm just going to keep talking seriously here while you guys just.  I'm 54. That's all I'm saying.  I'm saying this is I'm saying this is just this is not his first career triumph.  He probably just wants to do something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Former CEO at Novell and was successful there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Former executive at Sun was successful there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's if you read his Wikipedia article, apparently he wrote it  and a handy little Unix utility to in between.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He was integral in pushing Microsoft off its perch.  Anybody remember Microsoft?  They used to be a big company.  Yeah.  This is a guy who probably wants to go do something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Offered this bonus for him.  Ten, ten, 100 million dollar award if he sticks around for another six years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, that's great. I didn't know there was a contingent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, yeah, I thought he just got the money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, he's got to stick around.  This is what this writer story is saying.  That's interesting.  He is Schmidt said he expected to spend another 10 years of the company  and this 100 million dollar award.  He would have it's an equity award and he'd end to get it.  He'd have to stick around for six.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Can I just point out the guy's worth more than four billion dollars?  100 million in cigarette money isn't even.  Yeah.  That's the tip.  Yeah, it's like not even what is it's not nothing.  It's still OK.  That just makes me sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm just going to I'm just going to leave now.  I can't.  I think he I think all of this is disinformation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know what I think is going to happen in six months.  He's going to be the CEO at Apple.  You watch you mark my words.  Oh, boy.  That would be a trip.  Why not?  Isn't that what he and Steve Jobs are talking about  when they had that little coffee clutch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, the coffee class.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Remember, Steve was overheard saying, well, they're all going to find out  eventually anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, what they were talking about was, did you hear that they have this  train day latte?  It's huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's larger than the capacity of the human stomach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They were planning to take over the world with near field communications, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  To be a hundred million dollar equity award best over four years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, it vests.  It OK.  OK, that's that's that's not unusual to have that kind of a structure.  Yeah, you don't just give somebody something you expect something in return.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So we didn't hear we didn't hear Mitch's third theory.  All right. What's your third theory?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, the third theory is that the timing is good.  In fact, and, you know, Danny has written about this at length.  Google's been kind of faltering a bit,  you know, after Google Wave and after Google Buzz and all these other things  that they've tried and failed to get into the market.  It's a it's a good time for changing the guard.  But I think that's kind of lower down than the other two things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think he's a little injured by this past year of kind of missteps  and miscues, weird things that he said about, you know, the creep creeper,  creepy line, go right up to the creepy line, but not across it.  Things like that can't have helped his reputation with Larry and Sergey.  Of course, Larry has said a few stupid things, too, like we want to be your brain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a long time ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So he doesn't say that anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, he hasn't.  I mean, he hasn't spoken of the three of them.  He's spoken the least interesting recently.  And that's been kind of my theory is that both the timing and,  you know, Eric just kind of being sick of it.  I mean, he has had to be the public face now for 10 years.  This past year has not been a happy time for him in that,  you know, he says something and sometimes misinterpreted.  Sometimes it has been taken out of context.  Sometimes it's like you just shouldn't have said that  because it sounds dumb no matter how you say it.  And other times, maybe that's a sign of his fatigue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Maybe that's a sign of he's  of letting his guard down so he doesn't care as much anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I thought Ken Alletta had a piece, you know, he had spent a lot of time  there to write his book on Google, and he was in contact with someone  who said that that seemed to be the case, that Eric was feeling kind of down  and tired and, you know, thought he could get reenergized  and really couldn't do it.  So it just seemed like a good time to kind of check out and bring somebody in  fresh, even though Larry isn't necessarily fresh.  But at least if Larry has to start stepping up into the CEO space now  and he goes on to some show, the first thing they're going to not  they're going to ask him isn't so you said this, this, this, this.  Did you really mean all that?  He kind of loses some of that baggage.  The things people are going to start asking him is, so you're the new CEO.  What are you going to be doing or what's going forward with Google?  And it kind of changes the the conversation, I think, a bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is it OK? So the stock market  reacted to Steve Jobs stepping down by by killing Apple's stock price significantly.  They reacted to Eric Schmidt stepping up by bumping the Google stock price significantly.  Is the stock market right? Is this good for Google?  I think the stock market is never wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I find it difficult to say anything about stock markets,  because I usually find most investors seem to be idiots.  They don't understand anything about the companies that they buy.  And I, you know, it's hard for me to tell you whether this is good or bad for Google.  Because you know what it tells you?  Even though I spend so much time watching, there's so many pieces to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. It tells you what the conventional wisdom is,  which is that Steve Jobs is integral to the success of Apple.  And I think that that's actually probably true.  And that Eric Schmidt is far from integral and perhaps even  a hindrance to the success of Google. Is that true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's that's very well said.  I mean, you know, if Eric Schmidt were to leave Google tomorrow,  if he had said, I'm quitting, goodbye, I've just, you know,  I want to take that job. New York Post is right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have this TV job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oprah's calling.  Google would not, I think, noticeably have a problem.  You know, maybe Larry and Sergey might decide they need to have another person  to kind of keep them focused, which seems to be the main thing  that he's done based on reports is say, hey, Larry, Sergey, look over here again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That was his tweet. That was his tweet.  His adult supervision no longer necessary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But, you know, to where Steve Jobs really comes across as this visionary genius  who really puts a lot of himself in product.  But it is that is that is that is that who Larry Page is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is that who Sergey Brin is?  Is there somebody at Google who is an analog to that?  I mean, I remember I've taught, you know, in the early days,  10 years ago before Eric, I remember, you know, talking with Larry and Sergey  when it was a smaller company, they were much more available  and really having great conversations with Sergey about the search results.  And he was I mean, they're really into the technology in some ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think what Google, it's hard to say.  I think what Google has instead of that is this belief in testing and analytics.  So rather than Steve Jobs perhaps having an intuition and thinking,  I am so right that I'm going to do this and I will bring people into a new space.  I think Google tends to launch a product and then watch what people do  and then reshape it based on that kind of feedback to decide.  And do a lot of testing before they do it.  So, you know, their muse is analytics, I suppose, in some ways.  But it's it's hard to say.  But I can't I can't recall many stories where it's come out that, wow,  Larry really shaped it this way or Sergey really shaped it that way.  Or it was Eric's vision that made this sort of thing happen on a product level.  Occasionally, you have individual product people who seem to have a vision.  Wave was an example of that.  You had a team that seemed to have a vision of what it was supposed to be.  And it really was something different that wasn't out there.  You know, you have individual products in that way, but not not like an  uber product controller, I would say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, let's not forget what Eric said was the justification for this,  that they had three people participating in every decision.  And that made the company not nimble and agile enough.  So therefore they had to have a division of labor. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That it was, in fact, there were too many people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Although then they then they said, we're still going to have three people.  So it's like, who's the third?  Who's the third?  We're all still hanging out and who bodies and, you know.  Who's the third? Well, Eric.  Oh, so he was, you know, one of the things he said,  well, we're still all working together, we're still going to be making  these decisions and whatnot. So, I mean, it  that felt more like an excuse to me than anything.  But underneath it, I thought the thing that perhaps was more notable was that.  Previously, Larry was president of technology,  I remember correctly, and Sergey was president products,  or they might have been flip flopped.  I'll search for it in a second.  But with this change, those those titles went away.  So Eric's been stepping up into this new thing that he's doing,  which seems to be I'm going to go out and I'm going to get a glad hand  to be nice to all the business people I need to make the deals with.  But I don't necessarily have to go on CNBC anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Phew. Oh, that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And Larry seemed to be like, all right,  I'm going to be doing that role going forward.  Get it. You don't want to be dealing with it.  I'll pick that up.  And I'm also going to take a firm hand on all of our existing products.  And Sergey, your job now is blue sky.  You are supposed to be figuring out where the hell our startup culture went.  And how do we start having products internally that are emerging  instead of all these products now that we're either having to build by  or we're seeing people used to work for Google, go off and build them  outside of Google because they said he's a part of strategic products  and everything else.  So to me, that was the main restructuring.  I thought that was going on with Google.  It almost felt like they're saying we're going to we're going to build  the garage again at one point, and Sergey is going to take control of that.  And Larry will make sure that the house is staying in order,  that we're already living in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Maybe.  Well, that sounds, you know, business as usual.  I just I feel like Eric's not going to be around that long.  I mean, I think they made a lot of effort to imply that to reassure people.  I just feel like, you know, TV show or not,  I don't think he's going to be around that much longer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that hundred million dollar bonus points to  you give you give somebody it points to the idea that he was  he had a foot out the door and they want to drag him back in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That that he was ready to leave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, the hundred million to me says,  let's just give him this thing and we'll put this vesting in there.  Maybe that'll make some of the investor things that believe that he's going to.  I feel like all this, even though it's nothing money to him. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's it sounds like, you know, Google wants him to stick around. Right.  And that they're just giving him incentive to do so.  So it makes it sound like it's maybe more his decision to step away.  Or maybe that he does have a foot out the door.  He has been thinking about that.  Just it seems like a symbolic move, like, hey, we really want you to stick around.  And this is why the vesting is built in.  It's very common for companies to do this, even small startups.  Vesting equity over time is a way to hold on to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Never give people the award all at once. Right.  If you want them to stick around.  So it was in other words, it's not a goodbye gift.  It's a stick around gift.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a we want you to stick around, which I think is a is an interesting,  interesting move, public move by Google, you know, gesture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All right. Let's see here.  What else?  I should tell you what, let's take a break because there is a lot more to talk about.  We're running short of time. We've got a great panel here.  Gina Trapani from SmarterWear.org and Lifehacker.com  and ThinkUp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  ThinkUp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I'm going to and we'll talk about it later.  A cool, cool, new thing.  A cool, new thing. Yeah.  And also with us, Danny Sullivan of SearchEngineLand.com  a guy has been watching search engines for as long as there have been search engines.  Is that about right? When did you start doing that?  Ninety six. Oh, good Lord.  Back in the Alta Vista days.  It's pre-Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We walked through the snow and mailed our queries to Alta Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was Alta Vista. It was Yahoo.  Google wasn't there in 96.  No, it was. Northern Lights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Northern Lights.  Nobody that's alive now was alive then.  It's it's amazing, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So, yeah. What an interesting beat to cover something that is 100 percent changed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Totally upended.  It's fun. Yeah.  Well, that's why I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I keep getting to come to work one day and say, oh, there's not going to be anything more going on.  It's all done. That's why I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Absolutely. Absolutely.  Also with us, Mitch Wagner, a fellow San Diegan from the CMO site.  Yes. .com.  Glad to have all three of you on today and we'll continue on in just a moment.  And I'll do if I'll tell you what, normally, Jeff was not here.  Jeff's at Davos and the Germans wouldn't allow him to speak because they knew it was a Google show.  So they've they've blurred his voice.  Blurmini. Blurmini.  I am in Blurmini.  But but he normally does a number of the week.  So I'm going to give Mitch and and Danny a chance.  You have a few minutes while I do this ad and then we'll get to the number and to come up with a number  that you think is a is a reflects something, a trend in the news this week.  Number number.  I'll let you search while I talk a little bit about hover.com.  Domain registration done right.  I was so happy when I was getting along.  Actually, hover is is not something new.  You remember Domains Direct.  They've been doing this for a long time. Part of two cows.  They've renamed and rebranded because they realized there was something missing  in the in the domain registrars out there.  They all looked like a carnival site.  You know, they all look like, you know,  dancing chickens and and and 18 clicks before you could even buy something.  And hover said, you know, it's really should be easy.  It's not a complicated thing.  So they've created if you go to twig.cover.com, you'll see how clean, simple and easy it is.  You couldn't get simpler than this.  Search for a domain, transfer a domain.  They don't do hosting.  So they're not going to upsell you on their hosting.  They do they do just a few things.  You can either have your domain forwarded,  which is what most people think of as domain hosting.  You know, I have Leoville.com.  The registrar doesn't host it.  I have professional hosting service.  You they'll also do email forwarding for you.  So you can have a domain register with them.  And this is a good idea, even if you're not going to put up a website,  get your own domain, a family name or it's such a great thing.  Because then with the forwarding, you can use Gmail or Hotmail,  whatever the heck you like, or your ISPs mail.  But you're but you can change around your your your email address never changes.  It's always, you know, Leo at Leoville.com.  It has been for 20 years.  So that's a that's a if nothing else, a good reason to do this.  You can have custom URLs as well.  And it's very affordable.  Plus, there's not the upsell.  For instance, you know, those other guys will they'll sell you privacy.  Say, well, you've got the domain, but you don't want anybody to know where you are.  So do would you like to buy domain privacy?  It's whoops. I went to the wrong site.  It's free on hover.com. It's included.  It's automatic domain.  Of course, you don't want anybody to know your information.  Go to twig.hover.com.  You'll save 10 percent off your new domain.  With the Twig offer code, 25.  If you've got a bunch of domains to transfer, I wish I'd done this.  I thought I'll do it by hand. What an idiot.  If you have a bunch of domains to transfer, just spend the twenty five dollars  and they'll transfer them all, which is really great.  Transfers are free.  They will charge you ten dollars for the domain transfer,  which is applied to your next year of registry.  So in effect, you're going to get an extra year of registry for ten dollars  when you transfer your name over. That's a good deal.  Twig.hover.com use the offer code to again, you'll save another 10 percent on top of that.  We thank them for their support.  Let's start with the well, you know, can we do a quick  we'll do a quick news rundown because there's so many other stories.  I almost hate to leave any of these up.  We're running out of time.  Android 3 platform preview and SDK tools.  Have you looked at this, Gina? Have you? I know you're a developer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I haven't had a chance to install the new SDK yet, but Lifehacker just posted  a screenshot tour of what's in the SDK now.  So this is a preview of Android 3.0, which is honeycomb.  No due date yet. It's a preview.  So it's still unstable. Things might change.  But it's Android built specifically for larger screens.  So tablets, essentially.  So if you hit Lifehacker right now and click on some of those images,  you can see that there's a new theme.  I think they describe it as a holographic theme.  It looks really pretty. It looks. Yeah.  Yeah, it looks really pretty and optimized for big screens, tablet screens.  But we'll also be running on the smaller handsets.  So I'm super excited.  So we'll get this on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We'll get this on our Android phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, they're not forking Android in the sense that there would be a tablet  Android and then a handset Android like honeycomb will be  will be for all screen resolutions and sizes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So eventually, when it does roll out, everyone will get it.  There'll just be support for larger screen screen resolutions.  So it's looking it's looking really, really good.  And, you know, I think there's going to be some serious honeycomb,  hot honeycomb action at Google I.O., which will be in I think it's in May.  But registration opens up in February.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're going to do that. We're going to we you suggested.  I think we will do this. You're going to be there. I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I will be there if I can get registered in time because registrations go fast.  But yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So we'll get we want to do the show from there.  I'm sure we can get some help from somebody at Google. Hint, hint.  Yeah, I'm I bet we could probably get because I'd love to do the show from there.  We you know, we covered it.  We covered that they had last year, they had two keynotes.  And with the first one was good, but the second one was where all the juice was.  And we need to cover both of those and then do a show from there.  So we'll do that in May.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That'll be awesome. That'll be awesome.  But I bet there'll be a lot of honeycomb going on at I.O.  I'm looking at the Lifehacker article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And, you know, all the attention goes to the eye candy. Yes.  But there's some things that is more than I can.  This is called the action bar in every click on that image.  You can enlarge it. OK, we'll get more details here.  Yeah. So this is in every application.  There's some context sensitive  buttons here. Mm hmm.  And this is a complete redesign.  Look, there's the trash.  I mean, so and you click this stuff.  This is refresh.  So this will be consistent across the board on all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It looks that way. It looks that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The in every application, the child app.  Yeah, it looks like a Gmail app. Yeah. Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. A tablet optimize a tablet optimized Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So there's two bars.  They say the image there's a new message button, a refresh button at the top.  When you select a message, the action bar changes display, a move to folder button.  So in other words, this bar here is going to be context sensitive.  The second row down here, depending on what you're up to, which is huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because normally when you're developing an Android app,  and I've learned this firsthand the last couple of weeks,  you have to bury all this functionality in the menu.  Right. So you're asking users to tap the menu.  Hard to find. They don't know. It's hard to find. Right.  So if you have this constant context sensitive menu bar, which a lot of apps  build in, you know, seismic builds in a lot of the good apps actually build one in.  But it'd be nice to have it, you know, as part part of the development process.  Like, hey, you're going to have this menu bar and buttons are going to change,  depending on your context. I'm excited about that.  The keyboard looks good. Copy and paste looks good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is cool. Yeah, it's good stuff.  Yeah, it's a much it looks like a much larger.  This would be great on a tablet, that big keyboard. Yep.  And the copy and paste is already in gingerbread.  This is that new those new sliders.  You haven't seen that on your Nexus one, but we have that on the Nexus S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, twist of the night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now we had heard we had heard a rumor that you'd have to have a dual core processor.  But now they're saying, no, no, no, that's just what we'd like you to have.  But it's not required. Right.  Yes, because otherwise it would leave every phone in the market out.  Right. Pretty much be that wouldn't be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although the fact that they have some imaginary phones,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  the fact that they haven't updated  the Nexus one to gingerbread is a little concerning.  Like, maybe they feel like, hey, once it's a year old, you got what you got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, this week I got a notification about an update and it was Android two, two,  three, two or two, two, three.  And I just had that moment of like, yes, no.  But I know they said that next couple of weeks back in early December.  So I'm hanging in, hanging in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They haven't said no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They haven't said no. They haven't said no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can now port your home number or whatever to Google Voice.  I like that. Twenty dollars. I don't like that.  But that's nice if you have a number you want to keep  and you want to use Google Voice.  I think everybody should use Google Voice.  Is there any negative to Google Voice?  Any of you guys feel that would make anybody  want to stop before they port their main line to it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you can't port your main line or your mobile number.  Oh, if you have a landline, you can't move that over yet.  Just your mobile numbers.  And I actually ported my mobile number over.  They let me test it out for the past six months.  So I moved it over and I did a write up yesterday about it.  Probably the chief negative is a couple of people feel like sometimes  the quality of Google Voice because you're going through their network doesn't hold up.  I can't tell.  I can't tell sometimes whether it's Google Voice or it's just AT&T or Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So if I port, Danny, if I put my iPhone phone number to Google Voice,  does that mean all my calls now have to go through Google Voice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They'll be routed through that.  Yeah, every call.  If somebody calls your number, it will go through Google Voice  and you'll be talking to the Google Voice network as it gets to your iPhone.  Oh, that is a negative.  If you call out, you can choose to use, if you will, your real number on the iPhone.  Or and then you just go pure AT&T or you can use Google Voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you do have on outbound calls, you have the choice.  It's only the when people call.  But that's the case when somebody calls my Google Voice number.  They're calling me on Google Voice.  Yeah, right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For the most part, I've loved it.  I mean, it's just the freedom and it's my number.  Plus, at one point, I had four different mobile phones I was testing.  So it was great that I could just I I felt like I could accessorize.  I'm going to go out rollerblading.  I'm going to take the iPhone because it has the flip case.  Now I'm going off here and I got to walk around.  I've got the Samsung. Fascinating.  It's very light. So it'll go my pocket.  Someday all of us will have to go to.  But it made it very easy to know that any phone I took,  I would have my phone number go to it.  That was wonderful.  Although, you know, people are not carrying four different phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, but it's like what I was talking about with the email,  having a personal email address and then having it forward.  It's the same idea.  Ultimately, in the future, we should all have one phone number.  Maybe we should just have one thing.  And then if if if an email gets sent to it, it's email.  If it's a phone call, it's phone call.  If it's text, really, ultimately, shouldn't we just all have one number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's it. I have I have I have two two items on my wishlist for Google Voice.  And I'm hoping Google listens to this and they'll do it.  One of them is I think you actually need more than one number.  You need different numbers for your different roles in life.  I want to give one number to my friends and family  and another number to people I work with.  That makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So, I mean, I do that kind of because I use contact groups.  So that when my wife calls, it says, Hi, honey.  Sorry, I missed you. Love you.  And she and she says, Do you tell everybody who calls you  and leaves a message that you love them?  Because she doesn't really understand that.  No, no, it's just for you.  And then if a business associate calls and there's different responses  and if it's a number I don't know, that's a third response.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm going to call your voice number.  I want to know what my message is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, you know where you stand in the ranking, depending on one message.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't know you. I don't want to talk to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Am I friends or coworkers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've always wanted Darth Vader music as my theme song.  Yep. Whenever I go in a room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I thought Carmina Burana would be good, maybe.  Oh, it's like you're calling Satan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The other thing I want from Google is a true desktop VoIP app.  Because right now I patch it through to Gizmo or I patch it through to Skype.  And it's just like rubber bands and duct tape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They bought Gizmo and they took it off the market.  Please do something with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's terrible the way Google does that stuff.  They buy it and they kill it for a couple of years before they bring it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is by the way, Gina, if you call this is your ringtone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just as in just as acceptable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's the dark fury on line four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The seventh rider of the apocalypse.  All right. Let's OK.  That's a good story.  So no reason not to port.  Go for it, man.  Love Google Voice. Love Google Voice.  Google buys a company called Say Now.  This is to bolster their voice service. What is Say Now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What is Say Now? No idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Don't tell Lou. Say now, say now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a song. It's confusing.  It seems to be something where you call celebrities and leave messages for them.  And I'm a pitiful message is back or something like that.  It sounds like some sort of stalker enablement service.  Just. It may be just hang around David Letterman's house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You could call Fitty Said or Tricia Yearwood.  Gee, decisions, decisions or the Jonas Brothers.  Fans call and leave a message in the stars can then, quote, call back.  But see now, obviously, they don't tend to apply.  I mean, I think Google would say, well, instead of stars, what if this is you?  Right. Celebrities can connect with their fans.  No, this must be they they have no use for this.  This must be Dane Cook uses it.  And if I'm so there. Oh, yeah.  I could call Dame Cook. Wow.  Here's here's a Dane Cook.  This is a call. No, no, that's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am live right now from my desk.  And we're just going to say the word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I can't get the car mean of your and I have, but it's somehow

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  suited my head down on a book that I'm pretending to read and drooling.  And so I'm at my workplace.  No, I don't like that either.  That sounds like a person that's about to go home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And this is the end times, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So this is like voice publishing.  This is like YouTube.  I think it's kind of interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think that Google could do something with this, not with Dane Cook, obviously.  What about because they couldn't get group group on all the rumors  are they're going to do a group on clone or some sort of coupon thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, it's coming.  You're going to do it.  People are getting people are finding Google  coupons and getting that confused with Google Groupons,  which aren't aren't Google Groupons will be called Google offers.  They're coupons from Google.  That's a nice thing to it, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's Google Groupons, coupons, but coupon that confused the hell out of everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Would be great.  But yeah, they're going to do it.  And man, it's like, OK, if you don't want our six billion dollars,  we'll sink it into something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it's called Google offers.  It looks and operates like Groupon or Living Social.  You get an email with a local deal of the day.  You could buy it.  It's the same business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess it's who's to say Google's going to be able to execute?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Last week, what did Living Social?  They were selling those  Amazon gift cards, $10 for 20 dollars card.  Right. That's that's huge.  Well, it's going to put six billion into Groupon.  I suppose that that could give them a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is the cost, the true cost of that.  Somebody wrote an article and I would like to give them credit, but I can't.  But the real cost of this is Salesforce on the ground.  Yeah, because both these companies have to put a you know,  you're it's it's aggressively local.  You've got to have a salesperson in every single market, at least.  So this is a huge cost.  You're talking thousands of new employees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Google has never had a strength as a hands on people to people company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Maybe they can do some sort of Python Salesforce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Did you see the state of the web?  I know.  Love it. The Groupon love it.  Where it says a group on got young people excited about about coupons again.  It was just hilarious.  It was my my favorite part of that, that whole comic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Pulling it up right now.  Let me this is the state of the web right now.  If you go to, oh, let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I got to find the oatmeal dot com slash comics slash state underscore web  underscore winter.  Maybe the oatmeal state of the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The oatmeal state of the web.  Facebook is now used by one in 13 people on earth.  Lord Zuckabeast demands more.  That's good. I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's got moves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's got some. I don't know what that is.  It looks like a happy face.  It looks like a happy face.  Every once in a while, Facebook makes all 500 million of these people  switch to a new layout.  Oh, my God, there's new layouts and outrage.  I can't believe it.  15 minutes later.  Oh, hey, you're using the new Facebook layout.  How do you like it?  Verizon plus iPhone.  There goes the one reason anyone ever signed up for AT&T.  Oh, don't say it.  When I saw this one, Gina, I cried for you.  Just skip that one.  I cried for you.  Let's skip that one.  Yahoo almost buries Delicious, but apparently the internet is still using it.  Dear Yahoo, if you sell Delicious, please sell it to someone who won't build a competing service  within the same company.  Yahoo bookmarks.  Apple launches Ping, a social networking music recommendation service,  which subsequently takes over the music industry.  Just kidding. No one's using that crap.  Yeah.  He, by the way, made this Tumblr goes down page for Tumblr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I love that.  The Tumblr.  It's a great, great graphic.  And they used it.  Listen to the audio.  Look this up because it's really cool.  They used it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's so cool.  That's neat.  Now, finally, here we go.  Groupon was my favorite, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Groupon manages to make young people excited about coupons.  1910 and 2010.  Holy hamburgers, Martha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Buy one sack of ground beef and get a free aircraft carrier-shaped cheese log.  Sweet Jesus, Bill.  2010 plus.  Holy swine juice, Chrissy.  Get $200 worth of pork chop milkshakes for only $100.  Jesus coupon cap in Christ.  The savings.  So incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Love that.  You use those things.  You shouldn't mock Groupon users.  You got to have a manicure for, mani-pedi for 20% off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not a big Groupon person.  No?  I did find myself very excited about getting double points at the grocery store last week,  and that's when I realized that I am truly in my mid-30s.  Like I'm growing up now.  I'm excited about my club card.  Next thing you know, you'll be listening to talk radio.  I love the pork chop milkshakes, though, because that just really encapsulates.  It's like this thing that you absolutely do not want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let me sign up for Groupon.  Let's see pork chop milkshakes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We can get a mani-pedi together, Leo.  Let's see what today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  $25 for $50 worth of tea.  It is.  It's hipster at Samovar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's hipsters.  I went through weeks worth of Groupons that came to me,  and it was just constantly eat, eat, workout, workout, eat, eat,  and get your hair done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I wouldn't have time for all those things.  What would Kevin Rose want right now?  And then they put that on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is there a lot of hot air balloon rides and paragliding,  like all those kind of things that sound really exciting,  but you never get your act together to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Transcript:  All right.  Let's get to our tip.  And I hope you guys, I gave you time, have come up with some numbers and I have a  fabulous new tool of the week.  But first, Gina Tripani, your tip of the week, dear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Tip of the week.  This is a really good one.  I'm excited about this new Gmail labs feature, an unread icon, unread message icon count.  So if you go into your Gmail account, you go into labs, you enable this new lab on your icon,  on the Gmail icon, it will show the number of unread messages in your inbox, which is awesome.  Because it means you can pin the tab, say in Chrome and only show the fav icon,  but also know how many new messages you have.  This feature has been in the Better Gmail Firefox extension, which I maintain.  Which you wrote?  Yeah, which I maintain.  And it's really cool.  And actually, a Gmail engineer emailed me and said, hey, what do you think should go in labs?  And I said, look at my extension.  I think all these things should go in labs.  And that was a while ago, but it finally happened.  So it's really cool that you don't have to add, you don't have to install any extra add-ons or  extensions to get this.  And it's just super useful to, not that I recommend monitoring your email box constantly,  but it's a nice way to see how much mail you have without having to switch tabs or get any sort of  toaster pop-up.  This is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You go every few days or weeks and look at what's in labs, because there's always new stuff,  isn't there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There is always new stuff.  They tend to do a post on the official Gmail blog about new labs.  So yeah, I just keep on top of the blog, because Gmail is literally one of the things  I spend most of my time in during the day.  So that's something that's...  So I've turned it on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So now this is going to appear where?  In the icon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In the fav icon, in the tab.  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, that's cool.  So I could just kind of go to another tab, but then I will see how many messages I have managed  to ignore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In the...  So if you...  Uh-oh, it's loading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  You know how many tens of thousands that number is going to be?  Yeah.  Are you actually really going to stretch the loop it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Counting, counting, counting.  Checking, counting, counting.  It's going...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can't lift it.  It's too big a number.  It's going to be wider than the fav icon.  We're going to need more tabs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right.  Thank you, Judah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  For normal people who have less than 10,000 messages in their priority inbox, it's very,  very...  It's still counting.  No judgment.  No judgment.  Is it still counting?  It's still counting.  That's nuts.  Look, the spinner even gave up.  The spinner's like...  The spinner's like, I can't do this anymore.  I can't do this anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I need to get three more.  It's going to show up like there is no number that large.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Seriously.  It's going to say Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Say like a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's going to say you have a Google messages in your Google inbox.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's good.  No, that's a good tip.  I like that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now, who among you, the two of you, Danny and Mitch, do you, either of you, have you a number?  Should I start with Danny?  Oh, I have one.  Mitch has a number.  He's going to get you off the hook, Danny.  Yes, Mitch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The number is...  I'll tell you how I got the number because I'm so cool.  I Googled Facebook number and came up with a Time Magazine article that said mobile is  going to be the number one priority.  So then I went to the original Wall Street Journal article, which said 200 million is  the number.  Wow.  200 million is the number of people who access Facebook on mobile devices every day.  Every day?  Yes.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Amazing.  That is amazing.  That's quite amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the CTO, Brett Taylor, said that mobile is going to be the top priority  for Facebook development going forward.  And one of the things they're going to be doing is trying to move to HTML5 because  right now they have to run seven different versions of the client.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  So I am very awesome for having come up with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The 200 million, that's a great number.  And my tool of the week, I was looking around.  I saw the Android marketplace and I said, what is this to do dot text touch?  And it turns out for a mere $2, I can have Gina Trapani's first Android application.  Yay.  What does it do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Tap the button.  This button?  Log in to Dropbox.  Oh, I got to log in to Dropbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it saves the, it saves, this is from to do dot text, which I've always loved,  which is a text based to do list.  You could store it in Dropbox and then load it in here.  We talked about it last week, but I just wanted to say it's in the marketplace.  Yay, Gina.  Congratulations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yay for Gina.  Thank you.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually, it was an experiment.  I wanted to test this hypothesis that no one buys apps on Android.  So I offered, so if you go to the GitHub repository downloads area,  you can download the app for free, but it's for $2 in the market.  And if for your two bucks, you get auto updates and that kind of thing through the market,  not thousands, but hundreds of people have bought the app.  So people buy stuff on Android, even though they don't probably don't buy as much,  as many apps as they do on iOS, people do buy stuff in the market.  So I'm really excited.  I want to thank everyone who did buy the app.  There's lots of really cool updates coming offline use,  home screen widget, location based stuff.  It's going to be really cool.  And it's well worth $2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm I, you know, I don't care that I can get it for free.  I was very easy.  It's great.  I'll log into my Dropbox and I'm going to have my to do list on here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm so excited to have your name in my Google checkout orders inbox.  Leo.  Thank you.  Do you see it?  I did see it.  I do see it.  I did.  I saw it for just a couple of minutes ago.  I was like, thank you.  Yeah, I just bought it.  Awesome.  Thank you.
