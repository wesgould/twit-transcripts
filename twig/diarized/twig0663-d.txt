This week in Google, the show we cover the latest news  from Google. Turns out there is a little bit of news from Google. Today was Google I.O. Jeff  Jarvis joined me and Jason Howell as we covered the I.O. Good morning and good afternoon, Jeff  Jarvis. How are you today? You've been in that chair for what now? 10 hours? Hours and hours,  I don't mind. I don't mind. Man, that's butt rock. Jeff is the Leonard Tau Professor for  Journalistic Innovation at the fabulous Craig Newmar Graduate School of Journalism at the  City University of New York. And I have something, but I'll talk about that in a moment. Also with  us, Ant Pruitt from Hands On Photography. Hello, Ant. Good to see you. Hello, sir. Stacy has a day

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  off today. What? I gotta tell you, I'm glad that you decided not to sit on that tiny chair today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I sat on it for Windows Weekly. The show was a lot shorter as a result.  Special saddle on a stick. Stacey. He's got to stick up his... Oh, the pain. Stacey's not here,  but good news. Mike Maznik is from Tech Turf. It's great to see Mike. TechTurf.com. Now, Mike,  you weren't here last week, but we somehow discovered that Jeff Jarvis' photo was available on eBay,  so I have a great expense purchased. Oh my. Oh my. It's a very good, the 1990 press photo of Jeff  Jarvis. I actually got two of them. I don't know. Because the hilarity was just so... This one,  I think is marred because your name is circled in ballpoint pen. I think they got this from your mom.  Did she have an auction of her... Let's see, this one. Oh, this is an even better one. This is Jeff  and some other guy. My nemesis. Entertainment Weekly publisher Mike Klingensmith. Probably a member  of the Interactive Advertising Bureau, I would guess. Oh, yes. All right, so it's time for the  ritual framing. We thought you weren't going to be here, but I have prepared a little... We need some  mood music for this. Strangers in the Dark. I'm super-seeing this. No more Ms. Mary Jo Foley.  I put a spell on you. Yeah, it was a picture of Mary Jo Foley and underneath her, some windows guy.  So anyway, we're going to... I just look, okay, I didn't have a frame. I thought, well, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  we'll borrow Mary Jo's. Here we go. You know what's funny is the world of algorithms.  I'm still getting emails now because I attempted to get one of those images as well. Hey, it's not  too late. It's not too late. So every other day, he was like, hey, you're interested in this pic of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis? I got you covered. Go to the wide. Let's see how this looks on the set. There you go,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  right next to Jeff. Before and after. Look at that. That needs to be there every week. Every week from

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  now on. You're exactly right, Mike Mazda. I was young once. You want to hear something kind of  sad, kind of poignant. What? So because of this, I thought, what is on eBay? So I went on and searched  myself on eBay, which I'd never done. And when I moved my parents out of Florida, I gave their books  away to the goodwill. So now the books of mine that I dedicated to my parents for sale on eBay,  folks. Signed by Jeff Jarvis. Like they abandoned me. They asked at Google I.O. if people Googled

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  their names and surprisingly few raised their hand. Embarrassed, I guess. But that's a step  beyond to go onto eBay and look for eBay. Here's 10% off my 2004 technology almanac.  Just $7.74. It's so up to date. PC help desk only $5. Buy two, get one free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Holy cow. Oh my God. Here's my dad's. Wait a minute though. Wait a minute. I have bragging

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  rights because as low as my books are, my father's book is $1.99. Or best offer. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  there you go. I gotta go call dad. Or best offer. I gotta call dad. Wow. There's actually a lot of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  crap. Old. A lot of people dumping their books. Oh, see there now my dad's other book is $65.  That's a rarity. Rarity. Quite a few copies of my father's book on here. Books. This is good.  Quite a few. $2 or best offer. Here's what an excellent condition $2 or best offer.  Whenever you give me I'll take it. My guide to Tevo is $157 for some reason.  Don't buy that one. Get the one with CD-ROM. It's only $5. Cost less if you get the CD-ROM.  Okay. Anyway, enough Merth and Merriment because it's going to be a depressing show.  Mike, when you arrived you said breaking news. The Texas Appeals Court, the Fifth District has  ruled that the Texas social media law can proceed. A lower court had blocked it.  That injunction has been lifted. The panel stayed. A district court injunction that had paused the  law while judges consider an appeal of the lower court's move. The decision was supported,  which was supported by only two unnamed judges. Nor did they immediately publish their reasoning.  You presume there isn't any. According to protocol, it came after a Monday hearing when  the jurists appeared to struggle with basic tech concepts including whether Twitter counts  as a website. It was pathetic. So Mike, what is the, just out of curiosity, the social media law

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  in Texas? It has a few different components and I don't think any of them are actually  constitutional if we had a Fifth Circuit that wasn't crazy. It requires some element of  transparency in terms of how social media websites handle content moderation. They have to publish  certain rules. There has to be an appeals process and you have to explain every decision more or  less. Oh my God. And if people feel that the explanations are not up to whatever level,  they can complain and the Attorney General of Texas can take action against the websites.  It's effectively trying to restrict the social media website's ability to do any kind of content  moderation, especially obviously the kind of content moderation that the current political  class in Texas does not like, which means anyone who supports Donald Trump or Greg Abbott.  They're basically going to be able to sue different social media platforms and they will do so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It sounds like the Florida law minus the exemption for Disney.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is very similar. There are a few very minor changes that doesn't really make a difference.  They're very, very similar laws. Florida's law, so both laws were passed and both laws were then  sued to block them and in both cases the district court stopped them.  Because of the first freaking amendment, right?  Mainly because of the first amendment and then there was an appeals hearing for the Florida law  about two weeks before the Texas one, but we haven't had the ruling.  The hearing in the 11th circuit for the Florida law, the hearing there went really well and the  judges seemed to really get it and seemed very, very skeptical of Florida's argument as opposed  to the hearing in Texas where the judges seemed to have absolutely no clue. It was all over the maps.  Web site? What's a website?  Just all of the comparisons were weird. They didn't understand section 230. They didn't  seem to understand the first amendment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A thousand dollar handshakes right there, man. That's all it is. A thousand dollar handshakes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, and then this is two days after the hearing. I mean, they didn't even wait.  Florida is still sort of probably coming up with their written opinion on this,  whereas the Texas, they just put out this announcement saying that they've lifted  the injunction and the law goes into effect immediately and they'll give out their opinion  at some later date. So it's going to be a mess. If I were running a social media company right now,  I would be talking to my lawyers this very second trying to figure out if we can still  do business in Texas because I think it's extraordinarily risky to have any users in  Texas right now if you meet the qualifications of this particular-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now I'm nervous because we, Twit runs Mastodon instance, twit.social.  Forums would count, right? We run our own forums on discourse at twit.community.  It does a chat room count. We've got chat rooms and we've got users in Texas. So you're not  giving me legal advice, Mike, but I mean, are lawyers all over the country telling  social networks don't allow Texas users?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's possible. I forget the exact details because there have been so many of these  kinds of laws. I forget the exact thresholds. There may be some thresholds in terms of size  for the Texas law. I'm sort of pulling it up in the background here. So I don't remember what  Oh, because if we're small enough, that might not be an issue.  If you're small enough, you might be okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But these are really aimed at Twitter banning Donald Trump, really. Let's be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, that's exactly what it's used for. But to be clear, that doesn't mean it doesn't affect  you, right? I mean, you use Twitter-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fifteen million monthly users or more. So we're out of the dark on that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By a hair.  By a hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But who knows, right? I mean, next month, you might hit that number. You don't know.  But it does also impact the services that you use. You guys use YouTube, you use Twitter,  you use Facebook to promote stuff, you use Discord. And all of these services may be impacted by this  and it may actually limit your ability to communicate with people in Texas, for example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Texas argument was that social media is a common carrier. And they want social media to  carry all content unmoderated the way a phone company is expected to carry all calls. That  means no zero content moderation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That'll be such fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The whole common carrier thing really frustrates me.  Because if you understand what a common carrier is, just by its very name, the idea is you are  carrying something from point A to point B. And historically that might be people or cargo,  and then it became data or voice. But social media is hosting something perpetually. It's  not just about getting from point A to point B. And the idea that-  It's not ephemeral phone calls.  Right. The idea that you should be forced to leave up content in perpetuity,  you know, that may be harmful or otherwise problematic or harassing.  There are all sorts of issues with it. And so the push to declare social media common  carriers is really, really bizarre. And it's especially bizarre because the very same people  who are strongly pushing to declare social media common carriers absolutely freaked out  and spent years complaining about attempts to make broadband carriers common carriers,  which where there's a much stronger argument, this is the net neutrality debate, right?  There's a much stronger argument that a broadband player should be covered by net neutrality,  that they should be a common carrier. They are point A to point B.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't it hysterical how they don't want ISPs to be common carriers, but they do want Twitter to be  a common carrier, completely reversing the meaning of common carrier in a-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. One of them actually makes sense as a common carrier and one of them doesn't,  and they have it reversed. And in fact, I forget which bill, because there have been so many of  these bills. I don't remember if the Texas bill has this, but some of these bills have explicit  language that says, this cannot apply to a broadband provider. So you can tell that AT&T  and Comcast lobbyists went in and said, okay, this is fine as long as you have this line,  kind of like Disney lobbyists in Florida saying, add in the theme park exemption until we've pissed  off DeSantis and then we move it. Now they're going to take it out, right? Yeah. Let's move it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just essentially using these laws and these courts to espouse a political point of view,  having nothing to do with the reality of the nature of the nature. It's really depressing  because- It's a position of victimhood.  But this is what you're seeing. This is what you saw with Roe v. Wade. They couldn't get the  legislature. They couldn't get the voters to overturn it. So they went the extra, the judicial  route, bypassing legislatures. This is a very, it's a useful route to go to the, you know,  go to judges. Yeah. Yeah. And in this case, this is a law that was obviously passed by the Texas  legislature, but it's, you know, obvious. I mean, I'm not a lawyer, but I mean, I do think the first  amendment says the government shall make no law infringing free speech. That's exactly what this  is. Isn't it? Or no? Can I ask two questions? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  First, I can't, like you, I can't keep all the laws straight. Is this law like the abortion law  that doesn't so much as government step in, but allows citizens to sue? If I remember correctly,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and again, like there are different laws, so I don't remember all of them. I think the Texas law  only allows users to complain. The only one who can actually enforce it is the attorney general.  So the attorney general can then bring suit on behalf of residents of Texas who complain.  I think that's what it is. I don't remember the details. And again, a lot of these

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  HB number 20 and act relating to censorship of, or certain other interference with digital  expression, including expression on social media platforms or through electronic mail messages.  What? So, well, you know, and again, email, common carrier, a little different than social media.  The idea is that no, regardless of the position you state, you should be allowed to say it,  which I, you know, I don't disagree with. Some have said,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  but don't forget, there's also a right of the company to not have to carry things.  And that's why the free speech thing is interesting. That's why the free speech

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  thing is interesting. They're saying, well, it's the free speech of the people posting.  And we're saying, well, yeah, but you can't abridge the right of Twitter or any other company to

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  moderate. That's right. So email is a common carrier. Yeah. Email is a common carrier,  considering that somebody manages these servers and stuff the same way they're managing all of  our social media. Cause I'm sure a vast majority of users aren't like you, Mr. Laporte, hosting  your own mail server and things like that. So email is exempt from this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I don't know why, what the email part is. But just to clarify,  it sounds like they just threw that in. I'm sure some email provider required something,  but the way to think of it is instead of, you know, when we talk about content moderation,  just think of editorial discretion because that's what it is. Right. This is content that you're  hosting on your website. You have editorial discretion over it. Free speech is about,  you know, your right to speak, which you, you know, you still have your right to speak. It  doesn't mean you get to commandeer somebody else's property in order to do that. I can't put up  political signs in your front yard because that's, it's your property. Right. If I want to put signs  in my front yard, that's fine. If I want to set up my own website and post stuff, you know,  nobody can stop me from doing that. But I can't commandeer somebody else's website to post.  And yet this law is effectively saying, yes, effectively the state can commandeer private  property and force postings there. And when you think about it that way, it feels like it goes

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  against everything that, that, it's like being forced to put somebody's law, somebody can put  a lawn sign on my lawn and I have no choice in it. Right. Right. Because you can't discriminate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like that's basically the argument saying that, saying that, you know, I can't put the sign for  the politicians I want in your yard is, you know, is a discrimination issue. Is the sort of

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  larger thing going on here? Sorry. The larger thing going on here is this, is this idea of  victimhood. It's the whole cancel culture. Yes. That, and it's, and it's, and it's, it's right  into Musk, which we'll get to in a few minutes, which is, which we'll also have to give Mike his  blood pressure medication when we get to, where, where it's, it's a weird phrasing now is basically  anybody can say absolutely anything. And if you restrict that in any way, because you, you, you,  you have standards, then, then you're going to be accused of, of canceling. And then I, the speaker  of this noxious speech, I'm the victim. And so it's a weird way to turn white people into victims

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  all the time. Yeah. Sigh. In the future of the car, Elon gave a keynote address in which he  talked a little bit more about his plans for Twitter to which off the cuff. I wouldn't just

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  say there, Mike, it's always off the cuff. He has no deep understanding of any of this. Everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that he says is off the cuff. Yeah. And should it, we should be, see, here's the question.  Should we be treating it that way or should we take it seriously? If it, I mean, he sounds like  he's making it up as he goes along. We should take the threat seriously, but his thought, he

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  has no serious thought. Yeah. I mean, he, he has instincts and he's going off of his gut and, and  like, you know, to be totally fair, like I understand sort of where he's coming from. And  like that instinct is a natural instinct that a lot of people have. And a lot of people who use  these services have the very same instincts that he has, which is that these services are, you know,  ways in which people can speak and speak broadly. And the idea that somebody can step in and say  that you can't speak has a feeling that, that feels wrong. And so I understand where he's  coming from, but, but, you know, anyone who's spent any time sort of looking at and understanding  the nuances and the depth and the different challenges involved in that, recognize that  it's a lot more complex than that. And, and the thing that really bothers me is his unwillingness  to even engage with the nuance and, and complexity involved in all of this. And just to assume that  the instinctual first thought that he has on this issue is the correct one, even when it  contradicts itself. And that's part of it is that so much of what he says actually contradicts  himself. And so it's, it's just, the whole thing is extremely bizarre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is weird. And he, you know, the truth is he still may not get it. He's right,  trying to raise more money. A surprising number of people have bought into his,  you know, plans for Twitter. He's got, he had to come up with 21 billion. He's raised seven  billion so far, 5.2 billion in equity commitments from 18 investors, plus a rollover of 35 million  Twitter shares from Saudi Prince Alawi bin Talal, a billion from Larry Ellison.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Scott Cunningham Who, by the way, who was going to resist  this supposedly? And his, that word lasted about 30 seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  800 million from Sequoia Capital. Again, you'd think, you know, savvy investors,  but they're buying Elon's, you know, PowerPoint deck in which he says, well, it's easy. We're  just going to triple revenue and then we'll go public. Quadruple. Quadruple. 700 million from  Vi Capital, 500 million from Binance, 400 million from Andreessen Horowitz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Andreessen Horowitz, what's his name? Not Andreessen, the other guy.  Horowitz. Ben Horowitz.  Scott Cunningham Yeah, Ben Horowitz. Thank you. Just had this ridiculously  haggigraphic, however you say it, tweet about how brilliant Elon is and how amazing he is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's what you're buying, right? Look what he's done. We'll give him money for anything he  wants because he's so brilliant. Jack Dorsey, maybe, who could have rolled 2.4% in, has not,  despite the haggigraphic things he said about Elon Musk himself, nor his Founders Fund,  another big true believer. So there's still some question whether he's going to get it. Maybe  that's one of the reasons he's so fast and loose at a financial time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Scott Cunningham But if he tries to get the price down,  if he tries to get the price down because the market's, you know, going to hell and my FU  money is telling me to go FU for one, that's an excuse for Twitter to back out if they had any  spine, right? Ben Horowitz

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They would have to pay a $1 billion. Scott Cunningham

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, no, no. If he says the opposite, if he says, no, I'm not going to buy it unless  you lower the price and Twitter says, we're not lowering the price. So then Musk could be the one

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Musk would then have to back out. Scott Cunningham

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He has a fine or penalty or something. Ben Horowitz  He has a billion dollar. Scott Cunningham

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He has a billion dollar. Ben Horowitz  Pull out a fee too. He said at the Financial Times Conference,  I do not think, I'm sorry, I do think it was not correct. Very hard to get these  negatives in order. I do think it was not correct to ban Donald Trump. I think that was a mistake  because it alienated a large part of the country and did not ultimately, is that why it was a  mistake? And did not ultimately result in Donald Trump not having a voice. Well, no, he was the  president of the freaking United States. I think he had a voice. That wasn't the idea. I really  like what it was. It was Sean Yee who said, look, don't moderate based on content, moderate based  on tone. But you got to moderate. And as you pointed out, Mike, on Tech Dirt, Elon's points  of view are contradicting. Scott Cunningham

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, he says a lot of different things. And so he keeps talking about free speech as  being the most important and not banning people. And then at the same time, he will say his top  priority, and he said this multiple times, including at that conference yesterday, the  Financial Times Conference, that his top priority is to get rid of spammers and scam bots on the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who have every right to speak because they're protected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sean Yee Their speech is absolutely protected under the First Amendment. So if he really  supports the First Amendment, he wouldn't be doing that. It also says a lot that he thinks  that that is the biggest problem, which for bigger users does appear to be maybe a problem.  And certainly there are people who, you know, it's a problem for him. It's very much a problem  for him. But like, you know, I don't every once in a while, I'll see one, but it's really not that  big of a deal. But he is the biggest problem. What do I see as the biggest problem? Elon Musk

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  owning this site. No, I mean, I'm not gonna sit here and just all out defend Elon Musk on this,  but he's one of the smartest cats on the planet. And if he's not one of the smartest dudes on the  planet, he knew he knew how to get a lot of the smartest people on the planet in the same room  to get things done. Over the last few years. Again, Twitter is a business. And if he can figure out a  way to help make that business thrive, then more power to him. I'm not sitting here saying he's  going to make Twitter better. But I don't know if he can really make it any worse than what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, he could make it worse. He can. He can turn it into a smart. I disagree with you. He's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He can turn into a fortune. Yeah. So if you don't moderate, what do you get? You get four people in

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the same room. Yeah. So I think I think there are a few things. One, I think that, you know,  to his credit, one of the things that he has shown that he can do really, really well is come up with  sort of a big project and get the people together to actually accomplish it. And these are big  projects that other people did not think were possible. And that includes like a mass market  electric vehicle before anyone else was willing to do it. And the whole like flying to space thing.  And those are those are huge, massive projects that most people thought were impossible. But  those are very different than speech. And what you're dealing with with Twitter is speech and,  to be more specific about it, society and the way that people interact with each other.  And that is a different kind of problem. It is not a problem of building something. It's not a  problem of manufacturing. It's not a problem of like, you know, figuring out the physics of  anything. It is figuring out people. And if there's one thing that he has shown that he is not good at,  it is sort of figuring out people and how they interact with each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, his tweet says that. Yeah, the way if you want a Twitter that's like Elon Musk's  Twitter verse, I guess that's okay. It's not something I'd want to. But then that's the beauty

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  of Twitter. You don't have to follow Elon Musk. Does he take away our tools to moderate? Does he  can't block anybody because you have to listen to everybody? It's absurd. I don't think he wants to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  do that. He has no idea where his line is on. But Ant's point of view is one I hear a lot from  Elon Musk's stands who email us and saying, why didn't you have somebody on to defend Elon? So  I'm glad you said that, Ant. There are a couple of possibilities. One, what have you done for me lately?  Elon has not shown necessarily good business acumen in a number of things, despite the fact  that the stock makes him the richest man in the world. He's still working on the stock.  By the way, this whole process has tanked his personal fortune by something like $30 billion  as the Tesla stock goes down. So was this a good business move? Well, it remains to be seen, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  so far not so good. And every car maker is going to compete with Tesla.  I've said that. Tesla's value is so through the roof, so unreasonably high at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's worth more than any other manufacturer of automobiles. The space business has a couple

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  of customers and it also has new and upcoming competitors. The space business, I have to,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to give him more credit for the space business even than Tesla. SpaceX has really shown  that you can do this. He did it in engineering. He brought the people together, but I'm saying

Transcript:  that I don't think he's as smart a businessman as he is. And I was thinking about this today with  Google when we get to them. They had the easy life of dealing with information. Mark Zuckerberg  and the Twitter founders had the hard life of dealing with human beings.  Human beings are tough.  Society of human beings, as Mike said, is what's tough here. And Elon has no idea clearly how to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  deal with human beings. And let me ask this, Mike, and maybe to, has Twitter failed in the last 15  years to bring in the smartest people to try to solve this? Have they not, admittedly, it's a hard  problem, but have they not done the best they could to solve these issues over the last 15 years?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, obviously, everybody could do better, right? There are ways to do better. But I had  written an article a few weeks ago where I went through and I looked at, and this is in part  because people were saying I was being unfair to Elon and I was interpreting everything he said in  the worst possible light. And so I went through everything that he had said about his plans at  the time for Twitter and looked at it and said, in the best possible light, what does this look like?  And then I looked at the things that Twitter is already doing and that they're already working on,  that the current management has set in motion. And almost everything that he said, if you  took the sort of best interpretation of it, the sort of most free speech supporting, the most open  system, the most transparent setup at all, Twitter is working towards all of that,  but doing it thoughtfully and actually doing it carefully. It doesn't mean they've done it well  to date or that the eventual things that they're going to roll out will meet that,  but they've taken all of these steps in that direction, but very carefully because one of  the things that they've realized is that these things are really tricky. And if you do it wrong,  you can create a much bigger mess than what you have today. So they have these different  projects in terms of algorithmic choice, which has been Jack Dorsey's big thing,  allowing people to choose their own algorithm and allowing third parties to create algorithms.  That is not working yet because it's a very difficult problem to solve and you have to do  that very carefully. You have to do that in a way that won't be abused and won't make the spam and  the scamming problems worse. In terms of freeing stuff up and opening stuff up, Twitter funded  Blue Sky, which is now a separate organization that is trying to build out this sort of social  media protocol that Twitter could then use, which is sort of what I think Musk might mean  when he says open sourcing the algorithm. Just purely open sourcing the algorithm and putting  it on GitHub, as he keeps saying, doesn't do what I think he thinks it would do and also certainly  opens up the system much more to the spammers and scammers that he's so upset about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He said yesterday he wants to put it on GitHub. Put the algorithm on GitHub, which...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's not how it works, right?  That's not how it works.  And that's just opening up all sorts of questionable things. Twitter, I think,  is trying to be as transparent and as open as possible, but they're doing it step by step  very carefully because they recognize if they get that wrong and they open up their systems in a way  that leads to a vulnerability in the system or other kind of security flaw or opens it up to  spammers and scammers and whoever else, that's not good. And so when you look at the things,  if you look at the best possible version of what he's talking about and then you look at  what Twitter is actually doing, not the sort of fantasy that you'll hear on Fox News about  what Twitter is doing, you begin to realize the company is actually doing some really thoughtful  things. And I think have really hired some really good people who are taking careful moves in this  direction, but it is somewhat slow going. And so maybe if he is able to understand that,  the things that the company is doing, that could be good. And I do think-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, none of that's algorithmic. Sure. I might point out. What's the algorithm he's  talking about? What algorithm are you talking about? It's not like Facebook. I mean, if you  can follow Twitter chronologically or you can follow their best tweets, I guess that's the  algorithm he's talking about, but that's not the most important part of any of this. That's just-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, there is an algorithm in terms of which tweets are recommended to you and which are not.  Yeah.  And he is concerned about that. So what?  Yes. Yes. And as Jack Dorsey has pointed out, Twitter is the only one of these companies that  allows you to turn off the algorithm completely and get a purely chronological or reverse  chronological feed if you want it. But the one thing I will say is that the one thing that I do  think is good about this move is turning Twitter into a private company again, taking it out of  Wall Street. Because I think a lot of the problems that we've seen have actually been caused by a  few institutional investors that have been really demanding huge revenue growth and huge user growth,  and they are pushing the company to make these moves in the very short term to hit these  quarterly numbers that I think has caused Twitter to make some dumb decisions along the way. And if  you take them out of that quarterly reporting system and let them take a longer term view,  I think the company could do some really amazing things with it. And so that aspect of Twitter  going private I think is valuable, but I'm not sure that that will work very well with Elon Musk.  If only with a better owner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  Well, as I said, I'm not-  What if he's a hands-off owner?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I honestly think that could be good. But he's not really shown that that's-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff Bezos style with the Washington Post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But has he ever shown anything that he's involved in, he seems to be very, very hands-on  about. So, the other thing that-  Somebody just- Go ahead.  Sorry. I was going to say, the other thing that is worth mentioning that happened this week with him  was that when it was announced that he was going to take over, some European politicians got very  upset and sort of put out this letter that was like, dear Elon Musk, we have rules. And basically  we talked about that last week.  Yeah. But on Monday, that guy, the guy who wrote that letter, who heads the digital- I forget  exactly what his role is, but he's sort of like the digital guy in the European Parliament. He  went to Austin, Texas to meet with Elon and they filmed this weird video. I mean, it really looks  kind of like a hostage video where he says, I'm glad I was able to explain to you the DSA,  which is the Digital Services Act, which is the new, one of the big two new laws coming out of

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Europe regarding- Just everything Musk should hate,  everything that he should hate, everything that he doesn't want, everything being forced to moderate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. And even more importantly, something that Twitter has actually spent a lot of time  very vocally, very publicly pushing back against and saying, if this law goes into effect in this  way, it will negatively impact speech and it will suppress speech and it is a problem. And here are  changes that need to be made. And this guy goes to Texas, meets with Elon and then films this video  where he says, I'm glad I was able to explain the DSA to you and it sounds like you agree with me  now. And Elon stands there and says, yes, we're completely aligned. I agree with everything that  you're saying and I want to support the DSA, which is like, for him to go out and say-  180. Yeah. And for him to go out and say like, he's supporting free speech. Twitter has been  pushing back against this law over and over again saying, this is bad for speech. This will  harm speech. And then immediately to have Elon come in, say he's the free speech guy and then  say, oh yeah, we support this approach, which will require Twitter to take down all sorts of content,  legal content is the structure of the DSA is really, really problematic. It's just bizarre  and suggest that again, he just doesn't understand what's actually happening. He's not listening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's not really, really grokking this, but to your point, so somebody an hour ago said,  I predict that Elon Musk will eventually ask Jack at Jack to be CEO of Twitter,  to which Jack responded 20 minutes ago. Nah, I'll never be CEO again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I, that's the last thing Jack Dorsey would ever want to do is to work for Elon Musk.  Work for Elon Musk. Are you kidding me? Elon really gives the impression,  much like Donald Trump did of going along with whoever the last person he talked to said like,  oh yeah, that's a good idea. I'll do that. Oh yeah. Here he is with Thierry. What's his name?  Language is hilarious. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to explain to you the DSA, our new regulation in Europe. And I think that now you  understand very well. It fits pretty well with what you think we should do in a platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I think it's exactly aligned with my thinking. I very much agree with,  it's been a great discussion and I really think I agree with everything you said really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh my God, that's hysterical. That's hysterical. Yeah. I'm going to pull down everything the  European union wants me to pull down. Thierry, you are so smart.  As long as I put Donald Trump up, then everything is fine.  Great meeting. We are very much on the same page, tweets Elon Musk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But what this all says is, and this is where Jack was right when he did his confession of,  of the problem is that it was centralized into a company and it shouldn't have been.  The internet's still young and this teaches us that these human entities, Facebook, Twitter,  can't be in this structure. We talked about this last week. We got to keep talking about it,  but it's going to require some building or some using of things to break out of this.  I still have hope for blue sky. Mike, do you have any hope for blue sky?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I have tremendous hope for blue sky. I think, you know, it's, it is slow going,  but there, you know, like there are some really, really smart people there and they are working on,  on a really thoughtful approach to this. You know, the real question is whether or not they  can actually turn it into something that people will use. I think their approach is much smarter  than almost any of the other ones that I've seen out there. So I am really, really hopeful. You  know, the thing was before this, we knew that Jack and that Parag really supported blue sky and that  they were very supportive of it. And therefore that suggested that assuming blue sky built what,  what was promised that Twitter would adopt it and bring the users. And once you brought the user  base, you would have a lot of power to then do a whole bunch of other things. Now with Elon,  he has yet to mention blue sky, as far as I can tell, some of the stuff he said sounds like he  should support it, but it's unclear if he will. And therefore blue sky might be kind of a drift  and on its own and then having to find its own user base, which, which might represent a challenge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And my theory is that Jack is being nice to Elon to try to in favor of blue sky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I hope so. I mean, Jack certainly sort of keeps bringing up blue sky as one of the things that  he believes in, that he supports, you know, so hopefully he can get it through to Elon,  that it's a good thing. You know, I'm sort of, I'm sort of in this state where like, I don't know  if it's good or not that Elon keeps not mentioning blue sky, you know, maybe it's better for everyone  if he doesn't know about it. Right. And let it, let it go. But the fact is like, you know,  I think it would be really helpful for blue sky in the long run if Twitter were to adopt it and  bring its users along. And then that opens up all sorts of really interesting possibilities,  you know, of a, of a world where you have social media as this kind of protocol set up,  and then you can have all different people building on top of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then add to your, to your hands off point, then if Twitter becomes the everything goes  platform where everybody can say anything, which is another way to say the internet, then okay.  But then on top with blue sky, Mike can create his, I'm going to find just the good stuff for  you and I'm going to get rid of the bad stuff for you. And you pay me for to do that for you.  And you then have nice Twitter on top. You know, that's a world I can, I can live with

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  because it's basically the internet. Yeah. I get it. Let's take a break. Enough Elon for the day.  Thank goodness. Just remember I've got Jeff Jarvis by my side.  When we come back, Google, huh? Google hub, Google, uh, I O I O I O it's off to work. I go,  we will talk about Google. Finally, AI will explain jokes to us when we come back. But first,  and the pixel book and the non-existent pixel book. It's exciting. It's really exciting.  It's just going to be a lot of fun. Uh, but first, before we do that, I do want to talk a little bit  about what a good night's sleep I had last night. Thanks to my eight sleep pod cover,  the pod pro cover goes over my existing mattress. You can actually get an eight sleep mattress as  well. So you can go either way. We got the pod pro cover because we like our mattress goes right  over the top. And we've had in the past, we've had heating, you know, uh, blankets, electric blankets  on top. Then we tried one with those, a mattress pad. This is, this is like that only like from the  22nd century, the eight sleep pod pro cover heats and cools. It can go as cool as 55 degrees  Fahrenheit, as hot as 110 degrees Fahrenheit. And it has a built in sleep doctor with biometric  tracking that watches how you're sleeping and adjusts the heat to help you sleep better. And  I can testify it really, really works. One of the 30% of Americans struggle with sleep  and temperature is one of the main causes of poor sleep. Too hot, too cold. I'm telling you,  a great night's sleep is a game changer. It's nature's best medicine. It can reduce the  likelihood of serious health issues, decrease the risk of heart disease, lower your blood pressure,  even reduce the risk of Alzheimer's. And by the way, it's just nice to have a good night's  sleep. I've set it up so that it start, I start warm as I get deeper into sleep, it cools down  and my sleep is as a result more deep. And then in the morning around eight o'clock, when I want  to get up instead of an alarm, I just have the bed start to heat up and I wake up naturally.  It's incredible. The temperature of the cover will adjust each side of the bed based on sleep  stages, biometrics, it knows the bedroom temperature. So, and reacts intelligently  to all three factors to create the optimal sleep environment. You wouldn't know I had  a good night's sleep last night. I have been on the air since 10 this morning. Eight sleep users  fall asleep up to 32% faster and reduce sleep interruptions by 40%. Overall, get a more restful  sleep. I love it. With 30% more deep sleep, you just know your mind and body are moving through  those restorative sleep stages. You're getting a more restful sleep. You just feel great.  I love our eight sleep cover. So does Lisa and she sleeps different than I do. So that's fine.  But that's why there's two sides to the cover. And so she can have the temperature she wants. I  can have the temperature I want. Look at that. I'm just, I always like to do this during the ad,  look at my sleep fitness from my eight sleep sleep tracker. Can you see that there? 96%.  My heart rate variability 74 milliseconds. High is good. My resting heart rate 58 beats per minute.  Low is good. It's just fantastic. You could set the temperature. I'll turn it on right now,  even though I'm not in the bed. I can turn it on remotely. You could set the temperature  anywhere from minus 10 to plus 10, which is very hot. I won't set it that hot. You can also set it  initially to have a sleep graph. You see, you really want this deep optimizing phase where  your temperature goes down. This is why it's not good to sleep hot at night. And I can't wait for  a hot summer night where I could actually be like having air conditioning in the bed. That's going  to be really interesting. Autopilot is great. It's the thing that automatically watches what I'm doing  and then makes recommendations, watching all of the feedback that it's getting from the room  temperature and how I'm sleeping and tossing and turning. It's really kind of brilliant.  It is really an amazing technology. Go to eight sleep, E-I-G-H-T sleep.com slash twig. Check out  the pod pro cover. You'll save $150 to check out eight sleep currently ships within the US,  Canada and the UK eight sleep.com slash twig show up as the best partner parent  or version of yourself every morning with a great, wouldn't it just be so lovely to have a great  night's sleep? You can. This thing is amazing. I really, Kevin Rose told me about it first.  And then Amy Webb, who was on that show, she tried it. She said, oh man, you got to get this.  And we did. We put it, we installed about six months ago. I'm glad to be doing ads for them  now though, because I'm a believer. Eight sleep dot com slash twig. Thank you so much for your  support of this week in Google. You support us when you use that address though. Please do that.  And you'll get $150 on the pod pro cover. $150 off. It's a great deal. Eight sleep dot com slash  twig. So I'm looking at your temperature. What's my current temperature?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no. What's the temperature you would just say you like? You know, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cause they just say plus and minus. So I start on my, I start, actually I just turned it up  just now. I shouldn't. I normally start at plus, that's not good. Plus turn it down. I go plus four  normally. And then it goes down to plus two. I actually had it cooler than that. And it was a  little, I would wake up in the middle of the night and be a little chilly. So I adjusted it. And then  the auto doc autopilot, the sleep doctor kind of adjusted it. And so this is, it's not, it's not a  huge curve. So you manually adjust it. And then I wake up, it's a plus three. I have to say, I like  it a little warmer when I get in bed because it can be a little chilly at night. And so I get in  and it's just cozy and comfy and I fall asleep right away because of it. It's a really cool  technology. I have to say this is the eight sleep. Then you start dreaming of Elon and then the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  temperature goes up. Yeah, it goes way up man. Way, way up. Yeah, I like it. It's fun. So I thought

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  this is going to be easy because, and then I've lost it. Darn it. I had a, a cute sketch of all  the things that were announced at Google I had just had it open. Let me see if I can find it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Recently closed windows. Oh rats. Uh, I found myself yawning during most of it. I was less,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  yeah. And you didn't have to work. So, uh, so Jeff and Jason and I had to pay attention. Yeah. You,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  you lazy sob. We were there working. I had to stay awake. Yeah. I have mixed feelings about it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to be honest with you. Um, there was some really cool stuff as always, but I also remember from  previous Google IOs, a lot of cool stuff announced at Google I O never materializes. There was less  of that kind of track record. Yeah. Yeah. You feel like there was more good stuff. You thought there  was something worthwhile. There was just less pie in the sky. Here it is. I found it. This is from,  um, uh, Chu key Chan. She did a lovely little sketch. This is going to help us  everything that Google says at the key. Little, little dirt, little drawing. They talked about  Google maps and YouTube. Did they talk about YouTube? Oh yeah. A little bit about YouTube  and Google translate Google assistant. They talked about Lambda Android 13. They did announce some  hardware, but they did it in the kind of way that I think disappointed a lot of people. Um,  there is going to be, as we knew, a new pixel six a, but you won't be able to order it until what?  July 21st and then delivered July 28th. And I have to think that's going to be supply chain issues,  $449 looks very nice. Got a lot of the same features. Maybe not. The camera is maybe a little  less than the six pro, but that you'd expect that they also preempted the, the, uh, gossip  mongers, the rumor mill by saying, and by the way, this is what the pixel seven is going to look at  this fall. You and a body aluminum looks nice. Yeah. Next generation tensor chip. Uh, they also  mentioned the watch, but they said, because we remember we saw the stolen watch. Rick Osterloh  came out. He was wearing it secretly underneath his, underneath his sleeve, but that's not going  to say a price. Did they, they didn't say a price, no price. And he said next year,  no, no, the watch comes out with seven this fall. Next year is, uh, what's, uh, slated for the  pixel tablet. They really push it. They really wanted to push the tablet on developers, like  develop for the tablet, develop for the tablet. So they said, we're going to have a tensor based  pixel tablet, uh, which looked exactly like they had ripped the screen off a nest hub max  and said, here's our tablet. Not impressive. Not impressive. We can move through it if you want,  um, bit by bit. Sundar Pichai was the MC. It was live, uh, shoreline amphitheater as it had been  before COVID. Have you ever gone to a Google IO, Mike Maznik? Yeah, I actually went to a bunch

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  way back when it, when it used to be at Moscone. Uh, so I have fun. Yeah, I used to enjoy it. Uh,  but then like after I probably went three or four years in a row and then, then I started to  realize like, I wasn't sure I was actually getting that much out of it. I mean, it's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's exactly the feeling I had today. It was like, well, at the time you're eating it,  it's like cotton candy. It's, it seems like it's really good. And then you're hungry an hour later.  It didn't, what was the substance of it? It's hard for me to pinpoint. Yeah. AI is getting smarter.  There's going to be some stuff translate. They showed some glasses. What'd you think of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  glasses, Mike? I haven't seen the details. I, it's just like AR glasses. I mean, yeah. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  they have a couple of people like a mother and daughter, the daughter speaks English. The mother  can understand English, but can't speak in it. The daughter doesn't speak Mandarin. The mother does.  So they gave them these, these are like the old man glasses from up the big black,  big, thick temple. Yes. They put them on. Now the thing that was cool is the text as the mother's  speaking in Mandarin shows up in a heads up display on the lens as to the daughter can read in English  what the mother's saying. But that's one way. Remember they showed something similar with the  Google earbuds, right? Where it was like the Babel fish or you put it in your ear and she talks and  she's, I'm hearing it in English and I talk and she's hearing it in Mandarin. That never did it  ever. I don't think it ever happened. You have to translate. You put the phone out and it'll do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I guess the phone does a pretty good job, but they haven't figured out the UI for the rest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they showed this thing in the, you know, what three years, four years ago, they showed the  earbuds. Still doesn't happen. So I feel like the glasses are similar. It's a really, to me, a good  use of augmented reality. The other use that they showed, which they didn't mention glasses, but  earlier they showed you could use your phone, take a picture of first it was a candy store and the  shelf and you could see all of the different chocolates by name, by rating, and you could  pick the best one with the right parameters to show the vision, the recognition in kind of real  time. And that would be, again, the kind of thing you'd put in glasses. You're looking around,  what's the cheapest blue jeans here? And you could see the prices on all of them, things like that,  but it's all very blue sky. It's all very, well, someday you will like the 18, the old AT&T commercials.  I can continue to go through this. Some statistics, 1.6 billion buildings mapped in Google Maps,  60 million kilometers worth of roads. They're going to be mapping these buildings in such a way  that you'll be able to, they showed London kind of zooming in and it's kind of like a 3D projection  generated, not a photo, of, you know, Westminster Abbey or, you know, the House of Commons.  You can kind of, they didn't move around or anything, they just showed it. That was all.  But that's their new immersive view, someday in Maps. They also want to do restaurant walkthroughs.  They've showed this a hundred times, right? Eco-friendly routing, which is in there now,  which will say, you know, you could take a drive there in 10 minutes, but if you're willing to take  15 minutes, you could walk there and it'd be better for the earth. Nice. YouTube has auto-generated  chapters. They're using DeepMind to do that. They've been doing that all along. They have  8 million videos now with auto-generated chapters. They hope to have 80 million by the end of the year.  Video transcripts, that's cool. In multiple languages, that's really cool. So right now,  you're going to caption a video as you're watching it, but they're going to add translation to that.  So I could be watching a video in Polish and see it in English. That's kind of neat. They're going  to add Ukrainian to that translation soon. Google Docs will have it. This feels like the change log.  Leo, it's 2025. Someday this will all happen. I mean, it's just, it's neat. They spent a long  time talking about skin tone equity, but again, this is something when the Pixel 6 came out,  they made a lot. They did ads. They showed this a lot. They talk about the monk scale of 10 skin  shades. But they now open source that. If you go to skin, actually, they really good page at skintone.google,  which talks about what they're doing, the scale, the monk scale. He's a sociologist at Harvard who  identified this scale and how Google's going to use this to improve not only their photography,  but also to give you better recommendations in YouTube videos. If you looked up a makeup video  in YouTube, for instance, you could get one that matched for your skin tone rather than,  you know, something completely inapplicable. All the recommended practices in skin tone ML research.  To some degree, I feel like this is green washing from Google. And I wonder how much people buy it.  I mean, don't we know that Google's business is ads?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We know that their business is ads, but at least from my perspective, I saw all of this stuff  announced today is like sort of status quo. It's like, well, yeah, I expect you to take your  existing technology and try to improve it. You know, you have this machine learning for this,  this machine learning for that. That's all they said is, yeah, we're working on our current stuff  and trying to make it better. Thanks. Just set it in about two hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't want to be mean on all this, but I just feel like Google hasn't done a whole lot.  AI test kitchen was, remember last year at Google IO where you were talking to the planet  Pluto. Remember that? Having this weird conversation. They got more of that  than that with Lambda. Lambda two is out now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Look at it this way, Leo. Twitter is now on the verge of becoming the destruction of all free  speech. Facebook is now a laughing stock as to what it was. Amazon stock is going down and nobody's  sure what's going to happen without a pandemic. Google looks pretty good by comparison.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe tech giants lost more than a trillion dollars in value over the last three trading days.  You're wondering why your 401k looks so anemic. Maybe that's why. Apple has seen its market  capitalization trimmed by over 200 billion since last week. 200 billion. That's one Disney.  They lost the whole Disney. Who are the big winners? Campbell's soup, General Mills, Smuckers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jesus. It's all sitting in our homes eating jam out of a jar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Microsoft lost 189 billion. Amazon 173 billion. Tesla, the big loser. Well, almost as much as  Apple. They lost to Disney too. 199 billion. Alphabet, a mere 123 billion. This isn't three  days, kids. Nvidia, 85 billion. Meta, 70 billion. The only reason Meta only lost 70 billion is they  already lost hundreds of billions. They've heard so far down. The US stock index, the S&P 500,  declined 7% since last week. The Invesco, Nasdaq 100 ETF off by 10%. I mean, I don't know how much  the stock market has to do with the reality of how tech companies are doing and the products  they're making. I guess somewhat has something to do with it. It's just kind of a gloomy time for big

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  tech. Yeah. I wanted to go back to the keynote for a second. You mentioned, and I believe it was in  the Twitter news coverage, you mentioned Google playing a bit of catch up to Apple with the stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that they announced today. It was all catch up to Apple. It was all showing features on Android

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that Apple's done for years. But okay, at one point in time, there was a lot of discussions where you  say the same thing about Apple. Apple's going the other way. No, yeah. And I mentioned that.  We're doing the same thing that Android's been doing for years. It's good for these companies

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to cross-pollinate, you know, if you've got a good idea. I'm not saying Google's stealing it,  but it's hard to trump it. You know, oh, look, when I opened the case of my Google pods,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the Android phone sees it. Oh, it's a miracle. But that's what I'm saying is how much more can  these companies do nowadays to wow us. It's not much that they can do anymore. And if they're  trying to play, quote, catch up with Apple, I don't know if that's a bad thing considering how  much Apple has in the bank. Oh, well, minus the news you just discussed. But sorry, when you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  worth two trillion, a couple of hundred billion here or there. No big deal. No big. I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just wonder Google, you know, they talk a lot about trust. They had their head of trust out  there and safety and how we're doing more stuff on device. You know, we don't sell, they made a big  thing. I wish I could find that segment where they say, we don't sell your information to third  parties. You know, they just collect it. We just collect it. We don't sell it to anybody. Oh,  we got your data. We got it. I wonder how persuasive that is to everybody. I think most  people kind of think of Google as a big, you know, advertising and I mean, obviously search,  but I think people are pretty savvy now to the fact that when you use Google, you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  giving them information about yourself. Right? Yeah. And a lot of people will argue about  Google collecting so much information on us, but yet at the same time, they do like the fact that  when they open up maps, they know that, hey, your job is 20 minutes away and you're going to be on  time today, even though you didn't necessarily say you're trying to go to work. It just knows  that you work at so-and-so and it's a work day of the week. You know, they know that stuff and

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  sometimes it's convenient. Historically, that's been the problem for Google, right? Remember the  Google Now and the smart cards? We're all excited about that, right? But historically, it's been a  problem for them to say, on the one hand, we know everything you're doing and we're going to offer  you your airplane tickets the minute you're right at the airport. And the other hand, but we don't  know everything you're doing and we don't want to know everything you're doing. It's very, it's,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  and that is going to be important. The more they can demonstrate that it's happening locally,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they don't know. And also, I mean, honestly, the more really useful it is, in some ways,  it becomes less creepy. The creepy aspect is when it's not quite right. When it's a little off,  you're just like, ooh, I don't really like that. When it just flows naturally, I think a lot of  the privacy concerns start to fade away. It depends what you think are creepy. I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  there are a lot of people who think Google knows I'm at the airport and is offering me my ticket.  They think that's creepy, even though you and I know how it happened and think it's a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I still think there are people who kind of go, I mean, the other aspect, and I think this is  one of the things that they're working on, is just making a lot of that more transparent to you. I  think part of the creepiness is if you don't know how it happened, how they have the access to that,  you don't have control over it. So if you had more control over it and you saw this is the  information that Google has, this is what they're going to do with it, then I think people, and the  ability to say, actually, I don't want you to have that information. I'm going to delete that.  I think that would make people a lot more comfortable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Chad Moses Do you want us to do this? Do you want us  and put them in control?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Devin Holt I also appreciate the pop-up today from every time I logged in that was mentioning 2FA  and basically trying to shove it down my throat, hey, get 2FA, get 2FA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Chad Moses They showed that. They said that number,  but a significant number of people have started to use 2FA since they forced it on us. 150 million  new two-factor users, 150 million new two-factor users this year because they're requiring it now,  which is fine. It's a good thing.  Devin Holt That's great.  Chad Moses They did say there is going to be a new  button when you see an ad or you can go into your Google account and see it. The results about me  page, which will show you what Google knows about you and allow you to delete it and contain it.  I think that's good, yes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Devin Holt Yeah, I think it's a great idea. It depends  on exactly how it's implemented. I think when they've attempted to do things like that before,  you end up seeing this page with so much information that it's effectively useless.  Like I went through one of these things like what Google is using to tailor ads to me once  and it showed all of this information about like car dealerships in Texas. I was like,  I have no idea how or why and you could just scroll on for days and days and not be really  clear on it. If it's providing that information in an interface that is useful and usable and  understandable, then yeah, I actually think that's a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The other thing it shows is the computers aren't that smart. They don't know that much  about you. They don't do it very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John Greenewald I don't know when they added this,  but they pointed out that now in search, and this has been here for a while, I guess I just  never noticed, there's three dots next to every search result. You can click that three dots  and find out more about the result, more or less, depending on what the result is.  I think that's kind of cool.  Jeff Bezos That's been there for a while.  John Greenewald I guess so. I never noticed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jeff Bezos Facebook did similarly with trying to show you sources.  The presumption is this is part of the media literacy shtick. If we tell people more about  the sources, they'll understand. I don't know that that's necessarily true, but what the hell,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it just shows you how much you can look at a search result and not see the three dots because  I never knew I could do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff Bezos The three dots were there for a while,  but they served a different purpose, I think. They sort of changed that a few months ago.  John Greenewald So you might have had blindness to it from before.  I think before it was just for if you wanted to see a cached version of the page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff Bezos Somebody's saying the extra information was added a few years ago.  It's funny because they never mentioned it before as far as I could tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  John Greenewald But it still says beta on it too.  Jeff Bezos Yeah, well, that's Google, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  John Greenewald It's kind of a Prince's spaghetti sauce thing.  Jeff Bezos It's in there.  John Greenewald It's in there.  Jeff Bezos We tell people about this. It's in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John Greenewald We tell you everything. I used to be very pro-Google. I always knew that they  were an ad company and that they had my information, but I always used to feel like  of all the companies, they respect my information and they're more secure than pretty much anybody.  And I don't know, over time, I've gotten less sanguine about what Google knows and a little  more concerned about it. And I feel like that that is I'm not alone in that becoming more  concerned about that. Maybe it's because I'm hanging around with you too often, Jeff Jarvis.  I love you though.  Jeff Bezos I wouldn't have an autographed picture if I didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  John Greenewald Ask the show thumbnail right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff Bezos We saw Sissy Shou come out and glare at her Nest Hub Max and knew what was looking  and it answered her queries without her saying, hey, you know who.  And everybody goes, oh, that's nice. I could just look and talk,  except that already my Nest Hub is always talking to the TV, to the wall, to the random,  just all the time. I don't know, is it just me? But all the time it's going, like it's listening

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  for something and it never.  John Greenewald All right. So Mr. LaPorte, is that a Nest  hardware problem or is that a software problem?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff Bezos I don't know. It's not a hardware problem. I think it's,  do you have any Google Assistant voice recognition?  You don't see, you don't know about that. Jeff, you do.  Jeff Bezos Yeah, I hardly use it.  John Greenewald But it's you hear it going off from time to time, right?  Jeff Bezos More my phone goes off than the thing.  John Greenewald Mine goes off all the time.  Jeff Bezos Anyway, now you can look at your Nest Hub  Max because it's got a camera. It's a little disconcerting when I walk in the kitchen,  my Nest Hub Max goes, hi, good morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jeff Bezos It's been so lonely all night. Did you sleep well?  What was your temperature?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John Greenewald It is a fine balance really between these things becoming sentient.  You don't want them to be sentient. But at Google, I understand at least trying to  see where the lines are, right? That they can be useful without creeping people out.  She was like leaning over and glaring at it. I think that might be something you actually have to do.  I'm talking to you, Jeff. I'm talking to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff Bezos I'm sorry. I don't know what to do.  John Greenewald All of that's ambient computing stuff that Mrs. Higginbotham used to talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff Bezos Yes. G.com slash  AI test kitchen is the place to go. It is not live for me yet.  John Greenewald It's not much there now.  Jeff Bezos No. And I think it's going to be a while before it's live  for most people. It's kind of says we're going to slowly roll this out.  But you can at least get some idea of what the features will be.  I'm trying to go in there. AI test kitchen. Did I spell it right? Let's try it again.  There we go. A place to improve AI technology together. That's not at all dystopian.  AI test kitchen is an app where people can experience and give feedback at some of Google.  So the idea is you go in here and you could talk to Lambda. There are three demos. Imagine it.  You name a place. Lambda will offer paths to explore your imagination.  This is kind of like having a conversation with Pluto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  John Greenewald Yeah, it's kind of dumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff Bezos Yeah. And then there's list it. Name a goal or topic and see how much Lambda can break  it down into multiple lists of subtasks. So the example they gave on stage is I want to start a  veggie garden that gives you a few choices of things you should work on. Wait a minute now.  The presenter is doing this straight out of the canned demo on the web page and says,  oh, I never got that tip before. Oh, you mean this tip on the web page that comes up every single  time? You mean that tip? Okay, now I feel like he might have been misrepresenting the case.  And then apparently you can talk about dogs. But if you try to change the subject,  you'll change it back to dogs. And, you know, I'm honestly this is not far beyond Eliza, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I was like, back in time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John Greenewald It's Eliza. Yeah. I got this in my EMAX. That's how old this is.  So I don't know, I'm turning into a cynic, I guess. It did say that they could explain jokes to you,  which seems like the worst idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff Bezos Yeah, I don't think you turn it into a cynic. I think it's just you have lived through  a lot of pretty cool innovation.  John Greenewald It's slowing down.  Jeff Bezos It's slowing down.  Jeff Bezos So now it's like sort of plateaued.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John Greenewald Yeah. I'm disappointed because Google IOP used to be very, very exciting. It  used to be like, oh, I can't wait to see what Google's come up with next. I think some of it  is slowing it down and some of it is we're getting a little more cynical about the things  Google's promising because we know that maybe...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jeff Bezos Here's my bigger theory, which is that we hit a point where the technology does become  boring and what matters is not what the technology does but what we do with it.  And that's the exciting stuff. I've said this before, it's part of my book coming up,  but it took 150 years before Cervantes decided to use this thing to invent the modern novel.  That was far more exciting than the, well, first you put the type in and then you do this.  Jeff Bezos Technology becoming boring is probably a very good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John Greenewald I'm trying to find the results about you,  Paige, because I think that's kind of cool, but I don't know, is it not live yet? I mean,  I'm seeing the shots from the... Jeff Bezos The what?  John Greenewald This is the take control of results about you that we always talking about earlier.  Jeff Bezos Oh, okay.  John Greenewald I haven't yet figured out how to get that to happen on my phone.  Jeff Bezos Yeah, we just want flying cars.  Gumby's saying that in the chat room. That's all. Where's my flying cars? That's all I want.  All right, let's take another break and then we will... If we said everything there is to say,  I mean, there's, you know, Google gave a little elbow, threw a little elbow at Apple,  talking about RCS, their rich communication system and how there is 500 million active users,  but still nothing from, you know, the other guys, which is obviously Apple.  Apple's never going to support RCS in messages, I don't think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jeff Bezos They did not.  Jeff Bezos I complained.  Gumby's Go ahead, Ed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff Bezos They didn't put a price up for the watch,  did they? I don't recall. John Greenewald

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nope. No watch price. Not much about the watch, really. No more than we learned from...  Jeff Bezos They just kept showing it every 15 minutes.  John Greenewald The guy who left it in the bar. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jeff, what did you want to say?  Jeff Bezos So I usually complain about, of course,  they don't have a new Chromebook, which makes me cry and that's that. But they also didn't talk  about Chrome OS at all, which I found... John Greenewald

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was the weirdest thing that they left that out. You mentioned that during the  event or at the end of it. They didn't... It's like it didn't exist.  Now you only have two hours, there's lots of things to talk about, I guess.  Jeff Bezos It does seem like that and then you mentioned  Fuchsia. John Greenewald

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Would you rather talk about Chrome or dogs? I would have taken Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff Bezos Yeah, yeah. Maybe there wasn't much to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff Bezos Well, even in the code labs and pathways here  on the IOS site, there's only one lab for Chrome OS. Everything else has multiples.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John Greenewald If you were a developer,  would you be saying, oh gosh, I got to start developing for these Google platforms? I don't  think so. I don't think there's much of a come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff Bezos I would assume they're saying they want  to develop for mobile, but not necessarily Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John Greenewald Yeah, well, that means iPhone, right? It means IOS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff Bezos Because everything is in the palm of our hands.  John Greenewald Any developers in IRC thoughts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff Bezos There used to be the time when we would have  people develop just for the web and it would work on any platform.  John Greenewald Oh, yeah.  Jeff Bezos Oh, yeah. Back in the old days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John Greenewald Well, they did. Okay, so they didn't mention  this. I'll probably mention it at the developer's keynote, but they did have a Google IOPinball game  developed in Flutter, which works. It's actually really cool. Works in your browser.  Do you want to see it? Have you played it, guys, at all? This is Flutter,  which means it's cross platform, works in any browser. I'm using it here in Firefox.  Let's select an Android and we will play a little pinball. I'm going to pull the ball back. There  we go. Oh, that was, oh, that was a mimic. This is pretty amazing for a...  Fireball!  Oh, fire's out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff Bezos It looks pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John Greenewald It's pretty amazing for, you know, a web-based technology.  Jeff Bezos Oh, that was so pathetic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh my God. This is so boring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John Greenewald Blame it on Flutter, not your shoes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jeff Bezos I like the carpeting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John Greenewald Oh, yeah. The carpeting matches the character.  Oh, I want to get that fireball again. Oh, oh, okay. That, oh, too bad.  All right. In the browser. That's cool. You saw how fast it loads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Can you go to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John Greenewald No, no. It's all just a... false advertising.  You can only play the one game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jeff Bezos UI problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John Greenewald Yeah. But that's a web development tool  that they did not mention. Maybe they mentioned it in the developer keynote.  All right. Let me take a little break. We have more to talk about. It's great to have Mike  Mazdick here. Let's find some stuff we can get Mike all head up about.  Jeff Bezos Oh, not going to be hard.  John Greenewald Something to get him angry about.  John Greenewald Yeah. Something that's pissing off Mike Mazdick coming up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jeff Bezos I just saw a whole new one. The EU is a whole structure about grooming and how you have  to filter all content for grooming. That's spreading too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John Greenewald Oh, yeah. Out of your messages.  So if you run a messaging platform, you've got to look for CSAM and grooming messages.  Jeff Bezos Yeah.  Jeff Bezos Oh, Lord.  Our show today brought to you by Codecademy. Now, being a developer is cool. And if you want to  change your career, there has never been a better time to become a programmer. With Codecademy,  you can do it on your own terms. Over 50 million people already know that Codecademy is the best  way to learn to code. Because Codecademy not only teaches you job-reading coding skills,  it helps you build unique projects for your portfolio. That really helps get that first job.  You'll earn certificates. You can post on your LinkedIn or your Facebook page so people know  you've got the skills. It'll even help you prep for technical interviews. Want to work for Google  or Apple or Facebook? This couldn't be a better time. Imagine a new career as a coder. Plus,  coding is fun. With Codecademy, you can learn at your own pace, get qualified for in-demand jobs  like full stack and engineer, front-end engineer, learn a little Dart and Flutter. You can write  your own pinball games. You can choose what to learn from building basic websites to artificial  intelligence and everything you could want. The Codecademy Python course is great. Actually,  all of their programming language courses are great because you'll start coding in seconds  right away. In your very first class, it's a hands-on learning environment and you immediately  start executing code. There is something when you're learning how to code. There is that magic  moment. That first time you get the program to do something, the computer is actually doing  something you told it to do that actually imprints you. I think it's the most important  first step that any beginner goes through. Wow, it's doing what I said to do. With Codecademy,  that could happen in your very first day. It's so much fun. You can learn languages like Python,  SQL, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. If you know JavaScript and HTML and CSS, the sky's the limit.  Everybody's looking for people who know that. If you're not sure where to begin,  Codecademy has a great quiz that will point you in the right direction. I took it. It said,  you should do our computer science track because you kind of... It's not a coding quiz. They ask  you what your interests are and what you're good at and stuff like that. They said, you kind of  have the mind that would like to think about how problems are solved. It's absolutely true. Lisa,  my wife took it. She's our CFO or CEO. It said, you should learn statistics and study R because  you definitely have a mind for numbers. Absolutely right. Take the quiz. You'll get tailored career  advice and course recommendations based on your strengths and your interests. As you're doing these  courses, you're going to get instant feedback. It's a totally interactive platform. You learn by  doing. I think that's really important. You'll be building your portfolio. You're going to get a  certificate of completion, which helps you market yourself to future employers. You can get a dream  job in web development or programming, computer science or data science, or a whole lot more.

So you didn't look at the rest  of the rundown is what you're saying. Yeah. Oh, there's more. Oh my God, there's page after page.  Whole lot more. Let's talk about this new EU. What is your sense, Mike, of the direction the EU is  taking? Is this a threat to big tech in the U.S.? I mean, some things like GDPR have been, I think,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  beneficial, yes? No. I don't think I would say that, actually. Really? In fact, I'll have an  article up, I think tomorrow. I have to put the finishing touches on it about how GDPR is now  actually being abused, often by Russian oligarchs, in order to silence reporters. Oh my God. They're  now claiming that if a reporter is collecting information on a Russian oligarch for the purpose  of reporting, that if they claim that the information is inaccurate, it's the same thing  as if Google had inaccurate information about you and therefore they can sue you. Oh my God. So  there have been a number of these cases. It's like libel tourism now becomes GDPR tourism. Wow.  It is worse than the libel tourism part. So I think there are some really, really serious  concerns with it. And I think the other thing too is, I think, and I would argue this is true of  most of the European regulations that have been put in place and that will be put in place,  is that unlike the US, that a lot of the politicians there are taking,  I'm going to choose my words carefully here, a more thoughtful approach. But the end result,  I think, is really, really problematic. And with the GDPR, I think we're seeing that very clearly.  That's the one that's now been in effect for a few years now, where it hasn't hurt Google or  Facebook. It's really helped them, but it's destroyed a lot of the smaller competition.  And there have been a few different research reports that have all come out within the last  few months. There was an NBER report that came out a few months ago that just got a bunch of  attention this week, even though it actually came out a few months ago, that showed that the number  of apps that were available dropped tremendously. They had a way of calculating innovation,  and they basically said innovation declined. And also that the main beneficiary of the GDPR was  Google. So basically, a bunch of other smaller companies had a lot of problems, and Google was  helped. There was another study that effectively said the same thing, but we're looking at sales  and profits, and basically said for everybody else, sales and profits went down. For Google  and Facebook, they went up. And so you can argue about... And I think to some extent,  the European approach, even as they talked about reining in big tech, they in some ways prefer that,  because if there's just Google and Facebook to regulate and deal with, that's easier than  having to regulate 100 or 1,000 different companies doing 100 or 1,000 different things.  And so they might prefer this sort of, oh, well, we just have to send in regulators to yell at  and fine, regularly fine, Google and Facebook rather than having to deal with the small  competitors. But from an innovation standpoint, as we just discussed, it kind of feels like  Google is reaching that stage of life where they're not so much the innovators coming out  with the next big thing. And if we're killing off all of the new startups, that might be more  innovative. I don't think that's very good. And so that's my big concern about... I don't think  they're as... The laws, I don't think are as fundamentally ridiculous as like Texas's social  media law or whatever. But I don't think that they've been successful. And I think they've  created a lot of problems. And I think that it'll take us a long time to sort of walk through and  realize just how much innovation they've actually really stifled. It's a little disappointing to me,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  because I do feel like what we don't want is big companies self-regulating, because they don't.  Sure. They're going to optimize for profit. That's their job. So it's up to government  regulators or in effect, the proxy for society to keep these guys in line. So I'm very disappointed  if this... I think well-intentioned and somewhat thoughtful effort has had such unfortunate,  dire, unintended consequences is a little disappointing. It's not all well-intended though.  Well, I think much of it is. Yeah, I think much of it is. Yeah. I think it's a mix of... You have

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  people who are certainly well-intended, but maybe not very well-informed. And then you have people  who are not so well-intended. And part of it is to me... But that's politics, right? That's all laws  if you really paid attention. Yeah. But there's a question of how much of these laws are really  driven out of trying to make the world a better place and to do the things that you talked about,  like not allow companies to be completely autonomous in terms of what they're doing,  and how much of it is driven by spite. And I think that a fair amount of the regulatory  focus is about spite. We don't like these companies. We don't like what they're doing.  Therefore, we must punish them. Well, that's because a lot of it is... A lot of it is prompted

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  by competitors lodging complaints against these big companies, right? That's what stimulates a lot  of these investigations and ultimately the laws. Well, what's the solution then? If we can't  expect a legislative solution and we can't expect companies to self-regulate,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  sounds like we're out of luck. Well, I don't think so, actually. I think there are a number of things  that we can do. And I'm halfway through writing a paper listing all of them out. So I'm not going  to go through my entire paper right now. But I think that the reality is having more competition,  having smaller competitors that can come up and say, you don't trust Google, you don't trust  Facebook, you don't trust these companies. Here are our alternatives and allow there to be real  competition that drives actual innovation. So instead of telling companies how to run their

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  business, instead prevent companies from using acquisitions to shut down competitors, prevent  companies from merging to form behemoths, encourage competition. Be transparent with your data,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  about your impact, allow researchers to be able to see that. I think that's the... Daphne Keller  and that they personally just testified before, I think it was the Senate, Mike, I think.  Yes. I think there's a movement toward transparency to research is the most sane next step that I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  too endorse. But it's actually tricky. And in fact, like the bills that are on tap right now,  that it was not technically testifying about those bills, but it really was because those are the  only bills that are being considered right now. I think also do have a lot of problematic language.  And this is what it gets to is like a lot of this stuff is really, really nuanced and really,  really specific. And poor language, even in well-meaning thoughtful bills can still be  really problematic. And that's what we have a lot of. And part of that is like, it is really  difficult to understand all of these different moving parts and how they play together. But also,  part of it is that these things all interact. And one of the biggest things, and I sort of got at  this in terms of what was happening with the GDPR, is if you're talking about speech, if you're  talking about privacy, if you're talking about transparency, and then you're also talking about  competition, those things are often not very well aligned. You can put all these rules onto  social media platforms, but again, the biggest companies are going to be able to handle that.  And therefore, you're decreasing competition as you're apparently putting in place all these  rules to deal with these things. And so, looking at all of that combined and figuring out how do  we do this in a way that actually does increase competition and increase innovation without  letting companies just run wild with all of our data. And it's a really difficult needle to thread  because those things work at cross purposes with each other, especially if you're not careful. And  I don't see anyone who's being really careful about it. It's possible the mistake GDPR made was just

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  being too sweeping. Maybe it would be better to do this a little more piecemeal, a little more  thoughtfully, also in a way that it could be refined, improved, or turned off if it doesn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  produce the results you expect. Well, that's always the issue with any law, right? I mean,  it's sort of the opposite of the way innovation works, right? Innovation is this process of  iteration. Try something, get it out there, see what happens, and be ready to continually iterate.  Laws are never like that, right? I mean, laws are like, we have this problem, here's the solution,  we're going to pass the bill and then we wipe our hands of it. And maybe 25 years later,  we'll look back and be like, boy, that was a disaster. Nobody wants to do that. I've argued  for a long time. I think it would be great if we had this sort of iterative approach to lawmaking.  But that also creates problems, right? Because companies and people are relying on the laws,  and if they're constantly changing, that's not great either. So, I don't know that there's a  perfect solution here. But I do think that there should be a little bit more humility in recognizing  that some of these laws have really serious impact, and we should be willing to look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Where's your paper going to be, Mike, when you finish it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not sure. I'm working on the paper. It's part of a grant that we got from Knight Foundation.  And so, it's almost done and we'll release it somehow, somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Can't wait to see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's very depressing. So then there's this new regulation, again, proposed. I think part of the  problem is the EU has such a Byzantine method of proposing, approving, and then enacting  legislation that it's kind of hard to follow it. It has to be, as I understand it, once it's proposed,  then it has to be approved to individual nations. Is that right?  They have to enact it.  Enact it individually. So, this is at the status of being proposed.  But it would require chat apps like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger to selectively scan users'  private messages for child sexual abuse material and grooming behavior. This is what we were  talking about earlier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  More panic. Get it ready, Ant. More panic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Privacy experts. Listen to what Matthew Green says, and we really trust  Matthew Green. This document is the most terrifying thing I've ever seen. It describes  the most sophisticated mass surveillance machinery ever deployed outside of China and the USSR.  Not an exaggeration.  Digital Advocacy Group.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But who can be for child pornography? So, anything can fit under that, then.  You have the worst of both worlds. Or you can say anything you want, except child pornography,  so we're going to watch everything you say so we can stop you from saying the things we don't want  you to say and go get you. It's, pardon me for my Gutenberg moment here, but every time there's a  new mechanism that allows more people to speak than were heard before, the old incumbent  institutions react against it, try to control, try to have panic and fear, partly out of their  self-interest, partly just out of moral panic, and eventually we figure it out. But in the meantime,  there's going to be a lot of destruction of a lot of the kind of good innovation Mike was just  talking about.  Sigh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sigh. The regulation established a number of new obligations for online service providers,  app stores, hosting companies, any provider of interpersonal communications.  Yeah, but again, this is a proposed law. These things seem to sneak in after the proposals.  Is there a comment period? Is there any way people can weigh in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, part of the issue with this is that there was some commenting beforehand in which a lot of  very smart people explained to the people pushing this bill that it was literally impossible to do  what they wanted and they just didn't care. It's similar in a lot of ways, though in this case,  worse. I said earlier that the European approach tended to be more thoughtful than the US approach.  In this case, I would say not so much, but this is very similar to the Earn It Act in the US,  but I think much, much worse in terms of how much of a wrecking ball it's taking to  encryption and private communications. This will go through quite a long process before it ever  gets anywhere, if it gets anywhere. I would imagine that it would improve, but it is starting from  such a bad starting point that I don't see how you could do anything of this nature and not have it  be absolutely terrible and extremely dangerous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, well. So what should we do? We're not even in their constituency. We just have to sit back

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and watch, I guess. Speaking up does help, right? So that more people are aware whether or not  our say matters directly to European politicians, perhaps not, though I have in the past testified  before the European Parliament, but getting people who are in the EU to speak up and say,  this would be a disaster and we cannot have this happen. And honestly, and this was true  of the Earn It Act in the US and others, where for all the talk of how this is necessary for the  children and you have all of the moral panic associated with that, the reality is that this  would make most children much less safe, right? If they cannot have secure communications, if they  cannot have secure places where they can feel comfortable talking without feeling like they're  being surveilled at every moment, that will do a lot more harm to most children than this bill  suggests they need to protect children. So I think people need to understand how much damage  this kind of thing actually does to children rather than protect them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Meanwhile, I'm looking at Stacey's article on Stacey on IoT. We'll ask her about it, of course,  when she comes back, I think in two weeks. We need laws and regulations on data use and privacy.  She's talking, of course, about the story that we saw that a company, SafeGraph, was selling  information about visits to Planned Parenthood. Vice bought a week's worth of information about  who had visited Planned Parenthood for 160 bucks. Of course, SafeGraph said, oh, that was a mistake.  We won't do that ever again. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They didn't say it was a mistake. They did say

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they wouldn't do it again, but then they actually defended it. In the process, it was really obnoxious.  If you find the blog post that SafeGraph put up, they basically said, but this is actually good.  This is useful data for researchers. Sure, anyone might abuse it, but this had really good  purposes, but because people are so mad about it, we're not going to do it again. Yeah, we won't do

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that. But there's plenty of other data brokers who I'm sure would be glad to pick up the slack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But the problem always is it's the use over the gathering. Having knowledge is one matter. How  you use it is the matter. The problem is it's now in the hands of noxious, authoritarian people who

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  want to use it against women. Yeah. She also cites the fact that the CDC spent nearly half a  million dollars buying location data on millions of Americans from another data broker to see if  people were following COVID curfews, tracking neighbor-to-neighbor visits, stuff like that.  Again, you could see the benefit, but it's also the fact that this information is available and  so easy to acquire is very disappointing. But again, calling for laws and regulations on data  use and privacy makes sense until you see what a mess has been made by the EU and the US in

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  attempting to regulate tech. Because it's too early. It's not just that. This is a lot more  complex than people make it out to be. And again, people get so focused on one aspect of it. And  we're going through that right now in California where we have this law, the CCPA. And there was  just a hearing about it. And my colleague, Kathy Gellis, who you've had on your show recently a  few times, she said to say hello. She just testified last week before the new California Privacy  Regulatory Board. I forget, there's an acronym for it. They're trying to figure out what to do.  And the point that she made was you can't look at privacy in a vacuum. You have to realize  that it impacts other things, including free speech. And the example I gave with the GDPR  and the Russian oligarchs silencing reporters by claiming that it's a privacy issue, that they're  collecting data for reporting purposes, that's a problem. And we're pretty concerned about some of  the plans that California has put forth that it would impact speech at the same time. And so how  do you balance those two competing interests? How do you balance this idea that, and I shouldn't  even say balance because you're not supposed to balance free speech. You're not supposed to  balance the First Amendment. But how do you look at those issues and say, how can we protect our  privacy but also not use a privacy law to silence speech at the same time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it problematic that the EU does not, in fact, we're the only country, one of the few countries  anyway, that has a First Amendment? You can't claim First Amendment protections in the EU.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They do have freedom of expression. The human rights law within the EU is supposed to protect  freedom of expression. It is a lot more limited.  Balancing other factors, though.  And it does have, there are balancing tests. The EU human rights approach involves balancing  different rights. And that leads to some bizarre things. There was also just recently,  speaking of bad European laws, a few years ago, the EU passed this copyright directive,  which among other things had what is now Article 17, which is for copyright filters.  And basically telling all of the countries in the EU that they need to pass laws requiring anyone  who is hosting copyright covered material, which is basically anyone, that they have to put in  place some sort of filtering tool to make sure that it's not uploading copyrighted stuff.  The law at the same time also said, but you have to make sure that it's not blocking stuff  that shouldn't be taken down. And so Poland went to the European Court of Justice to say,  this interferes with human rights. And so the Court of Justice came out with this ruling two  weeks ago that is completely useless. It basically says, instead of saying like, oh,  the copyright directive violates human rights, it says, as long as the filters do not take down  speech that shouldn't be taken down, then it's okay, which is useless, right? Because any filter  is going to misdiagnose things and is going to take down some speech that shouldn't be taken down.  And yet, so now everybody is struggling with this. All the different countries are trying  to implement it. Some of them don't care about legal speech. I mean, it seems like France in  particular was just like, ah, you know, we have to stop any kind of infringement if we happen to  take down memes and parody, whatever, like, we don't care about that. But other countries are  like, well, we're trying to balance these two interests. And the court is now saying like,  you have to get that right. If you get it wrong, and you're taking down protected speech,  you know, then it violates the human rights charter, whatever is the basis. And so  like, understanding that these these rights, you know, conflict, and how do you manage that  is really difficult. And it feels like nobody wants to sort of come in and look at that  holistically and sort of recognize how these different things intersect with each other.  Instead, they just push a very narrow focus. Like, I agree in general, like privacy is really  important. And we have this free for all right now. And I think that's bad. And I think that's  dangerous. But you know, I worry about every privacy law that everybody tries to pass because  I'm not sure it helps. You know, it's certainly not going to help if all we're doing is having  to click through a cookie banner to say like, Okay, I agree. Right. That doesn't solve anything.  So like, you know, it would be really nice if we could just take a step back and actually look at  all of this stuff holistically and say, what kind of world do we actually want? And why are we not  there? And how can we get there? But that doesn't seem like what anyone is doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Leo, I put it in the chat, I put a paper in that I quote, I have it in the book I'm writing. Yes,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  by James Doerr from 1998. The information age and the printing press. Right. So,  Moran Corporation. Yes. But this was 1998. And and what he argues is that countries that tried to

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  control the printing press were farther behind just in their general development than those that did  not. That it's early is my argument. And that also that it's going to be filled with unintended  consequences. So what he argues is the sooner you get to those unintended consequences, and then  start figuring them out, the better. So he says, this is Rand, but he says pull back from regulation,  so you can get to them and then you deal with their actual impact rather than how do you know  what the unintended consequences are until you try legislating? No, no, no, it's the unintended  consequences of the net. Oh, of the net. Don't legislate, let it go. Here's the problem with

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that. At some point, these companies get so big that it's impossible to do anything about them.  Isn't that the risk? And we may already be there.  Friendster is just a monster, don't you think? No, but let's talk about Facebook and Google. You think,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, honestly, Facebook's on the way down. Okay.  Twitter's about to be bought by a guy who's going to ruin it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay. Okay. So they're just going to burn out and we won't have to worry about them anymore.  Something else comes along. Something else. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, that is the history of the technology world, right? I mean, that's why I keep saying  the most important thing is clearing the way for new innovators and making sure that we can actually  have new entrants that will be innovative and that can build a better service so that people  are feeling more and more uncomfortable with these large numbering providers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But there is a network effect that makes it hard regardless of legislation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Regulation makes that worse in every case. That was Mike's point before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is regulatory capture. We've talked about this before. These companies want to pull up

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  the ladder after themselves. Even at first, they don't want the regulation,  but then when they realize it's inevitable, then they say, we can take it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we can take it. Well, that's what I'm saying. They've already gotten to that point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, you have Facebook advertising, please regulate us. But the other thing is more insidious  than this. And I heard what's his name, the founder, the planet here, CEO. And now you're  hearing Elon Musk say the same thing. Part of the shtick about if it's legal, we allow it,  is saying we'll make no judgments. We're not going to go to anything. You tell us what to do.  We're taking no responsibility for anything. Right. No responsibility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's insidious. You can't sue us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. And you can't blame us. Go make a law. It's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, that was what Mark Zuckerberg had said as well. When he was getting called to Congress  every two months, at one point he came out with a statement that was effectively like, you tell us.  Basically, I'm throwing up my hands. You don't want me to be the arbiter of truth? Fine. You  tell me what I need to leave up and what I need to take down, which of course has serious First  Amendment implications. Well, it's also disingenuous because he-  Sure. Oh, yeah, absolutely. But what else is he supposed to say at some point? Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what I would have said in his shoes. Exactly what I would have said. Fine. You tell  me. I don't know. I'll follow the law. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And if you don't like it, well, then pass the law. Don't blame me. Well, that's not the way to build

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a society of caring, decent people. Yeah. And that's why, again, sort of going back to  like Twitter and Elon, what I talked about before, the fact is like with the DSA in the EU,  Twitter has been a really active participant in talking to EU politicians and explaining why the  DSA is currently formatted would have tremendous speech suppression. And so like having actual  fundamental principles that you believe in, that then you go and you fight around the world for  laws that are causing trouble for it, that's what it means to be committed to free speech.  Saying, as Elon has said, that we're just going to take whatever the government tells us to do,  that's not being committed to free speech. That's getting pushed around by any government in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  world. And I think that's a real problem. It is true that we don't talk about Facebook anymore,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  do we? Yeah. It's like, who cares? It was destroying the world. Oh yeah. Remember them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they're happy about that. I was going to say, how happy do you think Mark Zuckerberg is about  all of the Musk Twitter stuff over the last few months? He just gets to sit back and laugh and  none of this is his problem anymore. You guys miss me? Yeah. Yeah. And I'm sure that recruiters at  Facebook are calling up every single person who works at Twitter right now. Oh yeah. The problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  is Facebook stock is no better than Twitter stock at this point, so maybe worse. And they still have

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  their own issues with the way they treat some of their staff, especially with the content moderators.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We should go public. Then we could offer them an upside. We could hire a hundred great engineers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know what we'd have them do, but I got some stock options for you. You're going to love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why are you still sitting on those useless Facebook options? They're useless.  You say, why are people still blaming Facebook for Australia's terrible news linking tax law?  This was Facebook and Google, right? That Rupert Murdoch wanted to take down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was Facebook that acted. Well, I can say it better than I can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. It was based on an article in the Wall Street Journal, which I didn't know it and I  should have. Of course, the Wall Street Journal is owned by Rupert Murdoch, who is at the center of  all of this. But this was last year. Australia had been working this law for a long time,  they admitted. Politicians in Australia literally admitted that Rupert Murdoch came to them with  this law and passed this law. It basically forces Google and Facebook and just Google and Facebook  to pay media properties, mostly Rupert Murdoch and Nine West.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Facebook just blocks news sharing in Australia?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Basically, just as the law was about to go into effect, both Google and Facebook had said that  they would block news sharing in Australia in response to this law going into effect.  Then just like on the eve of it going into effect, Facebook actually did start blocking it. Google  didn't. Google caved and said that they would just start paying. And people went crazy about it.  And then there was a slight change to the law in response to that and a week later,  Facebook reinstated it. And so this Wall Street Journal article...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Facebook, here's the headline, Facebook deliberately caused havoc in Australia to  influence new law whistleblowers say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so I read that article and I kept looking for where's this smoking gun from the whistleblower  about like causing havoc. And what you found in the articles, they talk about in a whole bunch  of early paragraphs about how they didn't just block news, they also blocked some government  and some nonprofit websites. And so like, okay, that's bad in theory, but I kept waiting.  The headline of the article and the subhead of the article implies that that was all done on purpose  by Facebook execs. And it takes until paragraph 55. It's a very long article. It's in paragraph  55 where they finally say... I counted twice because I counted 55 and I was like,  is that really 55? And I went back and I counted the second time. And it is literally the 55th  paragraph where they say Facebook executives realized... And like the reporters of the Wall  Street Journal had this, they realized that this was a mistake, that they had blocked too many sites  and they said, we have to fix this. That's in paragraph 55, after they spent all this time  talking about how Facebook deliberately tried to block stuff. And they bring in all these things  where you're like, as I'm reading, I'm like, this is exactly what... If you're in a position  where the law says, if you allow any links to news, you're going to have to pay,  then any lawyer in the world is going to say, you block everything that might be considered news.  Don't make a mistake. If you make one mistake, you're screwed and you're going to have to pay  up. So of course they're going to block everything. And so like, that's basically the smoking gun was  they had the legal team and the policy team told them, we need to be inclusive in who we block,  which is what the law tells them to do. If you don't want the law to apply to you,  which is what Facebook was saying, then you have to block everything. And then as soon as they  realized it was a mistake, basically people at Facebook tried to walk through and figure out  which sites they overblocked and to fix it, which is exactly what you should expect. And the problem  is the way the law is written, not the way Facebook acted. And so like the whole article was really,  really annoying. And it got a bunch of attention last week because everybody loves these stories  about Facebook being evil and Facebook might be evil, but in this case, it doesn't appear that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  they were. And when you, when you hear me talk about Murdoch and I include in that, the wall  street journal, there is an agenda to media's coverage of the internet. And I'm not saying  that this particular reporter got a call from Rupert saying this or that, but it was not hard  to sell this story with the organization. Yeah. No. And, and, and, uh, we never in media see the  acknowledgement of the conflict of interest of, Oh, we hate these guys. I think they stole all  our money and we want more money from them. And it's, it's a pincer movement in which media  have a conflict of interest that is never ever acknowledged. Yeah. Yeah. It's pretty funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a real problem. And I'm sure they figure if by paragraph 55, you've already made your

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  conclusions. You're not reading this. But it's in there. It's in there. Hey, we put it in there.  Was that actually the sponsor? I don't remember where there was Prince's spaghetti sauce,  everybody's too young to know that commercial anyway. Right. I thought that was prego.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there is a kind of, there is a prego too. So I don't know. I bet it is. Prego. It's prego.  It is prego, which is the worst bottled spaghetti sauce. If you eat prego, stop everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stop. It's in there. That's why it's bad. Prego was the spaghetti sauce you used in college when

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you had college out of the jar. Exactly. Well, sweet. Why heat it up? The spaghetti's hot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just put it on top. You were there too. You remember? I remember very, very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Respect. Speaking of pasta. Here is what Cacio e Pepe lady. What is she became famous for this?  All right. I'm gonna play a little tick tock video here. Everyone must try this

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Cacio e Pepe pasta sauce from Trader Joe's. That's why. What's wrong with that?  Cacio e Pepe. No, everybody loves the way she said it. I like it. It's Cacio e Pepe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cacio e Pepe. Apparently- That went viral. Apparently, now people are shouting at her  saying, say Cacio e Pepe. She said her exaggerated accent was just part of her Italian American  background. What are you talking here? Didn't mind the teasing, especially from actual Italians  who told her she's saying it incorrectly. Apparently, this is like, yeah, tick tock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's amazing. It's amazing. Wow. That went viral. You guys definitely thought I was like 17,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  didn't you? 26. I was born in 1995. You're the pig. Okay. Bye-bye. She's a little over the top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay. Unbelievable. You wouldn't be on an elevator with her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Content creators. Yeah. I'm 26. Okay. Thank you. Okay. I won't, the first tick tock from space.  You wanted me to play this as well? No, I didn't care. I just put it in there.  Great. Okay. I'm gonna skip that then. I thought you might be interested.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Kind of, you like space stuff here. You can listen to a black hole. That's down in the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's kind of interesting. Yeah. The sound a black hole makes,  except it's not really the sound of black hole makes. Because in space, no one can hear you  scream. So it's just what it might make if it were not in space, which of course, because it's a black  hole, it will be because it'll suck all the air in and then we'll be in space. Ohio Bill will ban  Facebook and Twitter from censoring users. So it's now Florida, Texas, and Ohio.  There are more. There are more.  Yeah. Oh yeah. Unbelievable. Why, how do you not, Mike,  you face this day in, day out, this drumbeat of bull crap. How do you not just despair and  throw up your hands and go, I give up? He is special.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am an eternal optimist. I still believe that people will come to their senses eventually.  I don't know why. All evidence is to the contrary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can pretty much guarantee you, no one's coming to their senses ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, it's a century from now they will, but that's the problem. We're all going to be gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you mean a century from now? What they'll wake up and say, this mess we made of everything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, the index of forbidden books lasted until 1996, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, yes, yes. 50 years after I'm dead, somebody will say, you know what?  Mike Masnick, he was right. You dream on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. All right. If you say so, you want to hear the sound of a black hole from the  New York Times. And part of an effort to sonify the cosmos, researchers have converted the  pressure waves from a black hole into an audio something.  This is the stupidest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So in other words, they couldn't hear it.  You couldn't hear it if you wanted to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you did this to annoy me, didn't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you annoy me, I annoy you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sound of the Perseus galaxy. And then they put like a radar thing on it.  So it looks like some, you know, it's scientific. So that's science.  You can't deny it. It's science, man.

You know, we use them as the whipping horse, the stalking horse for  sites nobody talks about anymore. Whatever happened. Ha ha ha.  Well, they just did a C round and have now worth $4 billion.  That's what happened. Ha ha ha.  Another round of financing from Andreessen Horowitz.  Participation in DST Global Tiger Global and Elad Giel.  They raised quite a bit. What did they get?  What did they get?  I don't know what they got.  This is annoying because all they say in TechCrunch is their valuation is $4 billion,  but they didn't say how much money they actually got out of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't hear as much chatter about Clubhouse, but there are a couple photographers that I  talk to fairly regularly and they still do their little events.  Really?  Do people show up?  Yeah, apparently they keep doing them.  Yeah.  I uninstalled the app. I don't want to participate in it, but some of the photographers that I  talk to, they still go in every week hosting whatever they're hosting or they participated  in one that's hosted by somebody else. It's just a community-based kind of thing.  It may not be the talk of the town like this Cacio and Pepe TikTok, but apparently they're still  being used.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, everyone I know who used Clubhouse has now switched over to Twitter Spaces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Equally worthless, but okay, fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By the way, so Jack, speaking of which, where was it?  Yeah, I have it. Is this Jack's Twitter?  Jack was trying to be on Spaces. Look what happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here he is. Can't seem to load or join the space I'm most a host now. It's blank.  I think if Jack can't figure out how to do it, by the way, maybe part of the problem is  it's got the old name of his company Square.  Well, that's still the brand.  Oh, it's still Square. It's not Block.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But the brand, I saw it commercial.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So is he the Square head or the Block head?  Well, he's a boss.  Ask Lucy.  He's both. We'll try to do it another time then he says.  Somebody says, that's what you get for killing fleets.  To which he replies, karma's a bee.  Wow. That's a hot thread.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you use Be Real?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I saw that and I was so tempted to download it and then I forgot.  So no, it's a new social app. It's boring according to the New York Times.  And the New York Times is on it, by the way.  It's boring in a good way.  Once a day at an unpredictable time, Be Real notifies its users.  They have two minutes to post a pair of pictures.  The pictures are from both cameras.  So the front and the back.  So if you're in a messed up room or whatever, that's what they're going to get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, somebody talked about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You should do this, Ant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's gotten some attention lately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's French. They're based in Paris.  So I guess it's pronounced Cachoy.  Be Real.  Be Real.  Founded in 2020. It's been around for two years.  By April of this year, 7.4 million installs according to Aptopia.  I think I remember seeing this when it came out.  Raised about 30 million in venture funding last year.  You know why?  Because Bitcoin's been down.  So they had to find somewhere else to put their money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm seeing some stories right now wondering whether Coinbase is going to go bankrupt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they're not.  But they had to put in their filing because it's a requirement of the SEC.  What would happen if they went bankrupt?  So Coinbase is an exchange, a Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency exchange,  where a lot of people store, and this would be the mistake you'd be making,  store their crypto there using a custodial wallet.  You should have a wallet you own because...  Like you could forget, like yours?  Yeah.  Yeah. Well, at least I have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Have is a relative verb there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All you have to do is sit down and remember the password.  And by the way, it'll come back to me.  It's not a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now that the value is way down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Honestly, yeah, it's down to $28,000.  It's lost more than half of its value over the last six months or something.  Yeah. But that's fine.  That's why I have met Bitcoin.  If I had remembered the password, I wouldn't have any.  I would have sold it when it was five bucks and said, hey, I'm rich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got 80 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But instead I have it.  Now, that's all that matters.  And I'm going to have it for a long time.  But if you gave...  So point being, if you use a custodial wallet anywhere,  that's problem number one.  Custodial wallets have been stolen in the past.  If you had a custodial wallet with Mac cox, buy Bitcoin.  But problem number two in their SEC filing, Coinbase pointed out,  if we were to go bankrupt, you would then be one of our creditors.  And probably at a pretty low on the list.  So in other words, if they go bankrupt, good luck getting your Bitcoin out of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the thing is, if they were to go bankrupt,  because Bitcoin is worth so little, you wouldn't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'd be fine with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ethereum, Mike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ethereum is the future.  They say, we're not going to go bankrupt.  That's not that we're required to state what would happen,  which is probably a good thing to know.  Moral of that story is don't put all your coins in any custodial wallet.  If you want to sell coins, transfer them over, sell them, get the money.  Or you want to buy other stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's a wallet that a mortal human being can actually do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's lots of Bitcoin wallets you hold on your computer or on your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Metamask is a popular one.  Metamask is a pain in the butt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I use basically the reference design from the Bitcoin Foundation,  their original Bitcoin wallet.  It's perfectly good.  John says Electrum.  But anyway, if you hold your own wallet, then you don't have to worry.  If you let somebody else hold your wallet and they lose it, you're out of luck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and there are the hardware wallets now as well.  That's right.  That's right.  Yeah.  There's plenty of ways to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People who are serious start to get into it.  All a wallet is is a number, by the way.  With a random phrase.  Your long account number, which I, you know, anyway, I protected with a random phrase.  I mistake.  I mistake.  You want to buy the house where Facebook was created?  This is the beautiful San Jose Mansion.  For the first time since its construction nearly 25 years ago, it is for sale.  What?  It's in Mountain View.  Where is it?  Silicon Valley somewhere.  Los Altos.  Never been up for only ever been up for rent since 2004.  Six bedrooms, four and a half baths.  Students love it.  19 year old Mark Zuckerberg and Dustin Moskovitz rented it along with 24 year old Sean Parker.  That's where they were when they created it.  Well, the Facebook took off, I guess they created it at Harvard.  Now, how much would you pay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What was the square footage again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it's big.  It's like six bedrooms or something.  Oh, six bedrooms.  Yeah, six bedrooms, four and a half baths.  I don't see the square footage.  Asking price, $5.3 million.  Oh, I was going to say seven.  No, here is from the landlady, the first deposit check written by Mark Zuckerberg  for the lease of the house.  Their rent was $5,500 a month, so he gave him, he gave her two months rent.  Nice handwriting, Mark.  But she's got the autograph.  I noticed she still has the check.  That's good.  Look at that.  There's a beautiful sunroom at Casa de Facebook.  It's actually a pretty big house for Los Altos and that's an expensive area.  3,000 square feet.  You'd get the whole crew in there, Aunt.  Yeah.  Yeah, be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You could put the pods in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wouldn't have much anything else in there, but we'd be in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, maybe they'd leave the sign that says cat, you know, or is that eat?  Might be eat.  I don't know.  I can't tell.  Welcome to pound town.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somehow I don't think there was a lot of that going on, to be honest with you.  Look at that.  Beautiful, beautiful home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's the shower where Mark Zuckerberg bathed and first discovered shower shoes.  That's good.  There's a gazebo out back.  That's fancy.  Fancy house.  Los Altos is a very nice area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In the movie there was a swimming pool.  Doesn't look like there's actually one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah, you're right.  So much for the movie.  See, I told you that movie was full of it.  Meta has its own retail store.  I might have to make, we're going to have to do a field trip, Aunt, you and me.  The Meta retail store just opened in Burlingame, California.  What would you buy if you went to the Meta retail store?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We can take much better field trips.  You know that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What would they have?  There it is.  That's what they have.  They have some portals.  They have the quest.  And you can go in there and play Supernatural on the quest while people stare at you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  People love the portal though, right?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Portals, yeah.  I mean, if you don't mind Facebook.  Grandparents.  Yeah, the grandparents like it.  I bought the original portal and really never found any use for it.  So I let Burke take it apart, which means it's no longer functioning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's gone.  It's gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anything else?  I will let you, Aunt, and Mike Masnick, our great guest, and Jeff Jarvis, tell me,  is there anything else that you want to talk about from this long list?  I'm not going to do the changelog.  We did the changelog.  Oh, that's fine.  We saw it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think Facebook is now, Facebook is saying they're going to not give  as much money to news publishers because screw it, we don't need them.  Oh, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does that affect you?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What was the story I saw something about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go ahead, Aunt, and then Mike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm trying to find it.  I remember seeing a headline about TikTok taking over surpassing YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that was up there.  It is.  It is.  But that's, yeah, according to eMarketer, here's the graph.  TikTok users will spend more time this year on TikTok than YouTubers will spend on YouTube.  Which is the rabbit hole?  The black is TikTok net ad revenues, which are now predicted to be $11 billion in 2024.  Currently, well, expect to be $5.96.  It's a little bit less than podcasts.  No, not at all.  What's the red?  Percent change, percent of digital ad spending.  They got like 3.5% of total digital ad spend.  Digital ad spend is on the up and up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  People spend a lot of time on TikTok because it's 60 seconds or less.  Yeah, it's quick.  YouTubers, the prominent YouTubers are doing their videos most of the time at 10 minutes a clip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mike, what was your pick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was going to point out the Josh Hawley copyright bill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  Mr. Hawley has decided that if Disney is going to be woke,  and you know that's the worst insult Josh Hawley can give anybody,  then they don't deserve this long copyright.  So this is a, you call it a laughably stupid copyright term reduction bill.  Where's Sonny Bono when we need him?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  So this is the thing where it's like, I've probably spent two and a half decades  fighting against long copyright, and nobody has ever introduced a bill to shorten copyright until now.  And it has to be done by Josh Hawley for the worst, most ridiculous reasons,  in the most impossible way.  It is very much a monkey paw kind of situation where,  you know, I probably would have supported almost anyone coming up with a law that would reduce  copyright back to 56 years, which is what he's doing.  But he has done it in a way that is so clearly and ridiculously unconstitutional,  would never stand up to any kind of scrutiny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But he probably knows that, right?  He's actually, all evidence to the contrary, a very smart, well-educated guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's an extremely well-educated guy and literally calls himself a constitutional scholar.  He clerked for the Supreme Court.  He knows that this is not how any of this works.  And it's clear that the bill, he has no intention of the bill actually passing.  He just needs to sort of play his band bass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's plucking the strings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's so frustrating that I had to spend all this time sort of explaining  why this bill that conceptually, I would love to see a bill that actually does this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, for years, you and I and everybody else have been bemoaning  the copy because every time Mickey Mouse's copyright comes up for expiration,  and for years it was Sonny Bono who would do this, they would extend the term of copyright  to protect Disney's assets, including most importantly, Mickey Mouse.  And that would just happen like clockwork every 18 years or something.  What is the current copyright term?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's not so easy to say.  But what I will say is that Mickey Mouse will, the original Mickey Mouse,  which is the Steamboat Willie version of Mickey Mouse, will go into the public domain January 1st, 2024.  We are less than two years away from this news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Unless Sonny Bono comes back from the dead and extends it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It appears to be very little appetite.  Oh, good.  You know, the one thing I am thankful for is that nobody seems to be,  even Disney seems to have given up on the idea of continuing to extend copyright.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They got Star Wars and Marvel.  They don't need Mickey Mouse anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're in good shape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But wait until the Luke Skywalker copyright starts to come up for due.  There is a lot of time for that.  So the original term was 14 years with 14 years renewable.  In 1831, it went to 2828.  It's like, what is it, 56?  Does it vary on the kind of work?  Is that the problem with saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, the issue right now is that older works are sort of under different rules than the newer works.  Because we had the 1976 Copyright Act, which went into effect in 1978, and sort of changed the rules.  And then there's like a whole bunch of issues with kind of different types of works.  But effectively right now, we're at, what is it, life plus 70.  That's what current copyrights are.  That's absurd.  That's absurd.  Yes it is.  And what's more absurd honestly than the term is the fact that it used to be, again until 1978,  that in order to get copyright, you had to register it.  And so most people didn't register their works at all.  And so those works were not covered by copyright.  And then in 1976 act, we changed it so that everything is effectively automatically given a  copyright.  So we went from an opt-in system to not even an opt-out because you actually cannot opt out.  The works get copyright.  You can issue a waiver or a Creative Commons license, which is effectively a waiver of your  copyright rights.  And that is bizarre.  And we went from a time where right before that, it was 56 years.  It was 28 and 28 and you had to renew.  And I think I put in the article that if you look at, most people didn't review.  Almost nobody reviewed.  The only people who did review were the motion picture industry, which is like the main industry  that Hawley targets.  The retroactive nature of Hawley's bill only applies to companies in the motion picture  industry and only if their market cap is above $150 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And they have a Florida amusement park.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it basically, I think it only, I was trying to figure out who had impacted and I think it  only impacts Disney and possibly NBC Universal.  And that's it.  So it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  God, I'm kind of rooting for this law, but as you say, it is blatantly unconstitutional  because, and here's your term of the week, kids, you cannot pass a law that's targeting  a specific individual.  That is called a bill of attainder.  Is that right?  Yeah.  A bill of attainder is your term of the week for this week.  It's actually a violation of the constitution.  Article one, section nine, clause three.  No bill of attainder or ex post facto law shall be passed.  It's kind of ex post facto too, right?  It's kind of got two strikes against it.  Yes.  Well, it's retroactive.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The retroactive, ex post facto is a little bit different than retroactive.  The ex post facto is basically saying something that you,  that was lawful when you did it becomes unlawful and then they can go back.  So there is a retroactive aspect to it, but I don't know if removing copyright would...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Copyright isn't breaking the law.  There's no law that broke it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The issue...  Well, I mean, that gets tricky too.  I mean, there is the takings issue also, which is that the fifth amendment prevents takings.  And people have long argued that if you were to take away a copyright,  You'd be taking it.  Then you're taking private property and therefore the government would have to  compensate you for that.  There are actually arguments against that,  but that's getting really deep in the weeds that we don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Josh Hawley doesn't care.  He knows no one is going to vote for it.  All it takes is a call from NBC Universal and they're going to go, well, screw that.  And he just, but he got the press release and he got the article.  What he really wanted the article in TechDirt.  That's what he really wanted.  And he got it.  Congratulations, Josh Hawley.  You got Mike Masnick to write about you.  Well done.  Jeff, did you have any last...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, I do.  Yes, I do.  Because last week, thanks to Glenn Fleischman and me,  you got some magnificent collectible art right there on the table.  And I want to follow up this week with another fine opportunity for more art.  If you go to my pick, which is line 192, I just saw this because I go to Twitter,  what I'm not supposed to, and I found the Taco Bell still life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's so beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A Taco Bell still life.  You can get a signed copy of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  For a mere $60.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's not bad.  What it gets to me is, how would you call this Taco Bell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there's a Crunchwrap, there's some nacho cheese sauce,  there's the crispy things and look at this, a fine green drink.  It's a drink of some sort.  Who's the same as that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It also has McDonald's if you prefer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Del Taco of yore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, that's the double Taco Bell.  I think only Taco Bell has that.  How do we know it's Taco Bell?  The logo on the drink cap is definitely Taco Bell.  That's Taco Bell.  I know it's Taco Bell all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know him.  He recognizes it.  He spent a lot of time there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Big Mac is quite a piece of art as well.  You might prefer that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does Noah Varier also do that?  Holy cow.  Oh yes, go to the sign for this.  He is one of the great artists of our time.  Go to the sign for this and there's Chipotle.  Oh, I would buy that.  Except every time I saw it, I'd want a Big Mac.  There's Chipotle.  So this guy, by the way, I just want you to know,  he does have an MFA.  It says so on his website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And he also does NFTs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's an MFA of NFTs.  Oh, get an MFT from it.  There's mac and cheese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The mac and cheese is not so crazy about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Broken egg.  I like his art actually.  McDonald's and Trader Joe's Barque Pouquet in oil.  12 by 9.  These are nice big prints.  Yeah, these are beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Those are the oil, which you can't get anywhere.  They're all sold.  But if you go to the sign prints on the left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you get a G-clay print of it.  We should get a Funfetti cupcake for Ms. Higginbotham.  The queen of Funfetti.  Wow, popcorn and M&Ms.  Onion.  I like this guy.  You know what?  I would buy this.  And this shows what an idiot I am.  I would invest in this fine art.  I would.  Yeah, if I get the oil, I would too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  The dram of whiskey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dram of whiskey?  A whiskey?  Well, you like it.  No, that's not it.  Where is it?  I'm going down.  It's there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you go to the...  Oh!

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, there's another one.  There's a couple on there.  Oh!

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Go to sign prints.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Guy likes his black as brown liquor, right?  Oh my goodness.  There he goes.  There he goes.  There.  That's the one.  Oh, that is the Ant Pruitt.  Sold.  Yep.  This guy sells a lot of his work actually.  Yeah, he also has NFTs too.  I would create my own, I guess.  I would want an NFT of this.  I don't know.  I guess if you like a guy, give him some money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So if the floor price of an NFT...  Let's see here.  The gummy bears.  Let me see.  No, that's lost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  NFT open C.  There's jelly beans.  Let's see.  Still life paintings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What does that mean?  Actual human...  3.33 ETH.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know what that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So that's worth about 25 cents now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's worth more than that.  Oh, I like the gummy bears.  That...  Yeah, the bids are low on this.  This is a really good opportunity here to get yourself a nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Something you can't frame.  I own that, you know.  I own that cinnamon roll right there.  Somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can add it to your wallet and then lose the password.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Perfect.  I wonder if not knowing the password,  I could add things to the wallet and just they'd be really safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because they don't exist anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it'd be really safe in there.  It's a good idea.  That grilled cheese looks good enough to eat,  but you can't because it's an NFT.  I'm going to take a break and then we are going to wrap things up with picks of the week.  Oh, I thought those were the picks of the week.  Oh, sorry.  All right.  I have not.  I have not wrapped things up.  Oh, I see.  That's right.  Okay.

Anything you're up these days excited about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I was actually debating because I have a few things.  But I'll go with one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could do all of them.  I'm fine.  We're not in a hurry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, well, I'll see.  But I have something that I have unfortunately,  probably from my wallet,  gone deep into the world of mechanical keyboards recently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah, baby.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I was asking people on Twitter for some thoughts and advice  and in particular on the difficulty of learning to use an ortho-linear keyboard,  which is where instead of staggered like a regular keyboard,  all the keys are straight up and down.  And amazingly and wonderfully,  someone on Twitter said that they had one that they had never learned to use  and said that they would send it to me free of charge.  And so I got it.  And about a week ago, I started learning, and I'll hold it up here,  how to use this HES keyboard.  And it is the most amazing thing.  I love this thing.  I can't make it ortho-linear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not the swoopy-doopy thing.  That's ergonomic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The fact is that the keys are like one on top of each other directly.  If you look at your keyboard, they're slightly staggered.  They're staggered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they're diagonals.  So they're straight up and down.  It's like a grid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  And so they say that's actually better for your fingers and it is more ergonomic.  But there is a learning curve.  And it was actually much quicker than I expected.  I heard people said it took them like two months of regular usage to get back up to  their former typing speed.  And for me, it was three days of 30 minutes a day that I just sat there.  Wow.  I was doing typing tests for 30 minutes and literally,  I had a lot of trouble with the letter C and the letter B.  And then I was always getting the keys next to it.  And then somewhere on that third day...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's so weird because it's just slightly off, right?  Yes.  So you'd probably learn the Dvorak layout faster than you would learn Ortho Linear  because it's close but no cigar.  Is that it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  But once you get it, it clicked.  And I tried yesterday then to go back to my old regular staggered keyboard.  And at first, I was then pressing the wrong buttons on that one.  This one is particularly weird because it's also a tiny keyboard.  So there's no number row and you have to learn to use layers.  And the shift key is down on the bottom instead of over on the side.  Are you a touch typist?  I am.  And so I'm almost there.  I'm almost as good with it.  And it feels so much nicer to use.  Like it's hard to explain the difference.  That's interesting.  But I am now kind of obsessed with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  So there is a website, olkb.com, where they sell Ortho Linear keyboards from Plank.  There are a bunch.  Yeah, there are many.  Who makes that one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This one is Keyboardio.  Keyboardio.  Search up Keyboardio.  Keyboard with an I-O at the end.  Keyboardio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A keyboard for serious.  Wait a minute.  I want the wooden one.  Look at that walnut enclosure.  I have that fancy wooden one.  That's pretty.  So that's the one you got, the Atrius.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Atrius is the one that I got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So maybe I'll try it.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is a learning curve.  If you want me to walk you through the learning curve, I've done the research.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you have tips for people who are learning this?  I mean, there's so much.  Is there a Mavis Beacon for Ortho Linear keyboards?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, different people have different recommendations, honestly.  But if you open up my YouTube right now, it's like all mechanical keyboard videos.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have gone down some rabbit hole of doom there.  That's amazing.  Very deep.  Yeah.  How interesting.  I had never heard of these and I like keyboards.  I'm very interested in keyboards.  That's the one you got because some guy gave it to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Someone sent it to me.  But the one I'm really looking at is one called the Moonlander.  So if you do a search on Moonlander keyboard, you'll see this is like the ultimate.  This is like people, lots of people, this is like their dream keyboard.  But it is an Ortho Linear keyboard.  It's also a split keyboard.  It's also a bunch of other things.  But that's like the ultimate keyboard.  What the what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We almost needed one tweak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What the what?  That I didn't buy something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I almost made it through and you didn't buy something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Came close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I thought a Taco Bell print there.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But now I'm thinking I want whatever the hell this is.  This looks like it's alive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dude, look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, but for those of us who spend a lot of time typing,  my problem is if I did that, then a laptop would be impossible, right?  I mean, because then you're going back and forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this was my concern.  This is why I raised it on Twitter was how difficult is it to go back and forth?  Because if I learn this, am I going to forget?  And so people told me no.  It depends on who you talk to.  Some people say it does become difficult to go back and forth.  And that's why I've been going back and forth each day  just to see if I can keep it.  And then the thing is honestly, with the Atrius, the tiny one that I have,  it's so small, I kind of feel like I could still just bring it with my laptop if I go anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What kind of switches on the Atrius?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So let's get into switches now, my friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  These aren't horribly expensive.  I mean, 365 bucks.  Right.  You know, I actually bought a old IBM Omnikey Northstar, you know, buckling keyboard,  keyboard, because I remember that nice feeling.  And that was about that expensive.  It was a refurbished model.  So that's not out of the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not crazy.  You can spend a lot more on keyboard.  Do you like clicky or not?  I am not a fan of clicky, but people who love clicky love clicky.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What made you want to explore this month?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what started is I sort of have spent a lot of time trying to optimize my travel situation  and my ability to work from anywhere and like with a portable screen and different stands  and all sorts of stuff.  And the one thing that I sort of felt held back by was the keyboard.  So I have a travel ergonomic keyboard that is not a mechanical, that is not an ortho linear.  And so I was looking for something better and to see if there was something better  than the one that I had before.  And that just sent me down this path, this dangerous, dangerous path.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it's such a dangerous path.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He said travel and I thought he meant key travel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry, sorry.  That is a whole debate as well.  Oh, I know.  Once you start going deep on like the different kinds of switches and how much  force and where the activation is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I have now watched like 20 minute videos that are just people pressing different key switches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So have you started to get sleep again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So are you saving up for a one-liner?  I actually have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where is it?  Here.  I have a, yeah, I have actually, but I have a...  Oh yeah.  Cherry will send you those.  Yeah, yeah, we have one of those.  Yeah, yeah.  So you can test all the different switches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So did you go with the cherries or those people are now saying, oh no, cherry, that's no good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no.  So the ones on this keyboard are the kale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kale, everybody's saying kale is the thing to do now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The kale ones are pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kale.  What kind of kales?  Just out of curiosity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  These are box browns.  So it's a tactile, the box is protected so that I could spill food and not have to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nice.  And then when you go to your laptop, you don't feel a disadvantage?  You don't get weird?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, again, I just got this a week ago, so I haven't really done that much with it.  But again, it's so small.  I really feel like I could just pack it with the laptop and just hook it up.  Yeah, use it everywhere.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Interesting.  Okay.  Okay.  You know what that means?  Jeff Jarvis's number is next.  Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I was going to do something.  I was going to tell you that El Salvador is going to go bankrupt because of Bitcoin, but instead...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, yeah, they made their currency the Bitcoin.  And now they're expected to default because it's dropped so far in price.  That's terrible.  Terrible news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I just put up a story.  I think this is the case.  I think it might be from Glenn Fleischman on Twitter.  I just put it in the chat.  I think this guy's writing a book about keyboard history.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How to Geek.  The Korty Keyboard is Tech's Biggest Unsolved Mystery by Ben J. Edwards.  Or Benj.  Interesting.  Yeah.  Once you start becoming a keyboard geek, it really is a bottomless pit of despair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm scared.  I'm through the looking glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you're through the looking glass now, buddy boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis's lobby at his school, the wonderful townite center for  entrepreneurial journalism at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism  at the City University of New York has a collection of typewriters under glass.  Quite amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Quite beautiful.  My favorite is named the Bing.  That's where Microsoft runs its entire search engine out of there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I see you have a machine that goes, Bing.  So well, okay, so that's one.  But what else?  I said I'm done.  I'm done.  You're done?  I got it.  Okay.  We did the Taco Bell's Tish Life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I did Taco Bell.  I did El Salvador and I did the keyboard history guy.  Perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Perfect.  And Pruitt, pick of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For me is Don't Give Up.  Saw this story yesterday or day before and is track and field related.  But I love it.  Little kids running track and there was an unfortunate event.  If you click on it, there's a video.  It was an unfortunate event, but the finish was outstanding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So she starts the race, loses her shoe at the starting line, runs back,  puts it on, then runs as fast as she can run.  Her little legs pumping, going fast, fast, fast, and ends up winning the race.  Yeah.  That's kind of like the Kentucky Derby.  That's the Kentucky Derby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  Here she comes.  Come on, girl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it's funny to hear her parents and her family in the background just sort of rooting  her on and they were like, wait a minute, she's going to win this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's hysterical.  Geez.  That's never ever give up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it wasn't even close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, go girl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is really, really cute.  That is such a great story.  That was great.  Yeah.  Don't give up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I want to say congratulations to the squad and family, the hardheads.  They won their four by 100 meter relay last week.  What the hell aspect ratio is this?  What are you using?  That was from someone's phone.  Oh, some weird phone.  Yeah.  It looks like a Polaroid.  Okay.  But they won last week.  They had a decent time.  This is a relay race.  Nice.  Yep.  They got the championship for that and qualified for the next meet.  Nice.  And then hardhead.  This is hardhead at Dank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right here with the headband there.  Yeah.  Oh, look at him go.  He's fast.  He just opened that whole thing up and he's just not even close.  He could have lost his shoe.  Yeah.  He still would have won.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He and Lil Weirdo, that was the NBL league championships last week.  And Lil Weirdo, she qualified for the high hurdles.  She got 10th place and qualified for the next meet.  But she just learned how to do it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You just taught her how to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yep.  And she's in for a tough one for sure.  But I'm just so happy for her and proud of her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So she's inspired by the boys?  Is she like, oh, if they can do it, I can do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She's her own.  Trust me.  She's her own.  Did she run track before she moved out of here?  She's like, if I want to do something, I'm going to do it.  Nice.  No, she just said, I'll try it out because it looks interesting.  That was pretty much it.  Wow.  And then shout out to the hardhead because he's now back to back league champion in the  100 meter dash and got a nice feature in the local newspaper and took some great pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is a beautiful picture.  That's great.  Eric Castro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love that picture.  Mr. Eric Castro shot that.  Nice shot.  He's a local photographer.  What an NFT of that.  If you look at, there's one on there, I think a slide number five or number six.  You guys might find it interesting or maybe our listeners will.  No, that one.  Now, if you read the caption or describe it and read the caption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All year I've been worrying about personal records.  So I had to write this on my hands at Jacob Pruitt 16 or Rancho Katadi sophomore.  After winning the boys 100 meter race, it says have fun.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He wrote that in the palm of his hand.  And I said on Twitter, I can't take credit for that because...  That's not what you ever said in your whole life.  Well, I mean, but like two days before that, I had to jump down his throat  about his performance and track and his effort and stuff because he was playing what I call  mind checkers.  He was having too much fun.  And I was like, dude, you're better than this and I know you're better than this.  And I expect you to continue to be better than this.  So I had to do the proverbial foot in the ass is what I said.  And he bounced back.  And when I took a kick butt...  You're tough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're on those boys.  You're tough.  And it's demanding for.  Yeah, that's nice.  Well, I guess he did have fun breaking the record.  That's great.  Well, thank you, everybody.  Thank you so much, Mike Maznik, techdirt.com.  Mike has a great podcast there to make sure you listen to that.  Indeed.  He is, you know...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and not only that, do what I do and belong to Tech Dirt.  Support Mike.  Support him.  He got rid of all his tracking.  He got rid of all the ad stuff.  Support Tech Dirt.  It is the most important voice out there for digital sanity.  Boy, I couldn't agree more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Also send him some Ambien too so he can sleep at night and stop looking at keyboards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's those loud keyboard clicks keeping him up all night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's very soothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A form of meditation.  I think my wife would throw me out if I didn't get help, sir.
