Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hello. Good to see you.  A cute sweater.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's Sweater Day on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is Sweater Day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Gina, also former founding editor of Lifehacker and just an all around great person to have a developer.  So we get the developer's perspective on that.  Speaking of developers, Aaron Newcomb is joining us.  Yes, thanks for having me.  He's a Linux geek, works at Oracle.  Are you a developer at Oracle or a project product manager?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, product manager.  But I do development on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what happens when you don't develop for a while.  You make your product manager.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry, I didn't get the memo. I didn't wear my sweater.  I wore my planel shirt.  What's your T-shirt?  T-shirt is an Android.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's that Android that you see on the phone when you're getting updated, but it's taken apart so you can explode it.  That's right.  See all the parts, all the pieces, all the guts.  Speaking of guts, here's the man who spills his guts on the Internet, Jeff Jarvis.  That I do.  Author of Public Parts and professor of journalism at the City University of New York, blogger at buzzmachine.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And if you all hadn't watched the pre-show, you should really watch live because more information than you ever wanted to have about everyone's grooming habits.  Grooming, earwax, everything.  Ear hair.  We went there.  We're living in public here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The reason we got into earwax is because we're in ear monitors like Bono does.  I'm wearing ultimate ears, but they've kind of fallen apart over the years because I use them so heavily.  On the shows, you know, it's funny because when I'm in, I don't know why, but it's just that it's the aesthetic of it.  When I'm in my office doing the radio show, I wear these big headphones.  I look like a radio guy.  But when for some reason when we come out here, I go to the in-ear monitor, I could wear wear either in both situations.  But I just for some reason, this is more like TV, so I don't want to have big headphones on.  So I wear the Bono in-ear monitors.  But so the guy who started ultimate ears sold it to Logitech.  So they own it now.  That made me a little nervous.  And he started a new one called J.H. Audio.  So I ordered a pair.  But you know, the problem with all of these is they're fit to your ears.  So you have to go get to an audiologist and they make molds of your ears.  Then you send them to the company and then they make headphones and all of that.  And it's very expensive.  Hey, Leo, that'll probably get rid of the wax.  Well, that's what happened.  I went to the audiologist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He said, oh, no, I'm not going in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The back story was even more interesting than the wax.  I had no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm not going.  Well, and here's the side thing on that.  23andMe, which is, Ann, how do you pronounce the last name?  Jiki?  Jiki.  Larry Page's wife's, Ann, who used to work at Google, now has a company called 23andMe,  which you send them a cheek swab.  And then they give you a genetic analysis.  You actually send them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I happen to have one because I'm.  Are you going to do it?  I've done it, but I'm doing it augmented.  They wanted more.  So you get this little kit where you.  More saliva?  Spit and spit.  That's right. You spit.  That's right.  Spit. Do you think you can spit no more?  And then you send this off for this little box.  It's only a hundred bucks now, which is nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's something.  So I didn't really learn.  I thought I'd learn more.  I mean, I didn't really learn much.  I learned I'm from Europe.  Yeah.  And as a European male, you have an elevated risk of but as of a heart attack of diabetes,  you know, all this.  But it's because you're a European male, not anything in particular about you.  Your disease risk is all based on your ethnic roots, apparently.  But I did learn there is there a few traits that they can tell you.  And one is I have wet earwax.  I do, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You see, you see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that important?  I didn't know.  Yeah. Like, what's important?  What does it even mean?  Brown eyes and wet earwax.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So my risk of prostate cancer is forty three point four percent compared to the average  seventeen point eight.  But that's just because I'm a man.  Yeah.  So so you're going to do another one that tells you more about yourself?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It there was a certain thing that it said in the results that you need to get more on  this result, which is one I kind of want to know about.  You need to do another one.  So this is like digging deeper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I did it so long ago.  I got I got it free.  What an appeared at Pardon me Davos about four years ago.  My I do not flush due to alcohol.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have I'm unlikely to taste bitter foods.  Does it have the asparagus thing in there?  Really?  Because is that genetic?  I don't know.  I'm likely tolerant of lactose.  My have my hair is slightly curlier than average.  My eyes are likely to be brown.  Well, good.  I spent one hundred dollars to learn that my muscle performance.  I'm a likely sprinter.  Wrong.  I am not a likely sprinter.  Anyway, you know, retrovirus, I'm not resistant to a norovirus.  I'm not resistant to AIDS.  If I'm a smoker, I'm likely to smoke more than the average bear.  I think this is over.  Here it is.  Asparagus metabolite detection.  Higher odds of detecting.  What?  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, what?  I mean, your piece smells even worse than it's a 23 and we some discovery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Some do.  And it's a discovery based on the so that's the interesting thing about this.  Then you ask a lot.  They ask you a lot of questions.  And then they do some genotyping with your phenotype to match it up.  And that's one of the things.  Apparently, I have a moderately higher odds of smelling asparagus in my ear.  It is what it is.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was just joking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's that's what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But you know what?  There's only three choices.  Typical odds, moderately higher odds or substantially higher odds.  So basically, there's no nobody who doesn't have odds or something.  Right.  I can't get mine up.  Yeah, let me see.  That's in here, too.  All right.  Enough enough genetic.  I do think this is interesting, but it's such early days that it doesn't really tell you a whole lot yet.  It doesn't.  It doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No.  Esther Dyson is one of 10 people who published her full genome.  Well, I tried to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, that's another project.  And I applied for it.  I haven't heard back.  That's the public genome project, which is a very interesting project.  The reason I did is we interviewed the guy on Futures and Biotech who's doing this.  And the idea is you have to you apply and they have to accept you and they do a full genotype, like not just it's a personal genome project.  I should say, not just the 23andMe, which is a few genotypes.  They do the full and it's which is much more expensive still.  And if you participate, you agree.  First of all, to fill out a big phenotype questionnaire, every complete medical history, this is what Esther's done and that it will be published because they say we can't guarantee privacy.  And really, the point of this is to match your phenotype with your genotype so that there can be research done.  So I said, I will do this because I don't I don't have anything to hide.  I live in public like you do, Jeff.  And somebody pointed out, you should ask your kids because you are, in fact, giving out information about your kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, when I talked to Esther about this, when I was researching public parts, I talked to her and said, well, you know, I guess Esther, I am revealing my son's DNA, but prostate cancer.  And she said, oh, Jeff, everybody gets prostate cancer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Get over it.  It's true. All men eventually, if you live long enough, chances are very high.  So they don't have a whole lot.  I don't right now.  There's 10 or something participants.  Esther's one of the one of them.  But they said there's no way that we can hide your your your name and information.  So we don't even try.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So they rejected you again because they reject me.  I just I've applied.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've said I'll pay the money because I really want to do it.  But I haven't heard anything back from him yet.  So but that was that was more than a year ago.  It was futures and biotech.  Yeah. So I don't know if they're stalled or maybe they've got so many submissions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And but it is one of those things where you kind of want to think long and hard before you do this,  because it'll say, you know, Leo Laporte is, you know, has carries some gene that makes it very likely that he's going to have Alzheimer's in three years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Exactly the fear. And do you want to know?  It's like so many women are going through this now with the breast cancer gene.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not only not only do you want to know, but do you want your insurance company to know?  That's that's where we need legislation to protect you.  Right.  I just think this is so this is and kudos to Esther and everybody who's done this.  It's a huge contribution because the problem is, you know, now you can order their genotype.  You know, it's in a bottle. It's like HALA.  Right. You can order their genotype and it's, you know, it's as die.  And and you then can look at the phenotype, like what her family histories are, what her medical history is and everything.  And you could start doing some research around this stuff.  And so I think this is a brilliant thing.  It's personally if you want to know more personal genomes dot org.  And I have high hopes for this.  But I think you crash the 23 me server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I can't get to my stuff. Oh, really?  All right. All right.  So Venus thrombolism, I've got a two and a half higher risk lung cancer, one point four percent.  I've won four times higher risk.  Of course, it helps that I smoked for eight years.  Macular degeneration is high. Diabetes, very high.  But the thing that they're learning is that merely the genotype is not enough that they many people carry genotypes,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  but the expression of the gene has a lot to do with environmental and other other nurture causes.  Right. Not not nature causes.  So you can have what all it's telling you is you have this higher likelihood.  But if you don't encounter the environmental stimuli to trigger it, you won't get it.  And it's still very early days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the thing. That's the thing's kind of maddening about 23 and me is that it says, well, there's this likelihood.  It doesn't mean you're actually going to get it's not a diagnosis of anything.  They can't. That's why there's no right. They can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's the limitation, I think, of genomics. I think we had hoped for more.  Right. Maybe there will be more down the road.  Maybe there will be. Yeah.  I just think this, you know, and what what I'll give you one example of the value of this.  Every cancer is genetically unique.  And if we could genotype the cancers and genotype the patient,  we could create a cancer fighting agent that targets just those cells.  And chemo would be not nearly so dramatically poisonous, in fact, would be much more likely to be successful.  And I think this is going to happen the next decade.  These kinds of tailored drugs, silver bullet drugs, I think this is more likely.  But you know what you should do? Listen to Futures in Biotech.  We no longer broadcast the show, but he's still doing it.  If you do, I think twice a month, Mark Pelletier does Futures in Biotech.  Futures in biotech dot com, I think.  But you can Google Futures in Biotech every Tuesday. Every other Tuesday, he does it.  Let's get to Google. In fact, lots of Google stuff.  This would be a good time to do the Google changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Google changelog.  Ladies and gentlemen, Gina Trapani with the Google changelog.  I just love that bumper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Lots of mobile app changes this week.  Google Maps for iOS got updated with Google Contact Support and local search categories.  Contact Support means it brings in your home address and other addresses from your Google contacts on the web once you sign in.  This is the new Google Maps for iOS.  New version of the app also allows for quicker local search.  You can choose places from categories like restaurants and stores.  And this new version also lets you pick between kilometers and miles as your distance units.  The Google Chrome beta for Android.  Also, this is the Chrome 26 beta on Android.  It's adding password sync across devices.  This will be enabled over the coming days.  It will only sync with other clients that are also based on Chrome 26 or higher.  That's really nice.  And it's actually going to sync your autofill values as well.  The other thing that Chrome beta for Android adds is the option to use data compression, which Google says will speed up your web browsing by 50%.  So to turn this on, this is in the Chrome beta for Android.  And to go in the Omnibox, you type in Chrome colon slash flags.  And then you have to enable the first setting.  This is an experimental feature.  So you enable that first setting there, which is enable data compression proxy.  So basically, Google's put out a bunch of proxy servers running speedy, which is their new compression protocol.  And so any time you browse to a website, not SSL, but just a normal connection website, you will go through Google's really super fast proxy servers and reduce your data usage.  And so like I said, Google said this accelerator will reduce data usage by 50%.  But you can see for yourself how much it actually saves you in that same Chrome version.  If you go to Chrome colon slash net internals, you can go to the bandwidth section and it'll tell you actually how much bandwidth you save using this proxy.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's not the first on my list.  What's it called?  So I can look for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The flag to check.  Check your beta.  The data compression proxy.  It's called enable data compression proxy.  That would make sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's in the new it's in the new beta.  I'm actually not sure if it's if it's rolled out quite yet.  It's Chrome 26.0.1410.26.  And it says it's rolling out over the next few days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have to be using the Chrome beta app, I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I'm doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now there's as I learned last week, there's the developer track and the beta track, right?  Which is in the developer or the beta?  Oh, it's in the Chrome beta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep.  For those of you running the stable version of Chrome on Android and even iOS, those have both gotten updated to also get faster speed up latest version of Chrome on Android.  You can scroll and fling to view all of your favorite web pages with more speed and ease.  Google says scroll and fling scroll and fling.  It's got the latest version of the V8 JavaScript engine, which is optimized now for mobile.  And Google says they've improved the octane performance benchmark by 25 percent on average.  So faster Chrome across the board, whether or not you're using beta or stable.  And on iOS, Chrome also got an update.  If you're using Chrome on your iPhone or your iPad, searching with Google got easier.  You can see search.  You can see your search term in the Omni box.  So instead of the long URL, which will get cut off on your phone, especially, you'll just see your search terms in the in the Omni box and a couple of other new iOS features to quickly view your tab history.  If you press and hold the back button to see any page that you previously visited, then a drop down appears and you can and you can quickly tap on one the menu.  You can share a web page that you visited and you can share any web page via messages as well.  And that's not that's on iOS.  That's it for that's it for Chrome on on mobile.  But far from it about the change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's a couple of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google Plus totally revamped the profile pages today.  Have you guys seen this?  Yeah, really nice cover photo is enormous resolution up to 2120 by 1192 pixels and just nicer about layout.  And it's really much easier to see how other people can see how public people can see your profile, how your friends see it, what it looks like to you.  Obviously, there's a sticky basic information bar as you scroll down the page.  Just really nice.  And with that cover photo upgrade, the hover cards and you hover over other users names, you can see their cover photo on the hover card looks really, really nice.  And well, I might as well add this here in the in the in the change log.  Probably we have it listed elsewhere.  But the the Play Store's one year birthday is this week.  And they're doing a little promotion over at the Play Store.  Bunch of stuff for free.  So if you go to if you go to Google Play the Play Store, you can click on their celebrate our first birthday with limited time gifts, free songs, a couple of free apps, a couple of nice, nice giveaways this year to to celebrate their year old.  I guess the market was around.  I guess they renamed it the year ago.  Exactly.  And I'm you know, it's funny at the time I thought not such a great name, but now I love it.  So grew on me.  And finally, Google I.O., which is going on in in May, their new the new I.O. 2013 site is up.  If you go to developers.google.com slash events slash I.O. all brand new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  As everybody knows, one divided by zero to the 13th is one.  What's zero to the 13th?  Is it one?  No, it's a division by zero.  Is it zero to the 13th?  Zero?  Yeah.  Well, that's not good.  No, I just realized I can write binary down here at the bottom.  Scooch it.  Scooch it.  Oh, you're writing binary.  If you get the code right, it will unlock Google and you'll get the Google achievement.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's binary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What are you writing?  I don't know.  Something's got to happen.  I'm telling you.  Try doing 13 in binary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What is that?  Aaron Newcomb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Someone give me the zero zero one zero.  Chattanoom will tell us.  Yeah, Chattanoom will tell us.  One zero one one.  One zero one one.  One zero one one.  Okay.  Or is it one one zero one?  One one zero one.  Sorry.  One one zero one.  Try that.  Yeah, nothing happened.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's got to do something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's got to do something.  You crashed Google.  Yeah.  If you click on it in different sequences, they sometimes turn red.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so it looks like if you get it wrong, it turns red.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then the next one that you click, it'll start the next sequence.  So you're going for something.  There's something going on there.  Chattanoom's saying zero and then one one one one one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, here I also see zero zero one one one two three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no.  I think it tries zero and five ones.  Six ones.  Zero one two three four five six.  You guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's no way to confirm or say anything.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I mean, this week in paint drying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, come on.  Oh, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, my God.  Whoa.  It's ASCII.  He turned it into ASCII code.  OK, what was that again?  So it was up here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's zero and all ones.  And it's actually up here in the corner of the web page.  It looks like I have passed through the first gate.  Now you got to do it again.  Again?  OK, here we go.  You've entered the major.  Whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's now ASCII, right?  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Where is this?  So this is the Google.  It's the Google page.  Google dot com slash events.  Yeah, this is just the I.O. 2013 kind of official site.  It just went up.  It just went up this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you spelling a word perhaps?  I don't know.  What is that first?  What is the first?  I want free I.O. tickets.  What is the zero plus one?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I want free I.O. tickets.  What is the zero plus five ones in ASCII?  I mean in binary.  I don't know.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It is binary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is binary.  It is binary.  It is binary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, but what is that equivalent to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me find out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Binary translators.  Everyone get out there.  Binary translators.  That would be ASCII.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hello, world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It also makes great sound effects on both the ASCII version and the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, does it?  I missed that.  I'm muted.  This is good.  This is fun.  Oh, now that's 8-bit now.  So here, I'm in the 8-bit.  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh.  I, I, I, I, I, I, I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that sounds like Castle Wolfenstein, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, no, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That is so fun.  Meanwhile, I can't save my cover photo.  Try again later.  Oh, no.  How come?  I don't know.  So you have to upgrade by hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it kind of prompts you when you go to your profile, like, hey, get a new cover photo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  And it says there's no going back.  So, just a warning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there's no going back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No going back.  Once you change, your life will change forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Lauren Weinstein is complaining that I want to read the posts.  I don't want to see the gigantic photo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I think that makes it more appealing, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've been going way more visual.  I think it's just because it's been used for, you know, Google Plus has had this great photography  community.  Yeah.  So just to wrap up the change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, sorry.  Look what I got.  Look what I got.  Oh, he's got bacon and eggs now.  Bacon and eggs.  How did you do that?  One, it's one zero zero.  One zero zero zero.  I don't know.  Go to my cover.  I just put a giant photo.  One and two zeros and then one and four zeros.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's giant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're right.  That is a little big for a profile photo.  Holy moly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When you navigate to someone's profile, it starts the page kind of like halfway down the  photo.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You have to scroll up.  Have you done yours?  Should I go to your?  I have.  Yeah, go right ahead.  Let's go to Gina's.  See what happens.  And it's up to that.  Oh, not somebody else.  But that's nice.  That's pretty.  That's Megan Peters.  I don't know who that is, but that's nice.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right.  All right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nice.  Ah, cats.  OK.  OK.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  OK.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is some.  So the game is if you note when it goes red, you got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You got to learn basically not to do that sequence.  Yeah, I don't think it's binary anymore because it seems like it's more of a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It seems like it's more of just a pattern.  That's weird.  And it's not the same on each stage.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  I love that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's cool.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, synthesizer.  You got a moog.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is somebody's 20 percent.  It absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Years.  Absolutely.  As a shareholder.  I don't know if I'm happy about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, you want to.  You know, I guess this is all HTML5.  This is all just the traffic.  And I'm not sure.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know.  This is all HTML5.  This is all just to track the developers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All just to show how much we can do in HTML5.  Exactly right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And what's sad is that this site, I mean, is really registration is on March 13th, starting  at 7 a.m. Pacific time.  So kind of we've got basically a week to kind of play around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it fills up pretty quick, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So yeah, like within 20 minutes last year.  So I'm not sure.  Probably quicker this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just to speed up the what will they be giving away?  They'll be giving away a Pixel.  What do you think?  Pixel and Nexus 5.  What are we going to get?  What comes after Q?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They don't give away things they don't have yet.  They don't announce things there.  So I don't think the Nexus 5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it would be a 4 then probably.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait, they don't announce things.  They announce the Q.  Yeah, they announce the Q.  They announce Glass.  Well, that worked so well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I guess they didn't announce Glass.  Good theory, Jeff.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So they don't announce any successful products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I just lost Pong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't.  You were playing Pong?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It has Pong?  It has Pong, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One and six zeros and then another one.  You know, you got to think how much productivity is lost to Google doodles over the years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a conspiracy.  They announced the Nexus 7 last year and gave it to people.  So no, I think this is a great way to make the developer conference of a high priority  for people because they know they're going to get a bunch of crap.  What about the news?  New version of Android maybe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Chad's coming out.  We've lost him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The thing is that there's always a new version of Android, you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it's 4.2.2 is the current version, right?  Are we going to go to K?  Oh, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was saying Chrome.  I meant Chrome.  I'm sorry.  I just heard Android and thought Chrome.  I was like, there's always a new version of Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was thinking either Android or the Motorola Nexus, which has been rumored.  I mean, I don't know.  X film.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  X-Fone.  Probably KeyLinePie.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Should we expect it?  What are you looking at?  Is that a pixel?  I'm in love.  What the hell?  You got a pixel?  I thought you canceled it.  Oh, this is the reviewer unit.  And you're in love.  I'm in love.  Would you recommend that somebody spend $1,300 for that?  I didn't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I did it.  I did it.  So that's interesting.  It's just too great.  The keyboard is butter.  The screen is so much better.  Unbelievable.  I put it next to my Mac now and the MacBook's positively ASCII.  Yeah.  And that'll get me in trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, well, you don't have a Retina.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I don't have a Retina.  And it's just solid.  It just keeps working.  That's the same reaction people with Retina's place have.  But...  But I know that Torvalds did a song of praise to it on Google+.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, he gushed.  He gushed over it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I wonder if he put Linux on it.  Yeah, he said he was going to.  But right now he said he might still use this as a browser machine.  He got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you can use Kruton.  And we mentioned this last week.  You can use Kruton as an emulator and use Linux within Chrome OS, which to me would  make it a lot more desirable to have a real operating system.  A little bit of a real operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  But then, you know, it hasn't hurt me.  I'm using everything.  You're comfortable.  And you can play Google I.O. games.  I could.  I have the IQ for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But not the binary codes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Or the... or the patience.  Or the life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Has anybody installed...  I mean, can we just put Ubuntu on it or some other Linux?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think you can as long as it's small enough to fit in the memory that they give  you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's the issue.  You can also... you can boot from a thumb drive.  You can boot from a thumb drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not USB 3, alas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No.  I think for a computer at that cost...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It has a fan.  The battery is a bit less.  Here's the thing.  I was...  I didn't know that the review unit...  I was sitting there somewhere.  I didn't have Wi-Fi.  And it said, you know, getting the cell.  I thought, oh, it has the cell coverage.  And boom, I was on.  And LTE on it is unbelievable.  You got the cell one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's the review unit.  That's the one to wait for, probably.  It's a couple hundred bucks more, but...  150 more.  ...permanent internet access.  It's pretty desirable.  And whose LTE?  Is Verizon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's...  It is a sweet machine.  I spend all day on browsers.  Do you think if you hadn't preconditioned yourself

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  by using the Samsung Chromebook for a while?  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'd be one of those saying, this is insane.  I'd be the first time saying Google's nuts.  I'd be saying all that, right?  But the Samsung just made me so comfortable  with living in the browser, living in the cloud,  that...  But the weakness of the Samsung was  little too little memory,  little too tinny,  pages would crap out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was a netbook.  This isn't a real computer.  This is a beautiful computer.  I gotta say.  And so really the only question is,  does it do enough as for a real computer?  And Jeff says yes.  And a lot do.  Somebody in our chat room just says  it's the best computer I've ever used.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's amazing.  And Chad, now I'm going to go nuts  on trying to...  That client for one of our users sent us.  I want to die to get it working  for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I want to travel along a Mac when I travel.  Four to five weeks for the LTE version.  Yeah.  Now is this like the other...  So you get 100 megabytes a month?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, you get a gigabyte.  I mean, you get a terabyte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Of download.  Oh, download.  It's 100 megabytes unless you pay for more.  100 megabytes?  Is that what it says?  That's what the Samsung Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You get 100 megabytes a month.  Free included with the Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  100 megabytes?  No.  You can't even watch YouTube.  A little bit of a trick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Come on.  It's a little bit of a trick.  Unless if you're in an emergency situation  where you want to get some mail  and you don't have a MIFI,  you can get your mail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Maybe.  As long as you don't have attachments.  Attachments, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I just ordered one.  Just we'll see.  Did you just order one?  Yeah.  Nice.  Jeff always tricks me into that stuff.  No, what I did is...  And they say, by the way,  four to five weeks for the LTE  and that's the one I ordered.  I'm not going to...  I think you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think you want the LTE  Yeah, that's what I originally ordered was the LTE  and then I said no  and I was going to order the Wi-Fi  and then when I...  Just the ease of...  I was sitting in the doctor's office today  and just the ease of going flipping over to the LTE  and there I was  and I was able to do what I wanted to.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or if you're commuting or anything, I mean it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I do love the corporate card.  Sorry, sorry.  Leo loves the corporate card.  I do love the corporate card.  What's he done now?  Hello Lucy.  I got a question for you.  64 gigs on the LTE version too  so that will be a little bit better for putting Linux on  which is one of the things I'm thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think if you dual boot Linux,  I think it makes a lot of sense.  You could put Linux Mint on that and be perfectly happy.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Then it's a real computer  and it's a really nice real computer.  Right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Someone in the chat room said  that half Google employees use Goobuntu  which I had to look up on Wikipedia  just because of a light skin over Goobuntu  and this person said,  sorry I missed it, it scrolled up.  It makes me wonder if they just want to make  a really nice laptop for their employees.  Yeah.  Which is usually Google's way.  That's a good...  Let's make something really good for Googlers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Perfectly good justification.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It seems odd though this huge jump  like they had all these low end ones  that everybody else was making  and then all of a sudden it's like wham!  You know, right from the top.  I saw people who are...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Googlers said that they've been using this machine  secretly inside the Plex for a year.  So this thing's been in development  for quite some time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And we had somebody in the chat room,  R. Byers, right,  who was on the team last week.  Right, last week.  Because he was so excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well he was so nervous  that I'd be using misinformation too  I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe that's...  I would imagine they assign people  to the show.  No, he's been great.  Let's just see what Jeff and Leo  and Gina are saying today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, somebody on Google Plus  posted all of the codes.  All the Google I.O. codes.  Oh nice.  The ones and zeros.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh that's not...  Don't look at it.  That spoils the fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What?  Cat, face, pong.  I'm just going to use the pong one.  Yeah, the pong one's great.  Bacon, Simone, 8-Bit, Song,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Synth, ASCII, Bowling, Rocket,  and Booger.  Burger.  So...  And Cat.  Don't look now.  Close your eyes.  But you now know the list  of things you're going for.  That's what you should have published.  And then obfuscated the binary  so that you know what you're going for.  How many total is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  6, 9...  So if you can't get...  So collect all 12.  Collect all 12.  And that's what Aaron's up to  by the way right now.  Any more on the change log?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's all I got.  That's the Google Change Log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thank you very much, Gina Trippatti.  We're going to take a break.  Come back with more.  Aaron is here.  Aaron Newcomb.  I got to make some money  because I just bought a Pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's wrong with me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There goes our raise, Gina.  There goes your raise, kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Leo just spat it.  And Jeff and Lena and Gina  are also with us as always.  Our show today brought to you  by LegalZoom.com.  LegalZoom, you've heard about...  They're not a law firm.  We're not talking about a law firm.  No, no, much better.  Self-help legal services  at your direction  for both business and personal documents  you can trust.  Incorporate your business  or form a LegalZoom LLC.  And you might say,  well, that's not going to...  Well, here's a pretty big company right here.  This one called Twit.  That's how we did it.  Way back when it was just me,  I couldn't afford to go to a law firm  and say, let's create an LLC.  But I knew I wanted an LLC.  And so, $99, that's a good deal.  And we're still using those basic operating  agreements and everything.  Trademarks.  We trademarked Twit and the logo.  Got to do that.  Copyrights.  Even patents and NDAs.  You can protect your family and assets  with a LegalZoom will.  Just $69.  You can also create a living trust.  Don't leave it up to the government  and the courts to decide  what happens to your estate and your kids.  You've got to have a will.  In the past 12 years,  2 million Americans have used LegalZoom  to do what I just did,  well, five, what I announced eight years ago.  LLCs, wills, trusts, trademarks, and more.  It's very simple, step-by-step questionnaire.  Total customer support.  In fact, they've added something since I used it.  I really would have taken advantage of this.  Because sometimes as you're going through the questionnaire,  like they ask, what state do you want to be incorporated in?  And I thought, California?  Or maybe Delaware?  And I would have loved to have asked an attorney.  Now you can.  If you have questions or need advice,  you can access their extensive network of attorneys.  LegalZoom's legal plans are available in most states.  And you can search the online profiles  and read unedited customer reviews  so you can pick the attorney that's right for you.  And of course, prices that are fixed and established.  And that's nice.  Lot, lot, lot better than going to a big law firm  for simple things like this.  Start your business.  Protect your family.  LegalZoom.com.  Again, it's not a law firm.  It's self-help services at your specific...  It was started by lawyers, though.  But it's not a law firm.  Self-help services at your specific direction.  Or speak to a legal plan attorney  to get your questions answered and get ongoing advice.  And all the forms, all the questionnaires,  all that's drawn up by attorneys, of course.  To receive a special thank you for using LegalZoom  through Twig.  Make sure you use our offer code for LegalZoom.com.  T-W-I-G.  And just as a little thank you,  we'll cut 10 bucks off your price at checkout.  Just to let them know you heard it on Twig.  T-W-I-G at LegalZoom.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Curse you, Jeff Jarvis.  Curse you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You think I made a mistake buying that thing?  It's going to be four to five weeks.  Four to five weeks.  That's a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can change your mind between now and then,  which is what I do.  I then go to write.  You already changed it a couple of times.  I have changed a couple of times.  But I just...  My rule is, if it's something I use  absolutely every day all the time,  then I should get something good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I'm reviewing the Samsung Chromebook,  the higher-end one that you like  and everybody seems to like.  I'm reviewing that next week for Before You Buy.  And I'll use it and kind of get used to it.  This is the $249 one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a lot.  So for that price, I could buy five of those for one pixel.  Or four of those for one pixel.  But...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But the other advantage...  Well, the advantage of the Samsung one  is you get six and a half hours battery versus five.  Yeah.  And it's lighter and smaller.  But it's a netbook, basically.  It's kind of a little crappy.  But it's really pretty amazing.  But it's going to feel...  You're happy that you got it.  ...really workable but tinny.  You're very happy that you got the Pixel.  Yeah, well, I used the Samsung for, what, six, eight weeks.  Yeah.  You know, a long time in our world.  And it was the only machine I was carrying with me.  I went on...  Unless I had to do Twig,  I carried the Samsung with me on trips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, you mentioned that maybe there'll be a Motorola Nexus.  I don't know.  After reading this, Google's CFO says,  Eh...  Eh, the Motorola stuff, eh, it's not up to our standards.  Yeah.  Now, and he didn't say the existing stuff.  He said kind of the new stuff, too.  I happen to agree with him.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We just hired Guy Kawasaki, I think, to be concerned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Motorola did.  Yeah, I don't know if that's going to make a huge difference.  Patrick Pichette, who's a chief financial officer  and senior vice president at Google,  said the products in Motorola's pipeline,  that's the upcoming ones, are, quote,  not really up to the standards  that what Google would say is,  wow, innovative, transformative, transformative.  This was at the Morgan Stanley Technology Conference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, that's how you sell devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess.  It's not going to be the Nexus Motorola.  He said we've inherited 18 months of pipeline  that we actually have to drain right now.  It's like a pustule.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  While we're actually building the next wave of innovation  and product lines, boy, they, wow, that is harsh.  Well, talk about managing expectations, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it's actually smart to the extent that  any new Motorola product's going to come out,  people are going to say, oh, this is the best we can do  and Google's going to say, we told you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, we're still clearing the puss out of the pipeline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's strange that their pipeline is so long, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Stop pushing about your year of 18 months.  Well, is that strange? Do you think that's unusual for a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's a little long. I mean, it seems a little long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That was the problem with Motorola.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  That was exactly the problem.  Yeah, yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it naive for me to say, like,  why don't they just shut down the pipeline?  If they really don't think these products are any good,  why don't they just stop it?  Well, I think that was the implication.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And he says it's just the transition is an instant.  But I think that's kind of the implication is  we're probably not going to make this stuff.  But it would make sense that at some point,  maybe not by IO time, the next Nexus,  a Nexus will start coming from Motorola  instead of anybody else, or maybe not.  Maybe, you know, Google's got to be at great pains  to tell the other Android handset makers,  hey, we're not going to give Motorola special treatment,  because if that really were their perception,  I don't know, that could be a risky thing, right?  Even, you know, Samsung is kind of signaling that to Google  by saying, hey, we got Tizen, we got Windows phones,  we don't have to make Android phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm surprised that they haven't done more with Motorola,  but I've also been through acquisitions  on a number of occasions.  You came to Oracle through an acquisition.  That's right, I came to Oracle through Sun.  And, you know, I wonder if Google,  I mean, this was a big acquisition for Google, too.  I wonder if there's some learning going on here.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a skill they don't really have.  It's such a different company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, they do acquisitions.  They do acquisitions all the time, but it's usually like  web startups, you know, oh, 10 people here, 10 people there.  But this is a big corporation with obviously a long pipeline  of hardware products.  So maybe they're still learning how to do it.  I mean, I don't know.  In the chat room, Bear just said Motorola was bought

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  for its radio tech.  Google Glass needed small, fast radios.  I like it.  Bear is our assistant and is very smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He used to work for the Mozilla Foundation.  That makes sense.  And the patents, of course.  And they sold off the set-top division,  which we thought for a while,  maybe was one of the reasons they bought it.  Yeah, right.  We thought maybe Google TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The other thing, of course, that is obvious is they bought

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  them for their patents.  Yeah.  And of course, they have relationships with the Verizon's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and the AT&T's and those people, too.  Like some of these products may have been, hey, look,  here's our roadmap.  And everybody agreed to it and signed off on it  and was happy with it.  Maybe they have agreements they can't back out of.  Now, if you're a company that's not really a company  and you have agreements they can't back out of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, if you're Google and you're under investigation  by the chairman of the FTC,  it seems like it would be a good idea to donate,  let's say, I don't know, 25 large  to an event honoring the chairman of the FCC.  Maybe you might get some good stuff out of that.  That's what happened.  The FTC says, we didn't know that.  Right hand should have talked to left hand.  We didn't know that.  The implication being, well, since we didn't know it,  it couldn't have had any implication in the fact  that we let Google off pretty light in our investigation.  I don't, you know, let's be honest, 25 grand  to honor the FCC chairman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's not to honor him.  It's to support the charity that used honoring him  as their excuse to beg for money.  So this is common sense media.  I don't know who common sense media is.  Let's look that up.  But that's where the money went.  Libavis didn't benefit in any way.  You got to eat free chicken.  Yeah, big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  FTC says Chairman Libavis had no idea  Google was one of many corporate sponsors  to the event until he read the article.  But he's grateful and honored to accept the war  from common sense media, which does so much  for kids and families and privacy.  What a politician.  This seems like an odd story.  Yeah. Well, I think you got to report it.  But I don't know if it,  I think you could safely say,  it probably didn't make a difference.  So Google won in the Bundestag, right?  Is that what you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, Mein Freund.  They didn't fully win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They were smart to take it to the German legislature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, they weren't.  No, no, no. What happened here was, Mein Freund,  hey Chad, get the reggae ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And if we get a Leichung Zittrich sighting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So what happened was that this law was going to require  the licensing of snippets.  Right?  There was two versions of it, by the way.  So they don't require license to snippets.  At the last minute, one of the parties proposed  a compromise that exempted things,  you're going to love this, up to 160 characters,  like tweet length.  And then that didn't survive, but instead they said,  okay, one word or very few words you can do for free.  So like freeze up the word V.  Nobody can own the word V.  Nobody can license the word V now.  Well, that's a relief. Yeah.  But the problem is there is no definition of a snippet.  So this is going to go on and on and on.  So Google said, oh, well, we're glad you got rid of the snippet thing,  but still it's dangerous and bad.  I think it's horribly dangerous and bad.  I wrote a post about this that was then translated  into an op-ed at Zeit and Tuggespiegel.  In which I ridiculed this law and everything about it,  but also said that I think it indicates a problem  with Germany and technology.  And these are arguments I've had on the show before.  And then Christoph Käse, who's the architect of this bill  from Axel Springer, a big publisher,  kind of the news corp of Germany, came into,  we had a little back and forth in Twitter about this,  where he was trying to argue that the Gutenberg stuff,  you don't get me on Gutenberg, man.  I was defending the Gutenberg deal.  So this idiocy continues.  It's not over. Google didn't win.  They won that much.  But we all lost because of this idea that you could license content  for a year and not quote it without licensing it.  It is obviously incredibly dangerous.  And by the way, dangerous to media companies.  How does Axel Springer get its content?  They quote a lot of people.  So, no, it's not over.  Now what it's going to do is now go to the higher house.  And there, that's controlled by the liberals.  And the hope is that it will get defeated there, but we don't know.  This is an election year thing with Merkel.  The conservative party is giving this to Axel Springer and Bertha,  the publishers.  So there's still danger, danger, danger out there, folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Stranger danger.  Yeah.  Okay, this is really annoying.  When I go to picassaweb.com,  which is Google's photo sharing service,  I get sent to not PICASA Web, but Google+.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ah, the plussification of PICASA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It does pop up a little thing.  Click here to go back to PICASA Web albums.  But how long is that going to be there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Are your photos moved over to, all moved over to Plus then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ah, yes.  It's the same albums.  And actually they're bigger thumbnails, which is nice.  But I'm a little puzzled, you know?  I mean, does this mean it's the end of PICASA Web?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Do they, if they incorporated all the functionality of PICASA Web?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the question.  There were some features that PICASA Web had that I didn't find in,  certainly didn't have in Google+.  It doesn't look like it.  It seems kind of, that's the real question.  Like you could, they have been adding more and more features to Google+.  Maybe they finally got to the point now where they're like,  okay, we're close enough.  We can merge the two services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let me click on a photo.  Yeah, this is all Google+.  I do have Edit Photo, Magic Wand.  There's a lot of tools in Edit Photo.  I guess this is, I don't know.  I'd have to really do a one-to-one comparison.  Is this Aviary?  Might be.  Yeah, Rotate, Sharpen, Resize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, actually there's some nice tools.  Maybe the chat room, more familiar with the PICASA Web than I am,  I do upload everything there,  but ironically I do it mostly through Google+, photo sharing.  Instant uploads.  Instant uploads.  But maybe the chat room knows what features are there or should be there.  Everything that I would use is there, but, and now it's Google+.  How about sharing with other people?  I guess that's part of Plus built in, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The problem I have in Plus photos is I can't email a photo unless I'm stupid  and never figure it out.  Really?  Hmm.  Or I can't save it.  You can do it saved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, you just share it on Google+, with an email address.  Yeah, and it emails it automatically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, you're kidding me.  That's Microsoft Think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is a little, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Huh.  You don't want to have, oh, duh moments.  It's showing the exif.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess this is much of the same information.  It's interesting though, it's kind of hidden under the Google+, UI.  Anyway, that's, I guess, goodbye PICASA Web.  I think, you got to say that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and if all the features are the same, I mean, it doesn't make sense to keep to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's better.  It's got bigger thumbnails.  It's prettier.  You're used to using it.  It's kind of a natural way to share.  I love how we just took that arc there where Leo was, oh, down the breath.  It makes me nervous because I don't like seeing Google-plusification of everything.  But on the other hand, if you don't lose any features and you get new features...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, see, the one that I never had in Google, or in Google+, was the ability to move photos around in your album so they come up in the...  Can you do that now?  Now I can do it.  Yeah, it's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Look back at Flickr, folks, where it was bought and then utterly orphaned and abandoned.  And this could have been the fate of Picasa, whereas now you know Google is going to care about photos.  This is all part of Plus and They Love Plus, whether you do or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So guess what, Google...  This is interesting.  Danny Sullivan, writing in the search engine watch, talks about the National Security Letter, FBI National Security Letter, and Google revealing...  I think this is something they're not supposed to reveal, but maybe so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Look how they revealed it, Leo. They revealed not much, but they wanted to reveal something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Aren't you, at least under the Patriot Act, you're kind of not supposed to say anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're not supposed to say specific numbers or specific cases. So what they did, look, they revealed a gigantic range of numbers.  And was there kind of a little slap to the feds saying, we can't be transparent because you're not letting us be?  Right.  But here's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When conducting national security investigations, the US FBI can issue a National Security Letter to obtain identifying information about a subscriber from telephone and internet companies.  In other words, they send out a letter which says, who was that using Gmail at this time and this date with this IP address?  The FBI has the authority to prohibit companies from talking about these requests. That's a Patriot Act feature.  But we've been trying to find a way to provide more information about the national security letters we get, particularly as people have voiced concerns about the increase in their use since 9-11.  Because it's not... There's no oversight from a judge or anything. It's not a warrant. It's just an NSL.  Today, we're going to start including data about NSLs in our transparency report.  We're thankful to the US government officials for working with us to provide greater insight.  So I guess they've asked permission. But you're right. It's not a lot of information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because it says zero. All you can see there is one year had more than other years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. We're reporting numerical ranges rather than exact numbers. This is to raise concerns by... raised by the FBI, Justice Department and other agencies.  We plan to update these regularly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is actually quite interesting. I remember, I think it was maybe a month ago or so, they said they were going to start publishing...  ...warrants and... how many warrants and subpoenas and stuff they get.  Right.  So they're just adding to that same report.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, what we know is they've received in the last four years between zero and a thousand NSLs.  And the only thing that's different is the number of accounts. The number of users in the number of accounts.  And it's actually... it peaked in 2010. About twice as many in 2010, apparently. Roughly.  But it's somewhere between a thousand and two thousand last year accounts. Doesn't really tell you a whole lot, doesn't it?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It just tells you the total number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. And then the request by reporting period, percentage of requests where some data was produced is very close to a hundred.  Actually, it's going down. It's going down. That's that graph on the right, Chad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then down below that, it tells you the details of the search warrants and the subpoenas and other. I don't know what other is, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, good on Google for at least attempting to reveal something.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The transparency report is great, but all this says is really that they've got more requests in 2010 than they did in 2009.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Actually, what it really says is this is happening and we just want you to know we're not allowed to tell you, but we do want to let you know it is happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And we can't tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And the government won't let us tell you anything or not much anyway.  Google services should not require real names, says the father of the Internet. Thank you, Vint Cerf, but you better talk to Larry about that.  Yeah.  He's right. He says in the face of increasing government crackdowns, Google should not force Internet users to reveal their real names for some services, including Google Plus, says Vint Cerf.  Now, you don't call the father of the Internet out of the carpet, so I don't know what you do at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But you know, there's becoming this overarching rule that says that requiring names is bad.  So shift to another example.  LinkedIn would be clearly useless without real names.  Right?  Makes absolutely no sense.  There's no possible use of LinkedIn without real names on the one extreme.  And on the other extreme is 4Jam.  Right. Totally anonymous.  Right. In the middle, there is, I think, pardon me, some right, even responsibility to try to determine the rules of a platform in a community you start.  Right.  And I always argue that Facebook's key differentiator was that it brought real names, real identity, and real relationships to an otherwise too anonymous web.  And we grabbed that because we wanted that because we were sick of just nothing but trolls everywhere.  And so I think that was a benefit.  Right.  And then, yeah, anonymity has its place.  Anonymity is important.  But real relationships and real people also have their place that are important.  And I don't think there's anything wrong with requiring it.  The problem comes in at the moment where Facebook or Google becomes a platform for communication that are necessary by those who are using anonymity for a reason.  Right.  Witness what happened to Walgonim in Egypt with Facebook.  Facebook was a place to go get people in Egypt.  He didn't want to start an account with his own name, but he couldn't.  So there's some exception needed for those circumstances.  But I think it's perfectly legitimate for Facebook and Google Plus to say this is a place for real people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what we're trying to encourage, but not require.  Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because essentially, isn't the service going to be the thing that says, you know, I want to use my real name because of the benefits that I get from that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but you've already gone over the edge.  You've gone over the edge to troll land.  And I'm not saying, by the way, let me make very clear here, I'm not saying that identity exterminates trolls.  I just wrote a big piece for Medium about this, arguing the opposite.  Oh, really?  Now, that's intriguing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I always thought that if somebody uses a real name, they're much less likely to troll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I can name some trolls by name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but they will look at perfect examples.  The Reddit troll who was outed and has disappeared.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And it stopped him, right?  But I can also I can also very much name some trolls by name.  I'm not going to because I'm not going to give them satisfaction.  That's the point. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mike Harrington, you mean?  I didn't call it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I've quite publicly called him a troll, so there's no taking that back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But but, you know, I try attempted on Medium to define a troll.  I think we talked about this last week.  I don't remember it.  Oh, there's a there's a book out called me.  I mean, I use the word a hole spelled out or not.  Yeah, a hole just like that.  Just like that. OK.  So there's a book called A holes, a theory.  I want to read that.  What is the theory?  You defined a holes and it's a whole book and it's very smart and very clever and goes on.  But then I argued that he left out a key genus of the species, which is trolls.  So if you go to medium dot com, where are you going to find it?  I'll send it to you to you right now in the in the rundown.  OK, can I send it to you on Skype?  No, I can't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You could send it, but I don't know who would get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you go to medium dot com at Jeff Jarvis, you'll see it's the second second article defining the troll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. So what I said is the troll.  So there's a definition of a hole there.  And then I come down later where you see the one, two, three, the definition of troll.  And his view is that an a hole, you know, it'd be nice if we just actually use the word because that sounds even worse.  But anyway, allows himself to enjoy special advantages and does so systematically to does this out of an entrenched sense of entitlement.  And three is immunized by his sense of entitlement against complaints of other people.  Yes, I'd agree with all that.  I think it's right. So I say what distinguishes the troll troll from the mere a hole is that he and by the way, I figured no women were going to complain about me using the male gender for this most are male.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I support the use of he here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, there's got to be female trolls. I know female trolls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are female trolls, but we don't have to talk about that.  So he has a target.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Number two, he seeks to get a response.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Arise out of that. I would disagree on he has a target.  A lot of trolling is, for instance, we have trolls come into the chair.  They're not targeting anything.  They just want the attention.  They certainly want negative attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But where do they choose to do it?  OK, that's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, there's well, it depends what forum you're using.  But I think a lot of trolls do not have a specific target.  They, in fact, most successfully target everyone.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, this goes back to number three, then, which is the believes he's acting out of some ordained moral purpose to destroy to bring down.  I disagree with that as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that's an a hole.  Yeah.  But I think a troll is not is really, I think, very simply, in my opinion, having lots of experience with trolls, it's somebody who wants attention of any kind, even if it's negative attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, I think that's more evil behavior.  I think the troll is a step beyond that.  I think it wants destruction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's a no, I don't know about that.  It's a destructive behavior.  But I'm not sure I would describe the intent to destroy as the more as the motivating force.  In some it is.  Right.  In some it is.  But I think in a great many, it is not.  They just want attention.  Interesting.  I think you know who should weigh in is our chat mods in the chat room because they deal with trolls all the time.  And there may be are different kinds of trolls.  Maybe there's forum trolls, chat trolls.  But I think that a troll is happiest when they've created conflict.  They've left a trail of of annoyed people behind them.  But mostly what they want is a lot of people talking about them.  And they're not so very different from John Hinckley or anybody who wants attention and is willing to do something really offensive to get it.  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's my theory.  I think the Reddit troll was trying to make a point.  Yeah, I think there's probably both both ways.  I mean, the Reddit trolls just trying to make a point.  I mean, trolls, I've dealt with them at least sort of pick a target.  Well, because you're the target.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I suppose you could make the case that I or Twitter are the targets in the chat room.  They certainly choose that.  That's what I'm going to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Something about that person or that place or that company or that forum that that triggers something in them that makes them feel like it's my job to disrupt this place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right, right. Exactly.  And by their action, they are showing disdain.  Yes.  For the place they're schmoozing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Actually, this is another I'll file a dissenting opinion.  So oftentimes, trolls love the place they're trolling.  Really?  Yeah.  You think it's the kid who dips your pigtails into the ink that really it is a I think trolls are it's a form of, you know, some mental problem.  And somebody who as a kid got negative attention is maybe the only attention they got from their parent.  And they really like somebody and what they want is attention.  And they only know how to get negative attention.  So if they're targeting you, it may not be targeting you to destroy you.  It may, in fact, merely be targeting you to get your attention.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That thin line between love and hate thing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm going to use the word appropriately.  That's creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, yeah, it's a little creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Look, here's my this is a that's a stocky.  A lay psycho lay psychology.  OK.  But my lay psychology is here's a kid didn't get enough attention as a kid did not get enough attention.  The only attention he got from his mom or his dad was negative.  It's not that knock it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Get out of here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it was the only attention he got.  And he learned that was the closest thing to love he was going to get from a parent goes out grows up into life and still craves that kind of attention.  Because for him or her, that's the attention they know.  And that's what equates to love.  And I think very frequently the Howard Stern analysis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I sit down, shut up, you moron said his father.  Yeah.  So that's what you're saying is that.  And we get I mean, I only say that because maybe that's the kind of troll we get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There are certainly trolls.  There are there are really evil people who go after people.  You know, the creepers, the stalkers.  That's not a troll to me.  That's a different thing.  That's just a that's a stalker.  But but a troll is somebody who goes into a community and disrupts it.  But it's my opinion.  They don't disrupt it because they dislike the community.  They disrupt it because they want to be a part of the community and they want the community's attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's even what that guy from Reddit said in the interview, didn't he?  He's like, this was my life.  This is what I lived for.  I loved it.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He loved that he got the attention.  He got the love.  He loved Reddit.  I mean, he loved Reddit.  He loved this precisely like policy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He also loved Reddit because it enabled him anonymously to do this.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's where he chose.  That was his forum.  He chose that as his forum.  Anyway, so a troll may not be an a-hole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  A troll.  It's interesting that we have a disagreement taxonomy here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know if it's germane.  I do.  Well, it is germane because understanding the person's motivation will help you in dealing  with the person, but at least it'll take some of the sting out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think there's some people that don't know they're trolls.  Do you think?  Oh, most trolls don't know they're trolls.  I mean, I mean, they just want to argue.  Yeah.  You know, and it's like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, our lead moderator, Dan, was a horrendous troll.  That's how I first met him.  I banned him three or four times from our forums.  It wasn't chat.  It was a forum.  He acknowledges this.  I'm not saying anything.  But I hung with him and he kept coming back.  And eventually I realized, oh, he just really wants to play.  And now he's like, he's our arm.  He's still a little trollish from time to time because he likes conflict, I think.  But he is our most ardent volunteer and has been for 10 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a really big accomplishment.  Yeah.  To change a troll into a contributor, that's big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that it's possible in many cases.  Poacher turned gamekeeper, says Charlie.  But who better to patrol for trolls than an ex-troll?  Right.  Yeah.  I think it's I think often.  Oh, now I'm going to really get in trouble.  Police officers, if they weren't police officers, would be criminals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's the basic, you know, 30s movie plot of the good brother and the bad brother, the priest.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I got so anonymity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Anonymity.  Back to anonymity.  Vince says we're doing the right thing.  We're doing it just right.  The EFF based differ.  Jillian.  I can't.  I'm finding the article again.  We got off on that troll thing.  Let me back up a couple of pages back here.  By the way, medium.com.  We've talked about it before.  Jeff writes some great stuff there.  I don't know why you're giving it away to have, but go ahead.  Keep up the good work.  It sure does look pretty, though.  Jillian York of the EFF.  It is.  Look, it's really pretty.  It's great.  I just wouldn't give my work away.  Jillian says Google's approach to this takes the view that the only thing people want to  stay safe from is government.  And that's one reason that there's certainly one reason, but that's not entirely true.  People are also concerned about staying protected from Google itself.  Yeah.  Oh, we didn't think of that, says Vint Cerf.  We're the good guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Vint and the EFF agree, don't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, Vint, what they disagree on is that Vint thinks Google's doing enough to protect anonymity.  I'm not sure the EFF agrees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, because users have the choice to display a pseudonym.  So they give your real name, but then only display a pseudonym.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  Google knows your real name.  And what the EFF is saying is, well, that's, okay, that's anonymity from somebody, but Google, others, but maybe they want to be anonymous from Google.  Right.  And since Google is responding to these national security letters, that may be synonymous with being anonymous from the government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, but the problem in that scenario was the government again, not Google.  Tell me where Google has harmed someone by knowing their identity.  They don't have any choice.  Well, we don't know.  I'm just sure we're sure where government has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just had this long argument on security now with Steve Gibson, who thinks that tracking cookies harm you.  That's what Google engages in very actively.  Could harm you.  Yeah, I don't want to get that anyway.  Moving on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's a rabbit down there.  Moving on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a big rabbit hole.  That's a long one, which we've gone down many times before.  Yes.  All right.  YouTube is going to launch a music service to compete with Spotify.  What do you think?  Is that now?  Is that a rumor?  I think I don't think Google's confirmed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they've got deals now.  Apparently with Warner and Universal, I think.  Was it Universal?  I can't remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This comes from Fortune, which was briefed on the service by sources in the record industry and those at Google who declined to be named.  YouTube said, while we don't comment on rumor or speculation, there are some content creators that think they would benefit from a subscription revenue stream in addition to ads.  So we're looking at that.  That's not that, by the way, that that could very well just be people who want to do pay-per-view on YouTube, which they are.  We know doing.  I think this is one of the few companies that could come marching into this space and do well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, they've already got a music, a good music service.  Well, they've got all the stuff on YouTube, but then they have Google Music.  They're already doing things like content matching, you know, when you upload your.  I mean, so they've got it seems like they've got all the pieces.  What they don't have is all of the content itself.  They don't have licenses to just warners and somebody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you've got to get them all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you got to get them all.  And then that makes you makes you really competitive, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But Billboard last year started including YouTube views into the Billboard charts.  That's how Harlem Shake went to number one.  Call me maybe oppo Gangnam style.  Somebody that I used to know from, as I've been told, it's pronounced goatee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, thank you. Oh, I didn't know about that.  Yeah, I didn't need it. Goatee. I've been saying gotcha.  I knew it was goatee.  I didn't realize that they had the song had gotten that popular because of the views.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Three hundred eighty million views.  You know, the two things that are very similar between oppo Gangnam style and and somebody that I used to know  is that in both cases there were a lot of parodies, remixes, tributes.  And that's got it. There's such a lesson there.  You know, there's so much about about let it go.  Call me maybe to there were hundreds of call me maybe.  Oh, my word. So what a surprise.  And Harlem Shake, do I have to say any more?  That's the way that you want to get viral, go viral.  Let everybody remix and modify your stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All of them have it.  Amanda Palmer did a really, really, really good Ted talk.  I know I'm overdue asking her to be on the show and and talked about how she realized the change came in trying to force people to pay versus allowing them to pay.  Yeah. And and and that it's really about a relationship and she understands the relationship she has with the public and it works.  And I even showed the entire video to my entrepreneurial students saying this is these this is a new business model.  It's a different business model. We had Perry Chen co-founder of Kickstarter in and it's the same kind of thing.  It's you allow people to act as a patron for something.  You allow them to remix something.  You change your relationship with them in a way that's not a relationship before us.  And you, Leo, are very good at that. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Amanda is a musician who's achieved some real success.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  She did a raise of one point two million on Kickstarter Kickstarter album and uses Google Plus and uses all of the modern tools.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Speaking of Harlem Shake and YouTube, you have gone to YouTube dot com and search for the Harlem Shake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, I can't believe that wasn't on the change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know. Well, I thought about it.  I didn't know it was like Easter eggs.  I don't know if those count.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not a change, but let's just for those who haven't done Easter egg.  Let's just show them.  You go to YouTube dot com and you guys should do this in Chrome.  I tried an Internet Explorer.  It didn't work.  Yeah. Do the Harlem Shake and is it going to do it?  What? Whoa.  What? Did I type it wrong?  Are you in IE?  I must be in IE.  No, isn't this Chrome?  It's Chrome.  Maybe you need to actually type it, Leo.  Oh, hand by hand.  Yeah, that's a big fucking page.  Do the Harlem Shake.  That's what I'm supposed to type, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe they turned it off.  Am I IE?  Oh, I'm in IE.  You know, Chrome and IE look so much.  Oh, shut up.  Shut up.  Go away now.  So first, the YouTube logo itself shakes back and forth.  And then after the drop, the whole page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The whole page does advance.  So silly.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I guess because I'm just over the Harlem Shake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I was over it before it came out.  Yeah, it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Do you think they show those things to Larry before they put them up?  Oh, that's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why is G to getting brighter and brighter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry, I'm adjusting my settings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is there an asteroid that's breaking up near where you are?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just it's getting brighter here because I'm in San Diego.  So the sun's getting a little lower and I'm sitting in front of a window.  So that should be better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Gina's coming to us from a Russian dashboard cam somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How do you do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

It may not have,  it may not have worked out but give him,  give him the props, you know, he took a risk.  He took a risk.  He did something different.  He failed.  That's okay, you learn from it.  Move on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Next week, let's talk about Google Glass techno panic.  I'm going to write a piece about that, so we'll get to that later.  Okay.  Oh, that'll be a good piece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe by then I will have my Google Glasses.  Really?  No.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  We're all surprised.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo, have you heard anything?  Not a word.  Yeah, me neither.  Did you guys see that Andy Anato switch is switching to Android?  Poor Andy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We talked at length with him on Mac Break Weekly yesterday.  He's now a prostate in the Mac crowd.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have to watch that episode because I have to tell you, some dude switches mobile operating  systems is kind of like...  It's a non-story, right?  You see these switch articles all the time.  But when it's Andy Anato, I mean, my jaw was on the floor yesterday.  He is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can read a three-part article he's published on Tech Hive, too.  He's published on TechHive.com describing what he found were the final elements that  put him over the top.  He and I have always gone back and forth because I switched to Android a long time ago.  What he always said to me is, you know, it's just the fit and finish.  The apps are just not as polished.  The fit and finish.  I said, Andy, you could do so much more with Android.  He said, yeah, but it just doesn't feel as...  Finally, he said, the functionality has finally reached a level and the fit and finish has  improved enough so that the scales have tipped in the favor.  And he has three or four examples, you know, different kinds of keyboards.  He loves Swipe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, he did a great bit on just text entry, right?  That he spends lots of time doing text entry and it's easier on Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The integrated ability to share to anywhere, anytime.  And a new app can always add itself to that share menu, which is...  Apple controls the share menu on and very tightly on iOS.  And in fact, I think it's a subclass of a larger class, which is that Apple locks  companies out of things like text messaging, the dialer and all of that stuff.  Whereas Google and Android allow apps to use it.  And so you get a large variety of much more interesting apps.  For instance, Mighty Text, which allows me to use a Chrome plugin to send text messages via my phone.  Things like that.  You can't write text messages on iOS.  Only Apple can write text messages.  So there's a number of things like that that he says have finally put him over the top.  Techhive.com.  And of course, if you really want some fun, read the comments.  If you really want to get...  But, you know, Andy, to me, I don't...  It is a non-story because any good tech journalist is not...  If they're doing their job is not going to say, well, I will only use iPhones.  You got to use what...  You know, you got to be open-minded and look at what's out there and use the best and talk about the best.  And I don't...  You know, maybe if all he did was write about iPhones, it would be reasonable to just stick with an iPhone.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, he's just someone who was just a big iOS fan for a long time.  Well-known sort of amongst the Mac circles.  He's not...  He hasn't been banned from Mac weekly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, of course not.  But he still uses a Mac.  See, this is what I find interesting is that Apple is not iOS and yet people act like it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, when Andy gets a Chromebook, that'll be the end of days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, he has one.  When he uses it full-time, that'll be the end of days.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, he's a writer.  He probably could live on a Chromebook very easily.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He likes stripped down editors.  That's all he wants.  Although when you see Jason Snell stripped down, it's not as exciting as you thought.  Time Warner Cable says, you know, people don't really want Gigabit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We've done service.  They charge them a fortune for it.  They don't buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  We figured out what the survey was.  Would you pay $10,000 a month for Gigabit Ethernet?  No way.  You see, they don't want Gigabit Ethernet.  Okay.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That full fiber optic Google experiment.  That's a terrible idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Terrible idea.  Google and Microsoft top dominate, in fact, the Forbes billionaire list.  A number of Googlers making their way onto that list now.  Of course, for years dominated by Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, Mark Zuckerberg now, the youngest,  and Moskovitz.  Who's that?  Must be a Googler.  From Facebook.  Oh, Facebook.  Okay.  This is the world's richest people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Bezos beats the Google boys by two billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you know, he owns Amazon outright.  A larger part of it.  A larger part of it.  You know, I was thinking there was another story we had on the rundown this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I forget what it was.  The six strikes?  Everybody misses the real war here.  Everybody thinks it's Apple versus Google.  I don't think it's that at all.  I think it's Google versus Amazon.  Yeah, well, it will be someday.  Google is now starting its own same day delivery service.  You know, everything you go through, that's where the war is.  I'm not sure I want that pixel to come tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Bill Gates, number two, with $67 billion.  Amancio Ortega from Spain.  He owns Zara.  Warren Buffett, number four.  Larry Ellison, number five.  Charles Koch, one of the Koch brothers.  Oh, and there's the other Koch brother right below him, David Koch.  La Ka Shing from Hong Kong, $31 billion.  The Bettencourt family, $30 billion.  You got to go a little ways, the Walton family, to get to some Googles.  Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York.  Boy, that pays well.  He's worth $27 billion.  That's a good job.  Sheldon Adelson.  That's an interesting story.  Shelley, the guy who started CES, then became a casino mogul.  And he's number 15.  More Waltons.  Bezos 19 with $25.2 billion.  Larry Page, $23 billion.  Larry's a little richer, $0.2 billion richer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Isn't that funny?  You think, OK, just a little bit, and you realize that's $200 million.  That's a little teeny wit.  I'll take the difference, please.  That surrounding area between them is $200 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's probably awards for being CEO or something, right?  20 and 21.  One of them might have sold more than the other.  Yeah, or they made different investments or something.  Yeah.  Close enough.  I always like Prince Al Waleed bin Talal al-Saloah al-Sahwa hawa.  Worth $20 billion.  Carl Icahn, $20 billion.  I like this list because it's just you go, wow.  Wow.  Wow.  These are people who are infinitely wealthy.  The man who owns the Mars bar fortune, Forrest Mars Jr., is a candy billionaire.  $17 billion.  All right.  What else?  Six strikes?  Well, I didn't know if you wanted to go down that rat hole.  We've talked a lot about it.  It became law.  Well, not law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What's new here is that the cable companies say what they're actually going to do.  Right.  One of them is going to do nothing.  The other is going to cut you off for some period.  One of them is going to cut you down.  It's all obnoxious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  So the idea is every time you're accused of copyright infringement as a strike, by  the time you get to strike four or five, most of these companies will at least throttle  you.  Some of them will, I think Comcast will throw up a landing page that says until you take  re-education, our re-education course on piracy, you can't get on the internet.  And their attitude is, well, this is better than the three strikes law, which knocked  you off the internet forever.  At least we're not proposing that.  It's ridiculous.  We had Cory Doctor on triangulation last week.  He said, yeah, but nobody forced them to do this.  This is their volunteer.  They're basically bending over for the recording industry.  Yep.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And of course, you can not, it is illegal to unlock a phone, but thanks to petitions  at the White House and several hundred thousand people signed that petition saying it should  be legal.  The White House has responded and says, you're right.  Now they don't have any, they don't have any right or power to change it, but they can  kind of make a statement here.  And I think they did.  Yeah, you're right.  You should be able to unlock your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I went through my closet and I found some really old phones and decided I'd sold a  blackjack here for 25 bucks for 30 bucks on eBay.  Right.  And I say in my listing, it's unlocked.  Well, that one isn't, but something else is.  And eBay slashes up a message right now that says after January 27th, 2013, it is illegal  to sell a phone that was not unlocked by the manufacturer or by the phone company.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's right.  That's the new thing.  Right.  They popped that up just to just to warn you.  You cannot sell that phone.  Although they let you sell it.  They just warn you.  They just say it's your ass.  We're not responsible.  Let's take a break.  Come back with our tip, tool and number of the week.  But I first want to tell you, speaking of phones, did you see that Sprint says now they're  going to let MVNOs take Sprint devices and bring them over?  Companies like Ting.  This is exciting news.  Ting's had bring your own device for a while for a limited number, but I think we're going  to see more and more of these.  Ting is a new mobile phone service that, you know, just they're really trying to do  it better.  You save money with Ting.  Of course, it's really affordable.  You do only pay for what you use.  There are no contracts.  You're month to month, no termination fees, unlimited devices on a single pool plan.  So it's great for a family or small business.  They resell Sprint.  So it is if you have good Sprint coverage where you are, Ting will be a great choice  for you.  You know, a really good example.  In fact, if you go to twig.ting.com, you can just take a look at the calculator, the pricing  calculator, bring your bring your current cell phone bill and enter in what you pay  right now and you'll see how much you'll save.  It starts $6 a month per device.  So, you know, four phones, $24 a month.  Then you add in the text messages, the phone minutes and the bandwidth you want and you'll  see it's an amazingly low price.  But here's the beauty part.  You use less, they rebate it.  Literally, they refund you the money.  You use more, they charge you at the same rate.  There's no penalty for using more data.  Just amazing.  And there's no bundling a ride along services.  There's no overage charges, no penalties.  You get all the things you want, including tethering and hotspotting free, three way  calling, call forwarding, no add on charges, no mysterious line items.  And the account control panel is fantastic.  So you can really see what's going on with your account.  Again, great for business.  Customer support.  Well, it's from Tucaz.  So, you know, it's the best customer support in the world.  You call 855-TING for the win.  TING FDW anytime between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. Eastern.  A real person who's empowered to help you will pick up the phone.  They won't put you on hold.  They'll take care of you.  But they've also got great help at help.ting.com.  Active customer forums, help ticketing system, lots of video tutorials, startup guides and more.  Ting is a great phone service and they help you get started with Ting.  Save twenty five dollars on your first device.  Yeah, they got all the great Android phones, including the Note 2 and all of that Samsung Galaxy S3.  They'll have the S4 as soon as it's available.  I'm sure.  To take twenty five dollars off your first device when you go to Ting.  Twig, I'm sorry, dot ting dot com.  Twig dot ting dot com.  I like the Note 2.  That'd be my pick.  But they have the Optimus G2, which is basically the Nexus 4.  With but with LTE, stuff like that.  Really nice.  Twig dot ting dot com.  We thank them for their support.  Great company, great service.  Reinventing mobile phone service.  Gina Trapani, your tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So my tip this week is a new Android app.  Well, it's actually not new.  It's an update to an Android app that I really love.  I think it was it was many, many episodes ago on the show.  I was saying that I really wanted kind of the Kindle app for podcasts.  So I've got a bunch of devices.  I listen to podcasts a lot.  Listen to podcasts across my devices.  And it would frustrate me when I couldn't remember what episodes I'd listen to and how far in I'd listen to them.  Well, the guys in All About Android, the show that I do on Tuesday nights, Jason and Ron, they convinced me to check out Pocket Cast, which has the brand new version that dropped.  Yeah.  Do you use this?  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.  Pocket Cast for Sinks.  What you've listened to and to what point you've listened to it across your Android devices.  This is awesome.  Right.  Because I listen to podcasts on my you know, my phone on my Nexus seven.  Really, really, really great app.  Love it.  I think I don't know.  I think it's like three bucks or something like that.  Yeah, I just want to say to you.  Yeah, really, really nice design.  Just really well done.  Really well done.  And in fact, just Shifty Jelly, which is the company that makes Pocket Cast for did this great blog post called Why Android First.  They actually released Pocket Cast for on Android First versus iOS because they said that this app has outsold the Android app outsold the iOS app five to one, which is kind of an interesting story.  Not really the story that you hear.  You always hear developers saying that things sell better on on iOS.  So Pocket Cast for absolutely love it.  Check it out.  I think you like podcasts, which you probably do because you're listening to this one.  I'll admit it helps that they included all that Android and right in the front there and a big, big, big picture.  Love it.  Quite a few twit shows actually.  So it should be as it should be as it should be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Pocket Cast for three dollars ninety nine cents at the Play Store.  Play.Google.com.  Mr. Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's see.  I got a smorgasbord here of them.  Give them all of us.  Give them all.  Well, OK, we do two things.  Google versus Apple stock prices at the widest gap since 2005.  Twenty five times earnings for Google, ten times for Apple.  I you know, between that and any Anaco switching to Android.  It's all over for Apple.  It's history.  They're gone.  That's it.  The other interesting number is that 98 percent of Chinese made smartphones run Android and that has the Chinese government going a little baddie.  And but also I think it was Google says we got the last laugh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hmm.  Well, it's no wonder.  I mean, because you can customize it.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, so yeah, in fact, I'm surprised that they sell any iPhones in China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, this is this is a Chinese made Chinese manufactured Chinese market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I see what you're saying.  Well, yeah, there's not going to be any Chinese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, actually, iPhones are Chinese made, but you know what?  Everything's Chinese.  Right. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sold in China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sold in China by Chinese companies.  Chinese companies.  Buy us for us.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  That's it.  You can throw an extra number if you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, Google's cash pile is forty eight billion dollars.  Of course, Apple's is hundred three times that.  Yeah.  But still, forty eight billion dollars is a big cash haul.  They spent what did it say there for Motorola?  Motorola, twelve point four billion for Motorola.  And that's gone so well.  So they got a lot more things they can buy.  Very cool.  Don't know what it will be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What will it be?  Google Glass.  Yeah, this is nice.  You know, if you do Wolfram Alpha, if you do like Google versus Apple, you can you can get a table of the two compared stock price, market cap, revenue.  You can really this is a good way to see the two.  You know, for instance, Apple has seventy two thousand worldwide employees.  Google just fifty three thousand.  Revenue per employee for Apple is two point two million compared to nine hundred thirty one thousand.  Net income shares outstanding annual.  The PDE is a good one.  Yep.  And no dividend for Google owners.  But you can look at fundamentals and then there's a drop down.  You look at ratios, balance sheet.  This is a great way to research companies.  Wolfram Alpha dot com.  Aaron, did you want to throw in a tool or a tip?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've got an app, actually.  I didn't realize that Gina was going to do an app.  So this is a this is a little bit more geeky.  If you hope you get away.  There we go.  Welcome to Star Trek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's an Elkhars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is my Elkhars desktop.  That's not what I'm going to show, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You mean that's your regular desktop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's that's my lock screen.  My lock screen is Elkhars.  So this is an app called DriveDroid.  And basically what this does is you load Linux ISO images, boot disks basically,  onto your Android and then you can plug in your Android via USB to a computer  and boot any of these images.  You just select one.  And so, you know, like usually you're carrying around little USB sticks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You've got five distros on your phone.  Well, these are all important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, you can't go you can't go without at least Fedora Ubuntu pre-BSD and partition magic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know what I'd love to have is a pixel that could boot to free BSD.  That would be nice.  Or Solaris.  Yeah, you could do either of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sure.  I'm sure.  So I have five distros on my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Which would you like to boot?  Yeah, take your pick.  Spin the wheel.  That's really treating the phone as a giant USB.  Exactly. It's like a giant USB drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What it does is it mounts these images so that so that it looks just like a USB disk.  They have to be live drives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they have to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  But it's great for troubleshooting the the I don't know how to sleep.  Sleet as or slide as what is that?  It's only it's basically a really, really slimmed down version of Linux.  It's thirty five meg and it comes with things like G parted so you can fix disk problems and things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So this is now become your fix it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly. So anybody that has a problem like, oh, I got a virus on my windows.  So you got Fedora 18 on there.  What's P magic?  Partition magic.  Oh, I love partitions.  If you have disk problems or anything, it's from the it's.  Is that still around?  I used to use it for years.  Yeah, yeah.  Actually, I'm sorry.  Not partition magic parted magic.  Oh, that's the magic.  So this is the open source version.  Basically does everything that partition magic did, but it uses parted as opposed to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it's an interface to parted basically.  Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a GUI interface.  So yeah, I try to get on there.  Let's show his phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm stealing all the ISOs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, here's the other thing you can do.  Right. So if you don't see what you what's on here, you can just hit the plus button.  You can add other ones.  You can download the image directly.  Drive Droid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yep.  Now, this, of course, takes up space on your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not only does it take up space, but it also requires root.  OK. So that's the caveat.  So you have to be running root.  So that's why I said it's a little bit more geeky.  But, you know, they've got all of these defaults.  Oh yeah, this ain't geeky.  It's not geeky at all. Right.  All of these you can just do straight Debian.  You can do anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So how much space are you using?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So each one of these is about I'd say max about 800 megabytes.  Oh, that's not bad.  So it's not bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But you only have a 32 gig card in there and you can store it on your SD card.  Yeah, you can. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It stores it on the SD card.  It's just the way that it mounts it on the USB when you hook up the cable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So drive droid drive droid need root.  Big deal. Yeah.  You don't have root. I don't know why you're even alive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right. Just use my sentiments. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why wouldn't you have root?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wouldn't.  Does it have to be a drive image or could I have like portable Chrome on there?  It has to be an ISO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It has to. Yeah, it has to be a bootable ISO image.  That's all. That's really the only requirement.  If it's not one that's in the list of ones you can download, you can actually download it yourself and then put it in on the phone.  You can transfer the image over to the directory on the phone and it'll appear in the list.  Very cool. So it's very helpful.  If you're someone that does this all day long, goes around and fixes other people's computers or whatever,  very, very handy to just carry your phone with you, which you have anyway,  as opposed to a bootable hard drive or a USB drive or something.  Installing it right now.  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Check it out.  I guess you could put Ultimate Boot CD for Windows on there. If you have a bootable ISO, yes.  It should work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Now they say in here that not every ISO image will work, but every one that I've tried has worked fine.  The other thing to mention is that you may have trouble with UFI bootable computers.  Some of the comments in Google Plus when I was talking about this mentioned that, oh, I've got a UFI boot.  Yeah, that's always, but that's a problem for everything.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So don't buy those.  Well, by the way, this is one, but don't buy those.  Now there's a paid version and a free version.  Yep.  Ads. It's just ads.  Okay.  Buck 28, worth it.  I'm buying it right now.  Yep.  Installing it right onto this phone right here.  Lots of fun.  Well, thank you so much for joining us on this show.  It's always fun to do this week in Google, even though we talk about everything, sometimes but Google.  Jeff Jarvis is our media guru and the author of, as you probably know now, What Would Google Do?  as seen on TV and his latest, which is Public Parts.  I'm surprised he didn't hold that up.  He's also a professor of journalism to those lucky few at the City University of New York and blogs at BuzzMachine.com.  And I guess I have to say medium.com slash at Jeff Jarvis.  Read the free stuff, the stuff he gives away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I put it on the blog too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, okay. So it doesn't matter.  It's prettier on medium.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know that's mean.  You should just steal their CSS and then you don't need them anymore.  Well, but on BuzzMachine, Jeff gets ad money.  Right. But support Jeff and read it on BuzzMachine.  Regine at smarterware.org. That's where she blogs.  She's also the author of Think Up, a great Twitter analyzation app.  You can find it at thinkup.com.  And thank you, Aaron, for sticking around.  Aaron often is seen, in fact was this morning on Floss Weekly, our open source.  What did you talk about today?  Cake PHP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So really interesting if you're into PHP and you want a simple way to deploy a PHP framework, Cake PHP is the way to go.  They make it really simple and easy.  It's like Rails for PHP.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's exactly it.  Yeah, it's MBC, right? Yeah, I like Cake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Very nice. I love Cake.  But not that kind. I like RingFeld.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's interesting. Their annual event, their conference is called Cake Fest.  I'm there, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Attracts some of the wrong kinds.  Right. I show up with forks.  The Pixel has core boot and not UEFI or BIOS, so that means I'll be able to use the Pixel with this.  There you go.  I'm very interested. I mean, if I could just dual boot it, that would be awesome.  Yeah, exactly. Yep.  Awesome.  And of course, do you still do your other podcast?  I don't really do it anymore.  No, so I won't mention it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, just follow me at Aaron Newcomb.  That's the way to do it.  Google Plus is great. Anywhere else is fine too.
