Transcript:  Coming up on This Week in Google, it's me, Jason Howe, filling in for Leo.  Don't worry, he'll be back next week.  Also joining me, Stacey Higginbotham, Jeff Jarvis, and Ant Pruitt, we talk about how  Facebook is now meta and squirrel.  Also Ant shares his views on the Pixel 6 Pro and specifically about the photo capabilities  of the device.  Zillow is apparently bailing on flipping houses and TikTok seems to know why.  Email celebrates its 50th birthday and is it better to buy or lease electric vehicles?  We try to explain that and so much more next on This Week in Google.

I think maybe either he gets back from Mexico today or tomorrow, but not back in time to  talk about all things Google and let's be real, all things meta, which we're going to  talk about today.  Joining us today, of course, the return of Stacey Higginbotham.  It's great to have you back today, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm glad to be back.  Thanks, Sean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's good to see you.  Welcome back.  We kept the seat warm for you so you can give us all of your thoughts on what Zuckerberg  had to say last week and maybe some Google as well.  I don't know.  Just maybe.  Also joining us, Jeff Jarvis, the Leonard Tao professor for a journalistic innovation  at the Craig.  Do we play the song every time now or do we just...  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In Crowdstrike and that's the concept.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, or we get jumped to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or we can play a random piece of audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.  Stacey hasn't heard this.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know.  I haven't heard it.  That was so awesome.  Okay, I'm so sorry.  Finish your intro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, no.  No, that was done.  It was done.  You need to soak it in, right?  We were all here last week to kind of soak in the barbershop quartet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just... glorious.  It was glorious.  Wasn't that great?  It was great.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Jason, Jason, Jason, just a friendly note here.  You've got a little dirt on your chin.  You might want to wash that off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh yeah, I'll work on that the entire episode.  I'll be reaching up there trying to dust that off and realize, no, it's stuck to my face  forever.  Not forever.  I guess I can shave it off and I probably will at the end of this month.  Also joining us, I'm going to go ahead and deflect and move on from that.  Yeah, I know you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's okay, Shaggy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Swings!  Also joining us, Ant Pruitt.  How's it going, Ant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Unbelievable, sir.  How are you?  All I can say is bless your heart when I look at this beard on your face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Beard.  You said it with air quotes.  I heard the quotes.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As bearded people, we reject you, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know, right?  Look, a boy's got to become a man sometime.  Oh man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can go grab Hardhead, the 10th grade Hardhead and bring him in here and he's got pretty  much what I have on his face and compare him to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm telling you, I knew it was going to be like this.  My dad is the same way and I do think that this is genetics, I would guess anyways.  I guess I don't know that for sure.  My dad, he never grew out the hair on his face because he always told me, oh yeah, nothing  grows.  Then I think my grandpa as well.  This is just a howling gene.  Have you ever tried before?  No, this is my first time ever letting it grow out.  Outside of like, we go camping and for four days I'm not shaving because we're camping  or something.  That's it.  Wow.  So it's an experiment as well as a fundraiser, which I could talk about that later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just apologize.  Yeah, I was like, do you want to explain to people why you're doing this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, you might as well put the plug in.  I might as well go ahead and put it in.  Basically, I'm doing it, if you've ever heard of Movember, it's a way to raise awareness  for men's health and mental health.  So yeah, through the month of November, you let your facial hair grow out however much  or however little you have.  And it's a way to kind of get some attention around the cause, raising funds for these  causes.  So actually, if you go to my Twitter profile, at Jason Howell, my pinned tweet is a link  to it.  But you can also go to Movember.com slash m slash Jason Howell twit.  And yeah, if you want to donate a little to help me get up to my goal, that would be amazing.  But you know, it's really it's a twofold.  It's a two pronged thing that I'm doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's it's more than two hairs, Jason.  You have more than two.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There might be maybe 50, maybe 100 hairs down here.  I'm also very, very proud that my wife has not given me more crap about it than she already  has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So at least there's so Jason, when you do go to the metaverse, will you make your avatar  have a full beard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, that's a good question.  Sometimes when I'm in VR.  Yeah, I do.  I do have a beard.  It's the only way that I can do it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sorry.  That's all right.  I think that's a good segue for where we know we're heading at the very start of this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's remind everybody because last week you said and we all resonated with you.  You said it on Twitter again.  How sick you were of talking about Facebook and here, damn it, we've got to talk about  Facebook again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, which which is partially because I mean, mainly it's because like as I looked  through all the news for this week, it's it's really the only thing that stands out as like  the most notable thing from the last week is the fact that Facebook really kind of rebranded  itself.  There there were hints that it was going to happen.  And ultimately it happened at during the connect event.  Zuckerberg had a whole long spiel, like an hour long talking about the metaverse and  kind of ended things with the with the name change.  Metta is I don't know.  Is this basically the same thing as the Alphabet holding company of Google thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's how I looked at it.  I don't see it as some sort of rebranding.  The way we look at the likes of Federal Express is now FedEx.  I mean, they didn't change a thing.  I believe with them going from Google to Alphabet, people still talk Google this week and Google  whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I've seen the coverage all over now calls it meta.  Yeah, I'm seeing a lot of meta out there.  Whereas you're right.  You're right.  Everybody's Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've still seen seen journalists write Alphabet and things like that when it comes to official  documentation or whatever.  But when it comes to just general discussion, people say Google.  And I don't think this is going to change any in any way for meta versus Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is the metaverse expands.  I mean, right now, Facebook is just Facebook.  We use in the media, they use Instagram and WhatsApp, not interchangeably when we talk  about the apps, but when we talk about Facebook and Facebook's harms, we don't always have  a distinction between the different products.  So meta, the metaverse is a thing, then maybe we will call it meta more often.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You think the metaverse will be a thing?  After watching Zuckerberg, I'm more dubious than ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think his metaverse will be a thing.  I do think we are going to have a real AR experience that then gradually goes into VR.  I think it'll be time consuming.  I think we don't know the kind of apps that will drive us into VR for good.  I don't think gaming is a strong enough pull.  So that'll be interesting.  Virtual work is certainly something that has a strong enough pull to bring us all into  the metaverse.  But in that case, I would look more at what Microsoft announced, was it yesterday, two  days ago, with their version, which is less, will connect various metaverses, which I did  say would happen.  And maybe it's Slack that will deliver your or Zoom that delivers your metaverse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So did you all watch the video?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't see Zuckerberg's ones.  I wasn't interested in it.  I purposely turned it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know that, but I tell you, it's a traffic accident you had to watch.  Oh, really?  It was very awkward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I only watched half of it, but it was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was slack-jawed through the entire thing.  The effort to have these little in-jokes like, gee, what should I wear?  Oh, same thing I always wear.  It's cute, but you could tell you had a staff of 20 writers to come up with that moment.  But it was...  Yeah, I was slack-jawed.  It was amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ms. Stacy, you mentioned what Microsoft is doing and how to try to tie this in from a  corporate standpoint.  My question is, why even have these VR spaces for work?  There's a lot of complaints about just general health and people sitting at desk all the  time and staring at the camera for their virtual meetings and whatnot.  What exactly is the advantage of having a VR meeting to talk about stuff on the TPS  reports?  That's a very good question, Antoine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm so glad you asked it.  I would hope we would get a more sophisticated vision of meetings.  I think we're in the midst of this now with everyone being remote.  As a remote worker since 2004, I can tell you that I have had all kinds of meeting experiences  and some meetings can be a phone call or on a polycom.  Some meetings go great over Zoom.  I think there are things like collaboration and if you think about designing hardware  or even working with someone collaboratively on, I don't know, building a PowerPoint could  be better done in VR.  I don't think every experience should be in VR, especially for work.  I think conferences in VR become more interesting just because it allows you to communicate  and meander around in settings in a slightly less awkward way than some of the current  options that are available to us.  I view VR is not an everyday work thing, especially in the near term, but as a set-aside chunk  of time that you would use for a project, if that makes sense.  I could be really, really, really, really wrong.  We could just be in VR all day and that would be like a freaking nightmare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, God.  That would be horrible.  I thought about that.  Don't get me wrong.  I enjoy my experiences with VR.  They're very much confined to an hour here and an hour there and shared experiences with  my kids.  Spending all day working inside of a metaverse, which is one of the questions that I had out  of this is, do we understand what a metaverse is any better now that Facebook has gone all  in on this?  If it's so far out in the future, why now?  Why is now the time for Facebook to make such a significant dedication or devotion to this  futuristic view?  It does feel like a lot of deflection, right?  There's a lot of people saying this is deflection.  Do you believe that, Jeff?  To an extent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that, yes, I think the timing and the naming and all that seems convenient.  But no, I do think there is sincerity.  It has been for a long time.  I mean, they bought Oculus.  They care about this stuff.  They want to try to prove it's there.  They keep believing in there's some future.  They've got it in their heads.  They did say some things that were actually good, that they understood the necessity of  interoperability and taking your personality and your stuff elsewhere.  And they started talking a little bit about principles, but then they didn't really ever  go there.  This is the time, having learned the lessons they should have learned, which they haven't  learned, this is the time to say, let's talk about what's required here.  And all we get is Facebook with avatars in terms of the impact.  And that's not so good.  So I was disappointed by that.  So no, I think they're sincere.  But I agree with you, Jason.  I still don't understand what the metaverse is, even though Leo explained it to me.  I don't really see, I agree with Stacey that I think that I'm not a gamer.  I really can't get it.  Could I imagine the value in a meeting?  Maybe but I'm not really sure how it beats Zoom and not having to commute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Imagine the show in the metaverse.  So anybody in the audience, like on the Discord or the IRC, or maybe I'll charge people money  to get into the VR version.  I don't know.  So we're all sitting there together and I could actually virtually punch Leo.  Or when we all interrupt each other, I could actually raise my hand.  And because I'd be out of the corner of your eye, you'd see it.  You'd be like, oh crap, I can't interrupt Stacey.  That would be horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  But again, that's entertainment, Miss Stacey.  What?  Is it utility?  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are we entertaining people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not on purpose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.  For us, it's a job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Quasi-information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  But in a meeting, it's the same thing.  Like as someone who is terrified of being an aggressive female, I'm constantly in meetings,  but also someone who's chatty and feels like I'm a know-it-all.  I'm constantly blowing over people to talk about things that I know about in meetings.  And it would be nice to have more social cues.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I look at this is Daniel Suarez's Demon in D Space.  The way he described it, it sort of reminds me of Google Glass, where people were wearing  these little sports goggles or whatever, and it had an HUD in it.  And sure, the way he described it is they had these thicker arms on them, so there's  battery and communication and stuff like that.  But it didn't look intrusive.  It just looked like regular people walking around with sports glasses, even though they  did have this AR overlay.  I think something like that would be awesome to have.  But then there is also some privacy implications because they could look at people's credit  scores or D Space score and things like that.  And you have to worry about all of that.  And then you have to look at the infrastructure.  Who's going to manage all of the infrastructure and battery life?  Are you going to care about battery packs?  And it's a lot tied to it.  This whole metaverse thing, I just don't see it working in day-to-day life, but whatever,  prove me wrong, Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think this is near term.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, this is far out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I feel like what happened here is, you talk to any engineer, especially male engineers  of a certain age, the metaverse is where they freaking grew up, right?  Child of the 80s, 90s.  Hi-fi.  Early...  Yeah, they read about this.  They want...  I don't even want to get into what they want.  I don't know.  But you look at this rich immersion entertainment and it makes sense to a lot of people.  Not everybody, obviously.  I think the older you get and the more ingrained with real people you get, the less something  like this makes sense, right?  So, but I do think we are heading to a richer communication environment.  If that's going to be AR or full VR, I don't know.  I think VR for like entertainment, maybe meetings in the future.  But I do think we are processing so much information through our phones.  I think having a system by which we can process information around us from the world through  glasses is a no-brainer, right?  It's where we are headed.  So if you say, okay, then I need very smart glasses that are portable, that I need better  wireless, that is what we're building, right?  And that's going to be super fast.  And we're going to have to think about what it means to have information about the people  and the places.  How do you display it?  How do you store it?  What do you display to certain people?  What are the ethics of saying my name and age?  You know, to everyone around me, to I don't know.  I mean, all of those things are things we're going to be there and we're going to be there  in like 10 years.  Now, the full metaverse, I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You gave me the first use case that makes sense for me.  The scene you, so I don't do what I just did, which was interrupt.  I was going on.  I could see that.  That's all right.  It's all right.  Right.  And so I need those kinds of things.  But the other thing was, if you want to, if you play that video starting at about three  minutes, 45, I'm curious for your reality check because they never really present what  it's really going to be.  It's some kind of loose thing.  And where there's a whole bunch of stuff going on that I don't think is, I think because  of its lack of by realism, I mean, lack of doable being doable.  It doesn't really present what the vision could be and it makes it harder, I think,  to to develop it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it more like a conceptual viewed like what you would see at a CES when they bring out  all the products?  And it's just a product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know if you can play it or not, but I just went through the tape and if you go

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to about 350, you'll see from the one I have in the rundown.  He's probably pulling it up now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you'll see a mix of real person, 18 Avatar, easy AR person.  And I don't know how you mix those things in.  And and I know I'm getting ahead of myself in terms of the reality, but I think we've  got to speak in realistic terms if we're going to develop anything coming up.  Sorry, Jim, we're saying somewhere around like three, three, three, 45 into that tape.  Yeah, you'll you'll you'll you're in the in the game room scene at the beginning of  the tape.  There you go.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, the Pixar movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Right.  So you got it.  You got a real person.  You got a you got that's Boz.  Then you got a hazy person and then you got an Avatar all mixed in together.  Those two avatars.  Boz.  Right.  And then you then you've got a video feed into it.  Sure.  And you've got an interaction going on.  It's presuming that you're you're you're you're you're tactile.  This is a report of looking at AR art.  And so now they're all flying around it within the metaverse.  But the problem is this is a God's eye view of what it would be.  It's not a me.  Even though I am God, a me.  That's what I'm wondering.  That's what I just don't know.  I don't know how to judge this in reality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Am I accessing this through my desk from my desk chair?  Am I accessing this from the couch?  The bus station?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or does everybody have a dedicated VR room for all this stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have to go through your own room to your own pod to connect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't mean to be literal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just mean to be I want to understand it better.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, so I think easily in video games you can switch a lot of times.  You toggle between a God view and a first person.  Right.  So I feel like you probably could do that in VR if you wanted to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You should be able to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  I would imagine so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you spend time in VR, what you...  I mean, yes, they have to show you the God view or they don't have to,  but it makes sense that they're trying to.  When you spend time in VR, it does feel like you have the view that you normally have as a person  and you can kind of...  You don't feel it.  It's just like you're aware of things out of the corner of your eye that you may have.  And when you make your natural gestures, you get more information.  Right.  So when I'm like, what was that?  I see it.  Right.  So I think it's actually an extra sensory perception if you think about it to be able  to go to God view because then you see everything differently, but I don't know how...  So that's kind of an interesting user interaction kind of thing that you could think about.  If you're in a crowd of people, maybe you want to see the whole thing.  Yeah.  And I'm trying to think of my experience with VR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There was an article, or was it?  It was Washington Post that was kind of making a connection that like  Facebook is...  Meta is not anywhere near the first company to actually do a lot of these things, right?  Roblox is a game that my kids play and granted it's not in VR,  but it's very similar in a lot of ways to what Facebook is talking about.  This ever present avatar that follows you from experience to world to game and all that kind  of stuff, Steam VR, VR chat, also Rec Room.  Rec Room is a game that I played on VR.  I love to play that has a lot of these familiar kind of touch points, I'd say,  from what Zuckerberg was kind of pointing out.  In none of those cases that I've experienced, do you have that actual God view mode that  I've experienced anyways?  Maybe it's possible.  I just haven't experienced that.  It's always the first person kind of experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you want some more humor, sorry, if you want some more humor from this, if you go to 1630,  you see Zuckerberg on the Meta foil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, the hydro foil?  Yeah, the hydro foil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's amusing.  But the thing goes on forever.  The whole thing is an hour and 20.  Yeah.  No, it was a long...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what I kind of found a little bit humorous is it was so long and it was almost  entirely dedicated to the Metaverse and still at the end, I would have a hard time explaining this.  Here's the joke too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's trying to pick his outfit.  Do I need some sunscreen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, his face is covered in the sunscreen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love that he's less robotic in the Metaverse.  I don't know if you'll notice that.  I was like, wow, he is so much more fluid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's almost more human in the Metaverse than he is in real life.  I think what occurred to me by the end is that this idea, like you're right, Stacey,  this is a long-term view, but for the right now, this particular idea seems like a really  like niche market to hit your trillion dollar company to.  Which could end up being Meta slash Facebook being just incredibly forward thinking and  10 years from now we're like, all right, they obviously realized something that we didn't  back then, but it's just...  I don't know.  It's like Facebook decided this juggernaut that we've created, let's do Roblox instead.  It just seems like a really interesting kind of direction to go for me.  It's the Bitcoin of 2021.  VR...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, what was that Ant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it the Bitcoin of 2021?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, I think this is a point of...  What's the word I'm looking for?  Continuation for all of the internet.  I put this in the chat, but I think it's fundamentally true.  We do things on the internet initially.  What drives us, what drives most of the killer apps is sharing and connecting with people.  Facebook, that is literally what they think they do.  They want to connect the whole world and share.  We can argue about how and what and blah, blah, blah, but we are going to have through VR,  you do get a richer connection.  You do get to communicate more with your body, more information comes through.  Think about it as the fidelity of the information that's available to us online has  gotten richer and richer from email and static images to GIFs to FaceTime.  Can you hear my dog yelping?  Is she snores?  I'm sorry.  To the video, to this type of video, Zoom things that we're having.  So it makes sense that we would do that for certain occasions and maybe as it gets lighter,  wait, we'll do it more often.  Nobody, I mean, think how long video calling, AT&T showed the first video phone in like 1960  something and we didn't start doing it until FaceTime.  So I just, like, it's a continuum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a really good point.  These things are not immediate.  It does take a long time for them to make themselves obvious, right?  And it has a certain value.  And yes, and I think that's the other thing.  Major squirrel value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Huge squirrel value.  You know that thing Mark always goes on about meetings?  Let's do something around that.  This is a good time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Seems to work for us.  Maybe it'll work for the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I still think he's going to promote himself to be Metagod and then somebody's  going to be stuck with Facebook.  But I think that could be a good thing.  I think he'll do Larry and Sergey.  I still think that he'll still be.  Yes, he still controls the stock.  Yes, he's still in charge.  No, it doesn't get rid of him for those of you who hate him.  But does it change his roles sufficiently that someone could take responsibility in  a different way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll see.  Yeah, if he still has veto power, I don't think it matters, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but if you look at how Google has advanced since Larry and Sergey went elsewhere,  Leo argues it's gotten duller, but you really don't sense that they had their thumb on it,  that that was them doing the right thing.  And would he?  But I think it's possible that only the hugest issues would then come to him,  as opposed to part of the problem in the whole structure of the company right now  is that so much comes to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And he makes such terrible decisions because I don't know if he's like...  Yeah, I just, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, he'd be pretty tone deaf at times, to say the least.  All right, well, that's our meta block.  I mean, there were other things that happened at Connect, things that they showed off,  VR headsets, Project Cambria and other things, but is there anything that we need to touch  on there before we take a break and move on to other topics?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Project Cambria was like a, what do you call those cars that don't really exist?  They show up to Detroit, they frustrate me because you can't buy them.  The concept car.  It's like a concept car of headsets.  So it doesn't exist yet.  Fine, this is what we're working on.  I think the most interesting part to me was the guy at the end going through the technology  of what they are working on and the discrete elements they have to build.  That was geeky and interesting.  Otherwise, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Agreed.  Agreed.  And scene.  All right, let's take a break.  Then we can hopefully talk about some Google in here.  I knew we had to start off with Facebook, but then we can go in whatever direction we want.  I never imagined that we'd possibly talk about Zillow on this show, but I think it would be  interesting.  That's an amazing story.  Yeah, so we got to talk about Zillow at some point.  Let's take a break and thank the sponsor of this episode of This Week in Google.  And that is Udacity.

We thank Udacity for their support of this week in Google.  Okay, so let's see here.  Well, this is next in the agenda and I might as well just ask you about it now because I  know and during last week's show, was it?  It was during the show that you got delivered your Pixel 6 Pro, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, sir.  Kids showed up right during the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm stuck in Illinois.  I'm so jealous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And here it is.  I got it.  And mine was going to come December 1.  Slippery phone.  It's a slippery phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So do I.  Did you get a case?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I did.  I had the case delivered before the phone because Amazon.  But I'm so glad I did.  This thing is just ridiculously slippery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, no, it really does need a case.  I don't feel comfortable without a case on this phone for sure.  But that's just standard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You went with a clear case too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of course.  I mean, if you're going to put the phone in colors and stuff, what's the point of not showing at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So my recommendation, hold on.  Let's see if I can show you.  This was clear when I got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  After a while.  Start to fade like bleach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you should clean your case or get a new one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I wonder if putting it through the dishwasher would work.  Don't take that blindly.  I'll do it when I'm done with this one and see.  See what happens.  So, okay, so you've had it for a week now, Ant.  What do you think?  And I'm super interested in hearing kind of your thoughts on the camera system, obviously,  because that's your bag.  But what do you think about the phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The phone in general, I think it's totally fine and adequate from a speed standpoint.  That whole fingerprint reader that most people have been fussing about.  Yeah, it's a little worse compared to the other phones I've had and some of the other  phones that are out there, but it still works.  So I don't think it's that much of news or anything.  It's just half a second slower.  And does it really make that much of a difference in your day-to-day life that that fingerprint  reader is half a second slower?  But overall, I think this is a really, really slick piece of hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nice.  And have you put the cameras through any extra effort?  Cases?  Kind of?  Yeah, I have been playing.  That's what I was looking for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have been playing with the cameras.  I still want to play more.  From the video standpoint, I haven't played too much because I was hoping it would have  some sort of capability similar to what Apple has in its cinematic mode.  You're not seeing it there.  So it's just another 4K 60 frames per second camera, whatever.  But having the regular camera versus the telephoto camera on there,  it's been a little bit interesting to me because it doesn't have any type of macro  cap capability or anything like that.  So I wanted to play around.  Let me see if I could share my screen.  I took some photos here recently.  Share my screen to there.  There we go.  Now, this is JPEGs versus the RAW files that you can get with it.  This here is a JPEG file.  When I say JPEG, that means Google, after you snap the image, Google's AI  in process and said, hey, this is what this picture is supposed to look like in the end.  And I took it in fairly, this is in the middle of the day.  This was like at one o'clock, I believe.  1 12 PM.  So there's plenty of light outside, but yet I'm looking at this image and there's a lot of  grain and noise in the background that just doesn't make any sense to me.  I shot it using the telephoto lens.  Excuse me.  I know you were saying that you had issues going from the regular lens to the telephoto lens.  Like it just kept sort of skipping and jumping back and forth.  I haven't had that problem.  I haven't had that problem.  It just sort of locks in for me.  Once I hit zoom, the detail on this is not great, but it ain't horrible either.  But it just shows that whatever the AI processing on this image is sort of hit or miss,  because this is what the raw looks like.  As you can see up here in the upper left, it says DNG.  So that's a raw file.  That's no processing.  That's just what I did with my own camera controls and just hit the shutter.  And this looks much better.  From a photography standpoint, this is a lot more flexible to work with and dial in the  settings and make it look better, changing exposure and stuff like that.  There's plenty of data to play with and you get nice dynamic range and things like that.  Unfortunately, most regular people don't care about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or do they really understand why they would use it?  Oh, the files are bigger.  I can store less photos on my phone.  They're just not going to get the picture out of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's going to take some work to be able to pull this out and make it work for your Facebook  or your Instagram or your Twitter or whatever.  But from a photographer's standpoint, yeah, this is pretty good.  I enjoyed the flexibility.  I can even go in and just change the color of this green stem to be more of an older,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  dead, dying flower.  You've really brought me down now, Ant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're killing off the lovely flowers.  But if I want to make it vibrant, I can make it even more vibrant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There we go.  I'm feeling better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the file has plenty of data to work with.  But again, that's not something the regular person is going to care about.  Now, this one, this is another raw file and this one looks pretty good right out the gate.  I didn't save the JPEG, but the JPEG came out looking just as good as this one.  I don't really have to touch it.  But again, this is plenty of light outside with this smaller sensor  than a regular camera and it's going to look pretty good.  Next, I wanted to take a look at the actual zoom capabilities.  This is that tree way off in the distance over here in this scene.  Okay.  The zoom capability, I find you need to stop at about 9x.  You go more than that, you start to lose detail and it starts to look really, really fuzzy.  And this is raw, as it says up here in the upper left.  But this is just, I don't think that's usable.  I can play around with the exposure and make it look a little bit better.  But from a detail standpoint, no, it's just gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And do you encounter digital zoom that is, in your estimation, usable?  Because I feel like anytime there's a digital zoom, I just, my eyes see the crunch and I'm like,  I'm done.  I'm like, I'm not going to go.  Yeah.  So that's why an optical zoom for me is like essential.  I need an optical zoom because I want to be able to zoom  and I don't want to have to settle for that crunchiness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is so hard to find good zoom.  Like I said, I think the threshold is at about 9x on this phone.  Don't go any higher than that.  I actually have some pictures on Instagram.  If I could switch that screen.  There we go.  I set up a macro shot and I set up three different scenes.  So this is using the 1x zoom.  Okay.  And then that's the 4x optical.  And this is the 9x.  And this looks really good for 9x.  And even if I wanted to crop in, I got plenty of detail that are cropped in with 9x.  And then if I wanted to do some post-processing, I could bring it out even more.  So again, I think the sweet spot for this phone is to stop at about 9x or so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  And that 9x is probably going to work better on an object like that.  That's relatively close to you to begin with versus a 9x on a tree.  That's off in the distance.  Right.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because that was so much closer so you could get much better focus on it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now this is Kylo.  And again, this is a JPEG that we're showing on the screen.  Shot this in a less ideal situation here in the studio where it is a little dark  because I want to control lighting.  Shot it where he was backlit.  So that's a challenge for the camera.  And this one, it came out okay.  It was able to give us some details.  In his face versus the RAW file.  Catch my breath.  Versus the RAW file.  This is what it normally would look like.  His face is really, really dark because it was backlit and the camera didn't really  know what to do.  And if I wanted to play with it more, I can because it's got all of the data here to play with  and make it look good.  Sorry, I hate stairs in my house.  You're right.  It's what this one's going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, Ant, you should add some cardio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I hate cardio.  But getting back to that, the setup to get that macro shot, something that's critical  is being able to have a tripod or something like this here.  This is a little glyph.  Yeah.  It's called a Studio Neek glyph.  I definitely needed to have that locked down because when you zoom in,  you get a lot of micro shakes in your camera and it's just going to make it blurry.  So I was able to lock it down on the tripod and take those shots.  Let me see.  There we go.  This is what the setup looked like.  And I just stood up there and just tapped the screen to set the zoom to be able to get  whatever zoom I wanted to use.  And of course, I'm using light that I can control.  But again, these are scenarios that regular people aren't really going to worry about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No.  Most people are not going through this trouble to snap a shot.  It's not for morals.  They're just carrying that phone.  No, absolutely not.  But nice to know that the camera hardware is capable of creating good shots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's still daggum capable if you have all of the tools around it.  And then lastly, I wanted to show more of a somewhat real world experience with it.  Granted, I did have one of my lights there in the garage to shoot this, but this is a JPEG.  This is what Google says.  Hey, this is what our picture is supposed to look like.  Not raw.  Notice the skin tone.  We talked about they were doing a big push for real time for real tone for people of color.  This one looks, it's still a little bit green because if you look over here in this histogram  in the upper right corner, you can see there's a little bit of green pushing through there.  Even if I go to select my white balance, the white balance is going to say the same thing  and it gets rid of that green.  And this is more so what the skin is supposed to look like.  But now, yes, as you said, it's blown out.  Just need to dial back that exposure just a little bit.  But detail wise, this is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, your wife is going to hate you.  My God.  This is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is great.  She's seen this picture, but this is coming from a phone and I could shoot this for anybody  to present to their family as a portrait or what have you because it's really, really good quality.  And if I wanted to do some retouching on it or whatever, yeah, I can do that.  Let's see, I can get rid of that little mark right here on her skin.  That's gone.  It's a little blemish there.  That's gone.  And boom, we're good to go.  But this is all straight out of a smart phone.  Yeah, pretty awesome.  Google knocked it out the park.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, there's the verdict.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There you go.  Does it take phone calls?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It takes spam phone calls.  Who wants to do that, Stacey?  It takes spam phone calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's all I ever see.  It takes them and you don't answer them because it warrants you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do appreciate Google for that.  I'm always like, who are these people joking about their car warranty?  I've never had one of those on my Pixel.  I shouldn't have said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So then Stacey and Jeff, you both have them en route at this point, right?  When's yours arriving, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Any moment?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's pending because it's stuck in freaking someplace, Iowa, St. Corso, Illinois.  Yeah, so as of October 27th, it stopped moving and it's just sitting there.  Oh, no.  Interesting.  I'm real sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So mine, I was going to get it, I think late October, there was a 128.  I didn't want that.  I wanted the 256, so I reordered.  So then it was December 1.  Then four days ago, it was suddenly December 23, 24.  Now it's November 17, 18.  Oh, okay.  You can track my mood as a result.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, right.  Today's a good day.  Today's a bad day.  Yeah, this is all very much fluctuating.  Google actually has warned about this, the fact that there's going to be,  it's high demand.  There's all sorts of issues happening with shipping and keeping it in stock and  long delivery times and everything.  So if you bought the 6 Pro, and I think the warning was specifically about the 6 Pro and  not the regular 6.  I didn't get the Pro.  So you're on the regular 6.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm on the regular 6 and mine has it shipped on the 27th from Carroll Stream, Illinois,  and that is where it is.  Where they all come from, right.  Yeah.  So it's like Ingram Micro.  Is it an Ingram Micro plant that's there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They made the shipping label.  I don't know that it really shipped.  Not until you see that thing.  Well, they say it's actually shipped.  I know, but no, I've learned that lesson once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, usually FedEx, like in the FedEx thing, it's usually pretty good about like,  do we have the label or where are we?  But yeah.  It's a lie.  It's a lie, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I hate to tell you.  It's a global conspiracy.  It was supposed to be here today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, that's a bummer.  That's disappointing.  Hopefully you get surprised.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was like, oh, I can't wait to, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Open it on the show.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I have a question for y'all.  So as part, and anyone, this is, oh, this is things you can,  instead of convincing Leo to buy something, you can convince me to take something free.  So, you know, the Pixel Buds A series, they're like, hey, you get them for free.  Do you want to redeem it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got them.  Just get them.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I know, but I'm very much against buying things I don't need or want.  I know I'm not buying it.  I like the sound better than your Jabras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's more elegant design.  It's more comfortable.  I prefer them.  Yes.  Yeah, they're quite serviceable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  And I know that Jeff, a while back, I think it was on Twitter where you and I had the back and  forth that I may have convinced you to buy that the A series.  And then afterwards I was like, okay, well, I hope his experience is as good as mine has been.  No, I'm still mad at you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm mad at you for two reasons now.  One is it does have the occasional dropout, which when it happens, I say, Jason.  But not as many, not as often.  Very rare.  It's very rare.  I will say that.  Okay, good.  But number two, now I have two sets of them because the other one just comes with the phone.  Now there's nothing I could have done about that, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you can't blame me for that one.  I'm still blaming you, Jason.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've not experienced the dropouts with these that I have experienced with some other ones.  But what I am experiencing, I believe, is more of an Android 12 problem where Bluetooth just  toggles off randomly, just it's off.  And I'm listening to an audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'm having all kinds of Android 12 issues.  Well, that's not true.  I just had, my biggest one was it took me forever and I had to finally Google it to  figure out how to find my pulling up to all of my apps because I don't have them all in my  various screens.  So the full app view, they changed it.  So instead, if you're looking, if you're on Android 12 and you're pulling up from the  bottom like you normally do, that just gives you the windows that you have open to mess with.  But so you have to pull up kind of from the middle as opposed to from the bottom to get  your own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  From the very, very bottom.  You're right.  You're right.  If your thumb starts on that gesture pill or whatever you want to call it at the bottom,  that's going to do a different action.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do it all the time.  And I just, I was like, I'm flipping it.  I'm like, huh, flip it again.  I'm like, they must have changed something.  And then I'm like, you should have seen me.  I was like a frustrated monkey just jabbing at my phone, trying to figure out which other,  you know, I was like, this way, this way, this way, gestures.  It was less outful until I just was like, okay, I'm just going to have to look this up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, it's interesting that you mentioned that because last night on all about Android,  Ron told the story.  His sister had the same experience.  I can actually show it off if anybody's interested in seeing it.  So you've got the little gesture pill down at the bottom.  If you swipe up from there, what it's meant to do is if you swipe up and hold,  that gives you access to your recent apps.  But if you're kind of in this middle area, you do it.  It gives you access to your apps.  But one thing that it will do is if you do it a couple of times, trying to get it from there,  then it'll give you that little hint.  It'll be like, oh no, do it up here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, this is how you use this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, see, and you don't have to use the little pill.  I mean, like anywhere along the bottom, it works.  Sorry, let me rephrase that.  Anywhere along the bottom, it pulls up all of your open windows.  It's like, what is that on hot corners on your back?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Anyway.  Oh, right.  All right.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  Anyway, the point is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you all use tempered glass on your phones?  Or do you just use a regular screen protector, one of the flimsy, scratch resistant screen?  I don't use a screen protector at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't have a screen protector on this.  In general, if it ships with one, I keep it on.  If it ships with one, I keep it on, but I never think to buy one and put it on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Interesting.  So you've never shattered a screen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've shattered one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've dropped phones.  I've dropped phones, but mostly the case...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I always have to have a case on my phone so it doesn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I have a case on mine and that protects the edges and things like that.  I just don't want to chip the screen.  I've seen too many people walking around here in public with these charred...  Jaky screen.  Yeah, they're just chipped and their thumbs are bleeding.  That could have been prevented if you had put a screen protector on there.  The problem though is when I got the phone, the tempered glass wasn't quite available on Amazon  for this particular model.  So I temporarily had a 6 tempered glass on here and I finally got the 6 Pro version to put on here.  But it isn't quite ready for the fingerprint reader on there.  A lot of them, if you look on Amazon for it, it'll say,  hey, this is not going to work with your fingerprint reader just yet.  But some are starting to pop up in there now.  I just ordered one last night that said it's supposed to work with the fingerprint reader.  I won't know until next week when it gets here, but that's something for people to consider.  Even though it says it's not going to work, I can still set up the fingerprint profile in here.  But when I lock the phone and try to unlock it with the fingerprint, it won't do it,  which makes no sense to me.  How could I even set up the fingerprint profile, but not be able to unlock the phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can make the key, but you can't fit it in the door.  It's so weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's so weird.  And then I also thought, well, maybe I should try the little pattern thing on there just to  see what that's like.  So I haven't done a pattern in forever.  And that didn't work either.  I could create it, but I couldn't get back into the phone, which meant I'm stuck.  So I had to do a factory reset from the bootloader to get back into my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  These are all great reasons why I don't have one on my screen.  It has nothing to do with any of that, but it sounds like I should maybe take that warning  and not put one on for now.  Yeah.  I never...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  ScooterX just says in the chat that there's a setting in the touch  preferences for screen protector.  I'll look for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There might be a sensitivity slider.  Sometimes they...  I remember that from Android 10 or Android 11.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Didn't think about it now though.  Yeah.  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I need to change my color scheme because...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  So you're now on Android 12 and you didn't have Android 12 before, right?  You weren't doing the beta.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wasn't doing the beta because...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, it's fine.  Anytime something changes, you're automatically like, ah!  Do I love the clock?  It looks better, but I'm like, is it more legible?  No.  I still hate that my stuff looks pink.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everything feels less legible and because I have a picture of a quokka on my phone...  Oh yeah.  Yours is all pink.  Mine is all diarrhea brown.  I hate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We call that on the show.  We call that baby couldn't help it brown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's right.  That was last week.  That's what everything...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I'm like...  So I either have to change my picture or have to go in and figure out how to change the colors,  but I kind of resent.  I'm like, that is so like...  What is that?  That was like when I was in high school and you would change your Microsoft...  Was it Microsoft?  What was it?  You would go in and custom scheme every...  Anyway, the point is...  Yeah, yeah.  Those custom skins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Totally.  I remember doing that with Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would spend lots of time like, well, it looks good with turquoise.  This speaks to my aesthetic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  Right.  That's so me.  Right?  And this is called Material U, which makes the impression and Google has signaled as  much that this is all about customizing to you.  But there have been a lot of people that have pointed out like, actually,  the previous version of Android allowed me to do more customization than what this is allowing  me to do.  So it's kind of an interesting...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I assumed if I figured it out how to do it, it would tell me, look at that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you can't...  You're not getting the color, but it's really gross.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I just did this green sensitivity setting on here and it still does not  recognize my fingerprint with this screen protector on.  So I have to wait to get the new screen protector and try it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Basically, do you find that the finger thing works?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, totally.  I actually tweeted about that this weekend because I noticed a lot of reviews and a lot  of people complaining about the fingerprint sensor.  I'm like, you know, my experience has not been bad with it.  Maybe a little bit better with the 6 that I'm using right now than the 6 Pro that  Leo has, but that could be just how I set it up because they both have the same sensor.  So it's not like one has a different type of sensor than the other.  But no, I'm able to get into my phone almost every time with my fingerprint.  I don't know if it's...  When you're training it, if there's a better way to train it than others,  because I've certainly had phones that no matter how I trained my finger on the sensor,  every single time I went to unlock my phone, I had to do my tap two or three times before  I got in.  And that's super annoying.  I am not getting that experience with the 6 right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't have that experience with it just not working when I didn't have the screen  protection on.  It worked.  You know, it was just...  I definitely could tell it was slower than previous phones, but it worked.  And even that slower is just that much slower.  You know, it wasn't terrible.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  So yeah, you know, it could just come down to the fact that everybody uses their phone  a little differently.  I don't know that it's any worse than, you know, other fingerprint sensors out there.  My preference is not an in-display sensor.  I think that they're less reliable, less effective in general versus a hardware sensor.  I like the rear device touch sensor that we've had on all the Pixels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're here, Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I agree with him.  Give me that one on the back.  It just felt more natural because your hands are already sort of right there.  Yeah, it's right there.  There's some tactile aspects.  It's more sexy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's more integrated.  It makes the back of the phone look sleeker because it doesn't have a big old hole in  the middle of it or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, this is part of that whole like...  There's more than one design aesthetic, y'all.  We do not all have to look like the sleek future blobs from the Apple's anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sorry.  Having said that, I like the design of the Pixel 6.  It's okay.  When Leo gets back...  The fingerprint sensors in the front is fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When Leo gets back, would you prefer the Pro or the 6?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and that's an interesting question because I have actually really enjoyed the smaller 6.  I don't know that I would have expected that.  Prior to the 6 Pro, I was using the 5, which is way smaller, which felt super small when  I started finally using it.  It took me a while to switch over from the 4 XL to the 5.  When I did, it was like, wow, this is a tiny phone.  This is going to take some getting used to.  And then I got used to it.  And then the 6 Pro comes.  It's like back to gigantic phone.  And now that I've been using the 6 for the last week, I would totally stay with the 6  if it had that telephoto lens.  I just, I know me and the cameras on my phone and I want slash need that hardware,  optical lens for telephoto.  It's just, it's a lens that I use all the time.  And so that's kind of worth it for me to use the 6 Pro.  But I would prefer the 6 if I had my choice.  If the 6 had that, I would be fine sticking with it.  I think that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Six form factor, but the 6 Pro hardware is what you're saying, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I suppose so, which kind of speaks to the fact that Google used to give different  sizes with similar, with the same hardware between both.  And now they're kind of doing the trend where the smaller one is less capable and the larger  one is more capable, is even more premium than the premium phone.  That's a little smaller and which is kind of a bummer.  It would be nice if both phones had all the bells and whistles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But having used both, do you think the price difference is justified?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, good question.  I think no question the better value pick when the dust settles is the 6.  The 6 Pro is nice, but you're paying $300 extra for a handful of features that, I don't know,  are they worth the $300 extra?  That's a lot.  You know, that's a considerable bump up.  And so I would probably recommend the 6 Pro.  Did you say bump?  Bump?  Bump?  Bump?  Bump?  Bump?  Bump?  Bump?  Bump?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Bump?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sort of reminds me of Canon with its R6 versus the R5 last year.  I had both of those cameras in hand and shared images from both of them of the same shot.  And both of them look really dag gum good, but one did not look $1,500 better than the other one.  It just didn't.  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's often the case.  When you go up to the premium thing, you're...  As someone who buys a lot of premium stuff, it's kind of like whiskey.  After about the 12 to 15 year period, going up is kind of gimmicky.  You got the complexity you need.  Right.  Says I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Going up is bragging rights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's so true.  All right.  Thanks for letting me show those pictures off.  Yeah.  That was awesome, man.  It was so informative and fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Totally.  Great.  Love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I still want to shoot some more and I've been playing with some stuff out in landscape  scenarios and stuff like that.  I want to shoot some street photography with it, head over to Santa Rosa and just walk around town  and do a little street photography with it and see how it performs out there.  Just regular day to day life because that's what most people are going to use these  camera phones for.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No question.  Next week, Leo returns to this show.  I can almost guarantee you, maybe not, but I imagine he's going to show some of his photos  from the 6 Pro from being in Mexico at a very cool time, being there for the Day of the Dead  and everything.  He probably got some pretty awesome shots.  I don't know if it's his plan to show it next week, but I'm telling you so that you can  remind him so that maybe he'll show you some of those shots because that would be a really  good example of what you're talking about.  Having the right camera for the right experience and what are the pictures that you get out of  that.  Yeah, I'm curious to see what he's got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Someone asked me, I can't remember if it was in our Discord or just on social, but someone  asked, okay, this 6 Pro has this telephoto lens on it.  Can I go to the ball game and take pictures of it?  Take pictures of the game with that telephoto lens.  I think the way these telephoto lenses are being marketed to people is they assume  they can do that.  No, you can't.  It's still a tiny half inch sensor and you're trying to zoom in on a football player or  basketball player or a race car going by.  It's not going to look good.  It's just not.  You need a lens on a camera body that's got a larger sensor and much better optics on  that lens.  If you're trying to do some zooming like that.  Right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As a journalist, when I was working for places that had photographers but still sent us out,  they're like, look, zoom with your feet.  Don't try to do anything else.  Just zoom with your feet.  And I'm like, okay.  That's smart.  Yeah, very true.  It's probably the best.  I'm by no means a photographer, so that was probably the best advice they could have  given us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Bend those knees and walk slowly.  It's like a panning shot.  If you're recording video, I guess.  Let's take a break and then we will come back and we will talk about more.  Maybe when we come back, we can talk about Zillow and there's so much more in there to  touch on.  But first, let's take a moment and thank the sponsor of this episode.

And we thank Andela for their support of this week in Google.  All right, so let's talk a little bit about Zillow, which is not a topic I thought would  come up on this show.  But hey, here we are.  Zillow is apparently ending its home buying business, which is a business that it from my  understanding, I hadn't been following this until this this news broke, but it's kind  of interesting.  They were buying up properties all over the country or the world.  I'm not really quite sure, but they were using their AI system to help them to identify  properties that they could buy, basically fix and flip, right?  Buy up the properties, flip it.  Yes, they would make a profit, but Zillow would really earn a 5% convenience fee on  the deal that came out of that.  And they're now saying that they're getting out of that.  They're going to end up losing somewhere in the realm of $500 million in the process.  They're selling off the properties that they do have.  Serves them right.  Their AI miscalculated on both sides of the equation, both on what is a good price to  buy and then what is the potential of the future sale.  It's just so volatile and so unpredictable that apparently their systems did not work  in this case.  They pitched 7,000 of their homes to institutional investors.  And I thought this was interesting.  I think maybe you place this in here, Jeff, but I had read a little bit about this too,  that there were some TikTok videos that were kind of trying to understand exactly what  this whole Zillow thing was.  And you posted this in here, so maybe you can give it an explanation.  But it's an interesting theory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I didn't realize TikTok was doing this.  And what shocks me about it is that it's a tremendous conflict of interest because TikTok  is the service that people use now, as much as anything, to find out the value of homes.  So they can, and that's something that they make up out of the air based on cops,  but they can adjust that one way or the other.  And then they can have an impact on the market, the market, their buying and their participant.  So that's pretty yucky.  So there's a guy who's been a real estate agent for 11 years who put up a video saying,  here's what could go wrong with this for the market.  So I don't know if you want to play a little bit of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's pretty interesting.  And if we can't play it, it's just that Twitter link that's below the story line 42, John.  But I mean, yeah, if we can't play it, I mean, it's essentially, he's talking about Zillow,  finding a whole group of properties in a particular region, a particular area,  buying them all up, selling.  Let's say they buy them for 300,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, right.  Here it is. This guy does a good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The company that everybody used.  Everybody used, everybody knew up to look for houses.  And everybody goes on there and searches for houses when they're bored and stuff.  And so that company, they just sit back and they just collect all the data.  They just know what zip code is looking at what zip code and how much those people can afford.  Everyone's looking at this one zip code.  Everybody seems to be able to afford this certain amount.  And let's say that billion dollar company uses that information to go into that zip code  and start purchasing houses.  Because the people that are selling their houses, even though they sell it for a little bit less  sometimes than what the home could actually be worth.  And they pay these high fees to this billion dollar company.  It's a convenience factor.  So this company is scooping up houses less than what they actually could cost.  And let's say that that company, excuse me, Canute, that company buys 30 homes within a  two mile radius.  And let's say the price is 300,000.  So they buy all of these homes for 300,000.  And then on the 31st home, they buy it for 340, even though they know all of the, all of the  comps, because most people have to get a loan.  If you get a loan, you have to get an appraisal, which means the appraiser is going to look at  what homes have sold in the area for that size and that price per square foot.  So they're paying cash.  They don't need an appraisal.  Why would they pay 340 for this 31st home?  Whatever they've only paid 300 for these others.  Well, what that just did is create a new comp.  So when they go to sell these other 30 homes, that extra $40,000 that you could say this one sold  for 340 just made them 1.2 million off that one neighbor.  Because they know from their research how much people can afford in that.  Power the comp.  Weird.  And let's say that then they're going to come in.  They bought that home at 340 that still needs work.  So they're going to come in and do the good old paint, spackle, and change the carpet and call  it a remodel.  So now we can sell them for 360.  Because we know off of our data, that's how much people can't afford.  Wouldn't that be weird if a company did that?  And then say that this company also starts letting you use their own lenders and their  own title escrow company and makes you write your contract on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's awesome.  It goes on and on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's really well explained, I thought.  Yeah, super well explained.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's exactly what happened with the Libor scandal back in 2012 or so.  Which is, hey, we have insider knowledge.  We're going to use that to set up a basic comp price.  And then we're going to benefit off of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Repeat.  Oh, so such a scheme.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They did it badly.  They're like Trump owning a casino.  Only he could lose money owning a casino.  And so they owned ends of the market and they had AI to know what was going on and they  screwed it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was obviously not working for them.  They're getting out.  So this TikTok video, it's brilliantly laid out.  Is that exactly what's happening here though?  Or is that just his theory?  Well, there's two things happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're in trouble from the TikTok video did influence people to look at what they're  doing, but their AI also, because of the current craziness in the housing market, suddenly  they're like, oh, we did not account for this in the outcome.  Open door.  Is it open door?  Is that the there's another real estate company that just did the same thing because they  were like, oh crikey.  Yes.  They just had to lay off people and yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It affects people's lives in their houses.  Their stock fell from 105 last Friday to 65 today.  Yeah.  Couldn't happen to a nicer scam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I heard a little bit about this a handful of months ago from some people back East,  especially in the Atlanta area, in those suburbs there.  People were-  That is a popular place.  ... getting offers.  Institutions.  People were getting offers on their home and everybody was basically trying to encourage  each other to push back, say, don't take the offer.  This is how people of color are losing the ability of owning homes because it's not like  a lot of us own homes anyway.  You own a home, stop just giving it away and just sort of selling out.  That was the big push that I heard about it.  It was all from Zillow coming in writing big checks and everybody saying, no, don't take  the check.  That's all I heard about it back then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not just Zillow.  There's actually a lot of private equity firms are now there's company called  Homes of America, America Homes and then Invitation Homes.  Those are-  Yeah, Invitation Homes.  That was the other one.  Yeah.  They come in and buy single-family starter homes as an investment.  What they're trying to do is basically generate a portfolio of consistent revenue generation,  like monthly revenue generation from the rent payments plus they own the underlying asset.  From there, they can securitize it or do whatever they want.  That's what's happening.  Zillow, that's a slightly different thing, but a lot of people it correlated as the same, but  those people will continue to own the homes as an asset.  Whereas the Zillow people are trying to make money on the commissions and  kind of flip the homes for the most part.  I don't think they're seeking to own the homes over the long term.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just flip it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Either way, both are a tool for gentrification and both are-  Right. Oh, yeah.  Helping push the cost of single-family,  affordable, like starter style homes up in markets.  The Atlantic did a good look at it where they were like, this isn't so bad because they looked at  the absolute number of homes that were being purchased, but they didn't look at the type of  homes. It's a very controversial thing, I would say, especially as we're seeing kind of a  home shortage. As Ant mentioned, it is a tool for gentrification.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In Charlotte, there was within the last 10 years, there was a couple of different  neighborhoods that I can remember looking at that was considered the hood, in their quotes.  But now you go there, you better have a couple million in the bank if you want to live there  because people went in and bought up those hood-tastic homes or single-family homes and  destroyed them and pushed everybody out of that area. It doesn't look the same as it did 10 years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Bithyrmic Mansions.  Yep.  Yeah. Yeah, indeed.  Yeah, indeed. Wow. Then I'm curious what happens when, so let's say Zillow moves into a  neighborhood and buys up all these homes and then starts creating the new comps by selling them for  way more and does this with the entire neighborhood. I mean, that was a manufactured inflation of the  price at a wide scale that covers a large geographic area. Once Zillow is done, does that ever come back  down to earth or does it stay up there? Has Zillow driven it up permanently?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's the 2008 financial crisis in Las Vegas or Phoenix. Eventually, I mean, right now,  I would be interested to see if anyone in Vegas or Phoenix is your home back above water.  That was caused by cheap financing, but this is basically caused by overinflated valuations,  which could lead to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think there's got to be an investigation too.  Absolutely.  You want to investigate an algorithm? Investigate that is to say the output of it.  Were there any patterns once they went into this business? Was there any pattern of actual sale  versus Zillow price comp? Because it's not just a comp. That's not the issue. The comp is the actual  sale of a nearby house, but Zillow, of course, gives you a projected price of your house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was going to say they've got the stockpile and they're saying,  and this stockpile is actually worth this, not this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They could do two things. One is they could undercut the price if they're in the market to buy  and they could say, well, no, your house is only worth 280, but that's it. Right? Or they can  inflate it when they're in the market to sell because they can get off both ends of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hold on though, because what happens is when you do, unless this is all cash,  so if this is all cash and you're buying a house with cash, go you. But if you're going to seek a  loan, what will happen is this actually happened to us here. The person who's giving you your loan  is going to come in and send out their own person to value the house and do an estimate. And then  if that estimate is not in line, then you can't get financing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. But what I'm saying, Stacey, is you could have an impact on the actual sales  by people's impressions one way or the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Most people know that those estimates are whatever, pretty inflated.  I mean, you talk to anybody about their value of the, you know, oh, Zillow doesn't have it.  It's either too high. Your TCAT or your county assessor has it too high and they usually have  it too low and, you know, whatever. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anyway, fascinating story. Who would have thought that we'd have an AI  ethical tech regulation story out of Zillow?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. Didn't see that coming there.  Very interesting. Did you know that Google's forced two factor authentication switchovers  starting to happen? They had mentioned that it was going to happen by the end of 2021.  They had estimated around 150 million accounts were going to be auto enrolled in two factor  authentication. But now apparently there are a lot of reports coming through saying it's happening  People are getting notified and when they get notified, they have seven days before the switch  takes place. If they haven't set up an authenticator link with an app on their phone by then or  set up SMS code authentication, it automatically activates via Google's own two step verification.  And that's the one where it gives you the prompt on the phone on another device or whatever to say,  Hey, are you logging in over here? So that would be the method that would be used. But  it's beginning. Do we foresee any major issues?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sitting here thinking about this news and either everybody here in the Pruitt household is  already on 2FA or it hasn't rolled out to them yet. I'm leaning more towards B.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Probably not. I mean, 150 million is not very many.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I haven't heard someone say, what is this on my phone? Wait a minute, I can't get into my account

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  anymore. Yeah, I only know that my daughter's doing something on her computer when she comes  down after she's like, Mom, my computer won't turn on anymore. I just downloaded this OS up.  I'm like, Oh, no.  Jeff, I just want to go back because this has not been really widely reported, but it's ties to your  tech ethics, which is worth noting. And it's actually pretty cool. This week, I was slow to  get it because I couldn't remember the acronym for the agency, but the US Equal Employment  Opportunity Commission, the EEOC, they're actually launching an initiative to ensure that AI  used in hiring and employment decision complies with federal civil rights laws.  So this is kind of, I mean, you could argue that in the home world, I guess, Fannie Mae or Freddie  Mack could kind of look at Zillow, but this is actually a chance to actually regulate  the hiring practices that may choose people named Keith over people named Dwayne or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. And the thing you do in that case is you're not regulating the AI, you're regulating its  output, which is a more sensible way to go. You're going to audit what it does, which is  perfectly sensible to do and see what bias is built in. And it's also going to, but the interesting  thing is, Stacey, I think it also, because of the data sets that are used in hiring,  it also puts a spotlight on the actual hiring that feeds the AI, which is also necessary.  So having the data set of hiring and knowing what those trends are, you go after hiring managers and  you see what's going on out there. And then when you replicate that bias in your AI, yes, you want  to go out for that as well. You want to go out for both real life and AI. Yes. And they, their

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  efforts, so this is, hopefully this is what other enforcement at this level will start to look like,  but what they're doing, it's not quite as deep as you would like it to be. I'll just tell you that  right now. They're going to, they got to do their working group. They're going to listen to the whole  public and people are going to be like, this is the issue. That's actually important in this,  because as long as they listen to everybody, it's important to know what to look for. Like how is  bias, especially when you're blind to it, because you're a bunch of white old bin.  And then they're going to figure out, you know, what's it, then they're going to look at the  impact. So that's the thing. And they're going to look also not just for bad ones, but good ones.  So they can identify promising efforts there and promulgate those and then try to issue technical  guidance to any organization that asks for it based on what they've identified. So I think that's  actually pretty good. I just, I was really excited because this is the first effort of this kind to  come from the federal government, even though we've been talking about needing stuff like this  forever. So it's small landmark that nobody noticed in tech and AI ethics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Good. Yeah. I didn't see it either. And I was trying to search it, you know, so that I could  add it to the- Oh, I put it on 139 for you. No, no, no, no, it's okay. But speaking to your point,  I tried to search it just through Google and it took me, it took me some deeper-  Yeah, no one covered this.  Deeper Google food to actually locate it. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. It's line 129 for you. I tried to help you out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Got it. No, I appreciate that. Thank you. Thank you. But I think it-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was like, I know you're spinning your plates like that. I can picture you going,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh my God, where the hell, where the hell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know, but I would have the time to be talking while I'm locating a cell to put the order of the  story that that came at what time and everything. We make it happen. What else? Emails 50 years old?  Did you celebrate emails 50 year birthday?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By throwing my computer up in the building.  Deleting all my emails.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes. How do you celebrate exactly? Do you delete all your emails or do you create more emails?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I hate to get, cause there, you know, there's, I don't want to get into it because poor,  poor Maznik had to go through this. There's one guy, I don't want to say his name,  who claims that he invented email and goes after anybody who says somebody else did.  So I go in there. I don't want to get sued by him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I found in my inbox, so I made my first email, but I had my first email account when I was  like in at home, but my college email account was my first, like one for me, not part of my dad's  CompuServe account, right? Or Prodigy, we had both. And I went in and I found one of my college  emails that I apparently had forwarded to my Gmail account when I transitioned from whatever to  whatever or whatever. And oh my God, I used to like write these soulful, like 19th century  letter style emails. Remember when you would write to your friends via like using email?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. I can't think of-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was a replacement for a letter. It literally was a replacement for a letter in the beginning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. Yeah. And I'm like,  when was the last time I sent a multi-paragraph email that wasn't like a formal memo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We've come a long way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You say that and I swear, I feel like I'm the only person on the planet to still use this email.  From a personal standpoint, people are accessible through social media and that's great.  But it can only go so far on social media in my experience. There are some things that  are personal I don't want to put out there and I tend to tell people, hey, either call me,  they know who they are, or shoot me an email and we can chit chat and whatnot. And when I say email,  it's almost like I could see the deer in headlights and reaction from them. Because  it's like email? What is email? Oh, that's where I send spam. Right. Got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, I said people like the last heartfelt email I sent was to one of my  friends about a year ago when their father passed. And it was just to sum up, it was basically in  lieu of a card because Lord only knows her physical address, but just reminiscing about her dad.  Yeah, it felt personal, but that was a special occasion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you all know people beyond your PR list and work list that actually check their email regularly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  See? Like if I send an email to this or that person,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  check it and do something about it are two very different questions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Good point. My daughter doesn't check her email, except she has a personal email  and she has a school email. She checks her school email every day by, and they actually put a  timeframe, like no assignments after eight. So that's good because she checks it at eight  o'clock. That's nice. Never again. In her personal email, she checks like maybe once a week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow. Wow. I'm in my inbox every day and I finally got it down to the inbox zero. Oh, oh, oh, oh,  no, I hate you. No, I finally got it down, but I still check it every day for just for random  messages from people that I haven't talked to in a while. And it's nice when I see those,  but yeah, most of the time it's a bunch of spam and other gibberish in there.  I don't care about it. I still check it every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I check my email every day, but well, I check my personal email daily and my work email  it's just always up. But I literally have no personal emails. I have a woman who's  checking up on an appointment who's a real person, but everything else is crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. I'm that guy who basically says to myself,  third time, maybe I'll pay attention to it, but a lot of times it's just, I don't know what it is  and if it's important enough, they'll come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or it'll become your email as a journalist.  You'll send it three times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I can't, students and deans, I've got to pay attention to students. I would pay attention  to, but when I screw up that, I feel very embarrassed. But other than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But this is when Facebook comes back into the picture because people would much rather you  communicate through Facebook for those personal chats now, instead of sending something to-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I think that's the key, personal chat. When I think of communicating with my friends,  yeah, it used to be long soliloquy slash letters on email and now it is chats. Like any of my  distant friends who don't live in the area, close friends or whatever, I'm probably messaging with  them via, pick your chat client, I've got a folder full of them, but it's no longer sitting down and

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  writing a paragraph. Well, because you're afraid of what's going to come back. It's like a boomerang  problem. They're going to send it back to me. And I think it's become a rule of life that every  possible communications platform will get overloaded and then useless. We don't answer our  phones anymore. We don't want to email anymore. We dread having Slack messages.  People find our text and it's too much. Leave me alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a lot.  Do you think there's more anxiety with email versus those messaging apps, Mr. Jarvis,  especially when you have the people that's on the iOS platform versus the Android platform,  you have what is it? The green bubble versus the-  The second-class citizen.  Yeah.  Right.  Right. You don't have any of that with email. Let's just type it up and send it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a brilliant guy named Bob Wyman who used to be at Google who instructed me one day. And he  said the problem with email, Jeff, is from the very- he said, I can point to an email broken  the very first day when they said to make it sender controlled. And we've talked about this in relation  to Google Plus. Because Google Plus put on extra layers of receiver control, which for a while made  it much better and nice. But I think that sender controlled is going to get spammed and it's going  to become useless. But we can still-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We don't like senders.  Sign up for different newsletters and things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, newsletters. Oh my God. Who would actually sign up for a newsletter? More email?  Jeff.  I have a hard time.  Shut your face.  Wait a minute. I make a joke. I do sign up for newsletters, but there's a limited number,  right? And you go to the ones that are valuable like Stacey's. Benedict Evans-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't have to go to mine. I know I'm not in your worldview.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You actually are. But there's a limited number. There's a finite number. And now the Atlantic  just hired another eight people to write newsletters. The newsletter overdose is going  to hit hard. It's hitting hard. And the ones that matter, I'll subscribe to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff. I think is one of those matters of there's a time and place for email. That is, if there's  something going on between me and my coworkers at Twitter, I'm going to send it in email. If there's  something going on with the schools and the students and whatnot, I'd rather have that in  email just for the timestamps in the paper trail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That is true. There is something to be said for the fact that when you send an email,  it's easier to refer to. I find it's easier to refer to that paper trail later if I need  to refer to something versus random chats here and there that might get lost.  It's much more organized.  Yeah. Way easier to find things. See, 50 years later, you're still all right, email.  Just we figured out what you're all right for.  I'm not getting rid of it.  I wonder who still uses pine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow. I've never used it, but I did hear about pine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. We're a little young for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Craig Newmark used to use pine since I've known him. He doesn't anymore, but he used to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What differentiates pine?  It's a command structure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, okay. Okay. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was like, it's pulped wood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's actually, actually, did you know, Stacey, that before pulped wood,  paper was all made from fabric so that they would advertise to get the ladies to please recycle  the underwear and the hankies and rags because they were needed.  And there were countries that declared rags a strategic national asset and you weren't  allowed to exploit export rags. Get me going and see what happens.  So you still haven't mentioned the story.  Poor Jason's looking for a story.  Let's squirrel them. Squirrel drivers get fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're like a shark in water, Jeff. You go in there, you never know what you're going to  come out of the water with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Used underwear and paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, hey, Jeff, I thought you might find this interesting. Waymo cars are coming  to New York City. Are you excited?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, actually I am. It's another way to die.  Another way to die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's one way to look at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I never take cabs in New York City because it's way slower than the subway.  So I can't imagine that's going to be very useful.  But tourists will like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sure. Sure. Those funny looking cars with the thing on top.  Any, before we go into the change log, any of these other stories in here? I feel like  we've done a whole show. We've talked about a very small handful of stories, which is not to say it's  been bad at all. It's been a lot of fun. But I feel like there's some news in here that we haven't  talked about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wanted to get Mr. Jarvis's take on Google being back in Spain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm curious about that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the story here, folks, is that is the Spain...  Germany had what you know, all you long time watchers of the show know was the  Leistungsschutzrecht.  And that was the ancillary copyright that was going to try to restrict Google from quoting  from news without paying. Didn't quite work out that way.  Because it allowed negotiation and Google said, we're not going to link to you. You want us to  link to you, give us permission and we'll link to you. And that's what happened.  Spain replicated it, but said no negotiation.  You got to pay to link. And Google said, no, we don't. Goodbye, Spain.  Arrivederci. Is that what you say in Spain?  No.  Au revoir.  No, you don't say that.  So they said goodbye, Spain.  And so they said, adios.  And so they left and the news publishers, cut off your nose just by your face,  were hurt by it. They all lost traffic, but Spain was being stubborn about it.  Then the EU came along and created its version of the Leistungsschutzrecht.  I just love saying it every time I can. And it allows negotiation. So Spain,  because it's in the EU, just adopted 15 and 17 articles of the new EU copyright law.  And thus, because negotiation is allowed, Google just announced, we're coming back, Spain.  Buenos dias.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So they did announce their plan is to return.  Last night.  Yes, they have a...  I started to feel like we're still up for debate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I didn't see the follow-up.  Great.  So they said, we're in. And I suspect the web summit was this week. God knows why  anyone would go to a place with 40,000 people. But I suspect it was timed to that. So Google  would come in on a triumphant horse saying, we return.  We're back.  We're back.  Meanwhile, Australia is being stupid. And it's trying to tell Google to unbundle search from  Android, which is just like, can you do a little history here about the EU and Microsoft and the  browser? But fine, whatever. They'll feel like they're big and important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And indeed.  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a lot of stuff. But you're right. The things that stood up were Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If Gina were here, we'd talk about the return of Wave from Microsoft.  Right? They have a Wave competitor. Or it looks like it anyways. I didn't put the story in here,  but when I was looking through it, what is it called? Microsoft Loop.  And just kind of put a little smile on my face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's live collaboration. It's Wave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. It really looks a lot like it too.  Looks like it could have been the evolution of it anyways.  All right. Well, barring any other stories.  One other actually story. One other story.  Yeah. Yeah. Go for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which was that Hertz announced they were buying thousands of Teslas.  Tesla stock went up.  100,000 cars. Tesla stock went skyrocketing.  Musk became wildly richer than he already was.  But then Musk came around and said, no, no, no, no.  We didn't do any deal. They're paying the same rate that consumers pay because his, number one,  his supply chain is slowed up so he doesn't want to act like he can't sell the car to  consumers because they're all going to Hertz. Number one. Number two. What I didn't realize  is that car manufacturers don't want to admit selling cars to the rental companies  because it's a gross deal and it reduces the brand. So here you have Hertz saying 100,000  and people say, no good. This will make electric cars really popular. That's great.  Then Musk being the usual fart at the dinner party comes in in his way and says, uh-uh.  So who knows what's true here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah. Yeah. So Hertz said they were going to offer 100,000 Teslas by the end of 2022.  And Elon Musk was like, no, we don't have a deal. And people, they do get upset partially  because a lot of people have pre-ordered their freaking Teslas and probably are like, hello,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you have some of my money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. So car manufacturers selling to the rental services that cheapens their brand.  Is that what you're saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. A couple of reasons. One is because there's a lot, you know, I'm in the  national Emerald club or whatever it is where you can go and pick your cars.  There's a lot of brands you never ever see there because it's too plebeian to be picked that way.  A, B, the models they order are always stripped down and the manufacturer of a higher end car  would rather have you see the super duper car with all the stuff. And so they don't want to be  exposed. Got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay. Elon Musk didn't even put cup holders in the back seat of his first freaking Teslas.  So let's talk about the strip down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. By the way, I mean to ask you, Stacey, um, when a lot of people do, more people do  subscribe to your newsletter, just to spite me, from what I've joked before. And you're rich.  I tell you rich. Would you buy, are you looking to replace your phones? Are you looking to  replace your Tesla? How long does that Tesla last for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, let's see. We got it in 2015, September of 2015. Given what's going on in the world,  I don't foresee me replacing it for another year or two. Um, just because that doesn't make  economic sense. And then my daughter is 15, so she'll start driving, but we're not going to get  her a car until she leaves for college, if she even needs one for college. Because we both work

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  from home. Would you get a Tesla or would you say there's a, you'd be looking at other, because

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  there's so many other electrical choices out there. I would a hundred percent get an electric car.  Teslas are super fun to drive still, but there are other fun cars to drive that are electric. So  my options are much, I mean, when I bought my car, I wanted an electric and I wanted it to be  as fun as possible. Like I, and Tesla was just a blew me away based on the two other cars that  were available at the time. So I would definitely look at it. I've, I've liked it. I probably  wouldn't buy my car anymore though. If I bought an electric car, it probably lease it. It doesn't  make sense to buy based on the kind of technology that's in cars now. And the soft, it's now that  it's just a shelter. Yeah. It really ages out so quickly. Yeah. We just got, I mean, I just  replaced my, my 3G modem in my car with a 4G modem, but you know, I can't, I can't upgrade  to all the cool software features, like autopilot features that, and people assume that that's the  other thing when you're driving people like, okay, I backed it to someone accidentally at  the grocery store. And like, I was like, your car is designed to not let you do that. I was like,  okay, actually my car is not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Assumptions. Yeah, right. That's, that's a really interesting point that I had not considered is  that cars prior to electric were, cars now really are more and more, they're computers,  you know, with wheels and, you know, legacy vehicles that lasted, you know, decades, you know,  if you're, if you're, if you're nice to them. Yeah. I just hadn't considered the fact that it  may have made more sense to buy outright older kind of style vehicles, but these newer style  vehicles with the need to upgrade and the way, and the parts that get upgraded, like I've never  considered lease before. I've always thought like a lease was kind of throwing money away.  We are definitely in the realm of considering, because we just got solar on the house. We got  it with an electric vehicle in mind. So, you know, we want to be able to charge it here.  So, I mean, we're within, I'd say a couple of years of getting an electric vehicle to replace  one of ours. And I don't know that we had even considered leasing, but that's, that's a really

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  interesting, I'll have to look into that. Leave it to me to do this. We had, we had a Saab 9000  back in the, oh, those were the days, which we loved. We adored that car. And so then decided  to get another one and lease. And I wanted, I negotiated like hell to make sure that I get a  longer lease because I loved this car and GM had taken over Saab and it was crap and I was stuck  with it. I could not get rid of the car for four years. So you are, you know, you do have a lease,  you give up a little control with the lease too. Right. Yeah. Right. Yeah, you do. I mean, there's,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  there's pros and cons, but like, we always bought used cars. I even bought a used Tesla, right?  Because the car depreciates so much coming off. So it still depreciates so much driving off the lot.  And yet for resale, barring the pandemic. So this is a weird time because you can resell your car  really well, actually. Yeah. You know, the depreciation value of, you know, a five-year-old  computer is tremendous compared to huge buying it new or buying just a even two-year-old computer.  Right. So that, that's one issue. There was something else about cars that I was trying

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  to think of, but I can't. They go fast. I don't know. I don't know what your other thing was, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They do go fast. Oh, insurance companies, they're so expensive to repair. So as we turn them into  computers, they're becoming so much more expensive to repair and insurance on them rises, but also  the ability to total a perfectly fine working car is crazy now. You could have, you know,  with all the sensors and a mirror plus a bumper that could total a new car. I mean, it just,  they're not an asset that retains its value like they used to. That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  More and more each day, I sort of wish I had a motorcycle or a scooter, but it wouldn't,  it wouldn't be ideal for me to have a scooter to go back and forth from the scoot here to the studio,  but just putting around the neighborhood or whatever, the scooter would totally work.  Sometimes I don't want to drive my car, especially when I look out and see that it's almost $5 a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  gallon for petrol. It's just, it kills. Petrol? Petrol? Where are you from? Petrol. Petrol?  I was wondering if anyone would catch that. Because I'm not supposed to say gas, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're acting posh. I just found out recently what that meant. Posh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Posh. I think what you actually need to get instead of a motorcycle is what Matthew Ingram  last week's guest had as his, the Jetson One. That's what you need to get, the ultralight

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  flying car. It's a four engine personal helicopter. Oh, nice. You don't need a license

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to fly it. A drone car. It's a drone car, basically. $92,000. Do we need to do the change

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  log? Yeah, we need to do the change log. Should we do that now? Sorry. Let's do it. No,  I just was like, where are we? It wasn't your fault, Ant. No, it wasn't your fault at all.  This show goes where it goes and right now it's going to the change log. The Google change log.  All right. We got some stories in the change log, starting with Google Fi, apparently about to get  encrypted and end encrypted phone calls between two Android phones on Fi. Both users need to be  on Fi in order for the phone calls to be encrypted. Spies will Fi. There you go. Yes. Fi for spies.  Kind of has a nice ring. That could be a promotion that they do at some point.  All right. There we go for that. Okay. Android 12 beta program. Oh, that's right. Sorry. I'm  getting ahead of myself. November security update is rolling out to Pixel devices. That includes  the Pixel 6 and the Pixel 6 Pro. It addresses some deals or some issues with the phone.  The thing to remember here is that if you are enrolled for the beta program for Android 12,  you're not going to get the November update. You need to unenroll yourself and you'll get that  November security update. The reason that you have to do it this time and you didn't before is because  of the Android 12 L update that we talked about last week. The beta for that is going to start  next month. The idea is if you stay signed up for the beta, next month you'll start to get the Android  12 L beta releases until that's released. If you unenroll, then you'll be on the regular Android  12 track and you'll get the security patches starting with the November one that just came out.  It should be noted that Pixel 3, I think, is almost at the end of its life as far as updates  are concerned. It was only supposed to get updates until October 2021, that three years of updates,  but it still got Android 12. In some ways, you can consider yourself getting an extra update than  it probably was supposed to. You're going to get one final update sometime in Q1, but keep that in  mind if you have the Pixel 3. You're not going to get any more security updates after the last one  in Q1. Let's see here. There is a Google Chrome update, I guess, that is coming out. I feel like  there's Chrome updates coming out all the time to fix zero days. Steve Gibson was actually just  talking about this yesterday. I was on security now with Steve and he was talking all about just  the insane amount of zero days that Chrome has been seeing week after week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Every time there's one of these, GD Forbes says, this is why you must delete Chrome.  All these media places trying to tell you why you should delete something because something  went wrong for a day. ZDNet has fallen into this trap. Forbes is bad at this. I'm being driven nuts  by the former press. It's now become nothing but click-bait land. It's awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Indeed. Look for that update. Just always look for a Google Chrome update. It's probably  fixing something. It's probably a good idea to get it regardless, but apparently there's some  zero-day tax that it's fixing there as well. This is interesting. Chromecast. If you remember with  Chromecast and you have something playing, maybe you're casting to a TV or whatever, when you use  the volume buttons on your phone, it would change the volume that the Chromecast is playing back at.  Well, apparently those volume controls have been disabled on Android 12. More and more people  were complaining about this thinking that it's a bug. It turns out it's not a bug. Google has  needed to disable this functionality because it's citing a legal issue, essentially. They  wouldn't really elaborate on exactly what it is. This article, 9to5Google,  questions if maybe it has something to do with patents by Sonos. There's a lawsuit that's been  underway since early last year. Maybe it has something to do with that. Google has said  they're working on a fix. They've got a solution for this and it'll come back, probably included  in the next version of Android 12, which is going to be 12L. In the meantime, your volume

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  buttons aren't going to work on your Chromecast. Actually, I think it might be the spinal tap has  the patent there. You can't go to 11 unless you get their approval. Well, at least let us turn it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  up to 10 then. Exactly. No one needs 11. No one needs 11. Let's see here. Assistant smart displays.  I don't have one of these, so I've never run into this, but apparently you used to be able to make  all sorts of calls on it and now it's going to be limited to just your contacts. I don't know if  this has to do with dialing wrong numbers or something. Is this something that you've used?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could actually call restaurants and stuff to see if they were open or something.  Yeah, which would be useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Super useful. I hope they're not getting rid of that. If it's your contacts, that makes it seem  like you probably wouldn't be able to do that. Who puts the restaurant in their contacts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because you can always ask Google for the restaurant. You didn't need to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That new Indian place moved down the street. I should add that to my contacts so I can call  it through my Nest Hub. No one's going to do that. Actually, I have our local Mexican food place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Same here. I have two contacts for restaurants and I don't use those smart devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's different than what I'm saying though. What I'm saying is if there's a new place  that moved in downtown, I'm not going to add them to my contacts just to call them into Nest Hub.  Oh, okay. I was like-  But if it's a place you love, absolutely, I've done that too, yes.  Gotcha. Gotcha. That'll be first in line.  Yeah. Right. I got this offer in the mail, Google One users in four countries now have the offer to  get a free second gen Nest Hub if you upgrade to their two terabyte annual plan. That's the 99,  it's $100 a year for that plan. You would save 17% compared to paying $10 every month. That would  ultimately make the Nest Hub free if you did that. Oh, and this is part of Google's, let us give you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  stuff to sign up for our recurring revenue services. Totally. Totally. Also, let us have

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  the stuff that we give you be conduits in your home to more of our stuff. Here's the Nest Hub,  and now suddenly there's that lock-in. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And eventually they're going to launch a subscription for sleep and wellness from that  thing because that's the Nest Hub that does the solely sensory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, that's right. That's right. Yeah. I've got the 200 gig plan of Google One, so it's like  three bucks a month. So this would be a step up. I don't know that I necessarily need

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  two terabytes of Google Cloud Storage, right? It does if you shoot those raw images. Good Lord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have two terabytes. You do. So I wonder if you, is this only for upgrades? Oh, must be only for  upgrading upgrades. Yeah. I don't know why they do it otherwise. And then finally, Jacquard, if you  remember Jacquard from years ago, Google I.O., it was the technology that was embedded into the  fabric, showed off on Levi's jackets and stuff. And apparently the Jacquard SDK is going to be  released by Google so that devs can make their own smart fabric apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can buy the Levi's Jacquard jacket. You can also buy a backpack from, is it Marc Jacobs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Samsonite. Samsonite. No, St. Lawrence and Samsonite both have backpacks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay. I was like, someone fancy, Saint Laurent and Samsonite. Yeah. So those are real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh yeah. Yeah. You too could create apps for three things that exist in this world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think IKEA, so I think IKEA should make a couch with Jacquard fabric on the armrests.  So you can, as long as you can turn up the volume, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it's been disabled. I feel like that was one of the use cases or one of the examples that they  showed off at Google I.O. I specifically remember that. I feel like maybe it was.  Or maybe people were just wishing for it, but I do remember that,  talking about that and going, actually that would be pretty useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But imagine if you bought your couch, expecting it and then Google for legal issues had to turn

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it off. Oh, just took it away. Wouldn't that part of the couch kind of get dirty over time too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because you're always like- Oh my God, it'd be so filthy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it would be kind of gross. Yeah. That's why it would have to be a denim couch because denim,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it's okay if it gets dirty. You know what you could do? You could do the, you know how like  old people's couches have like slip covers over the things. You could put it in a slip cover and  then you could upgrade it over time and keep your couch. You could put a screen there with your TV

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  guide, just to size for the couch there. There you go. George's father on Seinfeld.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It would be like a screen protector for your couch.  That's exactly what it would be.  All right. That's the Google change log. We're at the end of that section. There we go.  Settle the Horns.  All right. We're going to get to tips, tricks and things and stuff. We've got all that coming up  next.

And we thank Cashfly for their  support of This Week in Google. All right, so let's do tips, tricks and things. And Stacey,  you're back. So we'll take yours first. What you got?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay. I am telling you about the flick, flick, flick, flick, the flick twist. Sorry. What's it  called? Y'all are probably familiar. And this is a Kickstarter. It won't ship till January. Just  get all that out of the way. But it is a legit company shortcut lapse that makes it.  So you should actually expect to receive this in a reasonable amount of time. So flick makes some  really awesome smart buttons. They're nice. They're Bluetooth based and they have a hub,  the flick hub that extends that beyond Bluetooth range and your smartphone. And you can use it to

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  control so many things in your house. Why is there a blood splattering with the thermostat thing?  Back up. What are you talking about? That video has blood splattering in a schtick about a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  thermostat. What's going on here? Oh, you know, it's just Halloween. Yeah, who knows? Yeah,  it's spooky. Okay. The twist is the variation. I'm like, I don't know, Jeff. Okay, I'm sorry,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  but I couldn't figure it out. But it did confuse me, Stacey. Okay, well, I watched the video like

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a week and a half ago. I don't know. Halloween. Oh, you're right. The very first frame. It's like

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  the twist and it's a blood splatter on the floor. It's a good question. What's his name on Showtime?  I'll go ahead and back you up, Jeff. That's a questionable first frame for your product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is. What is this possibly going to have to do? They're killing something. That's a strange  thing to start things off with. It is. I'm not nuts here. What's the Dexter? So somehow doing  the IoT of Dexter on IoT. It's not making any sense. So I just didn't get it. Thank you very  much, Jason, for showing up. Stacey's still irritated with me because she's getting hungrier  and she wants to go. I am hungry. Jason mentioned pudding, so I'm ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The proof is in. Okay. The flick twist is a variation on the button. You've got 14 options  of things to do because you've added instead of just a short press and a long press. Now you have  twists. You have 12 twists. I think the big challenge that we're going to see with this device,  which does look admittedly pretty cool, is the fact that there are 14 things you can do. I can't  imagine remembering all 14 of them, but they're working on that. Anyway, I do think it's neat.  It's 79 euros for early birds. That's about 92 bucks for this one thing. I would imagine putting  two in your home if you were in love with this concept for a master switch upstairs and downstairs.  But I could also see it on my... You can use it to control apps too. So I could use it on my desk to  control all my lights for my video setup or other things. I don't know if I'd have full 14,  but I'd have a lot. I could turn the thermostat down for my desk. Oh, now I want one for my desk.  But if you get this, it is still Bluetooth. So be aware that you'll need the hub if you want it to  work outside of the range of your smartphone or the device that it's supposed to be working with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that is the information about that. I love buttons and I love the flick buttons.  So I am right up here in the target market for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And how do you feel about twisty buttons?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love twisty buttons. Well, it depends. Do they click? The saddest thing about the Nest  and their cheaper redesigns is they did away with the physical click. And I was like,  oh, I know it's cheaper, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, there's something satisfying. Yeah, indeed. The flick twist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The clicky twist. So I don't know if this is clickies or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, hard to know. You mentioned the Nest. It kind of has a Nest thermostat quality to it,  kind of look to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's bigger than the buttons. The buttons are small. They're like this big.  But I wish I had a button running around to show you, but I think Anna has it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  41 days to go. If you want to back this and get it, who knows when? You can.  There you go. It's on Kickstarter. Cool. Jeff, what's your stuff or your number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to do disgusting food things, things that will bother you with food.  Number one is line 149. I'm jealous of this as hell. Somebody had a Taco Bell wedding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They could have had Beef Wellington and they chose Taco Bell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A Taco Bell. And the best thing is they made a bouquet for them out of saucepacks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hope they got paid so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, so then I went looking into this because of course this would fascinate me. I'm already  married so I can't do it again. But nor do I want to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You could get remarried. You could do Renew Your Vows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Renew Your Vows at Taco Bell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I will certainly not do this. So if you go to the pictures there on that story, you can see  that instead of eating a cake together, they're eating a taco together over the sauce packet  centerpiece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They didn't even do the churros or the cinetwists? What the hell do they call their churros?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They did the taco because it's a taco place. It's Taco Bell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know, but Taco Bell has the cinetwist things. Someone in the chat, please help me. What are  those called?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Churros. Yes, cinetwists. That's what they were called.  Well, anyway, so there are these beautiful sauce packet things.  I'm hassling you, Jeff.  Or, you gotta believe me now, I guess, if we go to the next line down, it turns out it's  the thing and there's a company that offers Taco Bell weddings. And they have their own  kind of little chapel there. And if you scroll down there as well, now that we're there,  you're going to see that they offer you Taco Bell Wedding Swag and the sauce packet bouquet  and the sauce packet bow tie and Taco Bell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Taco 12 pack on your way out of the chapel. This is unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then there's three weddings below that.  There's three testimonials.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are six whole weddings here? Is that what you're telling us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was going to say there's three testimonials from the three couples who have ever done this.  This is nuts.  What?  Hey, you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the sauce pack. I'd be with. All right, so that's one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Before you move on, before you move on though, would the bouquet toss just be really careful  that bouquet is made out of Taco Bell sauce packets. It gets too rough. That Taco Bell  sauce is going everywhere. And I don't know if that's a good or a bad thing. I guess it depends  on how much you love Taco Bell. But anyway, it's just a warning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They have a Taco Bell sauce pack garter.  You can throw that too.  All right. Now we have online 152. Are we going to play this video or not?  Because it's going to ruin if we can't play 152. It's a TikTok. Is that possible?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think so. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know what atrocity to food. It's mac and cheese. Okay. Well, that's that's the line above.  The line below has the actual video. 139 152 has the actual video. What's got what's having to it?  So look at this. They put in a slab of cheese, macaroni, cream, pepper, cheese,  and then they bake it. But it gets worse. They get it out and then you smush up the slab of cheese  with all the macaroni. That's kind of disgusting enough. And then they put raisins on there.  What? No raisins. That's the atrocity. Who would do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, everybody in TikTok is baking cheese. The baked core sand, baked feta, baked this.  Yeah, they're all doing that part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The audio is sounding a little weird. It almost sounds like Leo's running Linux on his machine.  I mean, it actually does sound like exactly that. I was just working on the best of,  and that's in the best of. So I got reacquainted with that clip.  Let's go to terminal.  Yeah, switch terminal. That was disgusting. Putting raisins in your mac and cheese. I've  never heard of that before and I can't imagine that tastes good. I do not believe anyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My wife thinks that raisins are a conspiracy on their own. They're only meant to hide in foods  and surprise you in unpleasant ways. I, on the other hand, like raisins and I get scones.  And she thinks I'm insane. She thinks raisins are gross.  Raisins are okay. Raisins are good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're okay. Well, raisins are fine on their own, but when they're like,  they just spoil baked goods like little pellets.  See, I could like my wife.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, I can understand that. Although raisins that could be found inside of like a trail mix,  like with nuts and M&Ms. If there's also raisins in there, totally game. I totally get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But Stacy, a raisin scone.  That look on her face.  Hey, you know what I have for breakfast every day since the pandemic started? I have dry raisin.  I don't like raisin. Who would put milk and cereal and make it all soggy? That never made  any sense to me. Raisin bran. Dry raisin bran. I eat bran flakes every now and then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what? Have your cat showy pepe. That sounds like punishment, Jeff. Good Lord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's torture. Yeah, that doesn't sound delicious. Although I do remember,  it's been a long time since I've had raisin bran. I do remember raisin bran was very susceptible to

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  getting really mushy with milk. So yeah, it makes no sense. Why would you? I don't get  putting in the milk and making it mushy. Why would you eat raisin bran?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Makes it palatable. Yeah. I think that's where I ended up.  It's not how can I continue to eat raisin bran? It's like, I don't like it with milk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's nothing. Now it's okay. There's so many delicious breakfast foods out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It says I'm out. I'm out. I don't need it anymore. I don't need you raisin bran.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And what you got? Well, my pick, man, Floss Weekly. That's my first one. Floss Weekly.  These last couple of weeks, these episodes have been just tremendous with Doc Searles and the  rest of the Floss Weekly host. Today, he sat with Paula Hunter of Moduloop and they talked about  just the state of financial inclusion and transfer of money from banks to countries that are  developing countries and the use of cryptocurrency and the difficulties between  changing currency from this one to that one. And you got feature phones involved. Everybody  don't have the best and latest and greatest smartphone and all the challenges that comes  along with that. And it was just pretty, just really interesting. And they're going to do  another discussion similar to that next week with another person from Moduloop. So it's  pretty good stuff. And Doc and Sean were the host for this week's show, but next week,  I can't remember who's on, but it's Doc and somebody. But yeah, Floss Weekly, twit.tv slash  floss. Nice. And then my other pick is Andre Mack. He used to have a YouTube channel,  but I don't think he's uploaded it uploaded to it for quite a while now, but he's a part of Bon  Appetit. And I don't know how you all feel about Bon Appetit, but their YouTube channel is pretty  good. And he's a Somali. I can never pronounce that properly. But basically it talks about wine.  And what I dig about him is he looks like me. He's a black dude and he's introducing wine  and talking about the nuance of it. Because being in Sonoma County, I need to learn about wine.  And especially if I get to hang out with Lisa Laporte, I need to know about wine because man,  she knows her wine. And it's been fascinating to try to learn more. And he's been quite helpful.  I'm still trying to get my palate to be as defined as his and figure out the differences  between different wines. And I'm getting there. I'm better with whiskey, but wine has been a bit  more challenging, but it's also been fun. You've had practice with whiskey. Before you

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  moved to the Bay Area, were you much of a wine drinker at all? Or is this kind of a new thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, this is all new to me. I would have it if someone offered it to me, but I never just went  out and bought it. But now I will go out and buy a Pinot Noir now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, right on. Yeah, there's a lot of dimension to wine. It's a cool rabbit hole to  jump down. I mean, as with so many things, I mean, bourbon, whiskey included. Tequila,  I found that with tequila. I always thought tequila was just tequila. Oh, that's the liquor  that you drink when you want to get really wasted or whatever. But then I ended up working at a  restaurant years and years ago that one of its specialties was that it just had this killer  tequila bar, tons of different types of tequila. And that was a total education working there. I  was like, whoa, there is dimension and depth to tequila that I didn't know existed. You can just  sip on its own. And yeah, it was just really cool. You can find that in a lot of that kind of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Queen Peru likes tequila and our neighbors had to sort of educate her to say, Hey, no,  this is not tequila. This is tequila and give her something that's much better. And it's night and  day in the taste. I'm not a tequila fan. I'd much rather have mezcal versus tequila, but  I think it tastes like the all the smoky stuff tastes like band-aids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm with you, Stacey. I much prefer like a good tequila over mezcal. mezcal has too much

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  of that smokiness. It's hard for me. I try so hard. I can do a little of it, but I'm just like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  yeah, me too. Me too. Well, okay. Anthony Nielsen points out in Discord, tequila is mezcal,  technically. You're right. But there's something about what's marketed as mezcal. It ends up having  that like overly smoky flavor that I just can't really get too deeply into. Thanks, Anthony. Okay.  My tip is something I learned on the show last night on all about Android that an email or  send in an email had heard me say on the show that I had never actually owned or used the Chromecast  with Google TV. We've talked about it a lot, but I don't have one and I haven't bought one because  we have Nvidia Shield TV in both of our rooms. And an email, I wish I wrote down his name,  I'm sorry, wrote in to say, hey, you kind of can't afford not to have one because right now,  if you have a Netflix subscription already, and even if you don't, Google has a deal going on  right now where they have a bundle with a Chromecast with Google TV and six months of Netflix for 90  bucks, which basically when you do the math, it's something like, what is it? It's the Netflix  value, it's in here somewhere, is $84 applies to Netflix. And so essentially you're getting  the Chromecast with Google TV for five bucks. And so I have a Netflix account, but it's not  the standard version. It's the 4K version. So the monthly fee is more, but still this $84  would still apply to my Netflix account, something that I'm already paying anyways.  And then the difference is the five or $6 and you end up with a Chromecast with Google TV,  which is a pretty darn good deal either way. But you mentioned this earlier, Stacey, and I'm  totally in this boat too. As tempting as this is to do, I kind of don't want to do it because I  don't really need it. Part of me thinks I might want to do it because just from the experience  of using the product and we talk about these things in the network all the time, so it could  be a work opportunity to just be more familiar with it. But it also kind of feels like a waste.  Like I'd be getting this thing and then I'd hardly be using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't buy it. Have Google send you a review Chrome or buy one.  Yeah, right.  I mean, don't do not interview your personal business.  It's not a good place.  Stacey Higginbotham  Speaking as someone who lives with like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stacey Higginbotham

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm just going to say someone who lives with all these devices and it has to deal with like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. No, I believe I'm right there with you. It's a lot to manage. At the same time,  if someone out there has been looking to upgrade their home setup and been thinking about a  Chromecast with Google TV and you already have Netflix, this is a really great opportunity to  get one for like six bucks. That's ultimately what it comes down to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or you have a cheapo college student. Want to get them off your Netflix account.  Stacey Higginbotham  Right, right.  You are an adult. Go into the world. We have changed the password.  Stacey Higginbotham

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That is one thing to remember about this is when you get it... Someone might be inclined to get  this and then take the like brand new Chromecast with Google TV and gift it to someone, which is  not a horrible idea, except for the fact that I think in order for the terms of this to complete,  I don't know if it's like you get a rebate or whatever it is, you have to actually set up the  Chromecast with your Google account. But then once you do that, that satisfies the requirement  and you can remove your account and you can still gift it. Someone would be happy to get it, I'm  sure. That college student probably wouldn't care. So there you go.  Stacey Higginbotham  Good pick.  Yeah.  Stacey Higginbotham  Yep. And then, well, I already mentioned it, but movember.com slash m slash Jason Howell  twit and on Twitter at Jason Howell, you can yell at me and say, dude,  Stacey Higginbotham  Woo hoo. Look at that.  Stacey Higginbotham  Get that stuff off your chin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stacey Higginbotham

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that what happens? You shave when you get enough money or do you have to wait till the end of the  month?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think I have to wait till the end of the month. But...  Stacey Higginbotham

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You start the month clean shaving. That's the thing. You started clean shaving and you don't  shave for the whole month and you just sort of watch and wait and see what happens as we  get your face.  Stacey Higginbotham  Stacey Higginbotham  Face stare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This feels like a lazy way to be like, I don't want to shave, so I'll just say I'm doing it for charity.  Stacey Higginbotham

Transcript:  Damn, man. I'm plugging my show. I don't know about them. I'm plugging mine.  Stacey Higginbotham  We talked about the 6 Pro and the cameras and JPEGs and RAW and all of that. Go back to my show,  Hands-on Photography, episode 33. I explain RAW versus JPEG and walk you through some examples and  dive in just a little bit more to help you understand what's going on with those types of  files. So twit.tv slash hop is the show and episode 33 if you want to go back and get your  lesson on that. And thank you all for your continued support.  Jeff Jarvis

Ant Pruitt  And thank you out there for watching and listening each and every week.  Leo will be back in the studio next week for This Week in Google. So look forward to that.  We do record this show every Wednesday starting at 4 p.m. Eastern, 1 p.m. Pacific. Right now it's  20-hundred UTC, but this Sunday the time changes. So does that make it 19?  Jeff Jarvis  Yeah, your guess is as good as mine.  Leo We fall back.  Ant Pruitt  Yeah, we fall back. So I think that means that it's-  Leo But they don't.  Ant Pruitt I don't know. But they don't. So I don't know if it's 19 or 21. Either way,  it's going to change. So be on your feet because I don't have the ability to figure it out right  now because as we said, we're hungry. But twig.tv slash twig and you can find all the ways to  subscribe and I'm sure that page will be updated once the time changes actually happen.
