Ladies and gentlemen joining us now, back from a wild party somewhere in the middle of Texas, Gina Trapani.  Howdy.  Howdy.  Should have worn my cowgirl hat.  How y'all?  Great, great.  Yeah.  A little raspy still, but it's still great.  I'm glad you're here.  I'm glad you're here.  I'm glad you're here.  I'm glad you're here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm glad you're here.  I'm glad you're here.  I'm glad you're here.  I'm glad you're here.  I'm glad you're here.  I'm glad you're here.  A little raspy still from the party end, but happy to be home, but also great South By.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was really fun.  Also from South By Southwest, Jeff Jarvis.  Jeff and Gina are...  Sorry, I'm still waking up from the party.  Jeff and Gina are our regulars.  Next week we will have a special guest from Google.  But for now, the three of us and lots to talk about in the Googleverse, but I guess we should debrief.  By the way, thank you so much for being part of Twit on Sunday.  And if you haven't heard...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I always feel good when I graduate to Twit.  It's like graduating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm at the grown-ups table.  No, no.  I want to just say about this week in Google, this show is one of our absolute premier shows  and it's entirely because of you guys.  Whoops, I just darkened the show.  Until then.  Until then, and we went black.  No, it's entirely because of you guys.  You guys are fantastic.  I don't know.  And it's one of the reasons the show Out of the Box got such a great audience is because  you have absolute fans.  Gina, for of course starting Lifehacker and her great work with ThinkUp.  And I have to throw in now to do that text, which increasingly...  Because you're using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to tell you, Leo, people tell me, I listen to you on Twig.  I don't hear Lifehacker anymore.  Oh, that's good.  I listen to you on this week in Google.  I guess that's good, right?  And they know about SmarterWr.  Yeah, it's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Jeff Jarvis, of course, he's a professor of journalism.  He's an esteemed commentator on the future of journalism and also the author of really  one of the best books on Google, What Would Google Do?  Although now I saw Vajanathan on CNN touting his new book.  So his book's finally out.  Yes.  Siva's book is finally out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Stephen Levy's book, I just got the galley for it.  Oh, he's...  In the Plex.  He's doing kind of the story of Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, see, he did, of course, the classic Soul of a New Machine.  No, that's Tracy Kidder.  He did Hackers, which really was one of the...  That and Soul of a New Machine were the seminal works on the 70s computer scene.  And so I can't wait to read that.  And Aleta's book, Google.  So there's a lot of books about Google.  I'm going to move on.  Yeah, maybe we should move on.  His next book, Public Parts, will be out sometime soon.  And you spoke, didn't you, Jeff, about that very topic at South by Southwest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I was over the river and through the woods halfway to Dallas.  But yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you get the four square...  There's a four square button that's like, I can't remember what it is, far, far out or something.  Far, far away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you explore Austin outside of the...  But really, for some panels, you have to take a shuttle to the hotel across the river.  Yeah, I did that a couple of times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I was thinking about what to suggest, because we discussed this somewhere that...  I was wondering whether South by...  19,000 is the final number.  19,000 paid participants.  Wow.  And should it be cut down?  Should it have a cap?  And somebody said maybe it was on Twitter.  Well, then it becomes TED, which you don't want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We don't want an elitist show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, but it just doesn't work.  It's just too big.  I'm thinking about it.  I think they've got a separate film from Interactive now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and maybe be a little bit more selective in panels.  I mean, there are so many panels and there are so many tracks that it's a little frustrating because you just can't see.  You get mad, yes.  Yeah, you can't see all the ones.  But what if they were...  If they cut the number of panels down by 75%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It would also be great if people could express interest in panels beforehand so that they could see before they schedule them.  Don't they do that?  Don't they have votes?  But no, this person, user123, Gina Trapani, wants to see these panels.  Oops.  A lot of people want to see the same panels.  Don't schedule them at the same time.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There is technology to solve this problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Lanyard.com, Lanyard with 1A, was awesome.  And my coworker, Andy Baio, was like, hey, just go on to Lanyard and see what panels your friends are going to.  And I did that and it was just like immediately kind of surfacing.  You know, 20 minutes and I was able to...  I had this great list of panels that I wanted to go to.  And Lanyard did a really, really nice job.  Better than the native, sorry, South by Southwest, but better than the native South by Southwest app.  That's interesting, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  They had this kind of dedicated...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a little different than Plancast.  But it's similar in that...  For that use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  You know, I haven't used Plancast very much, so I'm not sure.  So Lanyard is sort of just, you know, it's conference specific.  Right.  And you sign in with Twitter so it knows who you follow and who's followed you.  And you can list yourself as a speaker and you can, you know, see where your friends are going.  And that was really, really helpful for me because I'm out of the loop, but my friends are in the loop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, Plancast is all events and Lanyard is just conferences.  So yeah.  Right.  Social conferences.  And I like that there's a problem where you wouldn't have software like Lanyard.  Right.  And I like this link.  Fed up about hearing about South by Southwest?  Block tweets from known attendees.  Now that's an application that people want.  Well, of course you can't block us, but we'll stop talking about South by now.  But I do have to start thinking about it for next year.  We are talking with them actually this week about expanding our participation.  There's a lot of things we'd like to do.  One of the things, you know, the last two years all we've done is cover the parties because, you know, Scoble told me, he said,  forget the conference, forget the show.  The parties is where it's at at South by.  So last year and this year that was kind of our coverage.  But I really do want to cover the conferences.  So what we're going to try to do is work with the organizers to have a stage outside where select conference presenters can come out.  We can't stream the conference.  They do that, but can come out and talk to us and we can interview them.  Wouldn't that be a great way to spend a couple of days having the crowd having the people that it was just so great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The venue you found and was love was real fans were there.  Yeah, Momos was great.  And that was wonderful.  Just having real people and enthusiastic, you know, nice people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did not to promote it too much because I just wanted it to be people who listen to the show so they would know about it.  It worked perfectly.  I would have had you stream our session though, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Andy organized the worst website ever, which was like seven people pitching their worst possible idea.  And he funded us with five dollars.  The winner.  It was hilarious.  We had the ballroom just it rock us laughter.  It was awesome.  And everyone was asking us, you know, is there a video and we're going to try and get a video up.  And I would have loved to have had you live stream.  That was one of the coolest panels I've ever been on.  It was really fun.  Well, doesn't South by do some most conference organizers will do something.  Well, so they live stream the keynotes, which was great.  But like the individual panels, you know, we actually did our panel twice because the first panel was a panel.  Twice because the first room was so small, we had a line to the escalator.  So they said, OK, well, we have you know, that was at 11 a.m.  They said, oh, we have a bigger room for you.  You can redo it again at five p.m.  So we can accommodate everyone.  So it was just it was one of those things.  It was the most popular event on lanyard.  So we knew a lot of people were going to come.  We didn't want to turn them away at the door, but we had to do that the first time.  So it was just one of those things like we knew it was going to be a good panel South by didn't.  And like it was just like, I wish we could have streamed this.  But, you know, we had somebody with a handy cam in the first row.  So we did get some video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We could do better than that.  So Eileen is sitting here and we're you know, we are going to talk.  We have a conference call with the organizers literally in the next few days.  They didn't want to talk until after it was over.  But planning for next year.  And, you know, that's a great idea.  If we could if we would know ahead of time and I think with your help, we would.  Yeah.  What the really, you know, five of the best panels and they would let us stream those.  That would be awesome.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got to find the panels that are funny, like that take a different, you know, that aren't just people sitting at a table.  You know, the really kind of a lot of like, yeah, the real lively ones.  That would be that would be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'd like to.  Well, the great thing you can do, too, is you don't just stream the stage.  You use your cameras to go around and Oprah the room.  Yes. Right.  As you do it to the whole town.  You know, you know how to do that now.  So you could do that with the room where you really bring in the funniness.  You know, there's a nice folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a good verb, by the way, the Oprah the room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we know how much Jeff loves Oprah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to Oprah the room.  And no, I think I think we will.  We will be something a little bit more.  We're getting more each time getting a little more ambitious.  I mean, last time I remember was just me, a staff and a camera.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I walked around.  I didn't have a cameraman.  I just me, you know, walking around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, then, Leo, you have the other problem of having the one person crowdsurfing the six person crowdsurfing.  Now what do we do?  I think the tattoos the only way to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was hoping that I was wrong.  I don't want the twig logo on your ass.  I want the twig look on your ass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, dear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We should have a bet.  We should have a bet.  We'll figure out something.  So let's let us talk a little bit about what's going on in the world outside of South by Southwest.  Yes, there is a world outside of Austin, believe it or not.  Although really, the the geek world in the cloud world did converge on Austin.  I have to say, I learned a lot.  Did anybody go to the Google hack house party?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's how I knew that South by Southwest had gotten too big.  Normally when Google holds events at conferences like this, you know, it's top of my list.  And it's first thing I didn't make it to any Google events.  I felt terrible.  Did Jeff, did you make it to any of the Google events?  They were pretty big presence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Events were so oversubscribed.  These parties are so oversubscribed that most of these many of these parties had competitions to get into the party.  The four square party you couldn't get into unless you did.  You know, you were like it was it was crazy.  And I don't know.  So I'm just looking at all the things they did.  They had on Sunday, which we missed, was the League of Extraordinary Hackers from one to six.  They had 15 minute API briefings on Android, Chrome, HTML5, Blogger, Google TV, Google Maps, App Engine, YouTube, Web fonts, cellbots and fusion tables.  What?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I'm just not in the developer mindset when I go to South by Southwest.  You know what I mean?  Like I'm just not in like I want to learn the Chrome API.  It's like we missed that because we were working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But then we could have gone to super happy Dev House complete with hacking and a Lego Mindstorms Sumo bot competition.  Wow.  We got you know what?  I need more cameras and more more hosts.  We're going to have to do for we're going to have to do a four way screen where you pick what what party you want to be.  It's just incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But then on the other hand, a party is a party is a party.  Right.  Right.  You're going deaf.  You're then going to lose your voice.  You're going to fight to get one drink.  You're going to screw the thing you saw all day.  I don't mean to be old just for no fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you're right.  That's why, to be honest, I thought next year we try to capture at least some of the of the session content, which we have we have not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think session content and I think, you know, the fact that you go to Dignation, the fact that you are now going to have a show of similar parties with content.  Right.  Are pretty great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I don't I don't think I don't we don't even know what we're going to do next year for shows.  But I guess we have to do a show.  I don't want to do stuff.  I don't do what Dignation does.  That's two thousand people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yours was great.  Mo was great.  I like what we did because it was it was it was like family.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But next year, I think now everybody knows about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So next year, you're going to make it big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't want to make it big.  But anyway, we'll figure out somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was I was thinking, too, that we'll get off some of us because I know most of the world is sick of it.  But I wasn't there.  I've already heard about it.  But if they split up theater and interactive, they could also use the theaters to do some really neat stuff.  Oh, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you get right, they separate film.  Yeah.  That's a good idea.  Actually, that's separating the three is a really good idea.  Wasn't it wasn't this year the first year the interactive was bigger than film or music, which isn't just the last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Last year was bigger and this year was gigantic.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Google has once again done its crisis response pages has become kind of just automatic from Google.  If you go to Google dot com slash crisis response, there have been an awful lot of crises in the world.  And of course, Japan is the latest.  And I think they're doing a spectacular job now of this.  Yeah, they've got this down, right?  Got it down.  They roll this out right away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And honestly, I mean, not to be cynical, but Google needs to do this to show that they have real time tools that can help people that are on Twitter.  Because all you hear about this with these things, you hear about Twitter a lot.  People found out through Twitter.  People first, first, you know, eyewitness accounts, that kind of thing.  So Google's got to get into the game.  What I really like about Google's tools is that it there's like a direct help kind of situation where you can find, you know, finding people and seeing maps and adding names and looking for names.  That's very useful, maybe more useful than seeing a stream of news going by.  That's where people experiencing the issue.  Well, this has both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's what's kind of intriguing.  You can click this link that says latest news at the very bottom.  They have real time updates, which aren't updating yet, but they will.  Those are mostly tweets.  They have a latest, you know, it's really a dashboard.  Live streaming from NHK maps.  They have all sorts of updated links, rolling power blackouts, embassy resources if you're stuck in Japan.  And then I like this right at the top, a way to donate, which I think is so fantastic to the either the Japanese Red Cross Society, UNICEF or Save the Children.  And I think that makes it very easy.  That's using Google Checkout to donate.  Everybody's doing that, though.  You know, I was really pleased to see Apple with their iTunes.  It's right on the front page.  It couldn't be easier to donate and you do it right through the iTunes and Apple doesn't take its normal 30 percent.  I presume Google also waives its cut from Google Checkout.  So, you know, the tech community, we read on the MacBreak Weekly yesterday an email that was sent to Kevin Rose from a listener to this show and to many of the Twitch shows as well, because he mentions them.  Who is at Apple, a Japan employee, and talked about what they did in the Apple stores.  They said, you know, Tokyo doesn't have much open Wi-Fi.  Many people come to the Apple stores to use the Wi-Fi.  So we stayed open till 10 p.m. that night.  We put chargers out as many as we could find so we would charge their phones because there was no power.  This is in Tokyo.  That's great.  People were actually spending the night there who couldn't get home.  I mean, it was really, yeah, it was pretty neat.  I'm sure other companies responded similarly.  I'm sure Google Japan responded similarly.  I just think I think it's really great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's it's, you know, as we said it on Twitter, every technology comes of age.  You know, the next disaster, supposedly.  But you know, watching the many ways that we get news now here is just amazing.  I've talked about Andy Carvin like crazy.  By the way, I'm going to be at NPR next week.  Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, would you please?  You know, he gave a panel again.  This is another one I missed at South by.  He gave a panel.  I would have loved to have seen that.  He's he's just great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He's wonderful.  He was doing Japan.  But all the other sources, the fact that I can I've been going nuts watching NHK, which they the Japanese network and they put a live translator on TV.  Oh, that's neat.  It's on Ustream.  Well, that's what I said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  People in the people in the Apple Store going in to watch Ustream.  Yeah, that's where they were getting their news.  I think that's exactly.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So just just for the for the for the records, it's used to TV slash channel slash NHK hyphen world hyphen TV.  And it's it's striking how different the coverage is versus America.  Yeah.  It is so much more information packed and so less emotional, believe it or not.  They're living through this and we're the ones going crazy.  Yeah.  And they don't go crazy with the fancy graphics and all that.  They sometimes just hold up a big cardboard thing with a map of the of the area or a map of the of the reactor and explain it.  They go through long stories.  It's very impressive and amazing to be able to see it from there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No kidding.  So Andy Carvin, as we've mentioned before, will say it again, a Carvin on Twitter, and he's doing a kind of a curation as he has in the past with other events, major world events like the Egypt Revolution in Tunisia and Haiti before that.  He's doing his own little curation, which is fantastic.  And I can't believe still only thirty three thousand followers.  Meanwhile, you know, Charlie Sheen's got two million.  It's like, come on, please give me a break.  What's wrong with the world?  What is wrong with the world?  And as you mentioned, NHK dash World dash TV on on Ustream for their live.  And actually, you can also they also point to the the main feed as well from NHK.  I don't see anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You found any any great resources on on the technology side of this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the big story for I think for us as technologists is the nuclear plants.  That's what I'm saying.  Trying to get and it's really tough trying to get a link earlier to to the MIT.  I did. Now, that's a slate has deprecated that post saying that guy is not a nuclear engineer,  although I think that the folks at MIT in nuclear engineering probably, in fact, I know, amended his post and vetted it for accuracy.  So I tend to trust that post.  And then we also had a link to NRC.gov where they have a lot of teaching material,  the National Nuclear Regulatory Council on on how those version one GE boiler reactors work.  But it's hard to get unbiased information.  You know, a lot of the news networks want to sensationalize it like the, you know, it's the end of the world.  And then pro nuke people are minimizing it.  And I just, you know, I'm on the fence on Nuke and I'd like to get that information so we could make an intelligent choice.  And that's apparently not too easy to do.  So it's it's yeah, I want to we're probably I think this is in our portfolio.  Do something on the network to try to get some unbiased.  That's a good idea.  Yeah, it is, you know, technical information on the air.  Non easy to do, I might add, because everybody seems to have something a dog in this hunt.  Let's move on to some Google News.  Chrome, a big winner in two ways.  It survived the pwn to own attempts to hack it.  Actually, there were no attempts, which I thought was very interesting.  Canada's Cansec West, a security conference that's held every year, has a traditional pwn to own  festival in which hackers attack browsers and operating systems and lately mobile devices.  They come prepared with their hacks.  We should point out they don't like to sit down on a computer, say, let me see if I can hack this.  Of course, the company is now aware of this.  Put out patches right before Apple put up some big dozens of patches for Safari.  And still Safari got hacked within five seconds.  Chrome, Chrome or Firefox was hacked at all, despite the fact that Google put out an additional  twenty thousand dollar reward to the person who hacked it.  Nobody attempted, which I take to mean nobody had a hack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that doesn't mean no one tried.  They tried before the event and said, we're not wasting our time on that.  Yeah, so Google was paying 20 grand to someone who successfully hacked.  Yeah, so you would get anyway, you'd get 40,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think you get 40,000.  I'm sorry.  Fifteen thousand and a laptop if you succeed.  And Google said, we'll sweeten the pot.  And still nobody attempted, which is a pretty big pot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I would say that's a pretty good bounty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would say that that is evidence there was in fact no known hack.  Right.  Firefox was hacked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Those hackers could find.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Now, I'm not sure that Android.  I think Android got through as well.  Let me just see Pwn to own.  This is really a great event.  It looks like Android might have been hacked.  Oh, that was 2008.  Never mind.  Yes, in 2008, Android was hacked.  But it's interesting because a lot of these operating systems and browsers are now much more heartened than they were a few years ago.  Thanks to Pwn to own.  Thanks to Pwn to own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Although a number of Charlie Miller, who's the guy who traditionally hacks Safari didn't this time, but traditionally has won that award, said there is a negative side of this.  Hackers will hold off on its revealing exploits so that they can use them.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did any other companies sweeten the pot like Google did?  No, certainly not Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's interesting.  It's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google.  Yeah, it's interesting that perspective that you're doing as a service versus the other way around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  So, oh, $20,000 and a CR-48 laptop.  Now you're cooking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, those are about to get scarce, aren't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are they giving up on those?  Yeah, it looks like we have a story on the list here.  They shipped the last CR-48 for now, quote unquote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that probably means that we'll see actual commercial versions of the Chrome OS, yes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep, this summer, I guess, a gadget's reporting.  Okay, that's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I have my CR-48.  I just saw it the other day.  I waved at it.  Hi, how are you?  Good to see you.  I should probably see if there's updates.  I don't know.  I just, it doesn't compel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm thinking about maybe offering it as a bounty for ThinkUp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There you go.  Yeah.  You want another one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  You can have two.  Yes, I would love that.  We shall discuss that offline.  Mine is just sitting there.  Excellent.  You'll be making the government better with your CR-48.  Think of it that way.  It's about time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Partner Chrome OS devices on track for summer.  Google, rumor, according to Engadget, rumor had it, had 60,000 CR-48s made in December,  and that number fully depleted.  They were pretty, they were very free with them.  In fact, anybody could apply and say, I want one.  I never got one.  You never got one?  No.  Well, do you want mine?  You should have mine.  Yeah, maybe Justin.  I'll play with it and send it to you.  I'll send it to you first.  Cool.  And then, yeah, because it's certainly worth playing with because it's, it's not, it was  never intended to be a product.  It was only intended to demonstrate Chrome OS and beta test it.  And I know they've been pushing out a lot of fixes over time.  Yeah, they have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have.  They have.  It's definitely updated.  I use it every once in a while and there's, and once in a while I do get the, hey, restart  the update.  You got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They had a problem with the trackpad, which they fixed.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.  So anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did it work easily with printers and all that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know.  I didn't try to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I actually never tried to print from it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's that?  Google, you're so dead tree.  I dated myself by purely asking.  Did it work with printers?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did I use my acoustic coupler with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I believe the steam engine was not needed.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Actually, I didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I should try cloud print though, right?  That's why they built cloud print.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What we'll do is I will autograph it in the silver pen.  I'll send it to you, Jeff.  You autograph it in the silver pen and we'll send it to Gina and they'll have the twig  crew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nice.  It'll be a collector's item.  Let's do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's cool.  Krista Bohn is going to be in next week.  I can get him to autograph it too.  Awesome.  Google VP lays down mobile stats.  Is that a number of the week?  I don't want to interrupt your number of the week.  No, it's not.  No, another one.  He says 150.  She says Marissa.  She.  I looked at her.  I thought, that's a guy.  What am I, an idiot?  What am I, a nut?  What is wrong with me?  No, I believe I can tell nowadays.  She has long hair.  No, that's not true.  She has long hair.  She has long hair.  She has long hair.  No, that's not.  Anyway, she says South by Southwest, Marissa spoke.  She said map service 150 million.  Is that 150 million uniques?  Yeah, I think so.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And according.  12 billion miles.  Yes.  12 billion miles.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is crazy.  The latest build of the app saves people an average of two days worth of travel time  per year.  I have to say Google's, I love, Google's so great at that, at breaking down the amount  of minutes, seconds, hours, that things like Chrome, they did the same kind of stat when  they launched the Chrome instant results, right?  Didn't she say it saves searchers like an hour a week or something?  They do, that's, I mean, speed is obviously Google's main focus, but that's the way to  tell the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love it.  Yeah.  Of course they'd be good at metrics.  Right.  Right.  Obviously.  You talked to Marissa last week.  We had to let you go early, Jeff.  How did that go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was good.  I was talking to Marissa and Tim Armstrong up there and Tim did not back away from the  AOL way.  Marissa described the future of content, which really, you know, takes the thing I've talked  about in the past of the hyper personal news stream and really has a vision for where targeting  is going to go.  And a lot of discussion about quality and improving quality, you know, new algorithms  and stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When you use the word targeting, I think that might bother some people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know it's coming.  You know it's coming.  Google has such a good sense in their own minds of, as does Facebook, of the value of  it and then they don't fully understand the creeped out people out here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, what is targeting?  What does that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, if Google prioritizes your inbox today, imagine if Google could prioritize  all your feeds.  Right.  So you have your Twitter feeds and your links and your email and your RSS and they know  enough about you to know what you care about.  And so that they just say, here Leo, do this.  That could be high value to you.  But they know a lot of, they got lots of signals then of what matters to you and who you're  talking to and when and why.  And you're getting value back.  So it's worth doing.  I mean, I couldn't live without a priority inbox now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is the trick to do it without creeping people out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, the trick to do it is by being very open.  And the political end of this is difficult.  You know, I think Obama is about to announce, the FTC is about to announce tomorrow a do-not-track  law and it just drives me nutty because we don't need it.  We have it.  We have the ability to turn off cookies, anything we want.  It's a stupid way, but as has often been pointed out to me, the fact that Do Not Call got 180  million Americans or some such.  Anything called Do Not today is going to pass in Washington.  Yeah.  Do not.  Do not breathe laws.  And so is it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have this antipathy towards marketers, obviously, everybody.  I imagine everybody does.  But is that really reasonable?  I mean, they are.  They are.  Is it marketing?  Yeah.  Isn't it kind of critical?  Isn't it the grease that lubricates our economic machine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's why I wrote this paragraph in the book saying, you can cut all these things out.  You can get ghostry and find out who tracks you.  You can go to an incognito session.  You can kill your cookies.  This is all in your power today.  And that's fine.  It's your it's your right and privilege and you can do it.  But when you do that, you have lowered your value to the site you're coming to.  And you may be pushing them at some point, if enough people do this over the edge to  either open a paywall because they have to.  How much do you like that, folks?  Or certainly put up just really junky ads.  That's the immediate or even die.  Yeah.  And so there's a responsibility here, I think.  And you know, yeah, I fast forward through TV ads, too.  And so and I ignore lots of ads, too.  And the I put the blame on the advertising industry for doing stupid ads that don't think  and media for selling too many of them and not being relevant, not being engaged.  But that's the whole point.  If it's going to be better advertising, the way it's going to be better is targeting.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In the EU, I put up this on the list.  They this week are going to come out with, you know, this this panic goes on somewhat  related. They're going to have a right to be forgotten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I got a guy named Jens Best in Germany.  He he did the.  The anti street view thing where people find the pixelated houses.  Yeah, he tweeted me where is it here?  He said they're confused.  Right to be deleted in social networks.  OK, right to be forgotten means delete everything about me online.  That's bad in lots of ways.  And that potentially violates if I write about you and you can come along and tell me to  erase you, then that's a violation of my freedom of speech.  Right.  So this mania mania is doing great things for the book.  It'll it'll be a good topic by the time September comes around.  But but it bothers me greatly that we're going overboard on some of these things because  there's this mania.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I like the right to not exist.  Well, it's the right to be forgotten, like the Internet never forgets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And like have me just sort of disappear after a while.  There's no it's not technologically feasible, however.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, what it amounts to is that as part of the TOS for  Facebook, you would be required to guarantee that you could erase someone from the  service. So you're still right there.  Fine. You can erase my account, but can you erase everything that somebody said about  me? Can you erase every photo I'm in?  Can you erase every link to me?  This is the problem Facebook has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You could delete your Facebook account, but if anybody has referred to a picture in that  account, it stays because it's part of their collection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No man is an island.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. And let's not forget the Internet.  I know a few women who are, but that's a whole other story.  Well, you're perhaps talking about the Islets of Longahans.  Let us.  I don't know where that came from.  Where did that come from?  That was just something that's buried deep within my mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How often have you had shock therapy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. So let's take a break.  When we come back, it is the rebirth of Google Wave or  is it a very happy Gita Tripathi?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The night of the living tech dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We'll find out exactly what that means in just a second.  Before we do, though, I'd like to tell everybody about GoToMeeting.  GoToMeeting, of course, that great software from our friends at Citrix that makes it  possible for you not to hit the road.  If you're just back now from South by Southwest, probably the last thing you'd want to do is  get back on a plane for a client meeting.  And yet so many of us spend so much time for those face to face meetings.  Wouldn't it be great if there was some sort of system like, I don't know, the Internet  that would allow you to have your meetings online?  Yes, there is. In fact, you probably know there's quite a few online meeting solutions,  but none easier, none better than GoToMeeting.  If you haven't tried it, I do want you to try it.  Meetings cost a lot of time, a lot of money, and there's a lot of stress in flying places.  So we do teleconferences, but they're not perfect.  People get bored.  You know what we've been doing lately?  We still do a lot of teleconferences, but we set them up with GoToMeeting.  It's nice because it's built into GoToMeeting.  It's free. You get teleconferencing via VoIP, which means you can use it on the iPad or by phone or both.  So we set up a teleconference.  It's built in that look, it's a click of the mouse.  It's very simple.  But we also have the GoToMeeting in the background.  We don't always use it, but if I suddenly say, oh, you know, let me show you, I can turn it on and they see it.  Very easy for clients to use.  People who've never used it before, a lot of other people are maybe still using maybe those crappy Microsoft meeting software.  Adobe has stuff.  You know, I just say, you know, click this link.  Boom, 30 seconds later, they've got GoToMeeting on there.  And they universally, they say, wow, this is much easier, much better.  I didn't need to call the IT department.  For sales presentations, for product demos, for training, for collaboration.  Again, you're in a meeting.  You say, I got this document.  Can we work on this together?  Fantastic.  I even, you know, a couple of years ago, and this was so cool, rehearsed a presentation with somebody, with two people in two different spots.  We had a PowerPoint presentation.  It was like 60 tips in 60 minutes.  So it had to really move.  We were able to rehearse it on GoToMeeting.  It was incredible.  Brought to you by Citrix.  So, you know, it's secure 128-bit SSL.  It's cross-platform Mac and Windows.  And yes, on the iPad, it's spectacular.  And as many meetings as you want for as long as you want, just $49.  Try it free right now.  Go to GoToMeeting.com slash twig.  30 days free.  You be the judge.  GoToMeeting.com slash twig.  So, Gina, we are using a new Google Doc feature that is very Wave-like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is very Wave-like.  Google Docs just got comments, real-time live comments, within the entire document and within sections of the document.  And it's pretty cool.  And it's very, very Wave-like.  It doesn't have the chaos anarchy thing that Wave had, which was that you can't edit other people's comments, right, which you used to be able to do in Wave.  But you can comment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can reply to their comments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you can edit the document that you're working on, which is some ways better, right?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  So the idea of comments is just to have this side conversation about what's going on in the document or in a section of the document without actually changing the document itself.  Now, Docs had chat, you know, the sidebar chat on the side, which was nice.  We used that from time to time.  Yeah, we have used that, Eileen, and just as we edit the Doc for the show beforehand.  But comments, because you can do comments within a particular section, you can have discussions which are separate.  You can delete discussions after you've had them.  Okay, this discussion has been resolved.  Not delete it, but kind of close it off.  It's a really it's a nice new feature.  I love this, right?  Like I get I have to draft documents all the time.  Documentation, proposals, this kind of thing.  And when you work remotely like I do, this this kind of thing is huge.  This is part of the reason why I loved Wave.  So I'm excited.  I feel like I feel heartened that this this is kind of, you know, something, you know, a lesson learned or a good feature from Wave that came into Docs.  I think they did a pretty good job with it.  I haven't had a whole lot of time to play with it.  I've been playing with you guys in the Doc that we're sharing right now.  And it also has this.  And this is one of Wave's fatal mistakes is that Wave launched without email notifications.  So you would wave someone, but you'd never know if they waved you back.  This new discussions feature in Docs, you can set email notifications for various things if someone replies back or starts a new discussion or you can turn them off completely, which is super nice.  It's a the button is you have to open up a Google Doc and then the there's a discussions button up near share.  That's just discussions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And so I'll zoom in on it so you can see it.  It's right up here.  By the way, we found this right away.  You can change it so it doesn't email you.  Right.  Because Jeff said, I'm getting a bunch of emails.  So you can turn that off.  It's actually quite granular.  If you click the discussions button, then the discussions opens up in light blue.  It's a a.  Get off my lawn, mailman.  I don't want the mail.  But I also noticed, Gina, that there's a little yellow post-it note when we've got a conversation, you and me going off to the right as well.  So and I can I have the capability responding, editing, deleting and resolving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's actually that's a selection conversation.  So I selected a couple of words and then right clicked and chose comment.  I'm going to add another one.  So she'll do it right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And this is all in real time.  So we're watching you as you do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Cool.  So that should come up.  And I believe that the little post-it notes should sort of should match the color of the highlighted section.  So I can see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, they do.  I can see those little red markers that Gina put.  I don't know if you can see that.  Let me zoom in a little bit more.  Gina put that there and then Gina put this here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so if you if you if you write, I think you right click and hit comment, you can see you should be able to see the the comments.  So I like this.  Listen, for groups that have to work on documents together, this is huge.  Talk about revision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So much better than Microsoft Word revision tracking.  I mean, really real time.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But but a very clear metaphor to word vision tracking, which I think people can understand, like have this mental model of a lot better.  Right.  That that was wave's problem is that no one it was like a product that solved the solution that had a solution for people who use mailing lists and wikis a lot.  And not a lot of people do that.  And there wasn't a clear a clear parallel.  And I think this is a very clear parallel to word track changes.  But it has you know, it's but it's even better because it's real time and it's in a cloud based.  So I dig it.  I really dig it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, that's great.  Wave.  Now we don't have the wave plug in architecture and all of that, although I don't see any reason why they wouldn't necessarily bring that back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would love to see something like that.  But that was a tough, you know, that was a tough thing.  You know, Gmail has labs, but only Google employees can add labs.  I mean, the dream would be a lab section or an extra feature section.  Third party.  Developers could could and they haven't they haven't really done that.  Wave was really the only platform that allowed for that for that kind of thing.  So I think that's just a tough problem to solve.  And I think, you know, you really have to get developers pulled in building really cool stuff to sell that.  So I think that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Can't you tie that?  Is it is it easier to tie that now into the apps marketplace?  You know, that's a really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a good point.  Right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The apps marketplace is actually that really good point.  A way to sort of integrate with Google Apps and.  It's cool.  Yeah, let's compare it.  Yeah, I mean, it makes sense, especially if you can make money, right?  Make money is always a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  People like to make money.  I'll never understand why.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Interesting.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I'm glad it's back.  There's a video on YouTube that that I guess demonstrates it.  If you want to.  Yeah, the video is pretty good.  Yeah.  So only three hundred five people have looked at it so far.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But actually, the video is kind of cute.  It's got a has wave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll go to the high def version.  We can watch it.  It's got jazz.  Everybody loves jazz.  Yeah. So that's a good demo.  If you want to know more about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you can add email addresses so people can get notification that you've addressed  them inside of a doc, which is nice.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Gears is dead.  Long live Gears or something.  I'm confused.  Google Gears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, it died.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was basically dead before.  It was dying before, but it's officially dead now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  It's officially dead now.  Yeah.  I mean, this is I think maybe we'll look back and see this is the dark age of like when we  knew what offline looked like because of Gears, but we didn't have it because, you know, HTML5  was on the horizon.  I guess they just pulled Gears.  Gears is now officially completely out of Chrome.  It hasn't been around for a while, but it doesn't support IE9 or the Firefox 4, which  I think is scheduled to drop next week.  So yeah, Gears is gone.  It's, you know, I wish I think it's probably really hurt Google Docs and maybe even Gmail  and the browser to not have offline capabilities.  I think that Google made the right decision to go with HTML5 and not this sort of hacky  extension thing.  But it's also been a really long time.  I think they sunset Gears in May of 2010 and they're talking about HTML5 offline capabilities  at the end of this year.  So that's a long time.  Why does that take so long?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not that complex, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a good question.  I'm not sure if it's an issue of the standard not being totally fleshed out or what.  I would love to hear the backstory on this.  I think Seth last week when we had Seth on, we asked him about it and he said, yeah, I'm  frustrated too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But he said that it would come, but just it's not there yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's taking a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So end of end of maybe end of this year.  And if you're going to make if you're going to push Chrome OS and you don't have some  sort of offline storage, that thing is practically useless.  I mean, you get on an airplane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Yes, that's the problem.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the problem.  There are still I found out airplanes that don't have Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Crazy.  Tell me about Continental.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was on JetBlue.  I said, where's the Wi-Fi?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they're like, oh, here's your one way TV.  You can watch TV, though.  You can watch TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You've got 40 channels of direct TV.  What's wrong?  I got to pay six bucks for that.  Yeah, it's really interesting.  I mean, of course, the airline industry is in crisis, but it's really interesting how  what was the latest greatest technology three years ago is now suddenly seems out of date.  These airplanes, it's hard to keep them up to date.  It's a big expense and the airlines don't have a lot.  So I thought this might I, you know, I keep saying this.  I'm one of these days.  I'll learn.  Maybe it's South by Southwest.  Google would announce Google me, which now we think, according to read, write web is  Google circles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that story got repudiated in not so.  Not so.  Oh, well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So traditionally, South by Southwest has been a great place to launch social stuff.  Twitter, Foursquare, Gowalla.  Nobody stood out this year.  And I thought maybe this would be a chance for Google to say, hey, we're here.  Not a good place to launch anymore.  Apple stood out this year.  Say again?  Apple stood out this year.  Apple?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the iPad.  Because of the iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that got all the attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They didn't stand out.  They popped up.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  They popped up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think South by Southwest is the right place to launch your startup anymore.  Don't don't launch your startup.  It's out.  It's just too big.  It's too crazy.  There's too many.  There's too many similar competing things going at the same time.  You know what?  Jeremiah O'Yang.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I sat behind Jeremiah O'Yang on the plane back and he said something I thought was  absolutely true.  He said the barrier to entry is so low now that there are hundreds of startups.  It's too easy.  Anybody with a nickel and startup a site.  Right.  It's just too easy.  And so as a result, you don't have you know, there's too many and no one's going to stand  head and shoulders above the rest.  Read, write web.  And we're going to get Chris Messina on not next week.  I think it's Chris DiMona, but Chris Messina maybe on the week after.  According to this read, write web article, Chris Messina is is one of the big guys involved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He of course, Gans went to Chris Messina and he denied it utterly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess it would be launched at South by Southwest.  He declined to comment on the story, it says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what that's what Marshall Kirkpatrick is saying.  And read, write web.  But Chris, of course, you know, with, you know, he's he he he's he's he's he's he's he's he's  he's hashtags.  He started the bar camp.  He's a very open source guy.  He's the kind of guy if they're going to do something, I would really like to see them.  It certainly incorporate his input.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I saw Rick Clow who was in charge of profile who got profiles launched.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We were going to get Rick on.  He said, as soon as I'm not busy, I guess he's now moved to YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Interesting.  So I'm on one of the nice.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Very nice guys.  Google acquired him along with his feed burner service.  Jonathan Sposato, who was with Picnic, another Google acquisition last year, is also reportedly working on circles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, actually, Chris didn't say I don't know what the story is talking about.  So there was a total utter denial.  It wasn't just not here, but maybe later.  It was these stories keep surfacing, though, if if none of this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If this is true, why do we keep hearing these stories?  Are people like playing Marshall and other bloggers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Could be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know.  I mean, I think, yeah, I'm not sure.  I don't know why everyone wants Google to launch another social product after Buzz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think one of the reasons that the buzz got big on this was because of the relaunched profiles.  Right.  Really does look much more.  It's cleaner and it looks much more as we talked about last week, like a Facebook page, because it's got relationship status and things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there's also a link to your profile in the drop down.  Like if you look at the new Google toolbar, when you when you're at Google and logged in, if you click on the drop down, there's a link to your profile right there, which is pretty prime real estate.  There are also there's a lot of chatter about blogger.  And, you know, have you looked at blogger lately and look at all the big new features and blogger?  It really seems like they're sort of pushing their more social products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, maybe here's where that goes from the other side here is that Facebook got a patent for patent for curated.  That is to say social search that's on the on the list.  Oh, patent for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, I'm trying to parse that sentence under Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, they call it curated search because they involve human input to it.  But it's really social search because it's it's it's what among your who among your social circle.  That's going to be scary for Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If Facebook's incredibly say we own that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And, you know, for people to use and I was hearing some people say that people are already using Facebook for search.  But I don't know how you would do that.  Well, Facebook would have the ability to generate search results and rank them according to a links popularity within a person's group of Facebook friends.  Now, Google's already had that way.  I'm quite amazed when I look for random things.  And below one, I see that, you know, Leo is as right to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. I think that's valuable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Huge. Yeah, that's a big signal for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So this is based on likes.  This is based on what your friends have been liking with Facebook basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, it sounds that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It sounds very much like what DIG does or Delicious does or any sort of social network where you can favorite things.  But Facebook just has the users and has been pushing likes for a really long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The patent is, quote, visual tags for search results generated from social network.  You said that. So information.  I heard of Bing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, because they're doing that Bing.  See, I wonder if you sign in to Bing using Facebook, is it going to get your track history?  That's going to freak people out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it would be it's good for Bing.  I don't know. I don't know anybody who's abandoned Google for Bing.  I know people who tried and I've heard people complain.  I said I was Tom Merritt.  Is he still is he still doing it? No, he gave up long ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a rank based on frequency of clicks by the members of your social network.  See, this is the thing. Just because I click on a search result does not mean that I recommend it.  It just means that it looks like maybe it's the thing that I want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. And by the way, how big is your Facebook social network?  It's 100 people, 200 people. It's not right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not a huge sample. You still get benefit of 100.  But but then is that really my social network?  You know, it's the combination. It's by Twitter.  People are probably more valuable than my Facebook people, oddly,  because we know we're interested in the same things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Happy birthday to YouTube. Gosh, I can't believe it's five years old.  I remember when Amber MacArthur, in fact, I think it's still on the Web.  You can go look at her YouTube. It's on YouTube, as a matter of fact.  Her piece that she did on our TV show.  She said, this is news. Cool site.  People can upload videos so easily. It's kind of it's kind of neat.  There's a video on YouTube that is the timeline.  This is pretty cool. And then they're hiring.  So Rick Clow is over there, but they're hiring new people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I remember thinking these guys are crazy.  They're never going to be able to host and stream that much video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. In fact, we said they've got a big problem here  because they're going to get sued to death. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the last I have with my own students.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  One of my students has a really good technology idea.  And she was talking about business models and she charged.  Well, why are you going to charge? Well, because a friend of mine does it.  And he pays for the servers. I said, if that's your goal in life, stop.  Right. You know, look back at YouTube. It went berserk.  I've got employee number 20 from YouTube is in my class now.  Oh, really? Wow.  Egan Honku is a wonderful guy working on the new business.  And, you know, if you think like Silicon Valley, you think,  no, grow as big as possible and then magic will somehow happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's an interesting acquisition. Green Parrot Pictures.  It's a company that specializes in fixing video quality.  Google just bought it. I haven't seen it operate yet. Have you seen it?  There is an example on YouTube. You want to watch? Yeah.  All right. Let's see here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And we talked on Twitter about how Google also bought next new networks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So here is, yeah, that was was that. Oh, didn't we talk about that last week?  That was Twitter, I thought. Oh, OK. Yeah, it's a content company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that's kind of interesting. Well, they're going to get rid of the content and keep the platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Keep the platform and platforms where the money is. So I didn't see anything happen.  So here's original footage, kind of bouncy shaky cam.  Imovie does this too and does a pretty good job of it.  And now here, but it would be cool if this is built into YouTube.  You just upload your video and it kind of cleans it up.  So shaky cam, shaky cam, shaky cam.  Wow. That's my motion sickness just went away.  Yeah, that's a lot better. Imovie does. It's very similar to what Imovie does on the new Imovie on Apple.  And in fact, when you import your footage on an Imovie, it automatically does it for you.  If you, you know, if you say, OK, that's a big difference.  That's a big difference. I can see that be a big selling point if you if it does that automatically.  Got crappy video uploaded to YouTube, it will fix it.  That's nice. Yeah. Wow.  Info-esting. We're going to take a break. Come back with more.  Our tool and tip and number of the week and a couple of quick stories too.  Boy, there's a lot. Facebook did block that Mark Zuckerberg action figure we talked about.  Oh, it's so good too. I know. He's even got the Adidas shower sandals.  Oh, great. If they'd left out the like button, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, they need to add with beast to it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the zoom is available, the Wi-Fi zoom, March 22nd, 27th.  So 11 days, five ninety nine, too expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I should confess, Leo, after having gone, you bought a reboxing my no, I haven't.  But but but just to the twig audience, I said this on Twitter.  I was going to eat crow and go ahead and buy the iPad, too.  I went to the line and they were out of anything but the huge one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I didn't do it. I haven't bought mine either. I ordered online.  I just decided I want to hang out with humans instead of stand in line at the store.  And I was too late. So I didn't order. It's like four to five weeks now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you won't get it till next month. Yeah. It's pretty nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I waited this long. Where do you see GarageBand? Yeah, I'm excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Apple universe is seductive, is coated in sugar. Indeed.  But it is, in fact, 1984. Follow the light, Joe.  In my opinion, I like the light.  Steve knows what's good for you.  It's only a matter of time before they turn the camera on and Steve is watching.  These are just like the screens in 1984, aren't they?  But they're so pretty.

Let's start with Gina Trapani, her tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm afraid I'm going to take that your tool. Are you going to talk about Google for iOS, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. How did you know?  Okay. So you know I won't do that one.  How did you know? No, take my tool, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I won't take your tool.  I've been trying to get her to take my tool for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's so mean. Sorry I said that. How did you know that was my tool?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no. You should do that one because I actually don't have iOS to try it out on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay. I have it in front of me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the main thing to try this week is the Google Docs comments, which we already talked about.  A very tiny little tip though. Gmail just added click to call to the web browser.  So if you check your Gmail and someone has emailed you their phone number or their phone number is in their signature,  you click on it and Gmail fills it in.  It fills it into Google Chat to make the call directly from GChat.  And that calling is free right now. They extended that.  So it's an easy way. It's kind of the same interface that you have on your phone, right?  You can tap a number and you can call, but now you can do it through your browser.  So I was at South by Southwest and someone had emailed me his phone number and I was like, oh, that's a link.  I had never seen that before. And then it launched GChat.  So cool, easy way to make a call.  And then I have one shameless plug, which is that we are giving away an iPad 2 bounty at ThinkUp.  So if you're considering, if you're interested in contributing to an open source project and we love newbies.  So if you've never done it before, please come check us out.  We're giving away two.  We're just giving out one iPad 2 and then maybe a CR48 at some point.  So go to bit.ly slash ThinkUp iPad 2 and submit a patch and you make some great software better.  Help us out. Help us help out a nonprofit and you'll get your nerd merit badge from GitHub too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So how would you know what needs to be done? Is there a bug report or something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, on that list we made some suggestions of cool new features and we're going to have.  So we have quite a few suggestions there.  We've got an issue tracker full of ideas as well.  And we're going to have the community kind of vote on like what are the what are the what was the best and most useful feature that got that got merged.  So we've got quite a few ideas there.  And even if you're not a programmer, we need help with documentation, with mockups, which is sort of design ideas.  So we welcome everyone. I'm really interested in sort of growing the community.  And we have such a great community. We had a meet up at South by Southwest.  We had like 20 people show up. Really great. Just awesome, smart, interesting people.  So Steve Martin comes Steve Martin did not come.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He loves ThinkUp, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know. I know. It's so great.  You know, we had the founder of I fix it show up and I fix it.  The Mac. Yes. We were kind of talking around the tables like how many thousands of dollars is I fix it collectively saved us all and sort of DIY.  So that was really, really fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they're there.  There are teardowns of not just the iPad, too, but the iPad cover.  Yes. 22 magnets in here.  It's just crazy. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He said that they broke the iPad to glass.  It was the first iPad glass that they had broken because it's so much thinner.  Well, it's also the way they've yeah, you can't.  They glued it all the way around. It's not just tabs. Right.  Yeah. So, yeah, those guys buy those iPads and take them apart and sell the parts.  But they take them apart by hand. It's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're incredible. They're really cool.  I think it's one of the best blogs out there. So, yeah, good.  How neat. Expert Labs is online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where expert labs dot org is the place to find us.  And we got a blog there and the bounty announcement is there along with some other some other news.  So, yeah, check us out.  Neato. Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to use this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Netflix delivers 61 percent of legal video downloads on the Internet, which, of course, is probably only about two percent of the internet.  Probably only about two percent of total video downloads.  Yeah, right.  And I mentioned that because I'm there's a nice little confluence of network wars stories.  Right. The fact that Brian Stelter at the New York Times reports that Netflix is looking to buy an original series,  which I just love because that puts Netflix in their producers with both networks and in a sense,  MSOs, and it makes them a new distributor of content.  Hallelujah. Just what we need competition.  At the same time, Facebook, these are things in the in the log is going to air baseball.  So it too competes with networks.  Wow. At the same time, the networks are having a hissy fit because Time Warner Cable's app was streaming content and they're complaining.  I wouldn't want to be a network right now.  So you go look and see the law would come cast by him, Jeff.  Well, because there'll be no network neutrality and they'll find ways to advantage them and try to kill Netflix.  And that's where the war is going to be.  I got to see Senator Al Franken at South by Southwest.  A very good presentation in which he gave the rousing defense of Netflix, of well, Netflix via neutrality.  And it's important, folks.  And he was yelling at the crowd that yelling.  He was being very funny, but he's been great about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have to say he's been so right on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yes. He really was a very good talk.  And he said, you know, entrepreneurs are job creators.  You have more clout than you realize.  You have power. Right.  And I think what what should come out of South by Southwest is action.  I think South by Southwest should organize a entrepreneurs lobbying trip to Washington.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've been saying that for some time.  It's very easy for geeks.  We're so into what we do and we have blinders on.  We forget that we have clout and we often aren't political.  And we got this is this is one issue where we really have to stand up and be counted because this all relies on network neutrality.  And all of this stands on that house of cards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So watch this in the weeks and months to come, you're going to find the cable companies trying to find more ways to smash Netflix because they realize that Netflix is a huge competitor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you ask the question, why would Comcast, why would Cable Town buy NBC?  Because because as bad as the network's business is, it's better than the cable company's business model right now.  So they're all screwed.  And if you have a choice, I'd rather be a content creator than a content carrier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I should have put this well, right.  And when you look what YouTube is doing and YouTube is crying, creating, you know, buying extra networks as a way to make better content there.  I think we finally find this somebody is going to make a big internet and that's going to change the whole dynamic.  One of these days, it's you, Leo.  Somebody's going to make it big on the internet.  It's you.  You're going to do the tattoo show and then you just don't know what's going to happen.  It's going to go wild on you.  You think the tattoo is all that's missing?  The tattoo show.  Yes, Leo's tats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm a blank canvas, baby.  That's right.  That's right.  Fill me up.  All right.  Gina, I'd watch.  No, you wouldn't.  Trust me.  I could promise you, you would not watch that.  Right after Glee.  Yeah, right after Glee.  I just like Glee this week.  I didn't see it.  How did you like it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would say, did you watch Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did.  My DVR screwed up and I started halfway through.  It was very upsetting.  I was all screwed up because of my trip.  You got to just buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's on iTunes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just buy it.  Yeah, I'm just going to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just ended up buying it.  Tell me if this was a next step that I thought it was and I thought it was important.  It was a major gay teen kiss.  And what's great about that too was there's no, you know, the world did not collapse the  next day except, you know.  We have times have changed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you had done, I'm reading a great David Bianco's book about the Smothers Brothers  where they got censored because they said the word rest.  My breast swells with love for you.  They actually had to cut that out.  That's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought you were going to say it was a turning point because they did original songs.  That's how accepted it's become.  Big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Couple of guys kissing.  What the hell is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was like, whatever.  Those two were falling in love for like two, zero season already.  I'm glad they finally kissed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I put it wrong.  I put it wrong.  It wasn't the kiss.  It was the fact that, you know, in any show there's a sexual tension relationship that  finally bursts.  And now it's that one as a relationship blossoming.  And they did a very good job with it.  And they made fun.  I said on Twitter it was good that they that happened and they made fun of a church lady.  And I got, you know, certain people yelling at me on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Probably mostly church ladies, I would guess.  Yeah.  Satan.  Satan was probably a stripper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Satan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I missed it.  I have actually not the season resumed without letting me know.  I've got a bunch of episodes to watch.  Yeah, you got to get caught up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I'm going to buy it on iTunes right now.  Yeah, that's what I did.  So I know I've got it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because my DVR screwed up a number of times with it.  I think that they may be doing some DVR manipulation.  Yeah, maybe.  Setting a flag or something.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was definitely an argument in my house last night about why the season pass was not  correctly configured.  There was some domestic discord about the Glee mess up last night.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm taking the remote control.  I am now in charge.  That's really funny.  That's the modern the modern family fights over the TiVo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, it's like no V is lower priority than Glee.  V.  V.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, boy.  You're such a geek.  Just because it's sci-fi.  I don't know.  Maybe I think I just lost my geek card.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  V should be higher than Glee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think V is over Glee.  It's an unless it's alphabetical order.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Glee is the new geek.  Glee.  Gleek.  Gleeks are the new geeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gleeks are the new geeks.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm going to very briefly mention Google has updated its iOS client and put GoG

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In it and some nice new features.  Voice search.  In fact, it kind of gives it parity in some ways with the client on Android.  You can swipe search results.  It's got all the apps listed now so you can jump right to the apps including Orkut.  Oh, wait a minute.  I don't have Orkut on here.  Never mind.  What else is new in here?  There's quite a few new features.  If you haven't tried the Google search app.  Well, they even tell you what's new.  Google goggles and notifications, which is kind of cool.  So your Gmail or a calendar events will notify you directly.  I'm going to enable that because I like my calendar to tell me what's going on.  If you have iOS update.  That's it for this edition of This Week in Google.  Gina Tripani is Ms. Think Up.  She's given away an iPad.  So go there and get one.  She's also at SmarterWear.org.
