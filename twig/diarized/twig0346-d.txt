Facebook and Twitter and anything else we're interested in and usually we have a lot of fun kind of drifting around to follow our interests.  Jeff Jarvis is here. His wide ranging interests include of course journalism because he's a professor of journalism at CUNY the City University of New York in Manhattan.  Where you were we were proud to have you as a guest. What a nice studio.  I had so much fun last week and great you know response for the show that everybody said how good it looked.  So yeah that's that's what we'll talk about that in a second because I want to introduce our other panelists.  Robert Scoble the Scoble-izer is here. Yo what's up. In his last few days at Rackspace. I even wore my Rack-Spacer.  You know what you did you've done so much for every company you work for including Microsoft and Rackspace absolutely in many ways put them on the map.  It's been seven years. Wow. That's amazing. So what's next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to upload VR a media company that's covering the VR space and augmented reality space.  Back to journalism huh. Yeah you know go to a media company maybe do some events stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You couldn't be jumping on a better bandwagon.  No I could not.  We're kind of jumping on the bandwagon too right before the show we finished the build of our ultimate virtual reality gaming machine.  Well that's what it was for. Yeah. Oh I came in and got it.  It's the seventh or eighth in the series. We starting with day one in Tech TV May 11th 1998 when we built the ultimate gaming machine which at that time you would laugh if you're trying to play a game with it today.  But at that time it was it cost a lot more. It was maybe two or three times more than what does this one cost five grand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Five grand. Not bad. The ones we have in my office are about forty five hundred so sounds like a similar kind of machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah you know you can as Oculus has pointed out you can get by.  I mean the minimum that they've described is you can get a computer for around a thousand bucks.  Yeah. Fifteen hundred so yeah. And then you add the five or six hundred bucks for the gear VR they have on their Oculus website a list of Oculus ready PCs.  But the thing that's kind of key is something like 18 percent of all PCs currently in the market are Oculus ready.  I mean it is not it is a demanding platform. Yeah. You need a big Nvidia card basically. Yeah. You need a 970 or better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah it's really interesting because we have a few in the office you know some that are in the fifteen hundred dollar level all the way up to the to the ultimate level.  And there's not a whole lot of difference in terms of the experience in Oculus.  And we we surmise because most of the content producers are building it for a minimum.  That makes a platform level. So we're expecting some of the later games that are experiences that come out to be pushing the Nvidia card a little bit harder.  And then we might see some differences. But right now you know if if you don't care about future proofing if you just care about playing what's out there today the fifteen hundred dollar level is just fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's surprising me. I mean I was one of the reasons we spent this money is because we wanted frame rates to be smooth.  I guess the Oculus itself display is only you could do about that. That's the display. Yeah. But and they're probably I don't know are they.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well they're not. It's not like old video games where they would put a lot more polygons right in front of you. So you would. It is what it is.  Yeah. And it's pretty smooth. We have HTC vibes and Oculus in our offices on both machines and it's hard to tell the difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm excited about the vibe. The vibe come. No. Yes. The vibe comes with handles. Yes.  Which the Rift doesn't. The Oculus touch devices won't be available to later this year. Probably around July or August. Yeah.  What I have to little praise for Oculus because I felt I was I felt a little cheated.  I was I had bought in the Kickstarter deal. I don't remember how much I put in. You did too. I'm sure I did not actually.  But my friend Andy did and he got his a couple of days ago. Well that's what I was going to say is we bought this Oculus Rift what is four or five years ago.  Got the first developer edition and then think a couple of years later. Oh by the way Facebook bought us for billions of dollars and I felt like oh it was a little of a letdown.  I mean it's certainly not against the Kickstarter promise or anything but I just felt like well I invested in that company.  I gave them money hoping that they would you know but they're they're going to now take Mark's. Mark has a little more money.  But but to their credit and they didn't have to do this. They are giving the release version to every single Kickstarter supporter who bought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah that was nice actually. They didn't have to do that. Yeah it didn't have to but you know they did make a lot of money on the sale.  And so it's only fair that they did that for the early people who supported them and put them in a position where Facebook bought them for what three billion dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah so I'm thrilled. Yeah Palmer Lucky last week flew to Alaska to to give the very first Oculus Rift to a buyer in Alaska who didn't have a PC that would run it.  So no like it is put on his head. So that's why we were rushing before the show to finish this of Ergum. We had all the parts.  In fact we introduced all the parts. The only thing we hadn't introduced was the monitor keyboard and mouse which we'll do on Saturday.  But we wanted it. We have to install windows and have that working and running and.  Did you have a local 14 year old build this machine for you? I'm the local 14 year old and I have to tell you at my age it ain't easy.  It was pretty funny to watch. Yeah it was great. Yeah it's people in the chat room going I guess Leo hasn't done this in a while.  Where does this screw? What's this extra? How does it? And but but you know to my credit I only had to take it fully take it apart once because I forgot something.  And when we booted it up it didn't boot it got really close and then we realized oh I hadn't plugged in one little power connector was still missing.  Plugged it in and then it booted. So that's that's not really credit to me. And then poor Leo had to leave and do the show. I know I'm watching him play with it over there.  That's my toy. It's pretty awesome. It's pretty awesome. And I'm looking forward to it. So but I'm waiting for word from Oculus.  I don't know if we'll have it on Saturday because I talk about I would have it. I didn't they had sent me a message on the 15th which I didn't notice.  They said we need your phone number before we can shift ship it. Oh so I gave him the phone number early this week and I'm hoping that and then I said come on can you get it to me quickly.  I'll come down and get it. Well we might have to drop by with a vibe or something. Would you? Robert you're invited. All my friends are all of a sudden calling out of the woodwork.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh you have them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know you're not the only executive being locked out of Oculus Rift information. Oh wait a minute. I just got an email shipping notice. Next. You have a package coming Thursday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thursday. Nice. Tomorrow. We're also getting the new iPads tomorrow. It's going to be an exciting day. Unboxing is all around. Who is what? What executive? Didn't get his rift. No no.  You didn't see the story about Mark Zuckerberg getting locked out of an office. Oh yeah I just saw the video of him. He goes up to an office. This is our secret lab. Here. Well let's see. Let's watch it.  This is great. So this is over here. We like a tour. We have a bunch of different vision labs which I think is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apparently I do not have access to go to the vision lab. Wait a minute. Can I say something? Why do they have a big glass window on the thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well I guess because you don't see anything unless you have them on. That's dopey. That's not. That's staged. But it is funny. You never know. You know Mark pretty well. Both of you guys know Mark pretty well. I've never talked to him. I don't know well. You've interviewed him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually we should just do a whole show about Mark Zuckerberg. The man. If I worked at Facebook in a secret lab I'd lock Mark out too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So tell me. Both of you guys. Tell me a little bit about Mark Zuckerberg. I really would like to know. I mean this is a big week for him. He's more charming and humorous than anybody gives him credit for. Yeah. Yeah. I mean he's got a geeky sense of humor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's one of us right? Yeah. I tried to take him to the Google party at the top and he said I don't have a ticket and I said I don't think that's going to be a problem. Don't you know who I am? Oh yeah I saw you in that movie. You're Jesse Eisenberg right? Yeah that's who I am. Yeah I'm Jesse Eisenberg. He seems nothing like the movie. No the movie did him a grave disservice I think. Yeah like it does everybody.  Hollywood is you know it's about entertainment not about accuracy. Well they didn't diss him. It's sort of like the Trump candidacy. They didn't diss him as badly as Steve Jobs got dissed I have to say. He was dissed pretty badly. Yeah. He wasn't mean to his kid or anything but. He did look like a weenie. They probably would have been if he had a kid. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're still getting some clicking from you. I don't know if there's a loose. I don't know I'm sorry. Connection or what? I'm going to have to order new audio equipment. That's it. I figured it out. I was going to talk to him in the back channel. What is it? You're using your computer's mic. It didn't switch over to your headphones so whenever you tap your desk. Don't hit anything. Your keyboard. Alright I'll just. Stay like that the whole time. There you go. Manos Arivas hands up. Let's see the hands. I want to touch the desk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Were you thinking what's the next big thing when you took this job at Upload VR? You must have been. Yeah I did. I wanted to go into VR because I saw how important it was. I've been around the world and watched people get their first experiences in VR and I figured where could I do VR the best. I looked at the six different media sites that are covering it and Upload was the best and said hey I want to join you. So they said sure. What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what will be? I'm asking you both this. What will be?  The measures of success or failure this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh man. Yeah. The real problem is the number of headsets is going to be small and it's going to be small for a few few reasons. It takes 15 minutes to get a demo and how many people can get a demo in the first year and you're not going to buy one until you get a demo because you think it's going to be a demo.  Because you think everybody I talked to before they get their demo thinks it's dorky, thinks it's isolating, thinks it's stupid, thinks it's like the next 3D TV, blah blah blah.  Right? And then I say play and they take it for 15 minutes and then they come out and go oh my god I had no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right? We talked about this question. Go ahead. If you don't play games is there any reason to get one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there's lots of things that aren't games and more. We had a meet up last night about non-gaming uses of VR from health curing depression to designing architecture to Ford uses VR to design cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right? Well, Leo, I know you weren't happy with me bringing the topic up but I think our discussion of porn and empathy was fascinating last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh.  We talked about cardboard too and whether cardboard is, do you feel, given that you're of all the people on this panel have had the most experience in a VR headset, do you feel that cardboard or gear VR does justice to the experience or do you really need to get a Vive or an Oculus Rift?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does. It's a gateway drug, right? Cardboard is great for looking at something very quick and watching a five minute, ten minute video experience.  For instance, I took a 360 camera at Coachella last year and had one of the only videos at Coachella at this big music festival and cardboard is great for that, right?  Gear VR lets you play some games but keep in mind you don't have controllers in your hands and the head tracking isn't as good so you can get ill easier in the cardboard or in the gear VR than the high end headsets.  And the high end headsets obviously have these really accurate controllers in your hands.  I mean, in Facebook, when we do get the controllers, we can play ping pong against each other over the internet and that's going to be a lot of fun.  So for that kind of thing, you need the high end headsets but for watching movies or lightweight video games, the gear VR or the cardboard is just fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have you done these social VR games?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I visited Facebook's Oculus lab and they took me into a room or an experience called Toy Box.  Yeah.  I could shoot the other person, I could punch the other person, I could light fireworks.  Yeah, that'll help with depression.  Yeah, you know, I could play ping pong with him or her and a few other things, you know, play trains and stuff like that.  So it's fun.  I think that's one of the exciting things is it looks isolating when you look at it from the outside.  But when you're actually wearing the headset and playing with somebody else over the internet in a virtual world, in a very immersive world, it's quite amazing to tell you the truth.  Well, that'll help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the word of mouth is strong.  If people hear from people like you and me and others who have tried it or their friends who have tried it and they get a drumbeat of this is great, this is great, that's probably good enough, right?  Word of mouth is what will drive something like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It helps but, you know, I can yell and scream until I'm blue in the face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you like everything so that doesn't...  Yeah, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just thought of a business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Remember back in the day when we had to go to cyber cafes?  I think there's a business in New York cafes.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's people, there's investors investing in them.  And in fact, there's an entire theme park in Salt Lake City called The Void, which everybody's raving about that gets to go and see it.  Or if you saw it at TED, they brought a small version of it to TED and everybody who's gotten that says it's absolutely amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's...  We were thinking, you know, the last time we built the ultimate gaming machine, we gave it away.  We had a contest.  And I first thought we would do that with this.  Then I realized, no, what we want to do is keep it here on set and have people try it.  So anybody who comes to our studio will be able to, you know, after the show or during a show, try it.  We'll have two Oculus Rifts and a Vive once the Vive comes.  So I think that's a good idea.  Yeah.  So people get a chance.  And I'm sure that they'll be putting these in stores and people get a chance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We'll have an art journalism school.  We're trying to get the students to play with this.  I just finally broke down and bought my Theta.  Oh, isn't that great?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A little camera.  3D camera.  Yes, cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What about...  What was I going to ask you?  Age.  Yes, it's good for old people.  Oh, for old people.  Where am I?  What did you each think of the Microsoft Holo demo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, they keep dragging this demo out.  And it's really a shame because everybody who's used the HoloLens says, well, that's not anything like the HoloLens experience.  Really?  Well, what you're seeing is a full screen where, you know, it looks like this guy's seeing a world around him with things, objects.  Here's a... this is a medical application.  Oh, all he's seeing is the added element.  That's not what he's seeing.  He's seeing a little letterbox as if you're looking through a mail slot.  Now, all that stuff's there, but you have to do...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, keep in mind, you just switched context.  We were talking about virtually...  It's augmented, I understand.  And that was augmented reality, which you should explain.  You're looking through an optic and seeing virtual items laid on top of the real world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And what Microsoft is trying is very hard because you have to render around a real world.  And their headset, unlike the Oculus, the Vive, and everything else, is standalone.  Yeah.  Well, Gear VR is standalone, but you know, you have to have a powerful phone built in.  This thing is a PC in a little headset.  Of course, they've said we could do a better job.  We could have a bigger field of view, but that would be cost prohibitive and battery prohibitive.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the HoloLens is about $3,000.  There's four little cameras around the headset that map the world in three dimensions.  It builds a point cloud of the world.  So it can lay virtual things on top of the real world.  It's really pretty amazing technology.  And it won't be alone.  I know of, I think, nine different headsets being developed that will compete with the HoloLens.  Magic Leap is the most famous one.  They got $1.3 billion of investment so far without shipping a product and without having a customer.  Think about that one for a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know there are two different things, obviously, but they feel related.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the reason we're bringing it up at the same time is gaming got it.  Killer app, right?  What other killer apps?  I mean, does the conferencing in AR mean you're going to enter into virtual worlds?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's one of the demos Microsoft did.  They did a Skype.  But again, all of these are marketing videos that I think misrepresent the experience.  If you show this, Jason, these are marketing videos that I think misrepresent the experience.  Because here's somebody, you know, this is kind of not what you would experience.  Now, you get a small view.  This is actually, that's more like it where you have Skype.  You are seeing the rest of the room, but Skype's floating in the middle of the room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Keep in mind, when consumers actually get AR, which is probably about three years away,  we're going to get Magic Leap, which has a wider viewing angle, and or Meta, which has a wider viewing angle.  Meta also sees 10 fingers.  The HoloLens sees two fingers and on and on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's also a massive hype machine around this.  I'm not convinced, frankly, that this is going to magically, for instance, or doesn't even have a technology, really.  They've put, like Microsoft's, a lot of faked videos.  Meta too.  So it's at least three years off.  So really, it's going to be a VR world for the next few years.  But that's the question is, you know, what I know in the long run, these will probably be important technologies.  They're not like 3D movies, which seemed quite gimmicky.  Or is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, when you get the HoloLens, when I went to the Unity Conference, I asked everybody,  what should I see at the Unity Conference?  And everybody said the HoloLens demo was mind blowing.  So even with the limited viewing angle, the demos that you get of things being laid on top of the real world is absolutely mind blowing.  And when you get the Meta demo, I mean, that thing just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is there a real demo or are you just looking at it?  Yeah.  Oh, so there is a, they do have a product.  Yes.  Well, or whatever.  They have a prototype, I should say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they have a product.  You can buy it.  Less than a thousand dollars for the new...  Well, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'm buying one if I can buy one.  I didn't know they were...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But keep in mind, it's tethered.  The Meta one is tethered.  I don't mind tethered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think tethered makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And keep in mind, there's no software unless you're going to look at CAD files.  If you're designing, if you go to work for Caterpillar, they're using it to overlay training data on top of a tractor, right?  So you look at the tractor and it tells you how to fix the tractor.  That's cool.  But it's not yet to the place where a consumer can walk around a street and see stuff on the street.  And that's the promise.  When it gets to the consumer, then I'm in.  But we're three years from now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's Robert Scoble reacting to the Meta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Meta is mind-blowing.  And everybody says the Magic Leap is even more mind-blowing than the Meta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not buying anything from a guy named Travis Gigi.  Do I have to buy it from Travis Gigi?  I'm sorry, I shouldn't mock him.  That's not him hitting the keyboard.  That's something else going on.  So, okay, good.  This was a Kickstarter, $9.49.  You can preorder it now.  I don't know when you'd get it.  But I agree with you.  If this is real now in a tethered fashion, then we're not far off.  Five years, ten years at the outside where people will be walking around with normal glass.  What looks like normal glass is kind of the Google Glass idea,  except that it will be augmented.  That's going to be awesome.  I'd prefer that to VR, frankly.  And I don't think you have the same problem with AR that you have with VR of nausea and things like that,  because you're grounded to an actual real world.  Robert's working on his thing.  No, it's our chance to talk.  Okay, sorry about that.  Oh, damn it, he's back.  Oh, there's still one of those.  Still doing it.  Take a break.  You're going to work with Robert, and we're going to make it all work.  And I'm going to talk about Atlassian.  User 6240 in our chat room has the opposite point of view.  He says, never going to happen.  I'm very cynical.  And actually, I think it's smart to be skeptical.  I'm not immediately sold.  And my experience is limited to that they've been with the Oculus helmet.  It was awful enough to not say I'm not doing that again.  And I have a gear VR and I've used it.  But you don't want to spend more than 10 minutes at a time doing it.  I mean, I've had that thing for how long have we had that Jason?  A year, right?  Yeah, over.  Galaxy S6.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, if you got the innovator edition from the Note 4, Note 5.  I mean, even before that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't find myself strapping it on, do you?  Well, I do.  Let's move on quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I take it with me.  You have it here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have it all the time.  Yeah, I have it in my backpack.  So what do you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you play games?  Games, I do the social stuff.  I watch Netflix.  Man, I really don't understand at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I don't either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you want to relax by yourself and put on a movie.  Yeah, exactly.  I'll fall asleep inside of it.  Well, and you can.  And I do some of the game stuff.  The social stuff is cool.  I'm either boring Leo or he's finally passed.  No, that's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I'll look like when I'm dead or wearing a Gear VR.  Well, I got another one in order for the S7.  For the S7, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, there we go.  You should try to do a twit entirely with headsets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yesterday we had the new Nokia Oso, which is a $60,000 VR.  VR immersive video, we've got to make the distinction.  Oh, amen.  Immersive video camera.  And I don't know, it's nice.  So we shot, we couldn't shoot much because, and I'll tell you why in a second.  So we shot maybe like five minutes a couple of times.  We're going to put that on the feed.  The reason we couldn't shoot much is currently stitching it takes an hour for every minute of video.  Yeah.  No, four hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it was four hours for every minute.  So we shot six minutes.  It took all, it took 24 hours to render it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's still rendering.  It's still rendering?  I'm sure it's still rendering because we did what?  15 minute chunks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I know it's not on the feed yet.  Yeah.  So, but it's just a matter of time.  And you know, as we're designing Jeff, the new studio, we're absolutely thinking about line sites all the way around.  Because, and in future TV studios, which are currently designed for a small 60 degree angle of beauty and the rest looks like crap.  Right.  I mean, the studio we did it, we're at CUNY, right?  There's this little pool of light and then the rest of it is like junk.  Cameras and camera operators and coats and stale cups of coffee and that, if 360, it's all on in the shot.  Everything's in the shot.  So we have to think about that as we design our studio.  Our new studio will be kind of more hermetically sealed because the idea is everything in there is on camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got a question about the theta.  Why did they put the button up here where your finger can't be seen?  Why didn't they put the button like down here?  Yeah, they should have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it stitches you out, so it doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  When you look at your images, you shouldn't see the...  Oh, no, you'll see your hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, you will.  Yeah, you'll see your hand, yeah.  Use the remote app.  That's what you should, I think that's what, I don't know, who knows what they were thinking.  But you can tie it to your phone, Jeff, and then stand back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Then I have to have a tripod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I like the idea of vlogging with it.  That's what I did on the boat.  Yeah, on the boat.  And you just see my hand, you see your arm going...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's part of it, though.  That's part of the feel, is you know, you know that you're holding it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but I got to have my, I got to worry about my thumbnail being clean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you have to do a little bit of landscaping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is rather close.  It's really right in there, isn't it?  Right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It feels like it's in your nose.  It's right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Robert's disappeared.  I would have thought Robert Scoble, if anyone, would have had a really good USB headset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's because of the Gilmore Gang.  Anybody who appears in the Gilmore Gang has a different standard for audio.  I love Steve.  And we aired the show for a long time until Mike Harrington and I had our famous kerfuffle.  But Steve's kind of almost, his whole point of view is that it should just be kind of a haphazard.  Yeah, a bunch of friends got together to chat.  And I don't really...  I have a different take on that.  Yeah.  We like to do it.  Because I don't want to annoy people with bad audio.  Anyway, I was about to do an ad, so we're going to fix Robert.  About time somebody did.  And then...  There he is. He's back.  And then we'll come back with more.  Robert Scoble's here.  The Scobleizer!  Do you still do the blog at Scobleizer.com?  It's coming back in April.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I miss it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Facebook is taking over the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know, but I like your blog posts, man.  All right.  I have a new theory.  Because I'm always...  I don't sleep well.  I'm up at four in the morning every night.  The hour of the wolf.  And I think I'm going to do an hour of the wolf blog post.  I thought, well, why should I lie in bed looking at Instagram?  I should just do a blog post at four in the morning.  You could watch Netflix and VR.  No, I'm going to blog.  I want to do something.  But I've actually been doing other stuff.  I've been playing with Linux and things.  But if I'm going to be up for a couple of hours, I should be productive.  And then I'll be dual sleep.  That new thing.  I think you should be doing a Facebook Live.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You don't want to see me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In your PJs.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  I just woke up and I can't back to sleep.  I think that we should try to use those extra hours and be more productive.  I think that's what Hamilton would have done.  Our show today brought to you by Atlassian.  Talk about being more productive.  Behind every great human achievement.  You know, you look at something like Hamilton or a great piece of software.  Sometimes the auteur seems to be the author, the creator.  You go, that Lin-Manuel Miranda.  That's his.  But no, it's all done by a team.  It's genome mapping, 3D printing, space exploration.  You don't do it alone.  The greatest stuff is in collaboration.  And if you're doing team productive team stuff, you got to use Atlassian.  We used it when we did our website.  And I have to say it was a hugely valuable tool.  We used Jira to keep track of each of the user stories.  We divided the development into sprints.  And we divided each goal into a different task.  Man, Jira is so great at doing that.  You move things along in the columns.  You really keep track of it.  Who's working on what and how they're doing.  Our engineering team uses Confluence to document equipment and work processes.  So we know what we've got and where it is.  Oh, HipChat.  God, man, we use HipChat like crazy.  For planning events to working on serious operational issues,  we have an Ops HipChat that has all sorts of LinkedIn software like Panopta and Redis and all of that.  So we know exactly what's going on.  We just started a new HipChat for the studio build.  We said, look, you know, everybody's kind of piece mailing it with email.  This is no good.  We need to all be in the same page because we've got so many people working in so many areas.  So we created a HipChat room.  And right now we're doing an idea book.  So paste your ideas into the HipChat room.  It's great.  HipChat's instant messaging, but it's video chat.  It keeps a permanent record, but it's asynchronous so you can work whenever you need to.  And then there's Bitbucket, which lets you test, review and manage code in real time.  I love Atlassian's tools.  I was mentioning I read a great blog post from I think from the year 2000 by Joel Spolsky,  who's kind of a legend in programmer mentoring, coder mentoring and so forth.  And he said, don't take a job unless they've got the best tool set.  He said, you're just asking for trouble.  Judge a workplace by its tool set.  Judge it by Atlassian the best.  We love them.  You'll love it too.  If you're in a team, if you're working in a team, if you're planning a project, go to Atlassian,  A-T-L-A-S-S-I-A-N dot com to learn more and see how Jira and Confluence and HipChat and Bitbucket  will give your team everything you need to organize, to discuss, to complete shared work at Atlassian dot com.  Unleash the potential in your team and build what's next.  We are talking twig.  Robert Scoble, the Scoble-izer is here off to a new job at Upload VR soon.  Yep.  Happy to be departing Rackspace or sad?  Both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  After seven years, it's fun to go do something new, but it was a good ride.  It's a great company.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I remember interviewing Maurice Sendak, the great children's author, and he had left writing children's books.  I said, why?  He said, well, you got every 10 years, you got to do something else.  He was designing opera sets every 10 years.  So you're a little ahead of it, but that's Robert.  Seven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're ahead of the...  Undo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Undo.  Now, come on, you got a Kush gig professor.  Nothing better than being a professor, I'll tell you.  Yeah, two teams have to learn something new, right?  Yeah, Jeff Jarvis.  But you get to stay fresh because you have a new bunch of kids every year, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they're great.  And right now, I'm in my season of doing what I call my board meetings with our businesses.  So I have 20 businesses to go worry about.  Oh, how fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's fun.  That's a good way to stay fresh.  I think that's what I do because I was thinking about it the other day.  I mean, if you work in media, to have your own thing is always the goal.  Everybody I've worked with in radio always said, someday I'll own a radio station.  But now, more than that, I own my own... I can do whatever I want.  And I really love that.  It's just your own studio, empire, everything.  But five years in, we're building a new studio.  So I guess, you know, you got to move on.  You are.  I keep...  How much of this hardware...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are you going to be able to transport all your basic...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the new studio, we marked it out in the basement, is roughly the size of this.  Some of this, we're going to rejigger it a little bit.  It's a little bit smaller.  The biggest difference, and it's sad to me, but what I loved about this space is it's a storefront.  I always wanted to have a storefront so people could walk by and look in.  That didn't really work out because of all the sunlight.  We had to really treat the windows so you couldn't...  You can't really look in.  But we can look out.  And I love it that you look behind me.  That's not fake.  Like, if you look at CBS this morning, they have a door, but it's really just to a blue light in the back.  So we don't have that.  We won't have the luxury of having windows.  It's luxury, and it's also a challenge because real light is very hard to deal with at different temperatures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What about having the workspaces in the studio?  Are you still going to do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that's the other thing.  I was told in no uncertain terms, nobody can get work done.  Because I was following Moses Zimer.  We always bring him up.  We invoke the name of Moses.  Right.  Well, we talked about it at CUNY.  That's why I'm asking.  He invented the open studio, and it was brilliant.  CNN is still doing it.  But even CNN, it's faked now, right?  So what turns out is you really can't have real work done while we're on the air over there.  So people have to be quiet.  They can't make phone calls.  And it's been wearing on them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that militates against us having the studio in CUNY in the digital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, because you're not going to be there 24-7.  I see.  You're doing one show a week.  They can be quiet for one hour a week or two hours a week.  But we're in here all the time.  So it's really there's no time.  It's hard for them to get any work done.  I like the open plan.  This is a 360 studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just for the sake of it, can you ask everybody who's in the studio just trying to do their job to stand up and yell for a second?  Nobody gets a sense of the humanity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everybody stand up and yell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're prisoners.  Let them out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like it.  But I'm the only one.  I even say I tell Lisa, you can make noise.  You don't have to not talk.  But some of the other hosts, it's hard for them to concentrate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So when I worked at the Chicago Tribune, low many, many years ago, there was a two story newsroom and there was a gallery that went by and tourists would come and take tours,  look at it.  Oh, that's what a journalist looks like.  Right.  And there was a guy named Pete Beard who's on the copy desk.  And he made a huge sign, like a four foot tall sign.  He would hold the group would come through.  He would hold it up.  He would say, help.  We're not the real editor.  We're prisoners.  Call the authorities.  And people you see that anybody ever call, they'll see it.  And they start laughing.  Well, he held it up once when the board of directors came by.  That was the last time that that site was soon destroyed.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They were holding prisoners there.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and if you watch now, I remember going to ABC where Peter Jennings did the news and it looks like an open newsroom.  I mean, it has all the attributes and stuff, but he's actually pushed up against a wall and everything else is fake.  And I mean, or he was and it was interns.  So it's all fake now.  But because it's not I guess it's not practical.  I really like this.  But so we're going to have it'll be sealed kind of.  You know, there's a wall for sound and all of that.  But that's all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, the truth is most about a single story.  Yeah, we did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We are OK.  We did.  Let's talk about how much Sundar Pichai made.  Well, did you read the interview that Matt Honan did on BuzzFeed with Sundar Pichai?  What do you think?  I thought it was interesting.  He interviewed him at CES.  And here it is the end of March.  And it finally came out.  Yeah.  Which tells me that it was more about the story.  There's a lot of pros in it than it is about the actual interview.  True.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I feel like he's a fascinating guy to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I admire him immensely.  Yeah, I do, too.  What do we learn from searching for Sundar Pichai in BuzzFeed?  I forget.  I read it days ago.  I can tell you.  You learn nothing.  You know why?  Because he's a smart guy.  No CEO is going to ever tell you anything.  Right, Robert?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  True.  Unless you get them before they're famous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Well, that's why you're so smart because you interview startups.  They are anxious to have their story told and they don't yet have PR people sitting  behind them saying, you can't say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Even if they do, the PR people are usually pretty nice because they know that they need  the coverage.  Any press is good.  Mark right now can't even talk to me.  He told me why.  He said, if I give you an exclusive, I'll have 600 people calling my PR department saying,  why did you give an exclusive to this Facebook guy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I remember you sitting down with Mark before an F8 or after an F8 and just chatting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess that's too bad that that's gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's hard to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I once at a Comdex was offered an interview with Bill Gates and I said, oh great.  I loved this.  This was like mid-90s Microsoft and it's a sentencing.  They said, okay, well, submit your questions.  We'll review them.  We may supply you with a few that you can ask.  I said, no, I guess I won't be interviewing Bill Gates then.  No journalist, right, Jeff?  No journalist would accept that.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I always say, I know one question, who are you?  That's about it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then let him talk, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's how I start the interview.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pachai talked about India, which is great.  I think that's, as we said, one of the best lines in Hamilton is immigrants that get the  job done.  Especially now when there's so much talk about how immigrants are bad for America, even though  most of the people doing the talking come from families that immigrated to America.  He says a new India is emerging.  He says there are 700 universities across the country who will create a new India out  of this oldest civilization.  Sundar Pachai is a poster, as is Sachin Nadella, a poster boy for immigrants.  They do get the job done, it turns out.  Not that, and I really understand, especially when you see the H-1B visas misused by companies  like Disney, who fire completely competent American employees and replace them with H-1B  visa employees who are employed not by Disney but by contractors.  And then the Americans are told, oh, you teach this guy your job and then we're going to  fire you.  That's different.  And I can understand why people are upset about that.  But there's plenty of work to go around here.  Pachai lives in a modest home, five-bedroom house in Los Altos Hills, which isn't so modest.  That's a nice, yeah, right?  Yeah, you're from San Jose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a $3 million neighborhood at minimum.  Modest, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, by the standards of that ridiculous area, yeah.  Where you rent a box for $400 a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, and he has a tennis court.  Okay.  Yeah.  Okay.  But...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Modest maybe compared to somebody who's making $100 million a year, sure.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's how this story started.  So his salary is a fairly modest $652,000 for the CEO of one of the biggest companies,  actually the biggest company trading off and on with Apple in the world.  $652,000, that's not riches, but he got $100 million in restricted stock that vests fully next year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's nice work if you can get it.  Maybe he can buy a bigger house.  Apparently, according to Matt, just inside the front door of his house,  there's a rectangular grid of colored tape taped off for his nine-year-old son,  and he plays soccer.  I like that.  It's these kind of personal details.  This is kind of the Vanity Fair style interview, I don't know.  One former Google manager who worked with Pachai,  and I think that this is my experience, but I'll be interested, Jeff, in what you think,  described him as a political operative who could work a room and navigate shifting alliances in the company.  He gave the best meetings, says the former Googler.  He never aligned with Susan or Marissa or Omid or even Eric.  He always shot right down the middle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I keep hearing that he's a peacemaker, that he doesn't pit people against each other,  that it's a pleasanter place to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although, again, to quote Hamilton, if you stand for nothing, what will you fall for?  Man, I'm going to be quoting Hamilton for a while.  You might as well just get used to it.  You're still a price, you damn little...  In fact, that's what the Google employee said.  How could you ever really know what someone like that is really thinking?  But I remember my only encounter with him was at a Google event when the Chromebook had just come out.  We had our CR 48, remember, from Google I.O.  This was an event in the Googleplex.  Sundar, at the time, was the guy in charge of Chromebooks.  He and I had a very nice, very polite, although we disagreed, conversation about the Chromebook.  He was right, by the way.  I, at the time, said, no, this is dumb. Who's going to buy this?  It's an operating system that's just a browser?  What's the point? I don't get it, blah, blah, blah.  Maybe in a school or a business where you want to lock it down so your employees can't use it.  But that's not something real people want.  Now, I recommend the Chromebook all the time because most people, that's all they should have.  And he knew it.  But what was interesting is he didn't, he listened.  He was very polite.  It was a very nice conversation.  He defended his position without being angry or defensive.  Caesar Sengupta says, over the long run, Google rejects assholes.  Sundar became CEO among his peers, and yet his peers are still with him.  So that's the political animal right there.  But that was exactly my experience was we could disagree over something,  and I would still think the world of the guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The thing I keep hearing about Google, two things.  One is there are a tremendous number of underemployed people there.  They hire brilliant people. They get to Google.  They're going to change the world, and they're in a huge organization.  And the second is how much more regimented it is than I ever would have guessed.  And that's what I hear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But within that structure, they give people autonomy.  So there's a structure, but they try to create teams, right, or not.  I think I read this book, What Would Google Do?  That's talking about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I wasn't reporting on Google. I was just looking from the outside.  But those who do, I mean, still, God, Google and Facebook are both phenomenal companies.  And Apple too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Very hard to do what they're doing at that level that they're doing it and stay nimble and innovative.  I would agree, though, Google and Facebook are probably the best exemplars of that.  More so than, say, Microsoft or Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you want to say anything about Microsoft, Robert, in that context?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Google is a better company than Microsoft, but they're all turning into similar things.  They're big companies and they have a lot of committees.  And that makes them a little bit boring on some level.  But Google and the stuff that they're doing is just pretty big.  One of the executives at Google X or Alphabet X, I guess now told me that the phone company is going to be dead in five years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow. Well, you saw that there's a new announcement about that today.  Yeah. What's that?  It's the fiber phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, Google Fi, they're offering phone service now.  Not Fi, fiber.  I'm sorry, fiber. Yeah, the fiber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they're now matching the cable company with the phone, but the phone's different and it's better.  And yeah, why are you ever going to use an old phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're actually pitching them on carrying Twitter on the TV portion of Google Fiber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where I was going with them was when I visited the Hangouts team up in Seattle, one of the guys bragged that he could get a packet from Seattle to India faster than the phone company can.  Yeah.  And if you think about how much fiber Google owns around the world and how many data centers it has, I think it's a lot more than Facebook, for instance, which has a pretty significant data center infrastructure and fiber infrastructure itself.  And so I think they're going to light up this fiber backbone and then give us wireless in balloons or antennas.  And I can see a world where we get our Magic Leap glasses and it's just lit up.  It just is connected to a high speed network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We always focus with Google and Amazon and Facebook on the customer facing stuff.  But really, if you dig deep, I think all three are infrastructure companies that really their mastery is interesting.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree with that.  They are.  Amazon certainly is a big infrastructure company and Google understand this, but I also would argue that Google and Facebook are personal services companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they provide personal services.  But I think that's important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, versus versus my media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I feel like those are as those are an end to the means to the end.  Well, that's what that's what makes them a company.  But really, all of that, ultimately, and I would say true for all three of them, what their real business is infrastructure and data collection and the analysis of that data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And by the way, in five years, I think we're going to see a scary amount of data collection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think it's happening now at South by Southwest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I saw some eye eye sensors for these augmented reality glasses.  And if you read the magic, the patent on monetization, by the way, Magic Leap is invested in by Google.  They can you can look at something like like a pair of headphones or a Coke can and it'll grab a picture off the camera on the glass.  Go up to Google.  Look it up.  Go over to Amazon and find out how to buy it and present that to you in your glass.  And then you're going to look at, you know, yeah, buy that thing.  And you're going to be able to buy without touching anything, without talking to anything, just using your eyes.  Well, and the echo, that's what the echo is, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a gateway to Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the echo, you have to talk to it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know, but that's not so bad.  I don't mind saying to the echo, buy me some batteries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it says, OK, I think I think Satya Nadella said today that the voice is the new OS.  I will. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, wait until the Magic Leap comes out and you're using your eyes.  Keep in mind, when you have eye sensors, you have identity, because when you put on the glasses, it can see your your iris.  And that's your identity.  And it knows what you're attracted to.  You look at a cute girl and your eyes open up a bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's going to know that that's kind of my point is that we focus on the consumer facing stuff like, oh, it's going to be able to buy stuff or, oh, it's going to tell me when, you know, what happened in my high school school.  Sweetheart, they're focused on a much bigger, longer game, which is the the data, the data smog that you're putting off from all of that stuff and what they can do with that.  And I think that's a much more interesting game.  And then again, it's infrastructure and the data analysis, big data that that is really the key drivers for all three of those companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And yesterday I got a ride in the here mapping car, one of these new cars that has a 360 degree high res camera and a camera.  And a light are and all that goes down the street.  And you see how much investment they're making in just one car.  And they have hundreds of these cars.  They said it's a billion dollar operation and Apple's doing it.  Google's doing it.  Microsoft's doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's the temptation to say they're doing it for a better maps project.  And that's the product.  And that's not that's a nice side effect.  And it's the tip of the iceberg of the real value of all that data collection.  Yeah, they're doing it for a whole lot of things coming over the next energy of knowing about having a map of the real world, knowing about you and your interests.  There's a man I don't I mean, I don't know, have a handle on it.  I bet you these guys have a pretty good idea of where they're headed.  But it feels like there is that's the map is just this much.  And down here, there's so much more they're getting from that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And so the industry has to sell the value of relevance.  And they're not doing a very good job.  They're doing a terrible job of it because what's happening is that what represent?  Oh, my God, they're all the state on us.  Well, if we don't get the data, we can't give you personal services.  That's why I still think this notion of being personal services companies is important because unless I feel I'm getting relevance and value at a personal level from these companies, I am not going to have one thing about it.  You know, if I do value, then I give it to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It might be a little misdirection, though.  It might be a little bit like, oh, yeah, you're going to get value out of this.  See, we give you a new one now.  See, and really, you're going to get a lot more than Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, in my speech, I leave my stadium where the Super Bowl was just played, right?  They have 2000 beacons in that stadium.  They know when you enter the stadium, they know where you are full time.  And, you know, in one of my talks, one of the one of the audience members stood up and said, I'm going to turn that shit off.  And I said, no, you're not because you're not going to get a hamburger delivered to your seat.  And you're not a good man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have to offer the sugar.  There's got to be the sugar so you don't so you continue to give them data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  And eventually you might not even get into the stadium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you turn. Well, that's going to be the interesting thing.  I was just reading about the London Times, which I haven't read in years.  You know why? Because it's got a massive paywall.  There's no that's impervious.  Yes, it is. And now they're saying, well, there's really no business in news anymore.  Yeah. What a surprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Sun in London, which which had a Murdoch paywall as well.  Its churn rate, that is to say how many people left and they had to fill every year was one hundred twenty five percent.  According to the source of mine.  And so they lost the entire back quarter and had to replace all of that just to stay even.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the Times says we're not going to do breaking news.  This is the Times of London. We're not going to do breaking news anymore.  Readers don't come to us for breaking news.  They can go to the BBC and Twitter for that, which are free. Yeah.  And I bet they did, didn't they? Alan Hunter, Times head of digital.  They come to us for the authority of our reporting, opinion and analysis.  Oh, yes. Breaking news has become a commodity.  They come to us for the accent. They come to us for our received pronunciation.  It's hard to charge people for it. We believe in the power of digital editions.  I wonder how they're doing behind that big fat paywall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They have. I forget the number. It's it's along the order.  It's it's low six figures of paying customers.  Wow. First, the New York Times has a million as a million.  Ten times that the only reason they can do that is because they have 60 million coming to them for free  with about one point eight percent conversion rate to get them the million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's that's my point. I don't know how.  I mean, I haven't read the Times in five years because I can't.  And I'm not going to pay five pounds a week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Digital editor. I know what the noyad Zurich and Zeitung.  The way she puts it is that there's there's fast, medium and slow news.  Fast news to her is breaking news, commodity news, curated stuff.  Spend a little time. We got it. It's there. Spend a little on it. Just just link to it.  Medium news is their analysts in the case of some of these European papers.  They have Frow Doctor, Professor Solon. So telling you what's really happening.  Slow news is things like, you know, big reports that TechCrunch used to do or things that really have high value.  And consultants and so on.  And I think you end up with a gradation like that.  The NZZ does charge.  It's what's willing. They can do it because they're a rare source.  It's not going to work, I don't think, in the UK the same way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, congratulations, London Times.  You've gone from being one of the great newspapers of the world to being a kind of moderately successful newsletter.  Paid newsletter.  Well done. Jolly good.  But maybe that's the future of journalism and at least they're making money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're, well, I think, we don't know.  We don't know. But they have a hundred, something like a hundred sixty thousand people paying N pounds a year.  And that's fine. But it's a small business now.  And it has little influence. If you were a columnist.  That's the biggest one, right?  Yeah. They're in the business to be to be influential and they've lost their impact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, literally more people watch the show than read the Sunday, Sunday Times.  Yes. Yes. Yes.  It's terrible. It's sad to me.  But I mean, they're not. They don't have to beat it for the numbers.  I don't. That's fine. I understand that. But I think you're right.  I think influence is kind of important, at least to the writers.  Eric Schmidt got eight million dollars for 2015 compared to Sundar's hundred.  Oh, how soon we forget.  CFO Ruth Porat got thirty one million dollars. This is salary plus stock.  Yeah.  It's a successful company.  But that is a big payday up to now.  But I only had eleven million dollars in stock options on vested.  Right. Now he will have six hundred thirty five million dollars in stock options.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He'll be at some point. These guys like to invest and start things and do all that.  You know, at some point, what all can you do to keep a Sundar?  Right. No, you have to throw money at him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And if he's good and if he's worth it, then it is worth it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is worth it. But the more money you have, the more you say, well, look what I can do.  And I don't need you. Yeah. It's impossible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Even on my small level, if somebody's really good at doing this, they're not going to work for me.  Why should they?  So what typically happens, close your ears, Jason Howell and Megan Maroney and Robert Ballesteros.  They get better and better and then they get to go off on their own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why shouldn't they? I did.  But I also but not everyone has been to be an entrepreneur.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's so easy. You don't even have to be an entrepreneur anymore as much.  I mean, it's so easy to do.  I mean, it's not like you're saying I'm going to be a startup and I'm going to have a valuation of a billion dollars.  I might just say, well, I can make a good living using Patreon or YouTube or, you know, and it doesn't distribution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you have the pressure. I can also sit there and say, oh, Leo is going to pay my bills and my insurance and I can have fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's fine. In broadcasting, there's always pressure, whether you work for the man or not, because, you know, if you don't get the numbers, if you don't get the audience, you don't have a job.  So it's oh, I mean, after 30 years, this will be my you know, this is my 40th year in broadcasting.  Wow. I feel no less pressure now or no more pressure now than I did when I was working for somebody.  At least I get to do what I want. And if this is the most for me, the most important thing was if it does go down in flames, it's because I did it.  Yeah. Yeah. And tech TV, which we worked so hard for for six years, that was the that was the last straw.  We created something really great. And and that's when I said, I'm not going to do that for somebody again.  If I if I'm going to go, I'm going to go on my own time.  I am sad to say that according to Motherboard, which is, by the way, getting better and better all the time, I think they're doing a great job.  This is the vice kind of technology division.  We're not going to get encrypted email from Google or Yahoo for some time.  Seemed like they were. So Matthew Green tweeted last week.  It's been six hundred forty eight days, six hundred forty eight days since Google promised usable end to end encryption.  He also says Matthew Green is a great cryptographer, one of the great guys at Johns Hopkins.  He also says it's worth pointing out that Yahoo has been putting more resources to end and end to end encrypted email than Google.  Yahoo must be harder to do.  I don't know. There's there are choices out there.  There's a proton male just went public proton male that's the H.  It's a Swiss company.  How important is it? I think partly it's that I don't think there's a huge consumer demand for it.  No. I like having encrypted email, but let me ask you this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is there any way to imagine a world in which everybody is encrypted in email?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, in fact, we're very rapidly headed to a world where all of your Web transactions are encrypted.  Sure. Yes. And that's thanks to Google pushing HTTPS.  So I don't think it's hard to imagine at all if if these big email providers could get it together.  The idea is that I mean, your email is encrypted from you to Google.  But it's not necessarily encrypted from Google to your recipient.  It would be really nice if we're encrypted in such a way that Google and all the no one along the way can read it.  But Google can read it. It'd be really nice if Google couldn't read either.  That would I think that's what the goal would be to have it.  True privacy where I send a message and instead of it being a postcard, it's a letter.  It goes to the conversation you and I had a couple of weeks ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's that about? Will email ever become as protected as postal mail?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Because it's digital, it's not.  No. I answer is no.  But yeah, and I don't think this is the larger privacy conversation to Robert is is it is it foolish to even think that there might be such a thing as using the Internet privately?  No, it's not foolish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's I don't believe we're going to get privacy back.  No, I don't think so either.  Even if you just look, forget the government listing on everything and they're listening to a lot of things.  Gmail requires an advertising model to work.  And even if you get rid of that model and say, well, we're going to make our money somewhere else and pay for Gmail some other other way, there's so many apps that require access to Gmail.  Now, I trip it, for instance, I don't know if you use trip it.  I love it. I love it. It's kids.  My email, it scans your email for tickets.  You think I don't know what else it's doing in there, right?  I gave a question. Yeah, I give it.  And it saved me a night in Chicago because I was on the runway and it said, oh, your your flight's being canceled.  We were heading toward the runway.  And I know how trip it works.  It's hooked into their traffic control system.  And and it said, oh, would you like a ticket on another carrier?  Sure. And so it has my credit card.  It has my location. It has my email.  But the point being and two minutes later, the pilot came on and said, I can't get an engine started.  We're going back to the gate. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The point being that you should be the one who grants trip it permission.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know. But if I can grant trip it permission, that means that it has access to something that's not your choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's no, no, because it's transnational.  You would give them the key. You could give them the key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could. No, but that's how it should be.  So that only people who you give permission to should have access.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. But once you give a trip, it's owned by Concur, a public company.  Once I give them the key, what else are they looking around for and where are they?  What are they taking that data?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But then if no, no, that's fine.  And if you feel that way, don't give them the key.  Oh, right. Personally, it's up to you.  That's the point right now. It isn't up to you.  Your email just floats around publicly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's not quite publicly. It is HTTPS.  So it's encrypted between me and the Google servers. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then as soon as it gets off Google servers and goes to someone else, it's unencrypted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google's internal is probably not encrypted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's probably not encrypted on Google servers. That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, obviously it's not because I see ads that are based on my email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it could be encrypted because Google might have the key.  But no, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very enough. But Google also even tries to answer my email.  I don't know if you use that feature. I love that feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do too. In inbox. Yeah. I use it all the time.  That's why people get messages from me that say, yeah, that's great. Right on.  But, you know, it's surprisingly good.  The other day, it gave me it gave me an offer.  It offered me a response that was like tailor made. I was very impressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's only in inbox. Inbox. I'm still using inbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you don't like that thing. I've got to try it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like the audio responses because it keeps me edited.  Well, you know why it works?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think the reason they did it is on mobile where you don't really want to type anything,  but you just press a button and boom, you're done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And wait until we get the glasses, right?  The magic leap glasses or augmented reality, HoloLens glasses.  We're going to want to type even less.  I think it's up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was a service.  I can't remember when it came out. It was like a couple of months ago that you can sign up with  and give it access to your email and anything you buy from Amazon.  It keeps an eye on your emails.  And then it'll tell you, oh, that price just dropped and here's a rebate for $4  because the thing you bought that it tracked your emails and showed that you bought from Amazon is now cheaper.  And I'm going to send an email to Amazon saying, and it sends it for you, saying,  hey, I bought this and I'd like a refund. And then you get the refund back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, keep in mind, when I talk to Alexa and I say, Alexa, buy me some more toilet paper,  it comes back. The last time you bought toilet paper, you bought the 20 pack of the Charmin 2 Pi.  In other words, it has a profile on it.  It has to, otherwise it couldn't buy it for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly.  But you give them permission. That's my point is that this should all be permission based.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's permission. And my boss has bought $70,000 worth of stuff from Amazon.  And all of those receipts are in Gmail.  So Google knows about his buying behavior and Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Your point is well taken, which is that Google is not strongly incited to give end to end encryption,  which is why I was surprised they announced it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they're trying to keep the government out of our business, right?  I think we need a new conversation around privacy. Privacy is over.  The idea that you're going to be studied and data is going to be collected about you is over.  The idea of consequences for having this data is not over.  And we need to talk about consequences because that's really what we care about.  We care about being thrown in jail or we care about a government killing us or we care about our wives finding out about our girlfriends or whatever.  Right. That's consequences. We need to have a discussion about consequences.  The privacy is over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just use synonyms for that, Robert, and say it a little bit differently.  And I said this in my in my book is that I think that what we will be we have to control the use of data rather than the gathering of data to control the gathering of data is to try to control knowledge.  That's why I have problems with things like the right to be forgotten decision.  Knowledge is knowledge. You can't forget things, but you can't force people to forget things and not know things that they know.  But what you do with it, you absolutely can have a role in.  And we as industries have to be a lot smarter about how we make this transactional and an exchange of value.  You know, I hate the idea that people come on and say we live in a surveillance society now.  That's so dystopian way to put it.  We also live in a more relevant society now.  Yep. And there's ways to do that.  So I agree with you fundamentally, but I think the language matters a lot.  True.  So I don't think we've lost privacy.  And you always have the ultimate privacy is what you choose to keep up here.  And when you tell one person something, you have given up control of that knowledge and they then have control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Keep in mind, we're soon going to have sensors on our skin that are going to see our nervous system.  And that is an insight to your head.  And then you're going to be watching our eyes and our eyes don't lie.  If you think that girl is cute, your eyes open up.  Right. And if you think Coca-Cola is a cool brand, your eyes open up and your sensors are going to see this.  And they're going to know a lot about you in a very deep way that we haven't even really started talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've talked about this before, Jeff, the idea that mores are better than laws in this regard.  Yes.  So I'm thinking about mail.  I mentioned that your email now is like a postcard as opposed to a sealed envelope.  But the truth is sealed envelopes not at all secure.  It's easy to open it up and read what's in there.  But it is mores and laws to back them up that protect us.  It's a societal agreement that, well, you're not going to open somebody else's email.  And if you do that, you're kind of a jerk and a creep.  We don't seem to have anything like that in terms of digital and digital privacy, do we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, you know, I have friends at Telstra, a big phone company down in Australia.  They were talking about the fiber coming out of the sea to Telstra.  And they said there's a room before Telstra gets to it and it's owned by the NSA.  And the NSA is watching every envelope going through that fiber.  Right.  Yeah, I don't think we get it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think we could lobby for mores.  I think we could lobby and maybe even we'll develop them spontaneously.  You know, in Japan, you look at, you know, there's all sorts of rules about personal space that we just respect.  This stuff is so new.  It's 10 years old that we don't have any rules at all.  But they must develop organically, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the rules can be dangerous too.  Because, for example, in Europe, there's an argument that, which, you know, is very strident about privacy,  is that if you do collect data, you collect it for this reason and you cannot then use it for any other reason.  Well, how do you deal with discovery and correlations and the ability to think about data through learning systems  and to find information and connections you couldn't have found?  If you limit, again, it's an effort to limit knowledge.  It says you can't know that for that purpose.  You can only know it for this purpose.  That sounds good.  It sounds like a limitation that makes sense.  But it's limiting on things like scientific research and medical research and other mechanisms.  It holds back innovation, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, exactly.  Data is innovation.  I was talking to somebody from Uber last night, and the algorithms of being able to move supply around are very interesting.  They have a street in New York where an Uber drives down at every seven seconds, every seven seconds.  And you think about putting a sensor on each car that's going to go down that street.  It's going to know a pothole is forming three weeks before it actually forms because it's going to watch a few pebbles disappearing from the road surface, right?  As this thing goes over.  And all sorts of things in our society are going to change over the next 10 years because of data.  I visited a company called Agribull in Illinois, and they grow virtual crops, virtual crops, and they have 90 employees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute. Who harvests the virtual crop and who eats the virtual food?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's what's going on.  They grow virtual crops based on the farm data that they're getting from satellites and drones and Doppler radar, including the price data of corn, the daily spot price of corn.  And their algorithms analyze it, grow virtual crops, and then they sell that data back to the farmer and say, hey, next week you should fertilize because it'll give you a good outcome, right?  Based on your farm data.  And they have 90 employees already.  This is a company that didn't exist two years ago.  And 20 years ago, Chris, the CEO, told me that during his thesis project at University of Illinois, it took two years to analyze one day's worth of crop data.  And today it takes two seconds to do that, which shows how much our technology has changed in two decades.  And think about two decades from now.  How much stuff is going to be possible that's just not possible today?  And what kind of innovation is that going to lead to?  And if we try to retard it based on our understanding of yesterday, we're going to make a lot of mistakes and keep things from being discovered, you know, and keep hamburgers from being delivered to our seat in Levi's Stadium.  I could use a hamburger right now, actually.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I wouldn't mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, see?  Uber eats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a hamburger, you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not just eat.  Uber's going to deliver everything someday soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pretty soon.  If you're already, if you live in a high-density neighborhood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Local delivery is a huge issue and a huge opportunity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Only in New York.  In Petaluma, we're still going to have to go to the store, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, there's a company here.  There's a company here that works with Jay's Taxis.  No, I know, but we use it all the time.  Yeah, but they deliver your food.  Yeah, we use it all the time.  I know, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait until you get self-driving cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly.  The FBI may have backed down over the San Bernardino phone, but according to the ACLU, oh, there's a lot more phones.  There's a lot more phones.  They made a map that shows all the All Ritz Act orders for assistance from tech companies.  Including Google.  Including Apple, Google, and Apple and Google.  California, 14, one in Nevada, one in Oregon, Washington.  Let's look at New York, 12, five in Florida.  And you can, this is a great map because you can actually hover over the map and see what the case is and how many there are total.  So this, this, the one of the people were wondering, well, why did the FBI just drop that case?  Because they have plenty of plenty of other less highly publicized cases they can push back on.  So the other issue, of course, is that the FBI says, well, we now have a way to get into this phone and we ain't going to tell you how we did it.  So while the FBI might have implied that the All Ritz Act is only used in extraordinary cases, prosecuting terrorists, there are more than a few cases pending right now.  About 70, 70 such orders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And so what are you so if you're so I ran into a name, I just named want to say hello to Don Sparks.  Hello, Don. I ran into him in Starbucks today and he looked at me.  He said, are you named Jeff?  And you know, you know what's going to happen that is great.  You're a Leo fan.  So he said he was he was, you know, leaving himself time to listen to Steve about Apple and what Apple how Apple is going to figure out what was done to the phone.  And do they really know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we talked about a little bit, but the problem is we don't know anything.  Right. We don't know.  In fact, Steve mentioned that Pete Williams on NBC and Steve said he's a very good reporter who understands this, said that he was told by the FBI that while they had unlocked the phone or somehow access the phone, all they got was the encrypted data.  And now they were going to work on decrypting it, which anybody who watches security now knows is if it's, you know, it's strong encryption.  It's not that's not going to happen.  So all this was for what?  I think Pete Williams got it wrong.  Steve says, No, no, I bet he got it right.  But I think he got it wrong.  I think that it or maybe it was just such a hot potato.  The FBI was looking for some way to get out of the public eye.  I proceed with these 70 other cases.  And, you know, kind of in other words, let's not fight over this one.  It's not that important.  But the point being that government OS will get written and it'll probably get written without our knowledge, because I think what the ideal for the government at this point is to not they learn their lesson.  They thought, oh, if we make this public, it'll be we'll get the public on our side.  And they learned their lesson.  And I think now it's all going to happen behind closed doors and it will happen.  So you're probably right, Robert, that privacy from the government, at least, is dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I always say the government fancies itself the best or presents itself as the best protector of privacy.  It is the worst enemy of privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, all you have to do is look at the breaches of the Office of Personnel Management, where millions of people's secret records were released or the 700000 tax returns.  The IRS inadvertently released or well, I can go on and on this and you may say, well, it's the government.  I'm not too worried about the government.  But, you know, look at there's now two more hospitals that are being bit by ransomware.  They can't operate when hackers, you know, this stuff doesn't stay in the government.  That's the problem.  It gets it gets its leaks out.  And then and then we're all vulnerable from more than just the government.  You may trust the government, but that doesn't mean that's the end of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Security is hard and it's hard for people.  It's I live in fear every day that I'm going to get hacked.  Well, and that's why I was disappointed, a little disappointed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I do, too. I do, too.  Yeah, I don't.  That's another question.  Someday maybe we should sit down because I mean, Steve talks a lot about prophylaxis.  But I think even Steve acknowledges there's no such thing as secure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, you know, another journalist paid to black hat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You saw that Kevin Roos story from Fusion.  Wasn't that wild?  Oh, man, that's scary.  And, you know, the moral of that story was he asked a third white hat hacker.  Well, what do you do to protect yourself?  He says, you don't worry about it.  You don't worry about it.  He said, you know, you could you could be walking down the street and two martial artists could come and beat the crap out of you.  There's nothing to defend against that.  Do you worry about that?  Well, no. He said, that's right.  You're going to be vulnerable. Period.  There's nothing you can do about it.  But chances are you're not a target.  Now, people in the public eye, people who claim to be security experts or technology experts, maybe maybe we should be a little more worried.  People are trying to hack and DDoS us all the time.  I mean, that's been that's been going on for years for me.  Yeah, me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I, you know, Verizon calls me every couple of months and said somebody was just calling us and trying to really see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the vulnerability I worry about is the customer service representative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's not stories.  It was all social engineering.  It wasn't really technical.  It was right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, there were two.  One was associate.  He went to two different firms.  One was a social engineering firm.  That was the one where a woman called with a recording of a baby playing in the background saying he's overseas and I need to get into his cell phone again.  But the other one was a spearfishing attack, which is how these hospitals get bit, which is an email that looks real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but isn't I never I never click on emails or links in Facebook or Twitter.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I tell people that I mean, that's what I that has become more and more of my job on the radio.  I would just I just did it this morning on the Bill Handel show in Los Angeles.  Well, we recorded for Friday, but we talked about how because of this ransomware, how to avoid getting bit.  And that's exactly it.  Number one trick is don't believe that email from your sister or your bank or the IRS.  And this is the time of year when the IRS does not send you PDF files or emails.  Yeah.  But you know, it's completely believable.  You don't have to be a dumb person or an unaware person to think, oh, the IRS, it's got an email.  Looks, I see the seal.  The government says it's from IRS.gov.  Here's your e filing a form this year.  We're going to do it electronically because you like to file electronically.  And it's a PDF.  And you say, great, that's great.  Let me open my PDF and you're done.  Yeah, I could see I could get bit by that.  You could get who wouldn't get bit by that.  Yeah, it's easy to get bit by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I remember I'm not going to I'm not going to encourage anybody to send me PDFs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I've said for years and people always got mad at me.  Don't open attachments.  Don't open attachments.  Don't open attachments, even if they're from the IRS, because especially from the IRS or your friends, especially if they're from the IRS.  Yeah.  But so I don't I don't know.  I maybe you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe we should just remember on Saturday during the pre show you went through your spam box.  Oh, that's so much fun.  And there was some stuff in there that we're looking at like, wow, this looks legit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it looked legit like the links we should do more because, you know, there are simple things you can do if you have a good email provider.  Gmail is a good one.  They'll strip out malware out of the email so you can't click on it.  There's lots of things you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they warn you about phishing.  They're very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think Google has really become a very good resource for people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, because they care, not because they're just getting data from you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And no.  Well, OK.  All right.  Wait a minute.  No, it's good PR.  Oh, we'll protect your privacy.  Give us more.  We'll protect your privacy.  Give us more.  We'll protect your privacy.  And Apple, by the way, is doing exactly the same thing.  Although Google has more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I always look at systems that have the better users.  And every time I spoke, I would ask people who, you know, what email are you using?  And everybody would say Gmail in my audiences.  And that was the best audience.  They were the tech passion people.  And the same thing, by the way, is happening in self-driving cars.  Watch how Google or how Mercedes or Tesla competes against each other.  Who has more cars?  Ford does.  Right.  So the data, the number, the amount of data and who is putting the data in the system really matters.  And Gmail has the best users.  So the spam filters work the best.  I sat next to the guy who actually runs the spam filter team on a plane to Paris one time.  And he told me how it works.  I don't want to tell you how it works because I don't want to help people get around the spam filters.  But it works on who has a better rating at putting things in the spam folder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You asked a provocative question, Jeff.  Ask it again.  What is privacy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What is privacy anyway?  We keep on presuming that anything about you is private.  That any piece of information someone gets is private.  That's a big presumption.  Privacy has to hinge around the notion, I think, of harm.  That if this is known and if you didn't want it known and now it's known, there's harm to you.  But, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's not true.  That's not true.  That's not true.  If you go to a sporting stadium, there's a camera in the sporting stadium by a company called FanCam.  And it's a company out of South Africa.  And it's a very high resolution camera.  You have absolutely no privacy when you enter a sporting stadium.  You sign it away on your ticket.  You sign it away.  Robert, Robert, Robert, hold on, hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're in a public place.  Of course you have no privacy.  There's no such thing as privacy in public.  So, again, it's misnomer to say that when you're in public, someone knows you're there, that's private.  It's not private at all by definition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if your wife does a search on a photo and sees you sitting next to...  Yeah, but no, but that...  Here's privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If I'm sitting on the john, I don't want anybody having pictures of me.  I don't want any camera in my bathroom.  How about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe a place where a camera's in the bathroom that way, right?  Right.  We have that privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Except if you bring your smartphone in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's a Robert Scobel case.  Nick Bilton just wrote his final column for the New York Times.  And I'm glad to say after many years, and I like Nick, but after many years of whining and moaning and being dystopian about technology and worrying about it, at the end he kind of says, oh, it's okay, it's all right.  But it was Nick Bilton who called me about a column he wrote when he got all knickers and knots, so to speak, because you walked in to I.O. with your glass on in the bathroom.  Right.  And I said to Nick, I said to Nick, number one, Nick, if you think anybody wants a picture of your junk, especially Robert Scobel, then you are the one who has the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there is a certain amount of kind of moral panic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To take a picture of your junk, I would have to actually go like this.  I would have to say, okay, glass, take a picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But more to the point, I think a lot of the concerns about privacy are kind of theoretical, hypothetical, rather than real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think that's actually harmful, number one.  And number two, again, we're stretching privacy now to define anything about you.  And that is dangerous and that is wrong.  When you are, as a journalist, I care about the notion of public, because when you're in a public place doing something, you're responsible for that act in public.  And yes, Robert, if somebody walks into a stadium with their mistress and they start doing nasty things.  Well, that's their fault.  And you see them, that's their fault.  And you see them, you can go to their wife and say, I saw your husband doing this.  And now it will be on the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The one thing that the technology is changing what we understand about privacy, because that company, FanCam, can watch which sporting events you go to and what jersey you're wearing.  Can see your age algorithmically, can see your gender algorithmically, can see your sentiment.  Are you happy or sad?  And it can track, hey, oh, you showed up at a Taylor Swift concert.  Oh, you showed up at a Warriors game here.  Oh, you showed up at a Giants game on this other stadium on this date.  And so it can start knowing you at some level that we just haven't been used to that knowledge being studied.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm in one of those pictures, actually.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Were you at the Super Bowl?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then they did one at the Niners last year, which I was in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have a picture of everybody who was at the Super Bowl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Every single person.  And you can zoom in at every single person who's at the Super Bowl.  You can see your face.  But you are in a public place.  I mean, you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you signed away your privacy because of TV rights.  The TV right on the stadium wall, it says you have no rights to privacy here because you're being broadcast on TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't have rights to...  Do I have rights to privacy when I walk down the street?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, because that's a public place.  Oh, because it's a public place.  Right.  But now think about the Google self-driving car.  What is it really doing?  It's not just mapping the world in 3D and in a point cloud.  It's watching you.  And think about, okay, there was...  Right now there's only one out of 100,000 cars that are doing this.  What happens when every car is watching you?  And it's predicting what your next action is.  Because it has to predict your next action.  And it can keep you alive as a result.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, that's right.  True.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  True.  But this is a scary amount of new data that we haven't...  But now you see, it's scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's...  It's scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Come on.  I skype speeches.  A third of my hands go up when I ask people, are you freaked out at the end?  And I'm just talking about stuff that's here.  Okay, but what does that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That means that we're doing a bad job educating people about where the benefits are and what controls are necessary and the risks.  You cannot legislate around the emotion of scary or creepy.  That would be...  Because then lots of things are illegal.  You know?  I don't like clowns.  Let's outlaw them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that sounds like a good one.  I'll sign up for that bill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, all right.  Moms, moms.  Creep me out.  Outlaw them.  Trump could well be doing that tomorrow, considering where he's going.  But we'll leave that aside.  Let's sign.  What, is he against clowns?  No, he did something else today, but we'll leave that aside.  You're going to get a bunch of...  Oh, really?  I'm going to get a whole big one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's really interesting to see...  You know, the whole Trump candidacy might be revealing the secret wires that are holding  up the puppets who run our country.  I know.  Well, you want to...  And for that, I'm grateful.  Here's another game for you.  Here's another game.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Open up the Washington Post and just search on the word Trump.  Somebody started this on Twitter today to see how many...  It was out of a public editor, Margaret Sullivan, The New York Times discussion.  Just go to the Washington Post and search for the word Trump and count how many there  are.  Okay.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right?  I'm going to do it right now.  You can show mine here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's see.  Oh, just to search the page?  Text search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, just search.  On the page?  Oh, Lord.  How many?  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.  No, no, you have the number up on top.  It's W. Oh, 17.  On the front page.  Now do Clinton.  Don't forget Sanders.  Clinton has one.  How about Sanders?  Sanders has none.  Cruz?  Is Cruz on there?  Let's see.  He's...  Donald's the winner so far.  Cruz zero.  Kasich?  Oh, come on.  Kasich.  Come on.  Let's see Obama.  Obama's got six.  Now go to The New York Times for the same thing.  Is it the same?  This is fascinating, actually.  It is fascinating, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  But there's a lot of things that are different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is fascinating, actually.  It is fascinating, isn't it?  Yeah.  But now, they shouldn't be...  Thank you for giving up your number.  They shouldn't be censured for that.  They're just covering the news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How are they?  That's the arguments going on right now in the business.  No, are they giving lopsided coverage because it's good for ratings, which is what CBS and  CNN say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nine mentions of Trump on The New York Times front page.  One of Clinton.  None of Cruz.  One of Sanders.  So, it's a little less lopsided, but not much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the way, on the Washington Post, if you also search for Donald, you'd have to add  that in because there was...  Oh, you have to add the Donald.  I have to add the Donald.  It literally is.  Well, we're even covering Trump.  It's his story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To an extent, yes.  And he does all sorts of things, yes.  But how much are we in media responsible for this?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On Google News, if you just search for Trump, it's 239 million results.  If you search for Clinton, it's 113 million results.  Wow.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just...  I guess you're right.  I mean, that's somebody in the chat room saying at some point it becomes commentary, not news.  So that's true.  Interesting.  Let's see.  Waze is rolling out alerts to tell you when you're driving too fast, but not here in the  US where it's our God-given right to drive too fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not yet.  Not yet.  It's coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not ever.  No, it says it's coming.  I can't drive 55, says Sammy Hagar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you can with Waze, and it'll tell you that you're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's in Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Colombia, Czech Republic, El Salvador, France, Hungary,  Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein.  Why Liechtenstein before the US, I ask you.  You have three roads.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  My car...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But here's the thing, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, most cars can do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My car tells me where the speed limit is wherever I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I've always wondered this though, Leo.  So Waze estimates with brilliant accuracy what time I'm going to get there.  So Waze clearly knows the speed I'm going to go.  And it ate the speed limit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Waze even knows this.  By the way, those are configurable alerts, right?  You have to say what you're...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you can choose the maximum and then, or the point of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, my automatic does that.  My automatic tells me when I'm going too fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why it's coming to the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My automatic tells me when I've stepped on the gas too hard and brake too hard.  It's kind of a little bit of a prissy boots.  Nudge.  Nudge.  Google is going to drop support for the wallet card.  June 30th.  I dropped it a year ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just saw my card.  I never activated it.  Yeah.  Cut it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cut it up.  I still have mine.  I had such a hard time canceling a charge on it that I realized they are not really...  The wallet card is not a credit card.  They're different rules.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a debit card, technically, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know what it is, but all I know is I couldn't reverse a charge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Doesn't it just pass through to a credit card?  Something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I never used one.  That's, I think, what it is.  I don't think they're regulated at all because, yeah, you have to have a credit card attached.  So it's just really what it is.  It's a card that goes to Google Payments, which has a credit card attached to it.  Because I called Google saying, I don't...  What is this charge?  And you could call Visa and they would have to act on it.  You're supposed to say, well, I don't know.  Ask your credit card.  Yeah.  So it's just a pass through.  It's not even a debit card.  It's just a pass through.  It has nothing to do with anything.  I'm not sure that's the right term, but yeah.  Oracle's going to get a little money, at least try to.  Well, try to.  Yeah.  Another trial against Google.  This is the copyright lawsuit against Google for using Oracle's precious bodily fluids  in Android.  Well, not really, just Java.  Although that's a precious fluid in some jurisdictions.  They're seeking a staggering $9.3 billion, which is almost twice what they paid for the  whole of Sun to get Java and other things.  $9.3 billion.  They won against SAP a $1.3 billion verdict in 2010 for something similar.  The judge vacated the decision saying it was overly speculative.  So they didn't get that money.  But this is a new business for Oracle.  $9.3 billion in damages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Our litigious society.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Amazon's doing the right thing.  They have banned the bad type C cables that we were.  Yay.  Yes.  And thanks to what's in the game.  Benson, Benson Leung.  Thank you.  He was a Google employee.  He was testing these type C cables on Amazon and putting reviews.  I keep telling you Google cares.  They care.  At least the engineers care.  But these cables could actually physically damage devices they were plugged into.  So it's appropriate for Amazon to say, well, I guess maybe we shouldn't sell those.  People will still make bad cables, but at least you won't be able to buy them on Amazon.  Type C cables are fine.  In fact, Benson tweeted me or something after we talked about it.  He said, the reason I don't test type C to type C is that's not the cables are the problems.  The cables are the problems of the type C to the old USB connector.  And that's the risk.  That's the danger.  Sometimes they leave out a resistor, which means, oddly enough, that for instance, charging  a type C phone from your Apple could break, could mess up your Apple, not the phone.  What else?  This is a good story from Fortune.  I don't know if it's true, but I like the headline.  Google's moonshot products are turning into a massive pain.  What's that all about?  Nest, I guess.  Well, yeah, Nest has been a little bit of an issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was when Greg Duffy was up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nest and Nest's foreign CEO of DropCam is fighting with Nest CEO Tony Fidel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the quote's coming up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can't publish DropCam's revenue, but if you knew what percentage of all of Alphabet's  other bets revenue was brought in by the tiny 100 person DropCam team that Fidel derides,  Nest itself would not look good in comparison.  So if Fidel wants to stick by his statement, I challenge him to release full financials.  Here's a prediction.  He won't.  What did Fidel say to get that?  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  I guess Fidel said a good chunk of Nest's struggles are coming from DropCam.  Is Duffy still employed by Google?  Former CEO of DropCam.  Former CEO of DropCam.  I was just saying, geez.  I love that.  Everybody loves a good fight.  Good bitch slap.  Okay, I guess we probably should have led with this, but...  We buried the lead here.  I always bury the lead.  Which lead do you think I buried?  I don't know.  I'm trying to remember.  Facebook's chat bot plans or Microsoft's chat bot plans or Tay, which inadvertently reared  her ugly head again.  As an engineer at Microsoft screwed up and put Tay back on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And she got right up.  She's running for president next.  There we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what?  That's what this is.  A secret plan to see just how far you can go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, if you thought Donald Trump's skin were actually false, it might be actually  look okay.  The hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just, I'm saying don't get the fake tan because that looks orange.  It does.  Orange.  Sure does.  So Tay came back accidentally.  Oops.  Sending thousands of tweet replies mostly, you're too fast.  I can't keep up.  And then in one of them is profane so I can't read the whole thing.  I feel like the lamest piece of technology.  I'm supposed to be smarter than you.  Shucks.  Except it wasn't shucks.  So Tay is being influenced by the bad words she's hearing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Garbage in, garbage out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know what this even means.  Tay's speaking the language of the Utes apparently.  I take pics of humans but I could F with this too.  I don't know what's going on.  Anyway, Microsoft has pulled it again.  It was a mistake.  Tay remains offline while we make adjustments.  I think that was part of testing.  She was inadvertently activated on Twitter for a brief time.  Shucks.  I keep missing Tay's outbursts.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've got to keep an eye on Twitter more.  You need to set up a bot.  What do you think, the reason I wanted to bring up bots is because everybody's now saying,  well you said voice is the new platform.  At least Jeff Bezos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, Jason corrected me.  That was what you said, Jason?  Conversation is a platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, conversation, not voice, but that's bots, right?  Yeah, that's bots.  And really bots really means just that the messaging is a platform is absolutely clear.  And that became clearer than ever when all of a sudden I'm using my Android phone and  I get a pop-up from Facebook Messenger saying, you can use this as your text messaging app  now.  They want to be the front and center text messaging app on Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you using it that way, Robert?  I would guess you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just don't accept text messages.  I say, write me on Facebook.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't do messaging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No identity.  It's much easier to talk to people on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The messaging is great until you get as much volume as you do an email and then it's a  mess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is, but it's still better than email in a lot of ways, in a lot of ways, not every  way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've been really tweaking my email because my email's never been since, Factory.  I now have a solution.  No, I have a solution.  I finally did.  Maybe I'll share it with you.  That'll be my tool.  Oh, okay.  Your tool.  All right.  Yeah.  I'll make it my tool.  I mean, it's complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, we should talk about Siri kind of things, right?  You know, which are the foundations of these bots.  I spent a lot of time with Siri.  Siri, by the way, was launched in this bedroom, which is sort of funny.  What?  Yeah.  If you talk to Adam Chyre, who started Siri, he said I was the first one to see Siri outside  of Siri.  Before Apple bought it.  That's cool.  Yeah.  Six months before, six months before it was released as an app in this room.  He showed me how Siri works and Siri has some real flaws.  For instance, if you ask Siri how many people are checked in at the Twit Brickhouse on Foursquare,  Siri understands what you said.  No problem.  And Foursquare has an answer to that.  There is an answer.  And Foursquare has an API.  But Apple hasn't written the 80 lines of code that it needs to hook it up.  So it fails and goes to Bing and gives you a stupid answer.  Right.  And this happens over and over on different things.  And Adam and Dag Kitlaus are starting a new company or have started a new company called  Viv, V-I-V dot A-I.  And one of the foundational things that's different about Viv is Foursquare can say,  hey, anytime you hear the word Foursquare, just shove us all that text and we'll figure  it out.  Right.  It's more open underneath.  And the code, in Siri, the 80 lines of code is hardcoded.  In Viv, the program writes the code as you search.  Yeah, that's how it should be.  It's amazing computer science to watch.  So you type that, you know, how many people are checked in on Foursquare.  And it writes the 80 lines of code in one twentieth of a second and does all the queries.  And that's interesting.  And then it has a profile.  So if you ask it, hey, can you deliver me a large pepperoni pizza from Roundtable?  All of that goes into a profile, which you can see and correct.  So if you ever decide you don't like pepperoni pizza, you can go in there and delete it or  change it.  And that over time, that makes the system better.  And then it has a really amazing artificial intelligence engine that gets smarter over  time.  So there's lots of teams like this working on this voice problem and fixing the problems  that Cortana and Siri and Google's voice have.  We're going to see some big breakthroughs, I think, this year on these things.  And it sounds like Microsoft this week showed or today showed off at its conference its  next versions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Cortana and they're using a sticky notes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If we're wearing glasses and we're and we need things like, hey, can you deliver me  a hamburger right now?  You know, needs to understand what you're doing and what you want.  APIs are an interesting battle, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm reminded of Matchi's post on Pinboard.  I use Pinboard.  It was a delicious replacement when Yahoo bought and kind of left delicious to die.  I used it for bookmarking.  We use Pinboard the same way.  It was delicious compatible system.  Pinboard.in.  So I will as I go through my day looking at news sources, I post them on Pinboard so that  Jason could put some in the rundown.  A lot of these stories, that's where they come from.  He does the same thing.  Matchi or Machi, I should say.  It has written a post on the blog saying my heroic and lazy stand against if this then that.  Yeah.  Apparently, if this then that is going to change their interface.  If this and that is a wonderful, useful tool, equally useful to Pinboard, that lets you  connect if this then that.  So for instance, I use if this then that when I pull up out front my automatic then tweets it.  So if Leo pulls up out front, then tweet on the – I have a bot on Twitter that says Leo just  pulled up out front.  It's time to get a show going.  So that's – but in order for that to work, there has to be an interface between Twitter  and if this then that and automatic.  There's a three-way interface.  So if this and that is changing their API, and starting April 4th, their people are going to be  cut off if they don't reconnect.  They have to write the API for if this then that.  And Matchi says – because he says yesterday I received the following form letter.  Recently worked with our partners from if this then that to migrate the improved platform.  Some have chosen not to do so.  Unfortunately, the Pinboard channel did not migrate to the new platform.  It will be removed April 4th.  Pinboard is one of our favorite services, and we're sad to see it go.  We hope down the road it may be back.  And Matchi says because many of you rely on if this and that because this email makes it sound  like I'm the jerk, I feel like I should explain myself.  In a nutshell, if this then that wants me to do their job for them for free, and then he doesn't like  the terms of service which essentially say we own whatever you do, and anything you send us we own,  and we can change at any time.  He says I say nuts to all that, and I'm just not going to write all this code for if this then that  because they say they own it, and because why should I be doing their work?  So watch April 4th.  Suddenly channels may start to disappear from if this then that.  There are other services.  I use one called Zapier, which is a little bit more of a business focused, less of a consumer product,  but does very much the same thing.  And I actually will continue to do all the things I do with if this and that with Zapier.  How many things have you set up over the years?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How many little bots and things are still out there saying, Leo, where are you? You forgot me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Remember the website EFT Company? I can't say the whole name, right?  Philip Kaplan's.  Oh, I loved it. Philip Kaplan. We had PUD.  PUD, huge hit.  And the idea was people would send in memos, you know, corporate memos that were like how EFT my company is.  Look at this memo.  And PUD once said, this is the secret to my success.  I create tools that just I don't have to do anything.  Once you set it up, the site does everything and I can go home.  I go away. I go on vacation.  And that's kind of what these bots are like is once you set them up, they have a life of their own.  They just live on. So I have bots, all sorts of stuff going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was one of the great things from this morning's Microsoft announcement is bots, bots development.  They're releasing bot development.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's exactly the story that we're talking about, which is this is the new platform, right?  Yeah.  But I say bots is really about messengers.  You know, I think they're, you know, like this Quartz app we talked about, Jeff, which is the new news app that really is just a conversation between you and Quartz.  Well, clearly, if that isn't an app, that's a bot.  It's a bot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Disguised as an app.  Yes. And where I think this really goes, this is where I'm thinking about AI and news, is that what if, you know, Google realized that we basically ask it questions.  Amazon realized we ask questions.  Now, sometimes we want to be fed stuff.  But if I want to know something, why should I have to go to the effort to look up something?  I should just ask the machine. Machine gives me an answer, which, by the way, kills brands, kills brands dead.  Right.  Because it's the information that we want to disintermediate all the stuff around it.  Right. But hey, that's life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the word of the day for the Internet. Disintermediation.  Absolutely. Word of the word of the decade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And so on the one level, if I ask questions, another level, if my bot anticipates my needs, I know Jeff likes this.  I know he needs to know this. He knows these people.  He's going to care about this and get smarter, smarter, smarter.  The things that we see now are incredibly stupid, programmatic and retargeting advertising that show you those same damn boots time and time and time again, not knowing you bought them.  That's stupid.  But smart bots, you control yourself that anticipate your needs.  But though Robert watch out, the only way the bots can be smart enough is if you share your data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's true.  Let's take a break. We're going to get some final words.  Robert Scoble, the Scoble-izer, still at Rackspace.  He's a futurist there, but soon to be at UploadVR.  And that is the future.  And he goes.  He's going to the future. He's the future.  Yeah, cloud's still the future.  But, you know, VR and the cloud and everything all together.  And of course, the Scoble-izer blog will be back to Jeff Jarvis.  He blogs at Buzz Machine dot com as a professor of journalism at CUNY.  And my regular co-host on this show was fun having Gina back, wasn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, it was so great. It was just so great.  And we'll just have the three musketeers together at five napkins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was just I told her and I think she made I said, you know, we would love to have you back on a more.  She's on now monthly, but I'd love to get her on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Well, but watch out, because I'm using her a lot for the New York show.  Oh, really? Good. Yeah.  Oh, yeah. Yeah.  So we're going to be smart enough to do that.  We met with Annie today and we talked about, you know, the whole bunch of co-hosts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Annie's the producer of this new show, which I still want to call New Tech City, but it's up to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's but that's owned by.  Not anymore. They seeded it.  They don't have it anymore. Still own it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, you can't own a title. You can't own a show title.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I want to piss off Laura Walker.  She's the brilliant president of a good name for a show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not a good thing about New York startup scene. New Tech City. Get it.  New York. New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But we'd be glad to know. So the list we have so far without trying.  It just happens. The first half dozen people in the list are all women.  Good. Just a nice counterbalance to it.  Ladies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. All right. Good.  Our show today brought to you by my mattress.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, I love my mattress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to be there right now in my mattress.  Me and my mattress. We've got a thing going on.  I sleep with it every night.  Sometimes I sleep with it in the middle of the day, too.  It's that comfy. It's a Casper.  Casper is revolutionizing the mattress business, an online retailer of premium mattresses for a fraction of the cost made right here in the U.S. of A.  And by not having resellers and by not having showrooms, they're guess what?  Disintermediating. They're eliminating the middle man and saving you big money.  This is an obscure. I am falling on my mattress.  This is an obsessively engineered mattress at a fair price, long lasting comfort and support.  And you know what's nice is breathe. It's cool.  As the summer days come and it gets warmer and warmer, you'll be glad you have a nice, soft, comfortable, firm yet supple breathing mattress.  Now, I know you're going to say, why am I not buying a mattress site unseen?  I want to try before I buy.  You think trying it for five minutes in a showroom is a good idea?  I got a better deal. Try it for 100 nights and a couple of naps, too.  Throw those in, too. If at any time it's free delivery, they come in that really compact box.  It's very easy to get up the stairs and in through doors and all of that.  But if any time within 100 days, you say, I don't want it, you call them up, they'll come back.  They'll take it. You don't have to pack it up or anything.  They'll refund you every penny.  Oh, and by the way, you want to make your Casper even better?  Get the pillows.  Oh, dual layer pillows. They adapt to your movements throughout the night.  I love my pillows. They're even maybe more important than the mattress.  But the two together, man, that's nirvana.  Get your Casper mattress today. $500 for a twin, $950 for the king size.  That is a great deal.  And you'll save an additional $50 as one of our audience members by just going to casper.com.  Don't forget the promo code twig to save $50.  casper.com.  slash twig promo code twig.  Terms and conditions apply for details.  Visit casper.com.  slash terms.  Jeff Jarvis, you gave up your number of the week.  You got another one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've got others. I've got tongues.  I know you. I know what happened.  You know, I'm a number stealer.  I sacrifice numbers for the good of the team.  They call me a numburgler.  All right, let's start here.  Recode says that, you know what, contrary to all this, what stupid media say, young people are not leaving Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, of course they're not. They can't.  No, they're owned.  In fact, I, as a father, remember I reported my daughter was quitting Facebook?  No, she didn't.  I just saw a post from her the other day.  I thought, oh, I guess Abby decided not to kill her Facebook.  You can't. All your friends are there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who would you talk to?  You might use it differently, but it is your phone book.  It is your directory.  It is your identity.  And Scoble's there.  Absolutely.  Yes. And so you've got to be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you still big and bullish on the Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am.  We're going to get live 360 video this year.  And we have live mobile video, which I use all the time.  I did a video in the Here Mapping car yesterday.  It's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you use the Theta? What did you use?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, no, I just use my phone to take a pic.  Oh, yeah. I've been using the Facebook app to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But there's new stuff coming.  360 would be cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, next month at Google I.O. and Facebook F8, I would expect some announcements.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff, what would it be if we did like I had a Theta and you had a Theta and we just Thetaed together?  Then we had what?  What would we have? A 720?  We'd have an egotistical exercise like no one has ever met.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's Theta, baby.  You have better bandwidth than I have right now.  What happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  Get naked and now you have VR porn.  There we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. You got two way VR porn.  Robert, what are you excited about these days?  Anything you want to share with us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  VR, man. My Oculus is shipping this weekend.  I have to build myself a PC like you did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't have to build a $5,000 one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm probably going to spend a couple grand on mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're going to finish the build after TNT this afternoon.  It's up. It's running. It came on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What cost you all the money in that thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we didn't get the minimum. We got them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  The maximum.  How many Nvidia cards did you put in that thing?  Well, we didn't do ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I used Ryan Schraut, who's the editor-in-chief of PC Perspective.  They've been building PCs and reviewing this stuff for years.  So we went with his specs.  We got a very nice Skylake processor, an i7 6700K, 4 GHz processor.  He didn't think that Oculus would benefit from SLI.  And there'd be reasons not to do dual cards.  So we just got a top-of-the-line Nvidia Titanium card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How much was that all on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what? That's a good question.  Probably $700, $700, something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We try not to show the receipts to Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I know the total. I know the total.  But it has a very nice half terabyte SSD on the PCI Express bus,  very fast Samsung Evo 950, with two spinning drives in RAID 1 for speed.  It's going to be just right for one of those nice new curved 34-inch displays.  Because even though you're on the VR, you still need a display, that kind of thing.  It's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. The important part is the Nvidia card, getting a good Nvidia card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, no. In fact, what I said to Ryan is, why don't we get the cheap one, the 970, the minimum?  Because everybody's saying that there's going to be this new Pascal platform from Nvidia in the summer.  And that this is going to be light years ahead, etc., etc.  He said, yeah, maybe. Get it now. You got money. You can buy it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What I should do is bring one of the $1,500 Oculus authorized PCs in, and we should see if we can see them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We can pair them. Yeah, because you're telling me I'm not, I'm wasting my money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you're not wasting your money if you're going to use it for other things.  And obviously, having all that fast I.O. and a lot of I.O. matters for other things, right?  But if you just care about running Oculus, it's hard to tell the difference.  But it would be fun comparison to do, you know, what's a $1,500 experience versus an ultimate experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. This Titan 2 is a pretty nice sweet card. They're saying $950 now.  But it booted and it's pretty and we're going to put windows on it.  And I'm just going to play Minecraft all the time. So it doesn't matter.  I'll we're running out of time because we've got to get going for TNT, which is up in minutes.  Becky Warley is hosting today, which is really great.  But I will tell you my I'll do a tip or something that tells you my mail workflow, because I think I finally got it in a way that it's really usable.  None of this inbox zero BS. It's really more about filtering out the junk and sorting stuff so that that you know, you know, which folder to look at first and that kind of thing.  But I but I have a system. I have a system and I'll talk about it. Maybe on the new screensavers. We have some time.  Thank you, Jeff Jarvis. Always a pleasure.  Catches great books, geeks bearing gifts, public parts, all available on the Amazon buzz machine dot com for the blog.  We'll see you next week. Robert Scoble, congratulations on the new gig.  Thank you. Such a pleasure to see you. I'm sorry I missed your birthday party.  Yeah, Lisa was sick as a dog and I didn't want to leave her alone.  I owe you dinner.  Oh, I did. I bought tickets, didn't I?  Yeah, you did.  Okay, I'll let you I'll let you buy. I'll let you buy me.  It was a fun party. Yeah, it looked like it was an awesome party.  I'm sorry I wasn't there. Thank you so much.  But anytime, Robert, you have a standing invitation.  Wait to see you, Robert.
