Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, and it is lovely here.  The weather is wonderful  and the wine and the cheese is fantastic.  And not only that, the other fantastic thing is Nougat.  Oh, look at that.  I've been testing Nougat and I tell you,  it's a very rich and full-bodied operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a hefty chunk of Nougat you got there, Mr. Elgin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We discovered that this piece of,  the woman who sold this to us hacked off this piece  and we found out how much it cost.  This is more than 50 bucks right now.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why did you not ask for a smaller chunk?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because I didn't know it would cost this much.  We figured how much could it possibly cost.  Oh, but it is delicious, isn't it?  Oh yeah, but this is made with honey  and this is the really hard-for-kind caramel flavor,  but it's so delicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is so good.  I remember when I was a little kid,  like 11 years old, going to the south of France,  and there's some town that's like Nougat town.  I've told this story before, there was Nougat everywhere.  Even the gas station sold Nougat.  I love Nougat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I had never tried it other than what you find  at the bottom of whatever candy bars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's good.  And by the way, it looks like you've got great internet.  Are you at an Airbnb?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm at an Airbnb and it really is great,  but we're in the old part of the city,  so this is a very old building.  You can tell because all the plumbing  and electricity is external.  Nothing goes through the walls.  And so I was around the corner  and the internet connectivity was a fraction  of what it is right here within sort of line of sight  with the Wi-Fi.  The signal doesn't really go through the walls here,  which I discovered right before the show.  It was not good enough until I actually came into this room.  Sit in the window.  Well, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're thrilled to have you.  Good, exactly.  I'm glad to be here.  Our digital nomad, Mike Elgin,  and also with us, Jeff Jarvis,  back from his Digital Jaunt.  So actually you've been back for a while, which is nice.  Yeah, once.  BuzzMachine.com, the author of What Would Google Do  and Geeks Bearing Gifts  and Professor of Journalism at CUNY.  And from Austin, Texas, where it must be 150 degrees  right now, Stacy Higginbotham.  Is it hot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's 101.  And humid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So yes.  Do you have to have AC if you live there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, God, yes.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, yes.  Because you're not even glowing.  You just look calm, cool, collected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, it is a cool 77 in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nice.  Actually, that would be hot for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, well, I'm a lady and we, I guess we're unblooded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is it?  Horses sweat, men perspire, women simply glow.  Oh, I thought we glistened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, glow?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  I believe.  It's a pretty antiquated statement.  I think it would be considered politically incorrect  these days to repeat that.  Women can sweat too.  Women's, and as a matter of fact, as I've learned,  since I learned that as a child, women sweat.  And it's a good thing.  Sweating's good.  Sweating's great.  It feels great to sweat.  And if you don't sweat in the summer, you're not doing,  you're not, you're sitting on the couch.  You're not playing Pokemon Go.  Have you caught the infection, Stacy, in your child?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have not.  My child doesn't have a smartphone,  so we haven't been playing it.  I was gonna load it.  She's only nine.  We can talk about when to get her a smartphone, actually.  That's a broad conversation.  That's an interesting question, isn't it?  But yeah, and I went to download it.  The servers were not working,  so that was at that point in time,  and then I just kind of gave up.  I'm lame, I'm sorry.  I could have like cleaned up in Maine too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it's so funny.  It's the greatest game, but the servers are incessantly down.  Today was the day it was supposed to launch in Japan.  Of course, the country from which Pokemon emerged,  and the most Pokemon Go, Pokemon crazy country in the world,  and we knew the servers would be devastated.  They delayed it, saying partly because of the leak,  I guess this was gonna be the first test  of sponsored Pokestop locations.  McDonald's was going to have Pokestops  at all the McDonald's.  The email about that leaked to TechCrunch,  and Niantic, the company that makes Pokemon Go,  said they are not gonna put it out today.  To everybody's great relief,  although I'm wondering if they end up doing it  because it is down, down, down.  John Hanke, who's the CEO of Niantic,  said we are not gonna put it in Japan  until we believe the servers can handle the traffic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a bad thing for Google Cloud, man.  It's looking- Yeah, yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because it's all cloud, it's all Google Cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, and I have no idea how it's architected  or anything, but I'm very curious to see what the cause is.  Can we- We've been trying to find out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've read articles, one article said that they are working  on Google, what is it, Code Engine, Cloud Engine?  Cloud Engine.  And then, but then it pulls from Google Maps.  But on Saturday, on the new screensavers,  we've got a network engineer  who doesn't have direct knowledge of it,  but who can speculate a little bit about what the issues are  and why it's so hard to scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there's a lot of, I mean,  you've got the real time back and forth  on what can be kind of shoddy connections,  depending on where you are.  And then you've also got pulling from different aspects  of Google services.  So there's a lot of back and forth there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know, and it's very frustrating  because I see a jiggly puff, but I can't get it.  You know how that is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't want to hear those words coming out of your mouth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are they playing Pokemon Go in France, Mike Elgin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They are, they're, well, it's funny  because here in the part of the city where we are,  it's the old part.  So you can tell that the streets are all sort of carved out  in the middle ages, they're all curvy and narrow.  So when you see on the map where there are Pokemon,  you know exactly where they are  because the streets are like 12 feet wide or something.  There's not big open spaces around here  where they could be anywhere in the vicinity.  So it's kind of funny, I just looked at the screen.  I'm like, oh yeah, that's right in front of the burger place.  And I know exactly where they put that one.  But Leo, I'm curious about what you think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you wrote the most vicious article about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know, it was taken as an anti-Pokemon article.  I basically said that it's a public menace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that sounds anti-Pokemon to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the reason it's a public menace  is simply because it's number one, super popular.  And number two, I think we're at a really interesting point  right now where we culturally haven't adapted  to mixed reality and augmented reality applications.  We haven't learned how to function in society  with virtual objects all around us.  And I think, you know, you've mentioned on previous shows,  I believe it was Twit, that how great would Google Glass  be with this thing?  I mean, it would be really great.  You keep heads up and you'd be more aware  of your surroundings.  I really do think that Google Glass-like glasses  will come out that are not bulky and ugly,  that are socially acceptable.  And I think augmented and mixed reality applications  like Pokemon Go and other things  are going to kind of mainstream that piece of hardware.  And I think that's gonna be great.  But right now, I think, you know,  we've sort of adapted to, for example, texting.  People, jackasses still drive and text and stuff like that.  But for the most part, etiquette and social norms  are arriving around texting.  I think eventually that will happen with mixed reality.  I think that three years from now,  there'll be 50 or 100 augmented or mixed reality applications  that lots and lots of people are using.  So it won't be like everybody using the same one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff, you disagree?  Well, I think you found the thing I put in the rundown.  Your cursor is on it.  Guy playing Pokemon while driving?  Oh, the Baltimore guy.  Oh, yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll get Karsten to play it for us.  So apparently, this is police video,  dash cam video from a police car.  Guy playing Pokemon Go runs into,  the about the worst thing you could run into,  a Baltimore police cruiser.  Let's see if we can see the video here.  I think you can go full screen on it, Karsten, yeah.  And this is for people listening.  On July 10th, 12th, 2nd, and approximately 3.30 a.m.,  for some reason, that page does not allow us  to scroll up and see it.  It's off screen.  Same thing happened to me.  I thought maybe it was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, just click off to that tweet, then you can do it.  That's all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I get the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  To me, the phenomenon, the danger around Pokemon,  there's nothing about Pokemon that's bad.  It's a cool, fun game, but it's kind of like Black Friday.  People are focused on something other than paying attention  to where they're going and what they're doing.  And they're in a competitive kind of situation,  so there's a bit of a frenzy sometimes with these large mobs.  And I think that's really the thing.  It's not Pokemon itself.  It's just large numbers of people,  millions, dozens of millions of people out there  wandering around and not really paying full attention  to where they're going and what poles they're walking into  and what cliffs they're falling off and so on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think a heads-up display  is gonna help that too much because...  No, it's gonna be worse.  You're still gonna be focused on the virtual  and not the actual reality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think given how insane this craze has become,  and I don't know what it's like in France,  but everybody's playing it everywhere I go,  there are surprisingly few problems.  You've got probably 100 million players  and a handful of incidents.  Most people are alright.  Although one of the issues,  and I didn't really understand why people were walking off cliffs  and climbing fences,  because I didn't fully understand the game,  there's a tracker in the game that you can use to try to...  You can see what's nearby and try to track them down.  And I think that's what's happening  is people who are using the tracker  were looking at the tracker, seeing,  am I close, am I close?  And then walking off of a cliff.  Interestingly, Niantic claims it's a bug.  I think it was intentional.  The tracker hasn't worked in a couple of days.  So I have a feeling that that was in response to that.  But what I'm really excited about,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  what I think is fascinating from a culture point of view,  is the fact that now a new generation of kids  are going to grow up where it's normal  to have virtual objects floating in space all over the place.  And you think about kids who...  You see, we've all seen the videos of babies  who pick up a magazine and try to swipe right  and use it like an iPad.  They, from the very beginning,  are programmed to understand multi-touch interfaces.  And that kind of thing.  It's going to get to the point where it'll just be normal  for these phantoms to be all around us.  It's kind of like in the old days,  when people used to think that everything was haunted  and there were ghosts and stuff like that all over the place.  They'll be, in fact, be able to see these things.  And again, it'll be lots and lots of things.  It won't be just games.  It'll be augmented reality and other stuff.  But we're now entering in a whole new cultural world  where there's a parallel universe,  or many parallel universes,  existing simultaneously in the same space.  And I think culturally,  that's really a weird and wonderful thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was my exact reaction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do any of you see any application for news?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, absolutely.  I mean, I guess, well, maybe not news, but history.  So, news is the first draft of history,  but you'll be able to walk around and say,  well, this is the place where this took place.  And it could be a historic event or-  Well, in fact, it wasn't Niantic's first program

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  was Field Trip, which did exactly that, right?  And that augmented reality.  But as you were walking by a point of interest,  it would narrate it to you with your smartphone.  The problem with news is news is not near you in general.  So, most of the time the news we see is,  like even here, okay, so there was a big fire at a dairy farm,  lots of smoke in the air.  This morning, we're smelling it.  It's smoky.  Lisa said, I'm on the internet.  There's a fire in the next county over.  I can't find it.  I said, no, no, it's nearby.  It took us a while.  We finally tracked it down to a farm,  dairy farm not so far from us.  And so, that's as local as you can get.  And still, I don't think there's any application for that.  You certainly don't want people going,  oh, let me go find the fire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could look at the smoke, and if there's a database,  you could actually put your news stories that would say,  hey, this is such and such dairy fire.  That's interesting.  Or, you know, traffic or road work  might be really interesting to pull up your phone and just.  Isn't that what Waze is already, really?  Well, no, no, no, no, no, no, but like planned things.  Like we're right now, our major freeways under construction.  I would love to be able to like pull up information  about when this is now planned to be done.  Cause it happens, you know, it gets updated every few months  that, oh, this is gonna be two months later.  This is gonna be three years later.  So that's news-ish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I wrote an article recently  about the attack in Nice,  and about the failure of the French government's,  they commissioned an emergency app  that is supposed to tell you what's going on  and where to go and that sort of thing.  And of course, people went to Twitter and Facebook  to find out what's going on with their loved ones.  So there's a real time news is breaking right now  kind of thing that has a practical dimension,  which is like, what should you do?  Is it happening near you?  Is it happening relative?  That's good, yeah.  But you can imagine a future  where people do have smart glasses  or are looking at their phones  and an augmented reality app pops up and says,  there's an incident happening that way,  and you need to go this way  and we'll guide you to a shelter or something like that.  Or, you know, you can imagine the future  of emergency services that use augmented reality  to save lives and to give people  immediate direction and attention.  And again, one of the benefits of having smart glasses  is that you don't happen to be,  have to be looking at your phone at that exact moment.  You can set it, say, okay, whenever there's an emergency,  I want it in my glasses right away.  And you can imagine that that could be something really,  really useful during breaking news events.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I can also guarantee that the most interesting use  is something we aren't even imagining  because that's how it often is with this kind of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's porn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's always porn.  First it's porn, then it's other stuff.  Stacey's already imagining it.  Interesting, what if you really could get X-ray glasses?  Right?  Oh dear.  Oh dear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A real boy's fantasy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Cabo's own in our chat room said,  I like this, what if you go to historic,  you know, go to ruins.  What if you went to the ruins of Palmera  and you saw the original buildings super,  you could put on your glasses  and see the original buildings as they might have been.  Wouldn't that be cool?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, or you could get, I mean, you could have people,  you could create like, not theater,  but stories where people came in, you know, dressed up,  like actors played role.  I mean, just to make history kind of come alive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go to Pompeii, see the lava rolling in.  That would be freaky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm wandering around France  and there are a surprising number of French people  in this city who don't speak English at all.  And I don't speak French.  I speak a little French, but not enough.  And so I've been using Google Translate.  So the other day we were in a shop and we were just looking  and the person there asked us in French, I assume,  would you like, can I help you?  Would you like something?  And so I just pulled out Google Translate and said,  oh, we're just looking right now, thank you.  And I played it and it was instantaneous, worked great.  She got a kick out of it, it was awesome.  But if you could put that as augmented reality,  that whole, you know, if I could be shown what to say,  here are three, you're in this type of shop.  Here are some things you could say, this means, you know.  And so it would be invisible to the other person  and so in my case, it would feel like knowledge.  It would be a surrogate for actual skill and knowledge  in speaking French and I would love that.  And of course, that's not exactly news,  but that's a way that we could interact with the world  that would be super practical and, you know,  have a uniting effect because in fact,  you could interact with people who speak other languages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So do you think we'll look back at Pokemon Go  in years to come and say this was when the virtual world  started to become the real world?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Look at how we look at Pokemon.  I don't know how we look at Pokemon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We look back and it was like, wow, wasn't it?  What was that all about?  We have, well, there's one kid here, Kevin's great,  who was clearly obsessed with Pokemon  and he was at lunch today showing us all.  He says, well, these are the legendary characters.  They have not yet appeared in the Pokemon Go game.  However, we have some theories that this character  is going to really become a mutate tour.  And it was, I mean, he's like, he knows every detail  and everybody's gathered around going,  okay, suddenly there's this interest,  like the knowledge that he has been maintaining for years,  but absolutely no value at all.  And everybody's going, oh yeah, tell us more, Kevin.  Tell us more.  It's like the village shaman.  That's so great.  It's so funny.  Good for him.  Somebody's to-  I will say. Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was gonna say on this idea of virtual reality,  there is like a slight or not, there's a slight downside,  which is it could create a potentially huge digital divide.  One, if you don't embrace this,  imagine how cut off you would be  if everyone takes it for granted  that you have these instant translation skills  or you have the ability to see emergency breaking news  on your phone.  And then the other is, what was the other?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we're already there, aren't we, in many ways,  if you don't have the internet, don't you think?  Yes.  You feel pretty left out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's a huge problem for them.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That gulf is only widening.  Right.  You know, we talk about income inequality,  but there's all kinds of related inequalities.  Except more, no, it's actually narrowing, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  More people are getting on the internet through more means.  I think both things are happening.  There's a huge number of people who don't have the internet  and therefore are completely locked out.  On the other hand, there are people all over the world  who can get lectures and coursework from MIT and Stanford.  And they don't have to, you know,  they're not among the elite who actually attend those schools  and all the information and knowledge of mankind  that exists on the internet,  which is available in little villages  if they have the internet.  So it's simultaneously, as Jeff said, bringing...  People erasing a digital divide.  And at the same time, as more and more people get it  and more and more people are not on it yet,  it sort of creates a digital divide.  Because again, you have to have these tools,  otherwise you just are just locked out of what's happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's it.  To Stacey's point, as it becomes ubiquitous,  then those who don't are really disadvantaged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But we're not having conversations about like privacy  and while we're having them,  we're just not changing anything.  So you have to think about when you start giving  like your actual location data up to everyone and their dog,  and, you know, governments start to rely on this,  are we going to start having those conversations  about what information people have and how they can use it?  Because I do think we're moving down this path  without really thinking about where it's gonna lead us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I agree, although it's almost inevitable, right?  I mean, what are you gonna do?  It's not, you can't say, well, let's stop, wait a minute,  let's think about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, but we could...  There's many, many, many, many naysayin'  caution monsters out there.  As somebody who plays the optimist role most of the time,  a boy, do I get bombarded with people who say,  but this could happen, but that could happen.  And my response is always, well, if something could happen,  do you then cut off all the possibilities  by cutting off what it could be?  That bad thing could happen,  you cut off the good that could come too.  We're smart, we people, we built civilization,  we built buildings, we built Pokemon Go,  we can do a lot of things.  We have Donald Trump running for president.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I know, I almost completed,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mike Elgin started this sentence,  there are some people who don't have the internet,  I almost completed it, and they're voting for Trump.  It does seem like-  I don't think Trump himself has the internet.  Apparently doesn't have the software  that allows him to check.  He has Twitter.  Yeah, he has Twitter,  which is the best part of the internet, right?  Or the worst, it's simultaneously the best and the worst.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a really interesting company  that I don't think gets enough attention.  I talked to the CEO, Julian Ranger of DigiMe.  I don't know if you're familiar with DigiMe,  but essentially they're working on a,  right now what you can do is download  all of your social networking stuff,  everything you've ever posted, every picture,  other people's comments on your pictures.  Nice.  From the beginning of time,  on all social networks into a single place  where you can slice and dice and search and do all this stuff.  Very cool, free app, it's a freemium model,  so there's a paid version.  But what he's working on is a system  where you physically download all your stuff  and control it and your information,  and then he believes that he can get the companies  like Google and Facebook and others to come to you  and essentially make a deal with you about your data.  Here's what we're gonna do with it.  Okay, I approve that.  Here's what else we're gonna do with it.  No, I don't approve that, you can't do that.  And sort of give you control of your data.  It's a really fascinating and breathtakingly large vision.  And the most fascinating part is  they have this sense of responsibility about it  where they don't wanna actually control it too much.  So I told him, why don't you just do a social network?  Could be like a super friend feed  where all my social networks would be in one place.  Just give me the opportunity to see other people's posts  and post from that to everything else.  And he said, no, we're not gonna do that  because that's the mistake Twitter made.  What Twitter did was they originally opened up  the third parties, they let all these different companies  do all these different things  and when anything started to succeed,  they said, okay, well now we're gonna do that.  And they lock those people out of it.  And they were greedy about controlling the stuff  that everybody was doing.  And he said, that's the downfall.  He said, we will never do that.  We will let third parties do all that kind of stuff  because no one company should have  that much control and power.  And by the way, even though they let you download  all your data, they themselves have no access to it at all.  And they encrypt it and all that kind of stuff as well.  So DigiMe is really an interesting company.  Let me show you.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My data is worthless on its own.  It's only an aggregate that someone's data  is useful to these companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They don't care about me personally.  No, Stacey, I'll disagree there.  What I've been arguing about the news business, for example,  is we have to stop treating people as a mass.  We have to start treating people as individuals.  Now we don't have the capability, you're quite right.  But if we did have the capability  where I can target you individually,  I know you're a mother and your kid's this old  and the kid likes this and things that you allow me to know  to give you greater relevance,  then I'm gonna increase the value  of our relationship hugely.  But we're not good at that in media business  because we're used to treating everybody as a mass.  Amazon does know you as an individual  and your data is valuable at an individual level.  So, no, I don't think it's just an aggregate  that the data is valuable.  I think that if the company has set up well  to give you personal service and relevance and value,  then in turn your data is valuable to them  because they've made it valuable to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me show you something a friend of mine, David Glickman,  has just released, it's an iOS app.  I'm curious what you think of this.  It's called OurData.  It's an ad blocker, but it's a weird ad blocker  because essentially you can agree to not be blocked  and the company that you're seeing their ads  will share some of its revenue with you  which you can then give to charity.  Right now it's Susan B. Komen,  but they're going to add other charities to it.  So the idea is, yes, your data has value  and in particular your attention to ads has value.  Here's how you can kind of recover some of that money  and make everybody happy, by the way,  because the media companies are still getting  the lion's share of it because you're seeing their ads  instead of not with an ad blocker.  Do I have to give it to charity, Leo?  Can I?  It would be nice if you could keep it.  I don't know if you can keep it.  I think it's a really interesting take on this  and it's the similar idea which is, it's your data.  You should have control of it, but maybe this is  a more practical approach to it, acknowledging  that you're going to be giving out data  and so kind of making a transaction around it.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I could go for that.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think the problem is the public doesn't care.  I think the public-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they're not gonna care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If they could get a 50 cent discount on something,  they'd give away all their data for life.  I think the public has demonstrated,  and we in the media have failed to,  we're either alarmists and the sky is falling  or we're, it doesn't matter, don't worry about it,  or we have these complicated stories  about why it's a big deal.  I think the public really doesn't understand it.  It's a headache to think about and they just would rather  just get the benefits of using Facebook  and all these other services without thinking  about the data, and again, part of the problem  is that it's really counterintuitive what's possible,  what sort of story is possible to construct  out of even just metadata for the communication.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess the best we can hope to do is just let them know  so that they at least kind of, at least it's not  completely in the dark about it.  To your point though, Mike, I'm thinking  of the Google Surveys app I use,  because I get like 30 cents and I give them whatever they want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I just got another one of those, Leo,  where I got a United Airlines, and you know,  I'm a happy prisoner of United Airlines' global services,  and I just got offered to, if I take a survey,  and if I started this, I got 600 miles.  Oh, okay, I'll do that.  And I'm thinking, oh, I'll make that every time.  The next one is a 20 minute survey that gives me 60 miles.  Not so much, but I did a long G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But at least now you've put a value on your data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, well, I know it's not 600.  Yeah.  And it asked me all kinds of demographic things  because the advantage is I'll get a better survey,  more viable survey, by them knowing that I'm this age  and this education is-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think this is a sign that we're figuring it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so too.  There's a marketplace.  That's the bottom line here.  And Stacey's quite right that there needs to be,  that the data on its own, on its own, alone,  doesn't have value unless there's a context,  unless I have a relationship with you  that means that, oh, I can sell you something  or I can show you something  or I can give you greater value in something.  And then that's the reason for you to reveal yourself to me  is either because I'm paying you straight out  or I'm paying you with better service or whatever it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there's also this idea in,  this kind of came to me while we were talking,  in these virtual reality things,  it adds another layer of not being able to control.  So here's the scenario I would ask you guys to envision.  If I'm walking down the street  and someone holds up their phone,  what's to stop them from seeing virtual reality  revenge porn affixed to me as a person?  Oh my God, yeah.  Or something.  So that's another thing that I'm like,  oh wait, that would be terrible.  Think about all that,  think about the lack of power you have over Google searches.  Imagine it actually applied to your face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe it just is a Google search.  But remember, Google has that capability and turned it off.  They said, oh, one thing we won't do is face recognition.  Well, they never turned it on, yeah.  Yeah, or yeah, they didn't turn it on.  But it doesn't have to be revenge porn.  What if I could just, I would personally love this,  but you may not hold up a phone and take a picture  or see somebody and get the information about them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, do you remember, I think this highlight,  was that the app that showed you  when people were around? Yes, nearby, yeah.  So that app creeped me out to no end, It's South By.  You know, people would, you'd be looking around  and you'd be like, oh my, I turned it off after that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a different experience,  and I really have to acknowledge this for men and women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah. Yes.  That's why I'm bringing it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no, as the token woman on this panel.  But I really have to acknowledge that,  that we, as guys, we don't have any idea how bad it can get.  So, okay.  Yeah, so I think you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It also raises the question of, you know,  you suggested a disgusting application  for the technology we know is coming,  and you know, people can be awful,  but it raises a kind of philosophical question about  what's the difference between a computer augmented fantasy  and one that's purely mental?  Is there a difference?  Well, I know. It's an interesting question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If I undress you in my head, is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do not like the creeps who,  when you walk down the street, undress you with their eyes.  And you can tell they're doing it, can't you?  Yeah, it's not subtle. It's not nice, yeah.  But this isn't just that.  This is personal information you could affix  to a person or a place.  And think about, you know, think about swatting.  There could be virtual, not swatting actually,  just virtual harassment.  Yes, stalking.  Associated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, and then of course, inevitably,  as we've seen again and again with all these technologies,  all of this will happen.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, yes.  And we still suck at deal.  I mean, look at Twitter and how poorly it handles.  Well, I wanna talk about Milo Yiannopoulos

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  in just a second.  Yeah.  Okay, don't.  Stand by for Milo in a moment.  First up.  Hey, this is, I love doing this show.  When we get these great people, Mike Elgin is here.  He's from Aix-en-Provence, in France.  He is becoming a digital nomad.  Is it becomingnomad.com?  Becomingnomad.com, yes.  And he's drinking red wine, which makes me so jealous.  Red wine, yes, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and I advocate the nomadic lifestyle.  Everybody should try it at least once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It sounds like you're saying,  I advocate the nude lifestyle,  and everybody should try it just once.  It's funny, it's as a lifestyle.  It's similar to nudism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nomadic nudism is my nude.  You don't have any clothes with you.  Because you're out there, man.  You're out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Aren't nudists, don't they call themselves naturalists?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Naturists, not naturalists.  Naturists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No naturalists, no leaves and birds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Naturists, that's right.  I have been to naturist places in my life.  When I was in high school,  we used to go to the nude beach all the time.  And it was purely innocent.  Well, and you immediately get over it, right?  That's the thing I should point out is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, because the people who frequent such beaches are not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, even then, even if they were all gorgeous,  it doesn't matter.  It takes you literally one minute to go,  okay, I get it, and just be normal again.  There's a Hot Springs up here, it's the same thing.  Or Tassajara.  And you just get used to it.  It's just like.  Saunas in Germany, as we discussed.  Saunas in Germany, right.  In some ways, I think that's the better way to do this  is just to say, we all have bodies  and not make it a taboo.  Because that's where it becomes creepy  when it becomes a taboo.  But at the same time, I respect your right  not to walk around naked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that the biggest thing you learn  when you go to a nude beach is  you gain an appreciation for clothing.  It's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Also with us, it's always wonderful.  Stacy Higginbotham, we missed you terribly last week.  I'm so glad you're back.  You know, I want to say something here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I see this on Twitter all the time.  No one, Gina Trapani, her number is retired.  No one replaces Gina.  But Stacy, I'm so grateful you're on the show.  You get tremendous reviews.  All the fans of the show are so happy you're here.  I'm happy you're here.  I know Leo's happy you're here.  I just wanted to say you are a joy and a brilliant addition  and I'm so glad you're here.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I second that.  IoT Podcast, if you can't get enough,  go to iotpodcast.com for her Internet of Things podcast  with our other great friend, Kevin Toffle,  who will be on your show but refuses to be on our show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, he's asking.  Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's not allowed to come on the show.  I've been asking for about a month now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think he's hungry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I learned something about Kevin  when I was trying to book him for TNT,  which is that he's very schedule-oriented.  So if you catch him on short notice,  he's never available.  But if you say, okay, in September, can you do this date?  He'll say yes and he'll be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but in this case,  it's because he's now working as a consultant to Google.  So he has to get permission, as I think everybody does.  We got so spoiled by Matt Cutts  because he was employee number 11.  He could just do whatever he wants.  And trusted.  But now he can't, by the way.  He's now working for the government.  Oh, so is that the case?  Well, it's just like Kevin.  He says, well, I have to get permission.  I don't wanna do it without permission.  Oh, shoot.  Yeah.  We've mentioned this before, but just in case you don't know,  Matt has gone to work for a group that's, I think, a great,  it's kind of like Code for America,  the idea of these really smart coders and technologists  helping make government work better, more transparent.  And I think it's-  He's at the Pentagon.  He's at the Pentagon, yeah.  The Pentagon is weaponized Matt Cutts.  Well, somebody had to.  I'm just glad it was our side.  Also here, Jeff Jarvis,  who we love dearly to, professor of journalism at CUNY.  No, you don't.  No one does, but that's nice.  I love you.  You're my brother from another mother.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And just look at that beard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, he's gorgeous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that's part of the problem today  is that I'm hitting the white balance on the camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, your beard is, yeah, that's what it is.  You have a little Gandalf thing going there.  Yeah, I don't know what just-  Yeah, you're blinding the camera.  Our show today brought to you by the great Casper mattress.  You wouldn't think a mattress would be part  of the revolution, but it is.  It is as part of the internet revolution,  changing the way we do business in this country.  Casper mattresses are, A, made in the US.  They're made by engineers obsessing  to make the best premium mattress possible  using the latest materials.  They combine springy latex foam with supported memory foam  to give you just like a Goldilocks sleep,  just the right amount of sink and bounce.  So you get the perfect night's sleep.  And by the way, on these hot summer nights,  where it's 102 degrees in Austin,  you're gonna love this,  because Casper mattresses sleep cool, they breathe.  And that really helps you sleep better.  2016 Business Intelligence Group Innovation Award winner,  the Casper mattress, and all of that for less  because there's no middle person.  You don't have to go to a mattress store.  Now, you may say, but Leo, I hear you now saying,  but Leo, I like to go to the mattress store.  I wanna try before I buy.  Yeah, but let me point out that five minutes  on a mattress in broad daylight with a salesperson  kind of giving you the stink eye is not the best way  to see what it's gonna be like to sleep on that mattress.  So Casper's got a better way, 100 nights to try.  100 nights, and if at any time in that first 100 day period,  you don't like it for any reason,  you call Casper, they send a courier, they take it away,  they refund every penny.  So it's really risk free.  Free shipping and returns in the US and Canada,  they uphold the highest environmental production standards.  So they don't smell rubbery or anything,  they're just fresh and clean and beautiful.

I haven't seen Ghostbusters, the new Ghostbusters yet.  I'm dying.  No spoilers.  Nope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's impossible to have a spoiler.  Have you seen it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I'm going Friday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm dying to see it.  It really shocked me that there was this kind of undercurrent  after the first trailer of people saying,  oh, women shouldn't be Ghostbusters.  It's just, it's disgusting.  I was like, what do you mean?  Well, and then I found out that there's this kind  of general consensus among some that women aren't funny,  which is funny because,  maybe because I just know a lot of funny women,  but I think some of the best comics working today are women.  Absolutely.  Including Melissa McCarthy, who's in the new Ghostbusters,  and I never remember her name,  the smart Ghostbuster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leslie Jones?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, well, Leslie Jones is the black Ghostbuster.  If we're going to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, Kristen Wiig and...  Kristen Wiig's in it, which is hysterical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kristen Wiig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And who is...  She's new and she's great.  She is.  I love her.  Anyway, Leslie Jones was getting a lot of nasty,  not only misogynistic, but racist.  Horribly racist.  Tweeting and did, I thought a brave, courageous thing.  She retweeted them.  Which, you know, that's gotta be hard to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stop there for one second.  I agree it's brave.  Was it the best tactic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there's a lot.  We debate about this all the time.  All of us have been harassed on Twitter and I think all...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Was it feeding the troll or was it exposing the troll?  Does the troll care?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's exposing.  So people either think it's not their problem  or they're willfully blind to some of the misogynistic  and racist things that happen.  And I think it's important for people to see it.  And I say that as someone who...  I actually don't get a lot of harassment on Twitter.  Please don't start.  Shh, shh, shh.  Don't say anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, that's another thing, by the way.  What a chilling effect this has, doesn't it?  Yes.  I almost don't even want to talk about it  because I don't want to encourage them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, you should talk about it.  You should tell people that it's unacceptable  because the problem is people who are in the majority  and people, they don't see it or they don't understand it  and they don't speak up about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had, you know, I had a Virginia Heffernan  on triangulation on Monday.  She's got a new book on the internet, Magic of the Force.  That was great, Lea.  And we had this conversation and she said it's...  I was kind of shocked  because she has been harassed on Twitter.  Somebody said she's worse than ISIS.  Which is such a ridiculous insult.  I almost...  Wow.  But it's, you know, but anyway, she said,  well, but it's not physically damaging to you.  So it's harmless.  She kind of stuck up for the free speech aspect of it.  And I said, well, I don't think it is harmless.  It's psychologically damaging and there's bullying.  There are people who have killed themselves  because they've been bullied on Facebook and Twitter.  It can be damaging to your career.  It could be damaging to your relationships.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Think about if someone tweets a picture  of your kid's school at you.  There you go.  I mean, that's, I'm sorry, that's scary as all hell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Doxing, that is highly damaging.  So anyway, so we had that argument.  She's not here, so I don't wanna, you know,  attack her in absentia.  But some people do say, well, but yeah, but...  And I think really, again,  I shouldn't put words in her mouth,  read her book, Magic and Loss,  and we're trying to get her on the show.  But I think what she was saying is,  and I've said this myself,  sunshine is the best disinfectant.  That putting this out in the public eye,  she said, hey, you're gonna learn a lesson.  You learn a lesson about yourself  and have to look at yourself.  And I said, well, I don't think most of the time  there's much of a lesson.  That's being very generous.  That's being very generous.  And then she also pointed out that some,  she was talking about Gawker revealing  the affairs of some gentleman to his wife.  And that that was good because the woman  was being gaslighted and she needed to hear the truth.  And I said, yeah, but maybe from relatives or friends,  but not from...  Well, not in full public view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  From Gawker.  If a friend tells you, a friend will take you out  for a drink and say, I gotta tell you something.  It's not very pleasant.  And do it gently.  Yeah.  Yeah, versus in the public.  You know, the difference is, I think that  in the broad public square  and in the public square that it is internet, yes.  Unbridled free speech, nothing you can do about it.  ISIS is there.  Good guys are there, bad guys are there.  But in a privately owned entity, institution,  whether that institution is a platform, Twitter,  or a publication, a magazine or a newspaper,  or a book publisher, I think that those institutions,  those entities have every right  and sometimes a responsibility to set a standard  and live by that standard.  Now Twitter, we value Twitter because Twitter is open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me continue with the saga here.  And by the way, Kate McKinnon, awesome.  That was the fourth Ghostbuster whose name I couldn't have.  So Leslie Jones was just getting...  So she retweeted this stuff and then said,  and I'm leaving, bye.  Apparently, now I'm not sure what the connection is,  Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos,  who's been suspended on Twitter before,  was banned by Twitter.  I guess he had...  He had some terrible racist...  And he more importantly encouraged others, right,  to do the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which I've long said is actually the greater issue.  You're gonna find trolls out there.  You're gonna find individuals out there.  But those who encourage them are at least as responsible  as the trolls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But, okay, on the other hand, Milo uses real name.  I mean, you can ban him because it's him.  None of those other people, I'm sure,  were using their real names and could be effectively banned  because they just create a new account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Though you know that Twitter, since you have trolls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Structurally, Twitter cannot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Twitter could do a far better job.  There's patterns, they don't hook up to it.  There was one troll that came after us.  Like, God, I'm sorry, I don't know if we wanna say this  because he may come back.  But would come after us 10 times in a day,  20 times in a day.  And there's a pattern.  And Twitter could be more difficult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think structurally, this is a problem.  I think the only solution, if you wanted to get rid of this,  is to force people to use real names.  No, because I always say...  And what you Twitter can't do and will never do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I always say I can tell you a-holes by name.  Anonymity is not...  Yes, anonymity is the cloak of the coward that's true.  But that's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you're anonymous, you cannot block them.  They just create a new account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not about anonymity.  So here's the problem.  So first of all, I really kind of disagree with...  And I actually went back and forth with Kara Swisher  and a few others about this particular issue.  Milo's banning?  Yeah, it smells to me like Twitter is doing  what Facebook is always doing.  Which Facebook kind of, and I don't mean to overly exaggerate  or overly criticize, but Facebook generally seems  to have no ethics.  They try things and if they get burned in public opinion,  they apologize and they stop and they go try something else.  And Twitter has not always been like that.  They've been kind of a free speech fundamentalist  in certain ways.  They have their own system which is deeply flawed  and I can get into that in a sec.  But basically they did what they did purely because of the PR.  They essentially said that Milo was targeted harassment.  Well, we both know that half the people on this panel  have multiple Twitter accounts where the whole account  is all about targeted harassment of people on this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're not our accounts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Other people's accounts.  My point is that the whole purpose of the account,  I mean Milo's purpose of his account was not just to harass  Leslie Jones.  He's himself.  He's himself and he's a trollish affect to him  in all spheres.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He attacked me.  Milo attacked me in length.  And then when his publication went bankrupt,  he became for a brief while humble and nice  and kind of okay and a little bit contrite  but then went back to his.  But he has his whole shtick.  At least he's not anonymous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's ironic that because he's not anonymous,  he can be banned.  Right.  And he has the courage to use his own name.  So his handle is at Nero but he uses his own name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Using the word courage in this case  puts you in Bill Maher territory from politically incorrect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, he's more courageous than the trolls  who don't use their real names.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, fine.  And?  And?  I mean if you're gonna troll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That gains you what?  At least use your real name  because then you're standing behind your statements.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But Twitter, Twitter, no, try this way, Leo.  Twitter bans thousands upon thousands  upon thousands of egg accounts.  This one just happens to have a name.  If they ban the thousands of accounts  that don't have a real name,  then why should one that does have a real name  be treated any differently if the behavior  is equally heinous in Twitter's rules?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it isn't.  It isn't equal.  I mean I think to a very large extent  they banned Milo because he influenced other people  to do super horrible things that went wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a heinous behavior in my book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean, so I've been acute.  Like for example, let's say four years ago  I would be defending Google Plus  and criticizing a writer who got a whole bunch  of things wrong about Google Plus  and then a whole bunch of Google Plus  fundamentalist fanatics went after that writer  with all kind of vitriol and stuff  that I didn't want them to do  and I specifically asked them not to  but they did it as a sort of like,  they felt encouraged by what I had done  and that's not the case with Milo.  He's a foul person.  He's like a professional provocateur.  He loves the reaction.  He loves to get people outraged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think as with all trolls, that's,  well, I can only speculate  but I think that's part of the payoff, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, but the problem with Twitter  is that they don't have clear guidelines.  I mean, for example, I'm bothered by trolls  who set up an account where the sole purpose  of that account is to attack a single person.  That should be something that can be established  and measured.  Okay, as somebody who is the target

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  of such a continual attack, I don't think they can.  The person, it's not particularly difficult  to use tools that obfuscate your account  and so you just create a new email account,  you use a proxy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It should take time to do that  and it should be harder to do.  Yeah, but some people are motivated to spend the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's, I'm sure, much easier for us to block him  than it is for him to create the account  but it doesn't seem to deter him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The biggest problem is that Twitter is like Pokemon Go.  The content is just out there  and so on Facebook or Google Plus or other social networks,  you start a conversation.  You, Leo Laporte, start a conversation  and then it's like, okay, this is the space  where we're talking about Leo Laporte stuff  and then people add comments to your posts  and when somebody's a troll, you block their,  you delete their comment.  You delete their reply.  You block them from participating in any future comments  under your posts.  On Twitter, that doesn't happen.  When you block somebody on Twitter,  when you block somebody on Facebook or Google Plus,  they leave the room.  When you block somebody on Twitter,  you leave the room.  And you leave the room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Twitter's solution is, oh, just mute or block them  and then they won't bother you.  And the reason I don't do that is because  then they're continuing to do it  and everybody else sees it.  I don't see it.  That doesn't solve the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Twitter puts themselves in the pop role.  They need to empower users to be able to take action  against people who are infiltrating their community,  infiltrating their conversations.  You need to be able to own your conversations on Twitter  like you can on Facebook and elsewhere  and then have some control, some moderation control.  That would make a huge difference.  You notice the moments.  All these stories are on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My attitude has been basically,  there's nothing that can be done.  This is the nature of Twitter.  And Twitter made their bed when they created it.  And of course, they didn't know what they were getting into,  so I don't blame them.  But the way they've structured it,  it's not possible to fix this problem.  But okay, but Leo's the Leo.  Well, I just want to hear,  I want Mike to explain it.  I know he did, but I want to understand it.  What is the simple fix that would fix this,  that Facebook does, for instance,  is a new kind of blocking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, this is where the verification comes in.  If everyone can be verified.  No, that removes anonymity for Twitter.  Twitter can't do that.  Hold on, hold on.  Okay.  If everyone can be verified,  you can choose to look at only the verified.  Well, I can do that now.  Well, but that's a tiny, tiny, tiny group of celebrities.  That means celebrities, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, they've done that.  By the way, they just announced that.  That's what I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what I'm saying.  So I can see the beginnings of a strategy that says,  okay, there's two Twitters.  There's a verified real name Twitter,  which they're going to presume is higher civility,  and then there's wide open Twitter.  Solve this problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me give you this problem,  and I'd love to hear how Twitter could solve this problem.  So there's a fella who targets me with really vile stuff,  and then at the same time,  tweets sponsors and future guests with vile stuff,  trying to discourage them from buying.  He's basically trying to put us out of business.  Single-handedly trying to put us out of business.  What's the fix for that?  Obviously, me blocking him doesn't fix it,  because the sponsors and future guests.  Twitter should have structures to know what the pattern is.  And by the way, I think you all know who I'm talking about,  because I know he's tweeted all of you.  Exactly.  And you know, by the way,  Virginia Heffernan almost didn't come on,  because she was told that I was a sexist pig  and unlikely to ambush interview her.  And she was girded.  She said, oh, I'm ready,  and she had a lot of responses to my potential sexist pig  comments to her.  So, I mean, you know, if Twitter cared enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How do you fix that?  Okay, when I block that person,  and I always report them to Twitter,  I do Twitter the favor of reporting them, right?  There are clear patterns, clear and easy patterns  that would allow Twitter to put a flag on some account  before it gets started and starts doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You do each thing.  Well, what's interesting, okay,  first of all, the guy's fairly sophisticated.  He has one account that he knows will get blocked each time  because it's clearly offensive.  So-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you know who it is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  Well, you can't,  because he's smart enough to remain anonymous.  And then he has a second account,  which never crosses the line.  We can't block because it's a parody account.  You know about that, Jeff,  because if you're a parody account.  Oh, yeah.  So he never crosses the line,  so he can't be blocked.  And he's smart enough to have both of those  because it's very effective.  He can attack us on two fronts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But Twitter should be saying,  let's just say that he uses the same IP address.  He's smart enough probably not.  You know he does not use the same IP address.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He obfuscates his identity entirely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you could prove once  that the guy who does all these horrid things  and gets blocked is the same guy who does that,  then that's what you say.  If you're banning for life,  you're banning for life in all forms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you can't ban him if he uses a different IP address  and email each time.  There are patterns.  So let me hear Mike's fix.  I want to hear Mike's structural fix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, there are multiple things.  So normal social networks  like Facebook and Google Plus and others  do a combination of they delete accounts  when they violate certain guidelines.  And the question is, what are those guidelines?  And then they also let you delete comments  to people who have commented on your stuff.  And you can block people  from ever commenting on your stuff again.  And those are both very powerful.  In the case of you and your troll,  and Jeff, you and your troll,  they're, in my opinion, stepping over the line.  So for example, the professor that shall not be named  is clearly, it's not a legitimate parody account  because the name that he uses  is exactly what would be legitimately used to refer to you.  And so that right there should be like,  that is not parody,  that's somebody who's trying to confuse and obfuscate,  and boom, out he goes.  In case of you, Leo,  this is a person who's clearly targeting you personally,  your business, your guests.  It's so clear.  And obviously, there should be clear rules.  It'd be easy to write.  I'd be happy to write them.  It'd take me 20 minutes.  That would identify that kind of line crossing,  and boom, they'd gone.  It should also take some time.  You should have to rise like Pokemon Go, like levels,  to the point where you are trusted in certain ways,  and I didn't know how to exactly structure that.  So that's that set of problem.  No, but it doesn't solve it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because he comes in each time under a different,  he's not identifiable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the pattern of what he says is clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, now you're asking for some sophisticated.  Well, that's the end of the scale.  Scaling that to 300 million users would be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you want Twitter to do a semantic analysis

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  on each new account and say, hmm, this is the same?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You don't have to scale it  because if you make each user a moderator  of their own site, essentially,  then Twitter doesn't have to do it all.  They don't have to be omnipresent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To A, Twitter's never gonna do this.  B, they don't wanna do it.  That's why we should all leave Twitter.  Well, I would love to, but they, okay,  so here's another problem.  I could leave Twitter, but if they don't  and they continue to do that, then where do I gain?  It's the same thing as muting them.  I don't, I'm not seeing it.  But you file a lawsuit against home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, so that's, you would have to go through  probably Twitter or try to mask the person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't because I can tell you right now,  I haven't checked, but I'm sure he's using Tor  and other anonymizing technologies  that would prevent any subpoena from being.  I have done this, by the way.  Some years ago, somebody tweeted a rape threat  and a murder and a rape threat against my daughter,  at the time, my underage daughter.  And we went to the local police and because,  that's, by the way, the only time the police get involved  is if there's a legitimate fear for your safety.  You have to have a death threat.  Then you would-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They won't always get involved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they won't always.  We were very lucky.  We had a local police officer here in Petaluma  who agreed to pursue it.  He got a court order, went to Twitter,  because I asked Ev.  I said, Ev, you're a father of a daughter.  This guy did this.  Ev didn't, wouldn't.  And I understand why.  He's not gonna send a president.  He's not gonna do me a favor.  So we went to the police.  The police did get the subpoena.  What they got was the IP address from Twitter.  They then had to figure out who the ISP was,  get another subpoena in that jurisdiction.  That required him going to the Chicago police  and again, convincing them to get a subpoena  from a judge in that jurisdiction to the ISP  to say whose account is, who is this IP address.  They tracked it down.  It was a young boy, 15-year-old boy, unprosecutable.  So the Chicago police knocked on his door and said,  it told his dad and his dad yelled at him  and that was the end of that.  First of all, a lot of effort.  Very low potential for success.  It did succeed and there you have it.  Now, the best I can hope for is maybe that kid  is not gonna be a stalker and a abuser in his future life.  Maybe we nipped it in the bud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This actually is a really,  this is one reason why people should speak up  against harassers or showcase these things because-  What if the person, by the way, lives in another country,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  which I believe he does?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is an issue.  But it helps strengthen our laws in the physical world  around harassment, which are fairly weak.  So if you think about your experience in that,  imagine if you didn't have, you weren't lucky that way.  And honestly, physical harassment is just as difficult,  not just as.  It can be as difficult.  That's right.  So it's important to say, hey, this is an issue.  It's important for people like you to say this is an issue  so we can fix it, maybe not just at Twitter,  but your police officers should not have to,  there should be something to help them do something  like that across state lines  so you don't have to actually visit Chicago or-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But there isn't, none of this exists.  None of this is ever likely to exist.  So let me ask you this, by the way,  I almost don't wanna show you this  and if you're easily offended, hide your eyes.  You don't wanna show it?  I don't wanna show it.  Okay, because he just tweeted.  Of course, they love the attention.  And normally I don't talk about it because why,  I don't need to feed the beast.  I just don't- This isn't the issue.  Well, it's an issue.  I think it's intractable.  I don't think it's insolvable.  I think as long as something like Twitter exists  that allows an on, now one thing that may be worth  a conversation is should an anonymity be allowed ever?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, yes, yes.  It is necessary for the harrass themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Then you're gonna have this no matter what.  Then this is gonna exist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me try the question a different way.  If you own Twitter and you're a responsible person,  would you do anything differently?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's what I'm asking.  I like the level up scheme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I really, I haven't thought this through,  but I like the idea of giving people  different levels of trust, maybe different circles.  I don't wanna call it circles of trust.  That sounds so- But our sponsors,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  when they get tweeted at, we instruct them,  okay, check how long it's been around,  how many followers there are.  You see, nobody saw this.  One of our sponsors wanted to put out a press release.  Jeez.  And we said, no one has seen this  until you put out a press release.  So- Stray Sand effect.  Yeah, so there's most, I mean, you're sophisticated, Stacey,  and you would understand some sort of karma points thing,  but most people, I mean, there is a karma points thing.  How long has that account been around?  How many followers do they have?  What are the other tweets?  You could easily look at that and go,  oh, well, that's obviously a bogus account.  People don't.  And even sophisticated people like Virginia Heffernan don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My students, we had this conversation.  My students say- What do they say?  When I have my case, ignore it.  It exposes them, they're out,  there's nothing you can do.  I just find that too sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, that's my attitude as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just don't think it's that complicated.  It's just, you should be able to,  when you block somebody,  they should no longer be able to at mention you,  turning that, they should no longer be able to use  a hashtag that uses your name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, but they could still tweet my sponsor  with my real name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, but you should be able to demonstrate  that you've blocked them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We do, and that's what we have,  but what it means is we have to call the sponsor,  or they'll call us and say,  you have to understand this is Twitter.  People don't know this about Twitter.  Even sophisticated people who ought to know better  don't know this about Twitter.  They think it's Twitter, it's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe it's something that people will have to learn  over time, maybe it's a generational thing.  I don't know.  I know that my daughter is, even at nine,  is far more sophisticated than I would imagine her to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Battlecam in our chat room saying something  I completely agree with.  He said the same mechanism people use to attack others  is used on a daily basis to get a company's attention,  and I would submit getting a company's attention  for a problem by a legitimate person happens far more  than using it as abuse, and I would agree.  In fact, that's why Twitter is valuable,  because it's most of the time used in a very valuable way.  We wouldn't want to lose it,  but I think structurally and endemically,  it has a flaw that is never going to go away.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that openness, and the further of it,  is openness has that flaw, period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So back to Vanny.  The tragedy of the Twitter.  Back to banning Milo.  Yeah, the tragedy of Twitter Commons.  Exactly.  Back to banning Milo Yiannopoulos.  Is that the right thing to do?  Is it curtailing free speech?  In my opinion, I mean, he's a vile,  horrible thing, what he's doing,  but he's doing it under his real name, which I-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Twitter has a right to say what goes out under its brand.  Of course they can.  I wish Twitter had higher standards,  and so that's not a matter of free speech.  That's a matter of Twitter having its own speech.  Twitter also has a right to edit.  Magazines have a right to edit.  They shouldn't be forced to publish things  they don't want to publish,  and that's what they're doing in this case.  Stacey, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I'm thinking this through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's rare for this show.  I mean, we never do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know, I'm terrible at that.  So you can't incite a riot,  and again, this is where laws are country-specific.  If you built standards that kind of talked about  inciting other people to harass  versus saying vile, stupid things that you just think,  maybe that's a way to get around.  Maybe that's when you ban someone like Milo,  who does have a right to free speech,  but when does it cross the line to like, yeah,  I guess yelling fire in a crowded theater,  or that's actually not the right analogy.  It's inciting a riot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He doesn't have a right to free speech on Twitter.  He has no right to say what he wants to on Twitter.  I know, Twitter feels like it's a platform for free speech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If Twitter, as a commercial entity that owns the platform,  decides that's a right they want to enforce,  or decides to quote unquote make it a right,  then he has it.  I mean, that's kind of what we're arguing,  is how Twitter creates rights or-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but Twitter has standards, right?  And so Twitter set a line of standards.  Now, I think what Leo's saying is,  does that line make any sense?  Because what they did was ban somebody who put his name on  versus a million people who don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They don't really have standards  because essentially they have standards,  and then they essentially banned Milo,  who has done things,  there are far worse people that they don't ban.  They banned him because it was a PR problem.  And they banned him because they could ban him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They can't ban the people who are anonymous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The solution is not to silence people,  it's to marginalize them.  The problem is that a troll can have as much  sort of like attention as the celebrity themselves,  especially when celebrities are retweeting them.  But the solution is to marginalize  through just tweaking the system as it exists.  So I think all you really need to do is have a system  that sort of pushes people out to the wilderness  if they're like sort of objectionable  to the people who they're talking about.  So that already exists on most other social networks.  It's not that complicated,  and I think Twitter could easily do it.  Why don't they?  Because it changes something that's unique about Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, every time I block this guy,  I provide them with all the previous handles.  If they really wanted to, they could in fact have,  there's a very concrete pattern.  He's actually just repeating the same tweets  over and over again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What if they charge you for more accounts?  I guess you just start a new email account, nevermind.  If you're really dedicated, you're gonna get through it.  Here's the other issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the real problem.  Somebody who's really like this is so dedicated.  I don't know.  It's like, well, that's the question.  It's like, you're spending so much more time on this.  I don't understand why.  It just like baffles me.  It's just bizarre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we shouldn't use him as our...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But there's many hims, not just,  you shouldn't use me as an example.  There are many, many, many people like this apparently.  For instance, I'm seeing a lot of hashtag free Milo stuff.  And it's, you know, by the way,  this is oddly conflated with Gamergate.  I don't understand this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, cause Milo had opinions about Gamergate  and you can imagine what they were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and apparently it's some of the same people  with Gamergate don't want a female cast.  What is so sacred about Ghostbusters?  It can't be remade.  Every other movie in the world,  including the first Star Wars,  which is essentially remade by the newest Star Wars,  has been remade.  I don't get people's obsessions.  I think what partly this is,  is that these people have always, I would guess,  have always existed, but never had a platform.  So we just haven't been that aware of them.  They've been...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And we make the mistake of encouraging them,  fight, fight, that happens all too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and that's usually why I'm breaking my absolute rule.  I know, I know.  I'm mentioning this at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I mean, I think it's...  I just put up a piece in the chat,  or in the rundown chat, from Eddie Robertson at The Verge,  who argues that the problem is  that Twitter's being vague about this.  This is also a matter of standards.  And we don't know what those standards are.  I think Facebook does a okay job of setting standards.  No matter what, no naked breasts.  Well, except for breastfeeding, but otherwise no.  Well, except for post-operative,  but otherwise no.  But they do set a line.  They try to do things around live and so on and so forth.  They try to set lines so that they can point to those lines.  The problem that Eddie Robertson has here  is that Twitter's vague about this.  They're not saying what the standard was,  or how can we enforce this in the future,  or what is it about my line?  I think that's a decent point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Selective enforcement is always a problem.  When you're, for instance, as a parent,  I know this as a parent,  if you punish some behavior but not others,  it confuses the hell out of your kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I think, Jeff, you give Facebook way too much credit.  In those cases you specified,  those policies were created as,  and only as, the direct result of bad PR.  That's the only thing that caused those policies.  They just plow forward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's not call it bad PR.  Let's call it feedback from the community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, seriously, people complained about it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and then Facebook changed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Otherwise, it wouldn't be bad PR, right.  That's why this is so difficult, incidentally,  because it is free speech, right?  People should have the right to complain,  even if you disagree.  And Milo should have the right  to have his bizarre political beliefs,  even if you disagree.  And he should be allowed to have that much.  It's not free speech on a commercial platform.  No, I understand.  The free speech in the sense of government  shall not make a law to restrict speech.  This is not free speech.  But we live in a world where we kind of want to encourage  people to be able to speak freely,  even if their opinions diverge from ours.  I'm not talking about the First Amendment style free speech,  but just the general notion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But think of it in terms of we have our home.  We have, so Jeff is a New York socialite,  the bell of the ball,  and has these massive cocktail parties  that are just, everybody's talking about them all the time.  And he has the right to invite who he wants  into his living room to have these cocktail parties.  And the right to, next time he has one,  to not invite that person,  because they got drunk and they tripped over the couch  and all that kind of stuff.  So next time he doesn't have to invite them.  And everybody supports his right to do that.  I think that social networks  should be like a cocktail party.  You should have the right to create one space  on the whole of the internet that's just yours.  And you can interact with just the people  you want to interact with.  And anybody who, if you're a semi-public figure  or a public figure or a celebrity or famous,  like Jeff Jarvis, you should be able to carve out  this space and say, okay, you know what?  You're not invited, out you go.  And so that when people want to interfere  with you and your community,  they can only really do it from inside your cocktail party,  inside of your little space.  In Twitter, there is no little space.  We're all outside, wandering around  like Pokemon Go players, clawing and scratching  at each other with no control over  who is at our cocktail party.  It's like having a cocktail party  where the law requires anyone can come.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you should start that business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google did, but nobody wanted it.  Oh, well then there we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well played, sir, well played.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you still using Google+, Mike?  I do, I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's getting weird because the sort of English speaking,  originally it was kind of an elite site  for very brainy people who were super enthusiastic  about what they're doing.  And little by little, some of those people  are wandering away.  But meanwhile, lots and lots of other people  who don't speak English so well  are not really aware of what's going on,  don't really want to have conversations  about what you post, are creeping in.  So it's a very active site,  but the nature of the conversation is getting weird.  I post a picture of a loaf of bread.  I'm like, oh, look at this great bread.  Oh, it's beautiful too, I wanted it, yeah.  Three or four people, five people, 10 people,  reply with, what is this?  It's a loaf of bread.  Have you noticed that?  I don't understand.  Have you never seen bread?  Maybe they haven't.  And there are a lot of people who post comments  that it's clear that they can't see the post or the photo.  So they're like, you know.  Or I think there's some bots, Mike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think there's some strange bots  that are there every time there's a photo.  What finally threw me off was every time  there was a photo there, you got 30 posts from Asia  just saying, oh wow, how nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there's no API though, how would this work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know.  There's a certain type of Vietnamese post  that uses five or six words from your post  and then trails off into Vietnamese.  Here's the bread, does that not look good?  Yeah.  Does it not look like bread?  Like who in the world would not say, oh, that's a loaf of bread.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Van Tung Pham says W-T-O-P.  I don't even know what that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Where are you located?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Michael Holland says hello.  And again, these are blueheads.  Like look at how many people don't have a program.  Charles cock-a-doodle-doo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's right, so that's what it's become.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And where are you located?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sometimes I go through the notifications feature  and a post from like three years ago will surface  and it has like 450 comments and 13,000 plus ones.  And I'm like, boy, those are the days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, by the way, Twitter has a similar problem  because if you look at your mentions  where people have mentioned you favorit-ed you,  retweeted you, bizarre old tweets of mine are,  it's filled with bots, usually attractive women  in low-cut dresses favoriting or retweeting  old tweets of mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have this horrible thing, Leo.  There's some services that I can't see right now.  I've got one right here.  Some time ago I said the first step to blogging  is not writing them but reading them.  So somebody made that into a GIF  and it's not always purely fake accounts  but it's BS accounts and I see this thing popping up  10 times a day.  Two or three of these quotes pop up.  There's clearly no reason for it.  They're not really quoting me.  They're trying to prove to somebody's algorithm  that they're real by seeming to have content  and then they do other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, yeah, that's the only thing I can figure out.  Actually, in the case of these women,  I think they just want people to see the avatar.  They're not women, Leo.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was gonna say, Leo, I'm sorry.  Yeah, sorry, I didn't disappoint you, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What?  But they're so cute.  And then if you look at their Twitter stream,  it's like, yeah, go to our site  and see our stuff and that kind of stuff.  It's spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They got you to click.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, only because they, well,  was that the whole goal is to get me to click?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, you.  It's confusing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it's pretty onesie-toosie.  Talk about retail spam.  I mean, that's a lot of work to get me to click.  Maybe that's what they're doing.  All right, let's take a break.  I'm very curious what Jeff Jarvis has to say.  We've been fighting back and forth over Google AMP.  Now AMP is amping ads.  Now I really wonder what Jeff Jarvis thinks about Google AMP.  I'll be curious what you have to say, sir.  Well, at least they're speedy.  Our show today, these ads are not, however.  Show today brought to you by Wealthfront.  I love Wealthfront.  Wealthfront solves a problem everybody has or should have,  which is if you're saving for the long-term,  your retirement college fund,  buying a house, rainy day fund, you got to invest it.  You can't just put it in a mattress.  You've got to invest it, but how are you going to do that?  Are you going to keep track of it,  learn all you need to do to learn  and rebalance and monitor it regularly?  Or you, probably not, right?  Or are you going to go to an advisor  and he'll take one, two, or 3%  of what you've got under investment  right off the top every year,  not to mention hidden fees, transaction costs.  It's very hard to make any money that way.  So we got a better way.  And it's a computer doing the work on your behalf.  That's why it's cheap.  Instead of one or two or 3%,  Wealthfront charges one quarter of 1% a year,  25 basis points a year,  with never any additional fees,  any transaction fees, any hidden fees.  That's all it costs.  That's less than $5 a month investing a $30,000 account.  And do they pay attention to your account?  Yes, they do.  Every minute of every day,  Wealthfront is rebalancing,  doing things like tax loss harvesting  to maximize your return and minimize your tax.  It's incredible.  And of course, you know exactly what it's doing at all times.  You can view and track all your accounts in one place,  even accounts that aren't Wealthfront accounts.  So you can see your whole net worth  on the Wealthfront site or using the Wealthfront app.  Every trade is on your dashboard.  It's amazing.  And it's based on the best research, the smartest minds.  So it really, really works.  They recently introduced their 529 College Savings Plan,  which lets you invest after-tax dollars.  It's kind of like a Roth IRA, basically.  So if you're saving for a child  or grandchild's higher expenses,  you want to save and you want to get the best return  at the lowest cost Wealthfront.  I'm not saying go there and sign up right away.  I want you to go there and research it and read it.  You owe it to yourself and your money.  But go to Wealthfront.com slash twig.  One way that you can learn about it  is they'll go through the question process.  It's very few questions to determine your timeframe  and your risk aversion.  And they'll generate a free  personalized investment portfolio.  That's yours to keep, it's free.  They'll also, if you want,  they can look at your other accounts  and say how much you're spending in fees,  how you could minimize taxes on it,  how diversified your investments are.  It's really, I mean, just think of it  as a financial checkup, but that's free.  Read up on Wealthfront.  And you can get started if you decide to invest.  You can get started for as little as $500.  That's the minimum investment.  And I really like this  because it's a great way to get a nest egg going.  Your first $15,000 will be free of charge,  not a quarter of 1%, but zero forever.  Forever.  That's nice.  Wealthfront.com slash twig.  I hear from a lot of people using Wealthfront  who are very, very happy.  Find out more.  Wealthfront.com slash twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can I add kind of a slightly related thing  to the Mylo story in terms of having fake people?  Yeah.  Just John Green just put up a post  saying this is one of the weirdest things in a while.  Now there's a lot of speculation that Meredith McIver,  the Melania speechwriter,  is not real.  What?  Yeah.  I just put it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that can't be.  Wow.  That's awesome.  So I had a theory worthy of Mike Elgin.  Because we're watching Melania speak.  And by the way,  not a knock on Melania in any way.  I feel very sorry for her.  She just, this is not her fault.  But I'm watching and she says,  Donald is never gonna give you up.  He's never gonna let you down.  And I said, I turned to Lisa and said,  she just Rick rolled us.  She said, what?  She just Rick rolled us.  And then, and I didn't catch the plagiarism,  of course I heard about it the next day,  but then I realized my theory was that Dick Tuck,  remember Dick Tuck, I'm sure you do, Jeff Jarvis.  The Democratic prankster.  Prankster, right.  Who got a number of pregnant African American women  to hold up the Nixon the one signs,  Nixon is the one signs during the Nixon, right.  He was famous and he was puckish.  He was not, he was a dirty trickster,  but in a kind of humorous vein for Humphrey,  I guess it was in 1968.  Anyway, I thought, you know what?  Some Dick Tuck style guy wrote this,  knowing that Melania wouldn't know and would just read it.  So now-  It's the troll of the year maybe.  I mean, talk about a great troll.  Anyway, that was my-  That's just fun.  That was my theory.  I don't know what now.  So then just this morning, they finally said,  oh no, you know what?  There's a woman who's written some stuff  for Donald in the past.  Melania was uncomfortable with the speech  that was written for her by professional speech writers.  So she called this woman up and said,  help me write this speech.  The woman said, okay, well, what?  Tell me some speeches you were impressed by.  What the kind of thing you'd like to say.  And Melania told her about Michelle Obama's  in the 2008 convention speech.  She said, I like this one.  And somehow text from that inadvertently,  and I believe that inadvertently,  got into the text of the speech.  Although they're never gonna give you up.  Never gonna let you down.  I'm still like, that is definitely a Rick roll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  There's a lot of stuff that seems kind of trollish.  When Donald Trump was introducing the VP candidate,  and of course there were rumors  that he had last minute cold feet  and kind of regretted the decision.  They were playing the Rolling Stones,  you can't get what you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't get what you want.  What the what?  Like before he announced his vice presidential candidate,  the theme song is you can't always get what you want.  But if you try sometime, you'll get what you need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wanna believe that somebody is trolling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think there are some disaffected campaign workers  is what I think.  But anyway.  So now the latest is that this woman doesn't exist.  I put them both up at the bottom of the rundown.  That can't be true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Donald did pretend to be his own PR dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they said they're not gonna fire Meredith MacGyver.  Is he can't fire a ghost?  And where is a picture of Meredith MacGyver?  Oh, there's a picture there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now Piers Morgan just came on to Twitter saying  that he'd dealt with her many times over the years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I would.  I've got one.  It's just too.  There's nothing too bizarre in this bizarre election cycle,  but that one maybe is a little funny.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So John Green said, you know John Green,  the wonderful VidCon John Green,  this Meredith MacGyver possibly not existing thing  is even by the standards of 2006  American political discourse intensely weird.  Yeah.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If nothing else, it's enjoyable.  Yeah.  Well, unless.  Well, unless the worst happens.  And you know what?  I have to be careful here  because even some of our employees are Trump supporters.  So, and I'm happily married to a Republican,  which I never thought I would be,  but you know what?  That has opened my mind.  No, and I want to say this.  That's opened my mind to the possibility  that everything I hold dear is wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I had a moment with God this week.  I was down, it was kind of a rough week  moving my parents into the retirement continuing care.  And that's a little bit of a story.  And we're going to get to Frontier Communications.  Oh man.  Oh man.  So one of the things, I had a whole list of to-dos.  One of the things I did was change their forwarding address  to the post office.  You go on now and there's some service  the post office sends you to  that tries to send you all kinds of ads  to try to make money on this basic government function,  whatever.  After it finishes with the address forwarding,  it says, well, you really need to update  your voter registration.  Do you want to do that?  Nice.  I faced God eye to eye  because my parents are both Fox News watching.  Oh, should you register that?  And I said, hmm.  Oh.  Oh, I did it.  I registered. Good man.  Good man.  I did, but oh, the election could be my fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, my parents are the same way, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I volunteered if I needed to  to drive my parents to the polling.  Good, good.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And run out of gas on the way.  Oh, I tried.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, geez.  My Tesla just ran out of power.  Stupid green machine.  Oh, you see, you see, we need more oil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If they'd only approve that pipeline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There you go.  Okay, can we not talk about politics anymore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know.  And I always resist it, but it's so hard not to  because it's so fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're a journalist.  You should have absolutely no opinions.  You're disgusting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's also a technology and social media dimension  which is hard to avoid when you're talking about technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and that's my, some would say rationalization,  some would say rationale.  I do feel like this is really an internet election  in a great degree.  And you can very much say that Mr. Trump's success  stems from his ability to directly address an audience  in the internet era in a way that no prior candidate  has been able to.  He mastered the medium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think also that the internet has helped  completely fragment us a lot more.  And that also helps him play to extremes  that both sides really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the thing I have to remind myself is  maybe he's playing to extremes.  Maybe he's not my candidate, but he got a lot of votes.  And there's a re-lock.  Bernie Sanders versus Trump.  And the same thing with Sanders.  And there's a reason, there's somebody,  that's of somebody's voice, somebody's opinion.  And I have to acknowledge it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So two things about this, Leo.  Number one, I would say a lot is relative.  13 million people out of 350 million people  is not a lot of Americans  who actually went to the trouble of voting for that candidate.  Well, we'll see.  But what it'll be telling is the general, of course.  The problem we have,  and I've done this a little bit before,  where I think we're at the end of the mass media  business model, which means we're at the end  of the notion of the mass.  We have institutions that depend upon the idea of the mass.  Like political parties, yeah.  There's two parties, and we're all gonna be clumped  into one of two.  And then we're gonna battle it out,  and we'll come up with some compromise that's okay.  Well, now 13 million Americans could come along  and utterly take over, insurgently take over  one of those two institutions.  And they used brilliantly the tools now at hand to do so.  And used everything legally and above board  and the way it is, and they used the system.  The system wasn't rigged.  They managed to use that system to do that.  And so the institutions that depended upon this idea  of the mass are now challenged because you don't have  to be as big as the mass to take over.  You just gotta be smarter about the tools for now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Should we be a parliamentary democracy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is, it's all we just.  We should vote based on our principles.  I know that's never gonna happen,  but right now we vote based on the person  who can defeat the person we hate.  Something like 55% of people who are voting for Trump  are doing so because they wanna vote against Hillary Clinton.  Only 35% or something like that  actually wants Trump to be president.  55% just don't want Hillary Clinton to be president.  Likewise on the other side, a lot of people  are gonna vote Democrat because they don't want  Donald Trump to be the election.  That's the nature of a two party system.  No, there are three parties on the ballot in all 50 states.  And there should be four.  Bernie Sanders should have run on socialist.  Oh, please no.  Gary Johnson, no, yes, but Gary Johnson  should have divided the right vote.  Bernie Sanders should have divided the left vote  and we'd have at least four.  There should actually be a dozen or more people  on the ballot in all 50 states.  Look how well that's working in Great Britain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  England has a Prime Minister no one elected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And a head of labor nobody likes.  And a foreign minister that hates other countries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like your presidential system,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  but it would work a lot better if people voted  according to the candidate that they want  instead of the person who they think  could defeat the candidate they don't want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to say, and maybe I'm sick of my head in the sand,  but I, and I said this yesterday too,  I think that our founding fathers were very smart.  I think they created an amazingly successful form  of government that has stood the test of time,  that there have been times as fragmented  and as challenging as this many times in our democracy.  We don't really remember them,  but they have been and we've survived in each case.  And I think we'll survive in this case  and I think it works pretty darn well.  It's not perfect, of course, but I have faith in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have faith in the founding fathers as well,  but the founding fathers never envisioned  party conventions, they never envisioned,  George Washington specifically said,  watch out for political parties,  you don't wanna get involved in these political parties.  So I think that they, I think it's kind of,  that the problems are not founding father problems,  they're simply things that we've invented lately that-  And I think we'll transcend those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think we'll transcend those.  And I think that the three, the three balance,  the checks and balances, the three branches of government,  the interesting, the electoral college,  the interesting kind of non-representative,  but the representative as opposed  to truly democratic system.  I think all of these things, I think are self-healing  and I think that we will do fine, but-  I hope so, though, you star-eyed optimist too.  I'm a star-eyed optimist.  Hey, you know what, if we don't, we don't.  Look at, no empire lasts forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, because I think this notion of institutional challenge,  institutional revolution is profound  and there are institutions, political parties,  labor unions, universities, post office,  all kinds of institutions in society  that are now challenged.  And look at newspapers, right?  Newspapers are trying to preserve themselves  in some form, well, maybe they all do need to go  and something replaces them, libraries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We are in exciting times, right?  And we're in disruptive times.  I think that's not unusual  and I think equilibrium eventually is achieved.  Unfortunately, these interregnums are often, sad to say,  a lot of people get hurt.  A lot of people lose jobs, a lot of people lose  not just their livelihood, but their lives.  And that's the nature of the way human society progresses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me say this without, please don't get mad at me, people.  I'm making this for illustration, okay?  Okay, would you just listen for one second?  I'm not saying what I'm about to say.  But if trolls can take over Twitter,  they can take over the political system.  Well, that's an interesting question.  Yeah, that's an interesting question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, if you have an open political system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Mike, the disagreement I have with you is that,  yes, on one hand, we should have four parties, six parties,  but it doesn't work with a Congress  that is then built around two parties.  We do have those parties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We do have those parties.  Mike Bloomberg.  We actually do have them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mike Bloomberg has said, why didn't he run?  Because he said, number one,  I couldn't get into either party.  So then if I run as an independent, let's say I win,  but I have absolutely no backing from anything,  nothing's ever gonna happen to Congress.  Wouldn't be the first time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The only reason we have two parties  is because of the money.  If you took the money out of politics,  there would be many, many parties.  And I think our democracy would function a lot better.  But I think that you mentioned  the trolls could steal an election.  If they did steal an election, and now back to technology,  they'd have to steal it from the bots,  because I think bots are the ones  who really are controlling this election  in a scary way that people haven't really come to terms with.  So much of the influence of political discourse  online, on social media,  is actually automated astroturf bots  that are really more influential than people realize.  Wow.  Wasn't that a plot thread on House of Cards?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go ahead, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, wasn't that a plot thread on House of Cards?  Or that was controlling search results?  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they tried to.  Go ahead, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just for the record, Slate says they do have proof  that Meredith McIver exists.  That was a short-lived moment.  That was a quick brief moment of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow, that was like quality journalism for us right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's the question.  Is Ann Coulter a bot or a troll?  It's not clear.  You're gonna get in trouble for that.  I know, oh no.  Really, do you think Ann Coulter has any supporters left?  You'll find out.  You'd be surprised.  I don't care.  You'd be surprised.  Google looks to amp up mobile ads,  new ad initiative builds on companies' effort  to speed up delivery of mobile web content.  We've talked about Google Amp, a kind of stripped-  Ad nauseum, yes.  Ad nauseum, a stripped-down version of the internet  that is compatible with all browsers,  intended for mobile browsing to speed up sites.  Google has been encouraging internet publishers  to offer both amp and un-amped sites,  but of course, encourage them to do the faster amp sites.  And some ad technology was allowed.  Does it make sense for ads to be part of amp?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, absolutely, because the problem is,  because of the priority in which the content  is served on amp,  the structure of the page, which is not allowed to change  so we can't jump around, you get the content,  the ads will then box out,  and then the ad will come into that box  when it's good and ready.  Well, so what's happening is the ads ain't getting served  by the time you've seen the page.  Right.  And Google's known this from the beginning.  The hidden agenda here is to speed up,  not just web pages from content perspective,  but speed them up from ads.  Ads are what slow us down so much.  So if your ads aren't seen,  on the one hand, the advertiser can say,  well, fine, I won't pay for it, it's not visible.  But on the other hand, they are trying to buy ads  and trying to get to people,  and so speeding up ads is a critical piece  of speeding up the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of stripping out that ugly ad tech  that really is the real problem, frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there's various things about what you do,  but I think that this is important,  and it's gonna be good for the advertisers in the end.  We know from content, we've known for years,  the faster the page,  the more engagement and traffic you will get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mike, we lost your audio.  I see you talking, but I...  I see you talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's my bad, my bad.  Okay, go ahead.  I had it muted.  So the other part of this  that a lot of people aren't talking about  is that this initiative also includes a landing page.  What happens when you click on this fast ad?  You get a fast page as a result of that,  which makes advertising,  greases the wheels of advertising,  which I think is a good thing.  I don't see what the harm is.  And like you said, Leo, I think slow ads, bloated ads  is a big part of the problem  that's driving people to ad blockers,  which by the way are now banned in China, I'm hearing.  And so I think it's an alloyed good.  I don't see any downside to this at all.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel much reassured.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was the fastest amp discussion we had.  I have room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I, you know what?  Is amp getting traction?  I see a lot of amp stuff now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  I still think Google is not linking to it  from enough places.  I don't think, I think it's from Google News  and from the carousel.  And from a few other places,  but I don't think the traffic is much yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We go through Google Now.  Does it go to an amp page?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good question, Stacey.  You mean like via voice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  No, just if I click on like a story from my Google Now page.  They're rolling it up a bit by that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I see amp articles on my Google Now.  It has the little lightning bolt, not all of them.  But yeah, but I think I do see  lightning bolts.  But I seem to remember lightning bolts  in my Google Now stories.  I love, by the way, I love Google Now.  I don't know what Google's plans are.  They don't really seem to have a long-term strategy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google Now should be their strategy.  I mean, cause it's the anticipatory web right now.  I agree.  So I'm like, make it happen, man.  I love it.  Do you use it all the time, Stacey?  I do.  I mean, I love that it alerts me when there's traffic stuff.  If I put in an address, I, what else?  I use it for all kinds of stuff.  I love it.  I open it whenever I'm in a place  just to see like what's cool on the menu.  Or I was in the cell phone lot at the airport  and I opened that and it was like,  hey, people who are at this spot, this location,  they wanna see this.  And it handed me the arrival times  of all the flights coming into the airport.  And I was like, that's what I was gonna search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, isn't that awesome?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you know, I get kind of that stuff in Google inbox,  which is great.  I see it showing up in various places in Google Keep  and some of the Google Now stuff.  I think that Google Now will really,  should come into its own, I don't know if it will,  when Google Home comes out.  Because I find personally that once I started using  the Amazon Echo and Alexa,  I almost completely stopped using Google Now and Siri.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What the hell are we gonna get Google Home?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No one knows yet,  but I would actually like Google Now on the Echo.  I know that's like sacrilege, blasphemy, whatever,  but I would love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think you're gonna,  I think that's gonna be what that little air freshener.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but I don't wanna buy the air freshener.  I already have a bunch of Sonos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's like me, I have like probably  four or $5,000 worth of Sonos equipment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, me too.  Oh, oh, oh, did you guys, that was me being excited.  That was so exciting, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is a common thing.  Can I pick up a ringtone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Please, I want that ringtone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Please.  This is such a common question.  I have to tell people about it.  So a company called J-Star.  You're just the greatest.  Thank you, Stacey, I love you.  Okay, they showed a video for an Echo Skill  that is not yet approved,  that will let you control your Sonos from your Amazon Echo.  So if you Google,  it's a YouTube video from,  it's the company that does Josh.ai, josh.ai.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, so it's not an official interface?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not approved yet.  They've made the skill.  But it's not from Sonos.  It's not from Sonos.  Why not?  Because Sonos doesn't have their API put together yet.  Anyway, there it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Third party app, Josh,  will bring a few new skills and different voices to Echo.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the Sonos thing is kinda at the end.  So the first part of-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is Josh like an alter,  like is it in the Echo?  Is it in my Echo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Josh is actually a home control with voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's not in my Echo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's a skill that they've developed  and they're just waiting for approval.  But it's an Echo Skill.  They've designed it to be,  but Amazon has to approve it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'm saying things like ask Josh to play  Beyonce Lemonade on my Sonos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  On my Tesla so I can control it.  Josh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the part of the Amazon Echo that doesn't work.  We need artificial intelligence  and we need Alexa choosing the skill.  If I have to remember-  You guys stop saying our game name.  Yeah, Echo.  Yeah, sorry.  The virtual assistant that shall not be named.  That should be picking the skill, not me.  I can't remember all of these commands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you can now.  Yeah, I agree with you.  And that's what Google and Apple are about to do  where they disintermediate.  They are actually vice versa.  They intermediate.  They become your ombudsman  and go out and get what you need.  And they know what apps you have  and they know what skills you need.  And you just ask her.  That's how, well, that's how Echo should be too, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah, and Viv will be like that too, which is-  Right, viv.ai.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what's funny?  Because until you get your Tesla  that you can't use the Tesla app.  It says you don't have a Tesla.  Wow.  Oh.  Cause I really-  No soup for you.  I know, I really wanna use it.  So, how well integrated is your Tesla  into your Sonos and everything else?  Is it just-  It is not.  It's not, it should be an IOT thing, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there is a company, it's called, hold on.  I think it's called Eve.  Let me find it.  They do an app through the Wink.  And the last time I tried it,  it was super high latency.  So it didn't work as well.  And then Tesla introduced some of the same functionality  that I liked, but they have since revamped it  and I haven't tried it yet.  I'm looking for it in my inbox, which is exciting.  Here it is.

Transcript:  Eve Connect brings Wink to Tesla.  Oh, you found it.  Look at you.  That's a Karsten, he's fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, Eve Connect.  He's faster than me typing.  He went to Harvard, you know.  Oh, fancy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He won't say it, but I will.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's he doing working in a slum like this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But yes, that is an app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Long term, did we?  It does that.  And then I think Ford SYNC is gonna sync to the Echo,  which will give you the smart home stuff.  Oh.  They announced that at CES, but I don't know if-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you'll pull into the garage and it'll join the wifi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it does that anyway.  Does it?  The Tesla, oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, the Tesla does, yeah, but-  Yes.  Do you have autopilot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I do not.  I bought my Tesla used because I'm like-  You're smart.  I was gonna go miserly of a sort.  No, smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is a pretty good deal to buy a used Tesla.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's never a good idea to buy a new car.  Buying a new car is the worst.  It loses- I never buy new cars.  I still-  It loses like 30% of its value when you drive off the lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Teslas don't, but yes.  Well, I'll find out on Friday.  There you go.  Oh, your car's already lost value.  They actually said they couldn't.  What?  I haven't bought it yet.  Well, wait.  They said they couldn't keep the pricing of the Model X.  They couldn't guarantee it would hold up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah, they used to guarantee that, right?  The resale value and they're not gonna do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you're-  I think they're missing a big opportunity with that app.  As somebody who's already got one coming,  you should be able to use the app  and communicate with your Tesla and say,  so what's going on?  And your Tesla should say,  oh right now they're putting the paneling on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even if they had a lie,  even if they said, right now I'm getting sprayed,  it would be okay, I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, well they should make that up.  Because the app, honestly, Leo, it's not that great.  I'm gonna tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Android or iPhone better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The iPhone actually is better  because it comes up faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I'm gonna dedicate my iPhone to the,  it's gonna be like my Tesla phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is creepy though,  because you can see where people are.  There's a location section,  so you can see the car driving around.  And I always, I'm like, oh man,  my husband will log in and it'll be like,  he no longer calls and asks me where I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Lisa's not gonna like that.  You mean I can see where Lisa is right now at any moment?  And vice versa?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If she was driving her Tesla  and you had access to the app, yes.  I don't think you can.  Or ask somebody in the chat rooms,  because I have not been able to.  I'll be reporting back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I will tell you all.  Let's see here.  Nougat is very close.  I have not gotten it yet on my Nexus.  Have you, Nexus 6P?  But apparently Preview 5 is coming soon.  Google released it earlier this week.  Have you downloaded it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I downloaded something yesterday.  That would be it then.  That would be it, okay.  And, oh yeah, oh there it was.  I just had the message telling me  to do something about this.  Oh. Mine did not get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I'm on the, are you on the developer preview?  Yeah. Okay.  Apparently there's a new Easter egg in it.  Do you want to try for the Easter egg?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh no, I haven't restarted installs all day.  Oh okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good, because this is ridiculous.  It's like. What is the Easter egg?  Oh, it's ridiculous.  Okay.  So, you know, you tap.  Well, if you press and hold.  Okay, so you have to turn, you know,  get the cartoon in, which means you go to about phone,  tap the Android version number like six times.  You get a cartoon in.  But press and hold the end  and you get a small cat emoji underneath it.  Tapping that again reveals a no entry emoji.  Then, swipe down your notification quick settings,  tap edit, find the question mark Android Easter egg  quick setting, drag it to your quick settings.  After it's moved, tapping on the new empty dish  quick setting, toggle, begins a game  where you have to entice a cat to feed  from an empty plate using either  bits, fish, chicken, or treats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Then tap on the get a life emoji.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Should a feline take the bait, which isn't guaranteed,  you'll receive a notification with a cat  and a number tapping on that reveals a new window  with a smiling cartoon cat that when long pressed  can be shared as an image.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is why I carry an iPhone.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that somebody's 20% project?  What's the deal with that?  How?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did they tell you this when they released it?  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does someone actually find this?  That's the question is how did somebody  at Android Central find this?  Daniel Bader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeez.  Someone must have sent him an email.  That's not even, that's not an Easter egg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, Blake Bryant, it was his informant.  He has 715 followers on Google Plus.  He's a computer gaming nerd and apparently  has a lot of free time.  Wow.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here is something that worries me.  Hangouts, the new version of Hangouts does not,  no longer merges SMS messages with Hangout messages.  In other words, you really don't want to use it  as your SMS client anymore.  You have to start using that other thing, Google Messenger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is part of Google's inexplicable policy  of making almost everything that they offer  work not as good as it used to.  Yeah, what, why would you even, what the?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When you get Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, this reminds me of Google Photos,  which used to have amazing editing tools.  They took it out.  And now they're just lousy editing tools,  so it's like why did you do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they still own the code, but they said not to use it.  So Mike, are you using Fi in your travels?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, I am.  And in fact, this is my tool of the week.  Okay, so save it.  We'll talk about it, that's coming up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Save it, because I want to know  if I should get a Fi phone for my kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, I will tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Excellent.  Yay, Facebook is paying a lot of money  to get internet stars to put their live video on Facebook,  kind of wooing away the Vine stars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So how much they paying you, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nuttin, $2.2 million in payments  intended to encourage experimentation on Facebook Live  says Facebook, this isn't even a rumor.  They pay a guy, John Paul Piquez, who is a Vine star.  He does body six second videos on Vine.  $119,000 to use Facebook Live  streaming at least five times a month through September.  Nice work if you can get it.  Ray William Johnson's getting a quarter of a million dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are these all guys?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep.  Ooh, good point.  They are all guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are they all doing body humor as it were?  Probably, I don't know.  I mean, Vine is a good place for that.  I'm just thinking about the demographic  they're trying to go after in Vine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's interesting, I didn't think it is.  There are some great female Viners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yes, it could be just the list they selected.  Yeah.  They're more likely to be like, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here you go.  Elise Strechen, Strechen,  host of the YouTube cooking channel My Cupcake Addiction  says a Facebook video may draw a million views  and 900 to 1,000 comments.  A live video may get only 100,000 views  but as many as 3,000 comments.  So she says on my YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know what to think about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's weird.  More comments but fewer views.  When I'm live, she says on my YouTube show,  it's polished, it's perfect.  When I'm live, so she is apparently  one of these people getting paid.  This is the Wall Street Journal.  When I'm live, it's really me.  Like dealing with when your kid eats half the ingredients  and you have to improvise.  Ooh, that's probably fun to watch.  According to the document viewed by the journal,  Ms. Strechen may be paid up to $196,000  during five months to create live videos.  She declined to comment.  So here's a question. That makes sense though.  Sure, sure.  Pay to play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They work hard, they deserve the money.  I was thinking about the viewership and the commentary  because the idea is the back and forth  that you would be getting, which would be awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And those count as comments, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what I imagine.  Sorry, Mike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just wonder if you can transfer a fan base  from one platform to another.  I mean, are there any known cases  where you can simply buy people who emerged organically  on Vine or YouTube and then transfer them  to another service where they continue to grow and be...  It seems to me that certain types of people  are ideally suited for certain platforms  and thrive on that platform.  I mean, Vine is very different from YouTube, for example.  And Facebook's trying to buy influence in this space.  Is that possible?  Has this ever been done?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I give you, I don't think so.  I think that that's actually...  This is Jeff Bezos' first Vine.  I kid you not.  This is Jeff Bezos' first Vine.  He's an alien from Star Trek Beyond, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When it comes to signal to noise ratio,  he really, I think his first ever tweet was,  I just launched and landed a rocket.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is from the 20th, just a couple of days ago.  No, wait a minute, that's today.  That's today.  Couple of days ago, that's right now.  And I guess I've heard that he is an extra  in Star Trek Beyond.  He's an alien, yeah.  Yeah, so this is him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is awesome.  I would totally use my celebrity status  as a CEO to get into like...  Yeah, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hope that he laughs,  because his laugh is so distinctive.  He's the best.  That you would immediately know,  my God, that alien's Jeff Bezos.  Is there a Jeff Bezos laugh ringtone?  No, there should be,  along with the Stacey Higginbotham ringtone.  The excited ringtone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the Stacey Higginbotham joy ringtone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The joy, the ringtone of joy.  Anyway, to answer your question,  I think you're exactly right, Mike.  I don't think it translates.  And I think that we've already seen,  we saw YouTube try to do this.  They spent $100 million taking celebrities  from other media to bring them to YouTube.  And it didn't work.  Shaquille O'Neal did not become a YouTube star.  As big a star as he is in the real world.  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are YouTubers though,  and Viners that go to like,  the Disney Channel and other...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fred Higgin, what was his name?  Fred Figglesworth.  Fred was a big YouTube star.  And I don't think you could qualify  his film career as successful.  I think it is really very much,  I don't know of an exception,  but I think it's very much...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What about Erin?  She's a sportscaster lady.  Was she a Vine star?  No, she had a vlog, she had a video, a YouTube thing.  Well, they're quite a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually come to think of it,  there are quite a few people who have migrated  from YouTube to mainstream success.  That's not unusual.  But YouTube's more like real TV than Vine is.  Vine is a very specific medium.  It is.  It's a weird culture,  because I mean, there are huge stars on Vine  that you and I have never heard of,  because we're not Viners.  I love Vine.  Do you go every day?  Will you go to Vine every day and look at...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I just like making them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You make them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've only made a few, but yeah.  I like shooting tiny little six second videos.  When we had this hedgehog in our house,  I kept trying to make it do something interesting,  so I could Vine it,  because I just thought it'd be fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was it a feral hedgehog,  or was it a pet hedgehog?  No, it was a pet hedgehog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If it were feral, it would have been more interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would say getting it out of the house  was the main thing you should have been concentrating on  in that case, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  To me, the biggest question that I'm really curious about  is what happens when YouTube's mobile live feature kicks in?  Will that launch a bunch of live YouTube stars or not?  Is YouTube ideally suited for the PewDiePie type  of edited, polished videos,  or can it be a great medium for live?  I'm really curious.  I hope that it will spawn a whole new generation  of YouTube live stars, but we don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll bet it will.  Live is so, so, so the hot thing now, thanks to Facebook.  The AP TV interviewed me today  about Roger Ailes potentially leaving Fox News,  and the guy who shot it said that now all the clients  out there want nothing but live TV.  It's all they want is live.  Yeah, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love that.  Live is awesome.  Live is great, right?  That's what we're doing.  We're live.  Well, we are and we aren't.  I know.  I mean, because really the vast majority of our viewers  and listeners consume it after the fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which isn't that, isn't that,  you know, I haven't seen any numbers.  Isn't that true of Facebook Live as well?  Oh, maybe, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not true of TV, obviously.  Certainly the well-known videos.  Yeah, I mean, On Demand is a fraction  of the total TV audience.  But that's because TV's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the fact, as you know, Leo,  the fact that you do have some live audience  and it goes for Facebook Live and so on,  completely changes what the content is  and how it feels and all that kind of stuff.  Absolutely.  Oh, wait, here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hi, Dad.  Is your dad watching?  He said he said he would be.  Nice.  Which I could only do if he were live.  Is your dad also in Austin or is he?  No, he's in Houston.  Houston.  Stacy, do people have pet hedgehogs?  You're still worried about the hedgehog.  Yes, people do have pet hedgehogs.  I will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're legal in New York.  Do people in Texas have pet armadillos?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have never, oh no, I saw my first live armadillo  actually a year ago.  So I don't think so.  Aren't they beloved?  Oh, yes, but they're like always dead  in the middle of the road.  Did you think it would be better

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to have them as pets and save them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah, you see a lot of armadillos on roadkill.  I think we need to save the armadillos campaign.  No, no.  Jeff's never been to Texas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was like Texas doesn't think that way.  If we love something, we kill it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just want you to understand how lucky you are  because not only can you openly carry a gun in Texas,  you can have a hedgehog as a pet.  Here in California, we can't do either.  I know.  Hedgehogs are illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're legal in New York, I think.  I think doesn't New York classify them as-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ferrets were outlawed for a while there back.  I don't know about hedgehogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ferrets, sugar gliders, hedgehogs, all illegal  in the state of, in the people's Republic of California.  My son drives them crazy.  He says, why can't I have a hedgehog?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, they're not that great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to get a license.  They're not that great.  They smell a little bit, don't they?  Just think of all the amazing things

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that will be legal after the Texit.  Texit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Texit.  I'm voting for Texit.  Here's a change.org petition you might want to sign.  Legalize hedgehogs as pets in the state of California.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They didn't reach the critical number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo, maybe you can change that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everybody now, I beg of you.  What's that?  What's that, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I downloaded the latest Nougat  and I can't get Google Now.  At all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a tragedy.  I think Google's killing Google now.  Let's start a rumor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're merging it with Plus and Hangout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm changing it to Google Venn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google Venn.  It's going to be, whoever was in charge of Google Wave  is not going to be in charge of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  SoftBank buys Arm for $32 billion,  thereby co-opting, cornering,  completely owning the entire internet of things market  for now and ever, amen.  Right, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sort of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think this is really a crazy deal.  I'm glad we're talking about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I see the note that says Stacey wants to talk about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Please?  Okay, so this is a great, this is a surprising thing.  SoftBank, they actually have SoftBank, the carrier in Japan.  They also own Sprint.  And I gotta say that it was so crazy  because no one thought Arm would go anywhere  because they are like literally-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're so British.  They're so British.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're very British.  You can tell looking at Simon.  I mean, look at that guy.  He's staid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He also said, this is a dark day for the British Empire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was the co-founder of, that was another co-founder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it was another guy, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was the guy who founded it.  Not Simon.  That would be terrible if your CEO said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's right.  He's all for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, he did, he helped do the deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But he says in that video, actually,  he says in the video that the only reason they did it  is because they paid so darn much for it.  Well, that's a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a chunk of change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the second largest chip deal after Broadcom Avago.  So that was 37 billion.  So this is huge.  SoftBank gets basically 95,  almost every single mobile phone  has an ARM-based processor inside.  And ARM doesn't sell chips.  They make the-  They sell the design.  They sell an instruction set, basically.  Sell the design for the chip.  They own the mobile ecosystem.  They are getting into microprocessors,  which is the internet of things,  but they do actually have competition there.  And then they're also getting into servers.  So they don't screw it up.  There's growth potential for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I think this is a deal.  I know it's a lot of money,  but I think, and SoftBank, by the way,  I used to work for a son's son  because he owns Ziff Davis briefly.  And I think partly,  it's hard to understand SoftBank.  It's more like Berkshire Hathaway than it's like-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a private-  This isn't a strategic deal for them.  It's an investment.  We have a lot of money.  Let's put it someplace it's gonna grow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so they're not gonna move ARM to Japan.  They're gonna let the same people run it.  They want to own the proceeds.  I think it's a great deal.  They're gonna own internet of things.  They're gonna own the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, they could own the future architecture  for just about everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Intel has taken a run at ARM and failed.  In fact, ARM is basically putting Intel out of business  in a way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is, and it's encroaching on their territory.  Servers.  Their high margin server territory.  Now, whether or not that'll actually happen, I don't know.  They're also both going after the cellular equipment market  with, they used to have like ASICs,  like program, like specially designed chips.  The cellular equipment market is now,  ARM's got stuff there and so does Intel.  So that could be interesting too.  And that's related to some of SoftBank's own interests.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Intel or Apple, somebody was rumored to be going after ARM.  The problem is because it could really,  and then in this article on Medium that you linked to,  did you write it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah, I wrote that one.  Well, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would be why you linked to it.  I was gonna link to something else.  No, no, no, this is good.  You point out that other chip companies really,  because of anti-competitive issues, couldn't buy it.  It had to be somebody like SoftBank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and a long time ago I thought Google might buy it,  but then Amazon and all of these other like data center,  companies that operate big data centers took ARM licenses.  So then someone like Google couldn't really buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think this is a very exciting move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I couldn't, if they put the money into ARM,  I think it will be amazing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and Apple, some question about Apple,  because Apple uses ARM, has licensed the ARM architecture  to create the iPhone and iPad chips,  but they have, I think they have  a perpetual license to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's two types of licenses.  There's an architecture,  yeah, which means you can futz with the design  as long as you don't.  That's what Apple has, right?  And that's what Apple has,  and Samsung and Qualcomm and all those guys.  And then there's just like the straight up,  we're just gonna take this as it is and use it.  Like Raspberry Pi.  You can futz as long as you don't want, Stacey.  You can't futz with,  if you don't have an architectural license,  you can't futz with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you either buy their design outright, which is cheaper,  or you buy the right to use the design as a basis  for your own designs, which is what Apple does.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's kind of like Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, except it's not, there's no free tier.  No free arm tier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's no free tier, and they make sure,  there are limits to how you couldn't like fork  the arm instructions that they've got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting.  So Apple can't abandon arm and just say,  hey, we got it from here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They can't, they could totally design their own chips.  Or they'd have to start from scratch.  But they couldn't use the arm.  Architecture.  But they've done, I mean, arm came about  as Apple working with a company called Acorn Technology.  So, for the Newton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and Acorn did the BBC computer, I think.  So this is really interesting.  And by the way, it powers something that is in some ways  spiritually the successor to the BBC computer,  which is the Raspberry Pi.  And that's also powered by arm.  And yes, Apple put a lot of money into arm for the Newton,  one of the first mobile devices.  And then sold at stake in arm,  but continued to use arm designs.  Well, didn't continue to, they restarted, I guess,  with the iPhone and then later the iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And arm is, it's such a quintessentially British company.  Like nobody knows about it.  They don't talk about it.  You know, you get Intel,  actually Brian Kozanich isn't like this,  but previous Intel CEOs were all like, you know,  Intel inside and they were so out there,  kind of like Jensen is for Nvidia.  But arms, they've never been that way.  They've just British.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  That's good.  This is a dark day for the British Empire.  We shall fight them in the trenches.  We'll provide them in the hands of the roads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When is, has Elon's master plan emerged yet?  He's writing it now.  He stayed up all night.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  On crack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He pulled an all nighter.  On crack he tweeted, which is probably not true.  What is his master plan going to be?  It must have something to do with his acquisition  of a solar city, right?  I don't know.  Anyways, he said he's finishing.  This is this morning, 7 37, finishing off the plan  while listening to the soundtrack from Gatsby.  Seems appropriate.  He has a sense of humor.  He does.  Elon, I'm gonna be at the factory at 11 on Friday.  Come by, say hi.  I'd love to get your autograph on my new Tesla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wouldn't that be cool to have a big Elon,  take a long one.  Yeah, take a long one Sharpie.  Elon Musk, autograph Tesla.  Now that would increase the value of backup.  I promise never to sell it, Elon.  Never, I love you, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, I think we can, any,  this blew me away.  I'm gonna do this this morning,  almost spit out my Cheerios.  Seagate has announced 10 terabyte hard drives.  The helium drives?  The helium drives starting at $430.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  10 terabytes.  We are living in amazing times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was exactly what I said after I picked up the Cheerios.  10 terabytes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And yet people still buy 16 gigabyte smartphones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's cause they're doing,  they don't think they sell them for so much more  if they're like 32 or 64  and some people don't even offer 64 at those punks.  Okay, I have feelings about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this is not flash.  This is a 7,200 RPM spinning drive.  They call them helium because they're filled with helium.  Not sure why.  Some magic.  Can also be used as gyroscope.  Lighter than air. Is it cooling?  Probably has something to do with that, right?  Yeah.  I can't imagine what the data density is in these drives.  It's just unbelievable.  I can remember thinking,  oh, by 2020 we won't be using spinning spindle drives.  It'll be all holographic memory.  There's no way.  But no one predicted was the amazing increases in capacity  that first IBM and then its successors  were able to come up with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, also, I don't think they were able to contemplate  maybe the amount of digital detrius we'd like to keep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that there would be a market for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, because spinning drives are still so cheap  and then you look at like Facebook  and their cold storage efforts  and I'm just kind of like stunned.  By the way, someone did tweet me saying  that the reason you don't have pet armadillos  is because they carry leprosy, which...  Okay.  Never pet an armadillo, you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Bah.  Not us.  Bah.  Yeah.  One of the things I think is interesting  about the continued existence of physical spinning hard drives  is that it kind of maps to the logic  that Google was essentially founded on.  When Google first started building up  sort of their search engine,  even when they were still at Stanford,  when they first moved into the Wajiski garage and so on,  their whole mindset was...  Everybody else was like,  how do we maximise reliability for each unit  that's in this big store, you know, this big server?  And Google's like, we don't care about that.  We have software that will gracefully and quickly failover  across multiple semi-functional systems.  The only thing that matters is how much does it cost?  How much bang can we get for the buck? Period.  And so they were scraping together in the early days,  used hard drives that were problematic  and used computers and servers and so on.  And that's kind of been their mentality all along.  It really, at the end of the day, when you have these huge...  They have an enterprise version that's been out for a while,  but even for consumers who would need something like this,  it doesn't matter if it's spinning hard drive.  What matters is what's the cost per terabyte, I guess, in this case?  It's the cost per terabyte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's actually cost per unit of compute for that,  or cost per unit of search for them.  Yeah, resiliency has become the key to not just Google  and its hardware infrastructure, but even things like  if you're going to build something in Amazon's cloud,  the assumption is you build an architecture stuff,  be it hardware or software, for it to go down  and failover somewhere else because it's so cheap.  It's so great. Sorry, I get excited by this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That wasn't your excited sound, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that wasn't as exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Her O sound was much better.  Yes.

Speaker: UNKNOWN

I would love to be in the south of France right now, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is lovely here.  And I am loving my pick of the week, which is Google Fi.  Now, of course, Google Fi has been around for a while.  And Stacey asked earlier in the show,  should she get a Google Fi phone for your daughter, Stacey?  Yes, she's mine.  So the answer is yes, of course, you should.  Google Fi has been awesome.  Essentially what it is is an MVNO,  which originally started out on two US carriers,  now is on three US carriers.  And the magic of Google Fi, because the phones,  the Nexus phones that it's available on,  have special antennas that enable them to quickly switch  on the fly between both Wi-Fi and the three carriers.  So if you're walking around and you're,  it will default to the fastest carrier.  And if you wander into an area  where another carrier is faster,  it just switches you over to the other carrier.  You never even notice it.  You just always have reliability and speed.  It's magic, it's wonderful.  It's also great in terms of,  and again, I'm talking about the existing benefits  and I'll get to the new benefits in a sec.  The pricing plan is so clear and so fair.  So essentially you pay a certain amount  for the phone itself, so just for the account.  So you pay, I believe it's 20 bucks a month  for unlimited domestic talk and text,  and unlimited international texts,  and then you get a special rate on international calls  if you're abroad and so on.  And then you pay $10 per month  for each gigabyte that you use.  And if you have a budget, so you say,  oh, I'm gonna use three gigabytes,  but then you only use two,  then they give you the money back.  They give you the 10 bucks back.  And they do it on a, you know,  if you use part of that,  they'll give you part of the money back.  So it's like, for you, Stacey,  one reason to give this to a nine-year-old  is it teaches kids the value of a dollar, essentially.  Because they can monitor their usage.  You're paying for what you get.  And then if you're disciplined  and you gravitate to Wi-Fi and change your behavior,  you get money back.  And it's a great way to see that in action,  whereas other carriers normally obfuscate  what you're paying for and so on.  So it's great from that perspective.  The other reason to use Google Fi for a nine-year-old  is because it's like,  you're like the kid who owns the pool in the summer  when it's 101 degrees in Austin,  because your daughter can walk around  and be the person who can offer a Wi-Fi hotspot  to all her friends,  or anybody else who's around or can use other devices  on that same Wi-Fi.  So it's very empowering and freeing  to be able to have a Wi-Fi hotspot anywhere you go.  Now, what's new about Google Fi and why I really love it,  and a lot of people didn't know this,  but Google Fi internationally was throttled or capped  to 256 megabits per second for the carrier.  So if you're in an area with a super fast LTE,  you were dropped down to 2G across the board,  no matter where you went internationally.  And this is one of the ways that they kept their costs  in line, and everybody kind of accepted this.  It's great to be able to go anywhere,  and for the same price and doing nothing special,  you get international coverage.  You don't have to buy a SIM card  to all the gymnastics you used to have to do.  But now all of a sudden, Google said,  you know what, we're just gonna lift the cap, no cap.  Your data is as fast as the local data will give you.  And it's like, wow, so in your areas where the carrier  that they've got a contract with has LTE speeds,  you get LTE speeds.  I mean, it's a radical jump from 2G to LTE.  It's wonderful.  And at the same $10 a gigabyte.  Yes, of course, you can burn through those gigabytes  a lot faster now, but still, it's the same price.  Same deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But my son just came back from Barcelona,  my daughter's in Mexico right now.  And the anxiety, it's hard to understate the anxiety  that you feel that you might have this $1,000 bill.  You have to really be careful, and not with Google Fi.  It's the same as in the States.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's wonderful.  And it's also an underappreciated feature  is you can go to the website or use the app,  and you can see exactly what's happening,  how much you've used, how much you've spent.  You can always just easily one tap  and see what's going on with your account.  You don't have to wait a month and a half  to get the AT&T bill and realize,  oh my gosh, I gotta take out a loan to pay this bill  because I've been abroad and I did the wrong thing.  Exactly.  I also have AT&T, it's a real problem.  Google Fi is a godsend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Basically, I just tell people turn off data roaming  because you don't know what your phone's doing  behind your back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Even if you turn off data roaming,  you can have a lot of problems.  And one of these days, I'm gonna write a column  about some of the problems.  For example, we suspended our accounts when we were abroad.  We were abroad for a couple of months  and then we went back to the US.  And we were like, okay, we're back in the US.  Turned everything back on.  And because we weren't on a WiFi,  all these apps were updating.  They had been waiting to update.  Oh yeah.  And we kept hearing all night,  during the night, not using the phone.  We heard this bleep and this was AT&T texting us saying,  you just incurred another $50.  So frustrating.  Anyway, so the other thing that's new about Google Fi  is that they made a deal with the European Carrier 3,  which is in lots of countries,  that it adds 15 countries to the total.  So now Google Fi works in 135 countries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  With full bandwidth in how many of those?  Not all of them, right?  All of them.  All of them?  All of them.  So are using it in France right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  Typically how I use it is, I use an iPhone, right?  What I do is, before we leave the WiFi connected Airbnb  that we have, I just turn on the phone,  I turn on the tethering feature,  throw it in my bag or my pocket and off we go.  And we just are connected.  We can receive and make calls.  We can get texts and emails.  We can just function.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How many gigs do you tend to go through in a month then  on Fi?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I keep it under probably 20 gigs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A lot of that depends on where you are.  If you have WiFi readily available or not.  Cause where I work and where I'm at home.  So I'm 20 bucks a month on Fi.  It's very, well more than 20 cause that's the base.  But maybe 30.  It's very affordable compared to my other phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it seems to me like you would really get a lot out of it  Leo because you buy so many phones.  Do you really need to buy another data plan  for every single phone?  Well that's the issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wish I could use, that's really okay.  So there's two negatives.  One, you can't get it outside the US.  And two, that you have to have a Nexus phone.  Either a 6, 6P or 5X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that's what I'm saying.  If you just had a Nexus phone connected to Google Fi  and then you had all your other phones connected.  Well that's exactly what I do.  That WiFi hotspot.  Yeah, so you're always connected.  That's exactly what I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  And I use Google Voice slash Fi to forward calls  to those other phones.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's exactly what I do.  And if you do, if you are gonna get an Android phone  and you do have Google Voice,  one of the options when you sign up is like,  yeah, just make that phone's phone number  my Google Voice phone number.  That's kinda cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a really good deal.  I have to say, I've been very happy  and I'm gonna be traveling in September  to 10 different countries.  And it's gonna be such a boon to me.  I was bringing a T-Mobile phone  because T-Mobile of course does that limited data stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it also has to be said  that you can just open up the app and say,  okay, suspend it.  So if you traveled one month out of the year,  you would only pay for that month that you're traveling.  Right.  That's a good idea.  Oh.  Yeah.  So you can have it just for-  For both, you can suspend the phone and data service?  You can suspend the data service, the phone.  You gotta pay for the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're gonna get the 20 bucks a month no matter what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I so wish, I so, so wish for a Fi, MiFi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When are they gonna do that?  When are they gonna open to other phones?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think carriers would be miffed at that though?  Yeah, that's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think you have to have some specialized radios  in there to do what they do.  You do, you must have to be able to switch around.  A tip for you Mike, Signal Spy,  great app that will let you know what carrier you're on  at any given time.  I'm on it.  Including Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Have you had the problem yet Mike  where it tries to connect to one carrier and can't  and then doesn't connect to you at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, I had that problem at first in Mexico  and I was going back and forth between  you pick the carrier and also I'd go back and,  okay, I'm gonna try each one serially.  And I struggled for a while,  but eventually it just worked for some reason.  And I don't know why, but so my son is texting me now.  He's also a Google Fi user and he says you can suspend  both the phone and the-  It's the whole account.  The whole account.  Oh wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that would be really useful.  So that makes-  It's been using it longer than I have.  For Jeff, somebody travels all the time.  That would be such a useful thing  because you could have your travel phone.  Not as much as Mike.  Your travel phone.  Yeah, not a-  No, it's worse though for you  because at least Mike settles.  Yes.  He says for one day there, one day here, one day there.  Yeah.  But I've been paying $100 a month for AT&T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, like me too.  And it's like, I don't even use it,  but I'm grandfathered in so they got me by the,  you know what?  And so I can't leave AT&T,  not with the unlimited grandfathered account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but I also pay for like $100 a month  just for the foreign stuff.  And I wanted to use Fi for a while to make sure I'm secure  and then I can pull my international AT&T.  Not to zero because I still use that phone now and again,  but way down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  But this new lifting of the data speed cap  is gonna be huge for you I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think Stacey was asking a different question,  I would guess.  Should a nine-year-old have a smartphone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's actually, I don't want it to be,  we don't have a landline in our house.  So she has to have a phone.  But she has to have a phone.  So I'm looking for a cheap phone.  I mean, she has my old Galaxy 3, 4,  I don't know which one it is.  Oh, so she does have a smartphone.  It's connected to Wi-Fi,  but like making phone calls on that phone is-  Get her a 6P or a 5X.  Yeah, so that's, she uses the phone less for internet.  She has got a computer with internet access.  It's the cheapest- But she uses it  to record video and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the cheapest phone I've ever had.  The other one that's actually,  maybe a little cheaper if you never leave the country  is Ting was a sponsor for a long time.  And Ting is- I know Elliot.  Yeah, yeah, there you go.  From Tukhouse.  Yeah, he's great.  And so the thing about Ting is you just pay as you go.  And it really, you know,  we gave our father-in-law a lease his old iPhone on Ting  and I pay it.  It's like nine bucks a month.  It's nothing.  Because, you know, if you don't use a lot,  you just pay for what you use.  But I think Fi is,  Fi, Google has really reinvented smartphones.  And presumably the new Nexus is,  somebody told me it's not Nexai, it's Nexus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know, jeez, it's a joke, people.  Nexuses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sonoses are Sonoses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it has to do with the noun, the Latin noun,  if it's a, I can't remember the-  Oh, I don't remember.  So the CEO of Sonos, is it John McFarland?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He says it's Sonai.  No, he says it's Sonoses.  And I was like, how did you get to that?  He's like, we just asked everybody.  That was the consensus.  I was like-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The joke is, but Nexus is an actual Latin word.  And it's, what is it, Karsten?  There's some term for it, it's not intransitive,  but it's a-  Karsten, you went to Harvard?  You old guy asked Harvard guy.  You went to Harvard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You went to Harvard, tell us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I went to a somewhat less good school, so I don't know.  Yale, man.  But in any event, somebody sent me an email saying,  well, as a matter of fact, Nexus is a-  I got the same one.  Gerundative or whatever, and the plural is Nexus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, like data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, like, no, datum data.  Well, that's normal.  That's a masculine noun, datum data.  But there's data, anyway, nevermind.  Who says the internet is stupid?  Well, who says Nexus is a Latin word is the other question.  Of course, if we're saying Nexai,  we're saying it's a Latin noun that is plural Nexai,  but that's not correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're telling a joke.  What's next?  We can't say Winkle-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What else do we have?  Do we got numbers?  Is something else happening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Number, no, let's do Stacy, and then we'll do the number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, mine's really short.  Good.  Because I was in need-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you for moving us along, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm getting hungry.  She's getting hangry.  This is not a new book, but if you haven't read it,  you can pick it up while you're traveling.  It's called The Cartel, and it is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I saw the Netflix movie of the-  Is it the same thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know, was Narcos made?  Or are you talking about Narcos?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, there's one also called,  there's a movie called The Cartel, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, my God, it might become a movie soon, you guys.  You should read it before that.  It's-  It's about drug cartels, right?  It's drug cartels in Mexico.  It's well-written, it's great.  We actually read a lot about actual drug cartels,  and this hews very closely to how they work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You live there.  There's probably a tunnel under your house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is, don't tell anyone.  Crap, now we've got to move, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can build a wall, but there's always a tunnel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So anyway, it's a really good read if you're into that,  and my Kindle ran out of batteries,  and I had to buy a book,  and that was the book I bought, and it's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there isn't a movie yet, so you're right.  A literary tip, I like that.  Yeah, you know what?  Stacey, you want to recommend a book every week?  I will always recommend books, but-  I love that, I would love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff, your number.  So I love this.  The Wall Street Journal went and looked at,  and they got evidently help from Facebook on this,  getting data for correlations.  Google usually likes to do this, but now Facebook is.  Those who like Clinton or Trump,  what they like in various categories of culture.  So Clinton likers, and by state,  but Clinton likers on music and bands primarily love Adele.  Trump likers primarily like Ted Nugent and George Strait.  Actors and directors, Clinton likers, George Takei,  and Jada Pinkett Smith.  Trump likers, Adam Sandler and John Wayne.  Oh Lord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Kurt Cameron.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Scott Bio.  Scott Bio now.  Chachi, we love Chachi.  This is a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I love Chachi.  I love him from Potsy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Most of the country by far.  Who's Potsy voting for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Clinton lovers love Harry Potter.  Trump lovers like God's Not Dead.  I don't even know that book.  Oh, that's a movie in which a student who,  what is the plot?  The student says, is a Christian defending his beliefs?  Oh, you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I was thinking God is dead,  the Christopheran.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, not, absolutely not.  You know what, guess what?  My in-laws gave me the video of that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, no doubt.  Television shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're Trump voters.  Clinton likers like the Rachel Maddow show, of course.  Trump likers, Duck Dynasty, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who spoke at the convention.  The chairman of the Duck Dynasty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Clinton likers books.  Here you go, Stacey.  Books.  Clinton likers like The Great Gatsby.  Trump likers, honest to God, like The Old Farmer's Almanac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh wait, wait.  I like The Old Farmer's Almanac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a great book.  I appreciate that that was all of Texas right there.  And a lot of Texas got it right.  Oh, but you know what?  The Clinton likers are terrible  because they like The Giving Tree,  which is the worst book ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, the Shel Silverstein book?  God, I hate that book.  That is really creepy,  because the thing, oh, that's horrible.  Yeah.  It is, anyway.  It's like Joel Osteen.  This is the most reductivist thing I've ever seen  in my life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then of course it is.  And then athletes.  Let's see.  Clinton likers, a lot of Serena Williams in the East,  Cristiano Ronaldo in the West.  And then for the Trump likers,  I don't even know who is Rhonda Rousey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, she's the UFC fighter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, she's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She got beat the other day, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tim Tebow, Dale Earnhardt Jr.  This is dumb.  A little bit of Tom Brady.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got something better.  I got something better.  I got something better.  Thanks to Nigel Town in our chat room.  The Stacey Higginbotham ringtone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, he'll be like, Stacey's eating something again.  She must be hot.  Oh, oh, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is so endearing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  That is endearing is a good word for it.  I only have a minute or two.  It should be the show title too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, oh, oh.

Transcript:  It is the show title.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, Lord.  So.  So.  The minute we finished the show last week,  Google pushed out the Play Store for the Chromebook Pixel.  You have to put, so now it's two different Chromebooks,  or three.  The first three that they mentioned,  you have to put it in developer mode.  So, no, not developer mode.  You have to be on the developer track.  It's different from the developer mode.  But it's a setting in your settings.  And then you will be offered the, here it is.  This is the Android Store, right there, front and center.  And at this point, they're not restricting it.  So you can download incompatible apps  to your little heart's content.  So most of the apps, obviously, are not optimized.  But Google makes Snapseed, it is optimized,  for the Chromebook.  Finally, a powerful.  Wow.  Oh, unfortunately Snapseed has stopped.  Now, it is a little buggy.  And in fact, what I found was that it's possible  to put on here apps that slow your Pixel down to a crawl.  So it's early beta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I have.  I remember Leo, it wouldn't work with my apps account.  Well, that might be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you see, I have, this is Telegram Messenger.  And it is, it's written in such a way that it scales.  I also have Facebook Messenger.  I have HipChat on here, because we use that all the time.  So these are Android apps that are running on Chrome OS,  natively.  And it works, for the most part, pretty well.  Notice, one of the changes, down here in the toolbar,  when whatever's down here is a Chrome extension,  it has a little Chrome icon on it.  So you can kind of tell which is an app.  Like, here's the Chrome Store.  That's an app.  It's going to launch Chrome.  And this is not.  And so in fact, in some ways, the Chrome extensions  are second class citizens on the new.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Isn't that weird that the Chrome apps are  the ones that have to be identified as being different?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So you see, they're the ones with the little lower icons  here.  But I've tried a number of them.  This is really exciting.  It's an interesting thing.  I don't know exactly.  By the way, Pokemon Go, because there's no GPS,  doesn't run, alas, on the Chromebook Pixel.  Although, if you had LTE, it would.  So maybe you just need LTE.  Anyway, this is exciting.  We're getting close.  Google says it will be on almost all new Chromebooks  and many older Chromebooks sometime  in the next couple of months.  Android for Chrome OS is now out for the Pixel as well.  Wow.  Mike Elgin is an ex en Provence in France.  He is a digital nomad.  And you can find out more, becomingnomad.com.  That's his blog.
