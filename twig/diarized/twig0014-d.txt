As a matter of fact, joining us on this Halloween episode,  appropriately attired, Gina Trapani in lab coat, protective eyewear,  and she's even got a wave pocket protector.  Look at that.  That's very geeky.  Now Gina, this is for the show.  You're not going to go out trick or treating in this.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  No, I'm probably going to stay home and tail my server logs.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'll be honest.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, let me ask you, do you like tail 100 or do you go for a little bit more?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I do a tail that dash F and watch it go.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Do the whole thing.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  Just, you know, and then kind of watch it, you know, fly by.  It makes me feel happy.  That's my treat for Halloween.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Jeff is completely underwhelmed by this conversation.  Jeff Jarvis is also here from BuzzMachine.com, our resident journalist and expert on the new media.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And of course, my Halloween costume playing that I like an expert.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And also the author of What Would Google Do?  Which is in its 1073rd printing right now.  We wish.  Lost track.  Did you guys see the, I just thought this was wonderful.  The Google story video that was on YouTube.  Yeah.  Wasn't that nicely done?  What's the story?  Is that an ad?  What are they doing there?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, I think it was some agency that did it.  I don't know who did it, but it started spreading around.  It's pretty good.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I didn't see it.  What is it?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's, I guess they, it looks like it's 3D graphics, you know, character graphics of the history of Google.  So it starts with a book and you turn the pages and it's just, it's literally,  there's nothing that you don't already know.  It's just the history of Google.  But it's so beautifully done.  I thought, well, why would somebody put so much effort into this unless,  I don't know, it's an ad or something.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, that looks really nice actually.  So, you know, they've been doing, they've been doing a little more,  like they did their first TV commercial, right?  Didn't Jeff, didn't you mention this last week?  They really don't, they haven't done commercials.  Right, exactly.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  For enterprise.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, right.  For going Google, the going Google campaign that went to TV.  There have been billboards.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I saw billboards in the Silicon Valley a few months ago.  So, but yeah, their first TV ads, they bought some time on one of our podcasts for,  and I thought this was the first time I'd ever heard an ad from Google.  And that was for the Google Summer of Code last summer.  Really?  Yeah.  So, they're getting a little, you know, you wouldn't think Google would need to advertise.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, that's always been their thing, right?  That they don't really need to advertise.  And so, you don't see, you know, you wouldn't see commercials for them  or you wouldn't see the kind of big, you know, like Yahoo has those big huge billboards all  through New York.  And, but, you know, but yeah, this is interesting.  This definitely looks like something you'd see on TV, although it's kind of long.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's long.  It's too long for a regular TV ad, but it's just really slickly done.  I don't know, it might just, you know, it could easily be just a spec ad.  Somebody just did.  Well, we'll just show how good we are.  Now, as long as you're on the internet, kids, go to Google.  If you're listening to this show on Halloween, anyway, go to Google.com.  And you'll notice something a little special.  The E in the Google has a nice little piece of candy.  Oh, but wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, there's more.  Click it.  And the candy multiplies.  But wait, there's more.  Click it again.  It's a surfeit of candy, more candy than you could possibly eat.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But it's all wrappers.  Isn't that cute?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  And then you click it again and it's all gone.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And then you make an appointment with your dentist.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, they should have.  What are the search results?  Maybe they are.  That would be funny if it were dentist.  No, it's Halloween.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It would be funny if it was dentist listings.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You might want to check in with your dentist.  They have a great sense of humor, I have to say.  Now, is Marissa Meyer in charge of these little...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Isn't she in charge of everything?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so.  She's in charge of the user interface of the page.  So I'd imagine that this is under her jurisdiction.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You said I'm in New York.  It then goes to Halloween 2009 search and my only ad is from an Afghan restaurant that has  free pumpkin turnovers.  With your order of two main entrees.  It doesn't always work.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm being told in our chat room that in Hulu there's ads for Google Chrome.  I think that is another thing that Google's been advertising is Chrome, switch to Chrome.  I bet you they see those though more as public good ads as opposed to commercials  because I think that they're really trying to foster a move towards HTML5 and Chrome is just  their...  What do they call this?  Progen horse.  Yeah, stalking.  What do they call it?  Stalking dog, stalking pony.  Stalking what?  Horse.  Horse.  Stalking horse.  Sorry, I'm not really good on my metaphors from the steps.  Google Voice is offering invites now.  I got a three on my Google Voice account.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And you can use Google Voice with your regular phone number now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You mean like number portability?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And some of the features.  I just saw it.  I saw it moments before Showtime.  It's on the on the friend feed, but if you give up a few bits of functionality,  but you can use Google Voice mail and such with your regular mobile number.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, you don't get the full features of a regular Google Voice account,  but you basically give it your phone number and then what it does is you program your phone,  your cell phone to forward calls, incoming calls to Google Voice mail.  So it's basically Google Voice mail.  It's not quite a full Google Voice account.  And so what you get is you get Google Voice mail,  which means that the voice mail gets stored in Google Voice.  They transcribe it.  They can email it to you or SMS it to you, which is really handy.  And I'm actually really excited.  I set up my cell phone to do it.  Your cell phone has to support or your service has to support forwarding.  You have to be able to forward calls that you're, you know,  so it basically takes the voicemail away from your carrier entirely and forwards it to Google.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I have an iPhone, so of course I don't want to do that because the visual voicemail on the  iPhone is so good.  But if you have a Google phone, that might be something you'd want.  Does the G1 treat Google Voice differently than other phones?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, I have the Google Voice app installed, the official app installed on Android.  So when I get voicemail or SMS messages, I get notifications on the phone  just like I would anything else.  And I can preview.  I can see, you know, it's just like visual voicemail.  I can see who sent it as well.  I can get the transcript just by browsing my list of voicemail and SMS all in one interface.  So not only do I see who called and have to tap it to listen to the voicemail,  I can glance at a preview of the transcript, which is, for me, is awesome because I hate  listening to voicemail.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  No, I like the transcripts, although it's actually you may like it for this reason.  It's kind of a puzzle to figure out what they're actually saying.  It is.  It is.  Only about one word in three is actually correct.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's like when your Armenian cousin stays and takes messages for you.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But it's fun.  Maybe I bet you, Gina, because you're kind of like me, I bet you like solving puzzles.  I actually enjoy the challenge of what the hell is this supposed to be?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  You know, in the Google Voice app, when you play the message back,  it shows you the transcript and highlights the words as the person speaks.  You can actually see, like you can watch it to see how good their transcription is,  which I enjoy because it's just kind of fun to see like, oh, they thought that word was that word.  You know, it's kind of like karaoke or something.  Yeah.  The lyrics, the bottom of the screen.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's a feature.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  How good is the Google Voice transcription?  Not very.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right.  It's not.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But, you know, fun to play along.  And it usually is enough for you to get the gist.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It is.  You get the gist, for sure.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  On the iPhone, does it do this on the Android?  On the iPhone, it highlights the number, so at least you can call that number back.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, you can easily return a call.  Makes it very easy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Just press the button and it returns it.  So there are finally some new Android phones out,  and there's some real excitement around the first from Verizon, the Droid,  which is the Motorola Shoals.  Did you get a look at it at all, Gina?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I didn't get a chance to look at it.  I read lots of the reviews and I've been holed up this week,  finishing off a project, so I didn't get a chance to get out there.  Have you?  Did you get your hands on one?  You were going to get one right away.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I was going to get one right away, and I know some reviewers got one,  but I'm not on that magic list.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  O'Malek was not impressed.  Really?  What did he say?  He said, if you're waiting for the iPhone killer, this isn't it.  I had this vision that actually there's a whole bunch of people out there  who are waiting for the Messiah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, it's kind of like that.  Or Godot, one of the others.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  When I tweeted that from O'M, a few people said,  the iPhone killer will come from Apple.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  O'M made a good point.  Does it have to be this kind of binary thing where it's either  the iPhone or the iPhone killer?  I mean, is in there room for something else?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You're stuck with the phone for two years.  Yeah, that's the problem.  You want to buy the best there is.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's a good point.  That is a good point.  And in fact, that's part of the reason why I haven't run out to the store.  Me too.  I have to finish out my contract.  If I walk into the store, I'm going to sign up for another freaking contract.  I'm going to have two wireless bills and I use my Google voice number anyways.  It's going to you know, it's just like, I don't want to attempt myself.  And I try to go with the late early adopter crowd.  Like I never try.  I never want to be like the canary in the coal mine.  I always like to wait for like, you know, version kind of two.  So I feel like I want like version two droid.  So I don't know if that's going to be hopefully it's going to be spring of next year.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Judy, would you pay the non subsidized rate for it to get a droid?  If you could get it without contract.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So what is it?  It's six hundred dollars.  Boy.  Yeah, it's a lot.  I mean, you know, I paid for my G1, you know, the full well, I got a little bit of discount.  I worked a little bit of a deal with a friend, but I paid a lot more than the subsidized price  because I wanted to switch over.  But now I probably wouldn't do that again because the G1 sucks.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Of course, it would only work on Verizon anyway.  It's not GSM.  So, right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.  Well, that's another problem.  It's not a world phone, is it?  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah.  And like I'm, you know, I'm going to London in a couple of weeks and that would be a problem.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's an HTC handset that'll be out soon to the heiress, which is another  Android phone from Verizon that HTC typically makes kind of multi band phone.  So maybe it will work.  That's the problem with Verizon in general.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's a confusing array of phones now.  I think last week TechCrunch had the had the post with all the phones in it and it's quite  a shopping spree.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's interesting how long it's taken the phone industry to respond to the iPhone.  It took them a couple of years.  The first few attempts like the Sprint Instinct and the Blackberry Storm were such flops.  I mean, they just, they looked like an iPhone.  That was the only thing they had going for them.  And I think that it's probably going to be an Android phone.  Although I ordered, I did order a Nokia N900, which is not running.  Yeah, I saw you say that.  Yeah.  Why?  It looks, it's a very powerful piece of hardware.  It's really a tablet PC with phone capability.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's a big little sucker.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's not as big as it looks.  It's thicker because it has a slide out keyboard.  That's one of the things about the Droid that's kind of interesting.  It's not much thicker than an iPhone, but it has a slide out keyboard.  So it's a very thin phone.  This 900 is thicker, but it's running Mimo, which is Nokia's version of Linux,  just as Android is Google's version of Linux.  It does support all Linux applications, you know, with some modifications.  I presume it's kind of like Android in that respect.  It has touch, has a lot of nice features.  And I bought it because of, as I mentioned last week,  this new T-Mobile, you know, all you can eat plan that doesn't require a contract.  I like that idea.  So you're paying an unsubsidized price.  You're paying 600 bucks for the N900, but you don't have to commit to it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, that's nice.  So when you say it runs Linux apps, what do you mean?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm told it runs Linux apps pretty much unmodified.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, huh.  Is it locked to T-Mobile?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's completely unlocked.  It's completely unlocked.  It's not from T-Mobile.  I just bought an unlocked US version that runs well on the T-Mobile network.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's right, because nobody sells those Nokia phones here.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  T-Mobile might.  I mean, it's really, it looks like it was designed for T-Mobile.  It's on the 1700 megahertz frequency, which is T-Mobile's 3G network.  So it's almost like it was meant for T-Mobile.  Nokia's smart that way.  I don't know.  I think it's, I, this is going to be my dark horse.  And with another horse analogy, Leo, Leo's ladies and gentlemen.  This is going to be my dark horse candidate as opposed to the droid.  That's why I wanted Gina to play droid.  So I didn't have to.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I, I, I'm definitely, I'm going to, I'm going to check it out.  All right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We'll, we'll, we'll, we'll do a head to head.  We will.  We will.  Now, one thing that is important for any of these phones to succeed is some sort of application store.  What's the Eclair Android app store to look like?  Is it improved?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, I haven't, I haven't checked out.  I haven't, I'm not running Eclair right now, which is Android 2.0.  And I, I'm not sure that the, at the app store that the market is, I'm not sure exactly what  the improvements are to the app, to the, to the Android market.  I mean, listen, that the big problem with the Android market is that they're just, you know,  there just isn't the, the selection of apps and high quality apps that there is in the app store.  Right.  So hopefully if the droid gets more popular, you know, the more popular platform,  more people can develop for it.  So that's really what's, you know, what's, what's important.  The market is still, I have a little trouble with it.  I wish that it notified me of updates on my phone a little better, but it has improved since  just in, in donut.  So hopefully in Eclair we'll see, see even more updates, but more, really what we need is more  applications.  That's what's going to make the market better.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's right.  Cupcake.  So they're asking in the chat room, did, is Gina and customers, did you just forget to  change before she came?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The glasses are just freaking me out.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is how Gina dresses.  Yeah, sure.  She wears protective eyewear and lab coats as she hangs around the house.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Perhaps I should take off the protective.  No, I like them.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let, let, let Jeff be freaked out.  It's okay.  It's okay.  He can handle it.  So the reason I ask about a store is because we got news this week that there's going to  be a Google wave app store.  Yeah.  That's an interesting, very interesting idea.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Very interesting.  Yes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So what's the point there?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, Google saying that they, you know, they, they want developers to develop for wave and  they want to set up some sort of revenue sharing.  Developers have been asking about it ever since wave launched.  Yeah. I mean, I think the app store just, you know, the I, the iTunes app store just  created all these opportunities for developers to make money for, you know, small, you know,  small amounts of money for each app sale and, and, and they want the same thing from Google.  And so, so this is, this is going to be great.  I mean, it's going to be a big incentive for Google, for developers to develop for wave.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And so it is a way to make money for developers.  It's not merely a way to find plugins.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It is a way to make money.  Lars said that there will be, there are going to, they are looking into doing revenue sharing,  figuring out a system for revenue sharing.  So yes, you, you should be able to purchase apps from, you know, from the purchase extensions.  I'm not sure.  So wave extensions are gadgets and bots.  So it's going to be, we're going to have to figure out how that, you know, it all works.  It might be a while out, but yes, you are going to be able to buy wave extensions as well as just  find them.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think that's pretty important for the ecosystem.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I do too, for sure.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm trying to figure out how that works.  So who would be the most likely to buy them?  If you're running a wave server and you're running services, enterprise or whatever,  that's where you're going to buy them?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, it's a really good question.  It's like, is it the server administrator who wants to be able to install them for  all of the server's users, or is it going to be the end user who says, I want to use,  you know, the Ribbit gadget.  So I'm going to spend two bucks and then I'm going to be able to use it with my,  with the people who I wave with.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, but then do your, do the other people you wave with have to buy the same thing?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I mean, that's the, that's the issue.  It's got to be on both ends.  Or not.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, well, that's the way, the way gadgets work is when you add a gadget to a wave,  the people, everybody who's on the wave can see that gadget.  Bots are another kind of extension that you, you can, you have access to and you can add  to the wave.  So, I mean, they could restrict bots to just, you know, use by the people who paid.  I don't know how they would do that with gadgets.  It seems like they should be able to do some sort of server administrator can buy a license  for so many users for a certain extension, but the servers are federated, so people are  going to have access to them.  So it'd be really interesting to see like how this is going to play out.  It becomes interesting too.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  If somebody can kind of generously buy a, you know, I, I, I create the, the better wave  for my group for some reason, and I become more popular because I did that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Interesting.  Cause if it's a map, if it's a map gadget, then everybody can see it.  Right.  Right.  So you would only, you could make a beautiful wave that you created by using gadgets that  you purchased that not everybody has to own.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I see.  Yeah, I see.  But everyone who participates on the wave in theory should be able to use that gadget,  but you give them access, you know?  So if I create a wave with my gadget and I add you to it, you can, you can look at and  use and manipulate the gadget in whatever way.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, so that makes sense then.  If it's not a double-ended thing, then it makes a lot of sense.  Yeah.  Right.  You're right, Jeff.  You hit the nail on the head.  There's this, this, this kind of competition to make the best.  I've got the cool wave.  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, I've got the cool wave with a really cool gadget.  Yeah.  I see.  I see what you mean.  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right.  And so, so it becomes interesting then to see that if wave does become a media thing,  as I keep predicting to no end.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I keep waiting for.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Then the cool publisher is going to want to have the coolest wave.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, I kind of think about wave extensions like WordPress plugins, you know, that, you know,  you can add the add to your installation and make them do stuff on your site.  So, so, so yeah, it could work that way.  Although this is totally all speculation, like the word that there would be  an app store for, for wave came through kind of secondhand through like a Google developers  meetup in London this week.  But there was definitely a quote from a large response and saying that they're,  that they're looking into revenue sharing.  And that's something definitely on there on the radar.  So it's not, so I think that there will be money.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And I also saw, I'll rewrite that the federation plans are about out.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Ah, are they?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  Read, write, test.  Darn.  I didn't put it on the, because I was one of those things where I figured  I could ask you what the hell it meant.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't know if I'm on a bookmark this.  You got to tell me what it means first.  Yeah, I had no idea.  Well, that's a big, that's a big deal because it means that people who run other people  who are running wave servers besides Google can federate their content with other servers.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right.  Because right now the only Google wave server is wave.google.com.  Right.  And actually there's another one, the developer sandbox is, is wave.google.com slash a  slash wave sandbox.com.  So there are two, there are two wave servers in existence right now.  They cannot talk to one another because federation is not ready yet.  Here it is.  And so federation being ready is a huge thing.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They're getting ready to open up this.  This is on Rewrite Web according to Next Web.  Don't you love links?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You never know who really originated this story.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The announcement may come as early as today and that was on the 30th.  So never mind that.  An open protocol update.  A Google spokesman just told us the company will have more news about the launch of the  wave federation program early next week.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Ah, yeah.  That's it.  I mean, that's, that's really exciting.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'll bookmark this right now.  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Because, you know, what that means is that everyone doesn't have to be on the central  wave.google.com server that you could get onto other wave servers and use wave and communicate  with people on other servers without being on Google server and without having to wait  for invites from them.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is moving so fast and yet nobody really understands what wave is or how to use it.  If somebody would just write a book that would explain Google wave.  So I would buy it in a flash.  And if that book were online, I would just, I would buy it in faster than a flash.  I would just like go to the website, but we'll find out more about that in just a moment.  I'm so bad.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  If you go to the bookmarks, you'll see a nice little, one of those great little  diagrams that I never understand with boxes.  What's that about the federation?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Federation boxes.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I expect the stars fleet to be coming in any moment.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Okay.  So, but that is important.  That's an important next step.  And what does seem to be true is that everybody now who wanted to be on wave has, I mean,  the buzz, I need a wave invite has kind of calmed down, right?  Maybe because people say, oh, I see what it is.  I don't want it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I think, I think people are in different stages.  Like, you know, when, when the different stages of  denial, when someone dies, I think that some people, people are just like, I know,  I think people now who always wanted an invite and put their name in for an invite and haven't  gotten it yet are like at this point of bitterness, like, like I give up you dummies.  I'm just not cool enough, whatever.  And I think the people who had did have gotten invites or got invites a couple of weeks ago  have gotten past the shiny phase and maybe aren't logging on to wave as much because  their friends aren't honored because it didn't capture them.  So I think, I think it's an interesting time right now.  And I think that what Google needs to do with the way folks need to do or keep rolling out  interesting things like this Federation thing, although the Federation thing is more of a  developer thing, but they got to keep, keep, keep themselves in the, in the news, in the news cycle.  I mean, invites have been going out at a pretty steady, steady pace.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's a developer thing, but it's also the kind of thing that is going to make it more attractive  to end users.  So you've got to give it to the developers so they can implement it.  And then, you know, I would, I think having a custom wave server of your own that federates  with other servers is important.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Definitely.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's what's going to make the architecture work here.  We'll figure that out how it works together.  I also put up on the, on the friend feed that there are two Google wave apps  awaiting approval in the iPhone store.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  Wow.  Jeff has done awesome wave coverage this week.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The race is on for the first Google.  A higher up, Jada.  Yeah, really.  The Google wave iPhone app, waveboard is one.  There's also an Adobe air application called waver.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Is a waveboard is a, is a Mac app.  It's not an iPhone app.  Okay.  Although maybe there's, is there an iPhone version and maybe there may be an iPhone version.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There is a, apparently it's waiting approval in the iPhone app store.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, what's interesting about Google wave on the iPhone is if you just visit it  in mobile Safari and you, and you open it, it uses the special peta tag.  It does a good job and it uses these meta tags that actually hide the Safari Chrome.  So the, so the app, the web app goes full screen and feels very much like a native app.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I don't, you know, the thing that people don't know or aren't really remembering is that  the UI for wave is completely fungible.  And in fact, Lars showed, you know, a variety of UIs, including one that was like,  looked like a green screen on a command line.  Um, so there's no reason it has to look like it looks.  And I think it might be not the ideal UI to begin with anyway.  So maybe they, maybe they can get there.  There's a video at get waveboard.com on, of, of the iPhone app and its basic functionality.  It looks a lot like wave to be honest.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It basically has no UI.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  We're just seeing an instance of it.  It's pre UI.  It's right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's, it's pre UI.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  This UI is just like, let us show you everything we can do.  And now it's up to some clever developers and UI people to, you know,  get down to the really useful stuff and simplify it and make it,  you know, apply it to different use cases.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think we're going to take a break.  Come back.  We will talk about a book that will help you understand Google wave in just a little bit.  Also the mystery town of Argo and why you should care or not as the case may be.  And Eric Schmidt talks about what the way web will look like in five years.  But I want to tell you about go to meeting right now.  This is, Hey, when wave, maybe someday wave will be as useful as go to meeting for your  online meetings.  But until that day comes, I want you to try go to meeting.  In fact, you can try it free by going to go to meeting.com slash twig.  It's very easy to understand.  You install the software.  You don't even, you just can, you know, you don't have to pay for it right now.  You just try it.  So go there and install it, take a couple of minutes.  And now the next time you have a conference call scheduled,  you send them a meeting invite.  You say during the conference call, I'd like to show you the keynote or the PowerPoint  or I'd like to show you the website.  I'd like to work together with you.  And it's so incredible.  I mean, now it's not real time collaboration like wave.  It's more like you're there in person with them, giving them a demo,  but you can work together on a single document wave like you can,  you can work, you can train so you can say, I have the doc, the program.  I'm going to use it now.  Here's how you use it.  Now you try it.  I'm going to do this with my sister.  We're training her on how to do the feeds.  And this is exactly what this is meant for.  Just about any kind of conference call.  This is a lifesaver and you could try it free for 30 days from the  friend for the great people at Citrix who know this stuff.  I bet you, I bet you they have something up their sleeve with regard to wave.  I would be, that'd be my guess.  Get your go to meeting account right now, go to meeting.com slash twig T W I G for this week in Google.  $49 a month for as many meetings as you want, as long as you want.  Includes voiceover IP and free teleconferencing.  Go to meeting.com slash twig.  We thank them for their support of this week in Google.  Do you want to make your announcement now, Gina?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Let's do it.  Let's do it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What's the deal?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So the reason why Jeff is schooling me on current wave news is because I've been,  I've been heads down writing my new book, which is called the complete guide to Google wave.  Yay.  And I'm really excited to tell you that it is mostly written or eight chapters of it is are written  and it's free to read online right now.  I literally took the password off of this site an hour ago.  If you go to complete wave guide.com complete wave guide.com you can read.  It's about 90 pages printed.  I've been working on this thing nonstop along with Adam Pash from life hacker.  So, you know, this is top drawer stuff for about a month now.  And the whole book is going to be free to read online continuously indefinitely.  And I'm also going to make a PDF available for purchase and a soft cover print version available  available for purchase going forward.  I'm going to have the preview edition later on this month.  And then all through 2010, I'm going to issue kind of a new edition every few months as wave  changes and grows, which it definitely will.  The current content that's up right now is just a start.  I mean, I think wave is such a sort of complex and deep rich product that it could probably  have many books written on it.  But this is my first try at it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Or or Gina.  It's more like the forever book.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It is the forever book.  It is.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It keeps on developing.  It's a living beast.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Exactly.  Exactly.  You know, I kind of took some inspiration from wave.  I mean, what I really like about wave is that each conversation is kind of this living  document that changes, right?  Unlike email that when you send an email, it's just kind of dead and it gets filed away  and it never ever changes.  And that's kind of how I feel that tech book publishing works.  You know, I've written two technology books and Adam has written a book as well.  And, you know, you write a book and the book gets published and then and then the book  is just dead.  It's out on shelves.  It's done.  And then things change.  And as an author, you feel horrible because things change.  You know, when people tell me they bought my book these days, like I cringe, you know,  and I feel terrible because I feel like there are things in it, you know, that just don't  apply anymore because it was published last last March in 2008.  So my goal with this book is to is to constantly update it, iterate it real time, live on the  web at complete complete wave guide dot com.  So anybody can get the most recent information about wave in one place, kind of organized  in a book in a book structure at any time.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think that's great.  Now, this is a brand new model for you.  Yeah.  As you said, you have two traditionally published books.  It's a little nerve wracking or is this just I mean, I think it's pretty obvious  the future of publishing, right?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's it's it's really scary.  And it's really it's really exciting.  I'm working with a small company here in San Diego to lay out the PDF and to offer it for  sale and to also to print the softcover book.  I do think that this is the future of publishing.  And, you know, I come from the web.  I wrote for I wrote for the web for years before I ever wrote for magazines or my print  book.  And it just it just seemed like I mean, this idea of locking down text, especially when  you're writing about technology, which changes so much.  I mean, I just it just doesn't feel natural to me.  And I'm a big believer.  And we've talked about this before about just giving stuff away for free.  You know, karma karma is a boomerang.  And my my my my goal is to be the kind of authoritative resource on wave.  And I think you've done that by the way.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, you're there.  It's too late.  For better or worse, you are now the wave woman.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, now that I'm wearing this dumb lab coat and these lab gloves, these goggles.  You're definitely there.  Yeah, there's your author photo.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The woman from wave.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, you know, I've fought with books like this that in a sense, you want to subscribe  to the future.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You want you want to get a guarantee of Gina helps me out for a long time.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You do not want to buy a static book for something like this.  That would be nuts.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, because things are going to change.  I mean, wave is going to change a lot.  We're going to look a lot different this time next year than it does now.  And I want people who get the book, read the book to to get the latest latest and greatest.  I mean, I would really love if people bought it, too.  That would help just support the people and the time I put in behind it.  They will.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I really have confidence that people will do that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I mean, everybody was probably shouldn't tell you this, Gina, but I think you've gotten  hammered.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, the server is down.  Is it?  Oh, yeah.  It was down the minute the last word.com left your lips out of memory.  Allocating.  I tried to.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, man.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, it shouldn't be embarrassing.  It happens to every single site that gets mentioned on.  It's what live does.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes.  And my server logs are going crazy.  Well, thank you, everyone.  And I'm really sorry.  I'm going to be a long, long tail session tonight.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let me tell you, I wouldn't do tail dash.  If I think you're really going to have to do that, I'm sorry.  But it's just going to be long, long, long.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, well, I suppose this is a good problem to have.  This is how I'm going to look at it.  No, the good news is that the book will always be there.  It's not going anywhere.  So once I get the server back up.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think this is a fantastic idea.  And it's the only way you could do a book about WAVE.  And I'm sure there will be people who will try to do  dead tree editions of books about WAVE.  But I just don't see how that can work.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  There definitely will be.  And surely they will be from my publisher, who I love.  I would just like to say that I love my publisher.  And I also love my literary agent.  And I'm sorry.  And all respect to all the Google WAVE books that are going to come out,  especially the O'Reilly books.  And I would like to thank O'Reilly for everything that they've ever done.  And this isn't anything personal.  I wanted to self-publish a book for years.  And WAVE just seemed like the perfect opportunity to do it.  So I seized the opportunity and did it.  And I want to thank Adam for doing it along with me.  And we've just been typing furiously and frantically for weeks now.  So I'm so happy to have this out there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It would be a good idea.  People are suggesting to do an EPUB version, if you could.  I'm sure you will think about that.  You've got a PDF now, so anybody could mail that PDF to their Kindle.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  We're definitely going to do a PDF.  PDF isn't quite available yet.  I want to have the site out there.  I wanted to make the book really a collaborative thing.  So I wanted to put out Adam and Zamy first draft.  And then I wanted people to give us feedback.  And Adam and I are going to refine it and add people's contributions.  And then we're going to issue the PDF later on this month.  So for now, it's website only.  But PDF later this month and then softcover book early next year.  And we'll definitely look into other formats.  I thought the PDF would be the most portable.  And I really wanted to do something that was non-proprietary and portable.  But whatever people want, we'll do what we can.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm thinking about John O'Bacon who did his art of community very much this way.  And then published it with O'Reilly.  So they had a community website where people...  It was a wiki where people were adding stuff.  Yokai, Benckler's, The Wealth of Networks, which is a brilliant book.  Same kind of model.  I think this is really the way...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Gina, I wonder, when we talked last week about Kickstarter.  Yes.  I would think that this is a perfect project for Kickstarter,  where people who contributed to it financially get some privilege,  get some access, get something else.  Get the print copy for one thing.  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  In fact, I wish that I had actually used Kickstarter in retrospect.  And there's a page on the site when the server comes back up on how to contribute.  And the site is a wiki.  It's running MediaWiki, which is the same software that runs Wikipedia.  So all the pages are editable.  I've protected some of them just for the launch.  But contributors will be able to edit the pages directly.  And the standout contributors, we're definitely going to add to the credits.  And the whole thing is licensed.  Those are Creative Commons, share-alike, attribution.  So everyone is free to take, remix, reuse, share how they want.  I want people to understand.  This is the thing.  Wave, and everybody who listens to this show knows this.  Wave just has captured my imagination in a way that a web app really never has before.  And so I'm totally not objective at this point.  But I fell in love with it.  And I feel like I want other people to see how cool I think it is.  So that's the point of the book.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wave is the first application that moves as fast as Gina.  I think that's really what it is.  It's the first thing that could keep up with you ever.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's the ideal Gina app because it needs explanation and she can do it.  You're right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's another way to look at it, I guess.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's probably a bad sign that it requires a book.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, the whole computer world requires books, doesn't it?  I mean, it's not intuitive for anybody.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Gina, were there, as you dug deeper into Wave or swam deeper into it, I should say,  were there surprises to you, things you hadn't thought of in our talks here in terms of what  it's for, what it does, or what it ought to do or anything?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Most of the surprises, unfortunately, were along the lines of, wow, this thing really isn't done yet.  In fact, I will say that I think it was around 11 p.m. or 12 o'clock last night,  Adam and I were in a furious chat session about what the difference between a ping and a private  reply was and why was Google calling it the same thing in their help docs and how are we going to  explain it in the book.  A lot of things are just not quite baked yet.  But yeah, the book has really made me think about different scenarios, mostly around etiquette and  the things that Wave lets you do right now and doesn't let you do that could really wreak havoc.  Anybody can edit anybody else's Wave, which means that anybody can insert the word not into  anybody else's sentence.  You can't remove people from a Wave.  So, in fact, we had some private waves about the book.  I managed the whole project, the whole book project.  Oh, neat.  Yeah, which was awesome and worked really well.  But I accidentally, I typed A in my search, my contacts panel to find Adam and someone else  came up first and I wound up adding this person who I don't know to a private Wave and I couldn't  remove him or her.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, dear.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So it was this horrible, like, you know, that feeling when you send that an email, you hit  send that an email to people who weren't supposed to get it.  It was this horrible feeling of like, oh, I just screwed up and you can't, you know, you can't  remove people.  So the fact that Wave is so half-baked, it creates some problems.  And also the fact that, I mean, I really would have wanted to write this book in Wave.  Wave's just not ready yet.  I think that Wave is going to be a great publishing tool, but I went with, you know, a proven  publishing tool that's been out for years and years and had, you know, the weight of Wikipedia  on it, which was MediaWiki.  So really, it was more, it was less about possibilities and more about limitations,  unfortunately.  I think Wave has a long way to go, but I think it also has like tons and tons of potential,  which is, you know, why I wrote the book.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, we're excited and I'm thrilled that you announced it on the show.  I think it's a perfect place for you to announce it and crash your site now before

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  before Monday.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't know before you go on the Today Show.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We could watch Gina reboot the server live and that'd be fun.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Go ahead.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Just because I know she's the 18 to do it right.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  It's killing her.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I am right now moving the slider up, change private server resources.  Okay.  More resources.  We need more power to captain.  Power.  Please.  You should see my charts right now.  It's like, whoa.  She's got.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Hey, while we're talking about that, go to google.com  slash robots dot text.  Y'all know what a robots file is.  It's a it's a file.  I don't know.  I don't think Google started this, but it's but certainly Google honors it.  It's a text file you could put on your website that will instruct the Google bot and other  search bots.  Whoops.  I just closed it.  Let's go back there.  Other search bots as to what directories to search and what directories not to search.  So you have, you know, disallow allow and that, you know, most webmasters use this  to, uh, to keep people out of, uh, parts of, you know, private parts of the website.  There's no point in a search engine searching that.  And most search engines honor it.  We'll look a little deeper as you go down the robots that text today and you'll see  user agent kids, disallow slash tricks.  There it is.  Allow slash treats.  See, Gina, have you done that on your server?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, man.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Also, I'm putting on the to-do list right now.  Nicer 404 page.  Nicer error page.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Those PHP errors are a bitch, aren't they?  I don't like those at all.  Well, embarrassing.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's like standing in a public square with your hands down, but you know.  It's a new costume.  Yeah, a new costume.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So who discovered this robots.txt thing?  Cause that's, that's hysterical, but I mean, you'd have to be looking at the Google robots.txt.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Matt Cutts.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, Cutts published it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Cutts tweeted it.  So he knew about it.  He's got the inside line.  He works at Google.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I bet you there was a memo.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So funny.  I'm sure he's actually pretty close to the robots.txt file, right?  Cause he used the spam.  Sure.  I don't know.  Maybe.  I don't know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't know.  That's interesting.  I don't know.  I don't know how it all works.  It's a mystery.  The internet's a mystery to me.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's true.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You agree?  Oh, now we're now I'm worried.  I don't know.  I'm the expert.  Oh yeah, that's right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I wrote a book, but I can't keep a website up.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So what's the deal, Jeff, with Argleton?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I just found that right before the air.  So I saw this in the Telegraph in London that it could be an Easter egg in Google Maps.  There's this town of Argleton in the Google Maps in the UK and it doesn't exist.  But of course it's pinpointed on the map.  So one of the guys quoted in the story went to that position to try to find Argleton.  It's kind of like Narnia.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Did you have to go through a wardrobe to get there?  Exactly.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The guessing is that it's there to trip up.  One guess is that like Phantom Streets that appear on maps,  it's there to trip up copyright violators.  Or it could be some strange reference.  I didn't Google Argleton.  I wonder what that'll get me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, you never know.  Google's got these guys now are getting really arcane in their search breadcrumbs.  Like with that Crop Circles thing.  Did we ever tell people what the upshot of that whole Crop Circles thing was?  No, I don't think so.  Yeah, I can't remember now.  They explained it finally after three or four weeks.  What you find is a Google Maps references to the fact that Google Maps talks about it.  I think you hit the nail on the head.  I think it's map makers have done that for years.  They put fake entries in their maps so that if you copy a map they know and they could say,  look, you didn't do that work yourself.  You copied ours.  But doesn't Google buy its maps from somebody else?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's where the new thing here.  Google is doing, of course, Google made the stock of Nav devices plummet this week because  it announced it's doing its own drive destinations.  And they're, I think, creating their own map data.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because they've been licensing it from TeleNav and a bunch of other companies,  just as the GPS devices do.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But now they're going to have their own free driving spot to spot directions on  Android 2.0.  And so you'll have no need to buy a Nav device.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, I'm kind of a little disappointed.  There is an open mapping group called OpenStreetMap.org that has it's like a wiki for  mapping and it's really good.  And I was I'm a little disappointed that Google didn't just kind of work with them  because first of all, they've already got a very complete data set.  And it would have been great to have Google's support of that instead of Google saying,  well, we'll do it ourselves.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, in fact, I would love to have those the guys or gals or behind OpenStreetMaps  on the show.  We will.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We did a Floss Week with them a couple of months ago.  Oh, fantastic.  And they were just so great.  If you can make an account there, everybody has GPS's now.  So you can make an account there, put a GPS track on it.  You can look at your neighborhood and see if it's accurate.  And because it's a wiki, you can fix it.  And they do want volunteers to go to OpenStreetMap.org and do that, update it.  It looks a lot like Google Maps, except there's more information.  There's really kind of interesting information.  Bikers use it, for instance.  So there's very good bike trail information on here.  You're a bicyclist.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  This gets back to what we talked about a few weeks ago, the idea of the annotated world.  Yes.  And if it allowed you to put new layers of information, you know, great bike rides.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't know how much metadata, but that's the idea.  Because I found out about it in a bicycling app that I use on the iPhone.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I haven't.  I haven't dove into it too much.  I haven't been riding my bicycle as much as I should be.  Well, you're too much of that waving, Gina.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You're still hanging behind here, aren't you?  So I'm zooming in.  I'm going to check to see if they move next week.  I mean, I'm looking at the neighborhood I know best, which is my own.  And it's every bit as accurate as Google Maps.  And I would just love to see.  I was kind of a little disappointed that Google didn't go with, you know,  the one that's already out there would have the same benefit.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What if there's liability, though?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, perhaps.  Did Google say how it was going to license its map information?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Maybe they're maybe you're right.  Maybe they can't just.  I don't know.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I mean, the other interesting story is that is in the UK,  the government owns the map information and you can't get it, even though people own it.  Oh, it's a huge controversy in trying to open up government data.  And it's kind of the first front in the effort for transparent government in the UK  is to say, at least give us our own damn map data to our own damn country.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, now we know who to blame for Argylton.  Yes.  Maggie Thatcher did it.  Yeah, this I mean, the government doesn't own shouldn't own the map.  That's ridiculous.  So you also posted this story, Jeff, and I haven't parsed it yet, but Eric Schmidt,  this is an article from Read Write Web a few days ago,  envisions an Internet in five years is dominated by Chinese.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, well, that of course leads to the the I can decision this week,  but finally is going to allow non-Roman characters.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, as a programmer, Gina, that must scare the heck out of you.  I know Dave Weiner said it's going to break all my software.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is it Unicode they're allowing? What is it that they're allowing?  Because they said that non-Roman characters will be allowed in.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But so just mean names, I think.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right. But that's not that's enough to break a lot of software.  Yeah.  You know, just having an e accent a goo in a in a in a URL.  Do you turn it into an e? What do you do with it?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. Interesting.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He says, Eric says five years from now, the Internet will be dominated by Chinese language  content. Well, that's just kind of a mathematical guess because they're a billion Chinese or  whatever. He says today's teenagers are the model of how the web will work in five years.  They jump from app to app to app seamlessly like little monkeys.  Five years, he says, is a factor of 10 in Moore's law, meaning computers will be  capable of far more by that time than they are today.  Well, duh.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's the impressive thing. Yeah.  But that, yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Within five years, there will be this. I hope he's true on this. I pray that he's true on this.  And in fact, I have banked my entire business on this.  Within five years, broadband will be well above 100 megabits in performance.  And this rest and distribution distinctions between TV, radio and web will go away.  I don't think that's five years off. I think that's maybe two.  But what could really throw a monkey wrench in that is how corporations, particularly in the US,  behave, how Comcast and Verizon behaves. There's enough dark fiber to make that possible. In fact,  to make internet access practically free. He said something surprising. We're starting to make  significant money off YouTube. So he says content will move more towards video. Again, something

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm hoping he's right on. Yeah, yeah. We all are, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Real-time information is just as valuable as all the other information. We want it included  in our search results. They're obviously moving in that direction. And this was telling, and it's  something I've said for a while, but it's not obvious. There are other companies, many companies  beyond Twitter and Facebook in the real-time space. I think that's absolutely true.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The next one is interesting too. You can index. This is where, this is I think is Google's week  this today. We can index real-time info now, but how do we rank it? Oh, it's huge. It's huge.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We talked about this last week. What is authority in a real-time world?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What is relevance? How do you cluster topics? How do you do all that stuff? It's just, I think,  just as in media, we brought all of our old assumptions to the internet and treat it like  a medium. I almost think that Google's in a position now where they're going to try to  treat everything like search and the real-time web isn't about search. It's something new.  I know they're trying to get their heads around it because I have to say this in every show.  They're talking about hyper personal news streams, but the stream, the notion of the live river  is just so different from the static page world of media and of the first web.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I've been talking about the river concept for a long time, for at least a year and a half,  and really been trying to figure out how to do a river of text that goes with our river of audio  and video on our live streams because I think text is so important. It's searchable. It's clickable.  It's where you add metadata to video and audio, and I've wanted to do that. CNET beat me to it.  They have a new view on CNET's homepage called The River. That's an interesting idea. It says  if you go to news.CNET.com slash river, instead of sorting or organizing the information we post by  topic, just go to The River and you'll see it all in order. Our tweets, our articles, all in real  time. I think this is very smart of them as a news organization. I doubt very much it'll get picked up  by anybody, and you can narrow it down to blog posts, videos, photo galleries, CNET on Twitter.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  CNN just did a redesign, and kind of a big deal of redesign, but they have their news pulse there,  which is their kind of big media way to do the same thing just by having the most popular,  you know, the stories with buzz going on now. It's on the top nav.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Most popular stories right now. Brazilian Indians find plane survivors. Yeah, I mean, this is where  we're going. We're in too much of a hurry. It's what you're doing with your book, Gina. There's  no time to make a dead tree edition. You have to have it online. You have to get it out there,

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  but you know, for consumers, it means really tuning your filters and retraining your brain,  I think, to consume these things, you know, consume the things that you're interested in.  Actually, this kind of segues into the Twitter list. I don't know if we want to talk about Twitter  list this week a little bit, but yeah, I mean, I agree, you know, the river is a good thing. It's  the fastest way to get information out, but at the same time, I don't know, maybe this means I'm  getting old. Sometimes I'm just like, too much. I can't keep it. Overwhelmed. Too much. As Clay

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Schucke says, that's not, you've always had too much. The problem is filter failure.  Right.  So the opportunity is to find the ways to try to prioritize this. And it goes to last week's  conversation about what was it called? Dew drop, news drop, whatever, you know, the efforts to  prioritize things, the efforts to give us to add value to this river.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, and it turns out humans are the best at this, I think. And you find trusted editors who,  Twitter is very good at that. You follow people who will surface the news in a timely and  organized fashion.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, the thing is though, and I totally see the value of this, but you know, the reason why  I wrote the wave book in a book structure with chapters and a hierarchical sort of structure is  that blogging about new things that happen on wave just isn't, it doesn't give you, you just don't  get the context. You're always getting sort of the new item, but you don't see how that fits into the  rest of it. And this was always kind of one of my biggest gripes on Lifehacker was like, I want to  create a resource, a reference where people can go and say, what is the best image editor for  Windows right now? You know, in a reverse chronological stream, which is what every blog is,  right? But in these times, real time streams even faster, there's no way to figure that out.  And I mean, we struggled with it for years. It's like, how do we rank content, prioritize content?  And how does the editor say, this is the thing that you should look at right now. And this is  the thing you shouldn't look at, you know? So, so it's, I mean, it also introduces kind of lots of  issues. I feel like writing the wave thing in a book structure is sort of an old school.  No, no, I think.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But, Gina, you adapted it. I mean, it's, the problem is that it's process versus product,  right? So it feels like you put on a product, but it's a product that's going to be constantly  evolving. And so what matters is not the product. What matters is that you created a place to bring  together the information to create a reference, but it's going to be constantly in process. And  that's, you're the future of media, Gina. No, I think so.  I think so. Wow.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's a combination of both. You need both. You need what's happening right now,  but you need some contextualization.  You do. It's true.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think it is wave itself.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  People, you know, this, we've gone through this before when people said, oh, there'll be no linear  structure or stories anymore, no beginning, middle or end. It'll just be slice of life. It's very  similar to this kind of real time thing. What did we find? Well, slice of life is fine, but people  still want stories.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right. And even within that, I had a journalism student come into my class in the first year of  our three year old school. And this young guy said, you know, what the hell are you doing  teaching us this newspaper crap for? You know, leads and nut graphs and all this stuff. And I  said, if you put out a blog post that doesn't have a nut graph that tells you what it's about,  nobody's going to read it. In an RSS feed, if you don't have a good lead and headline.  Can you tell me what a nut graph is?  Oh, sorry. It's the graph that tells you what the whole thing is about.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's the nut.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's the nut of the story. But the third or fourth paragraph, you come down and you have  the nut graph.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Boy, I'm learning so much in this show.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But a good lead and a good headline are going to make people click on your link  in Twitter and in RSS. And so those old structures still have value. The book structure you did,  Gina, I think, right. It's you've got to be able to go from a beginning to an end to learn something.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. And you know, for me, I'm going to kind of feature recent changes to the book.  And I'm probably the book will have some sort of blog. Like, here's the new thing to look at.  But, you know, I tried to pitch a wiki structure to the publisher, the life hacker publishers and  say, hey, I want to build a Wikipedia for software, essentially. And it was like,  people just aren't, you know, what's the reason to come back? It's, you know, it's got to be  sort of news based. It has to be reverse chronological. So I think it's, I think it's  striking a balance between the two.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Do you think that 10 years from now we'll look back and say, isn't it, isn't it quaint  how challenged we were by all this?  I do.  It was so obvious.  Why were we worried?  Bad news. If you're a newspaper publisher, I just saw the Chronicle circulation statistics  for our San Francisco Chronicle 25% down. The New York Times dropping below a million for the  first time in memory. It's now, it's not just a revenue problem for newspapers. It's a circulation  problem for newspapers too.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, but it's bigger than that too. It's, I mean, this is what I blather about all the time.  You know, it's also a cost problem because they, but it's also then a cost opportunity.  The fact that you can work collaboratively with lots of people saves you a tremendous  amount of money. In fact, the marginal cost of new journalism is zero because the people  themselves will do it. And the question is, how do you add value to that? The economics of news  have changed completely and utterly and will never be the same. I've come to, I haven't  read this blog post yet, but I think the future of news is not institutional. It's entrepreneurial.  Yay.  And I think that's going to be true in many areas of economy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think it's business. In fact, you know, what I talk about with the educators, especially for  high school kids, is you need to teach kids entrepreneurial skills.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Amen.  Yes.  They need to come out.  I teach a course in Journal and Entrepreneurial Journalism. And if either of you in New York  on December 9th are jurying for the classes and there's $50,000 in seed money to give them.  Wow.  And I have three students from last term who are starting businesses now based on this.  Oh, that's great.  What we realize is most journalists are going to go out, they're going to work independently,  and we have to teach them new skills.  Yes.  We're doing a session on how to create a brand and market yourself. You got to learn how to send  out bills. You got to learn how to probably, this is heresy, but you probably have to learn how to  sell ads.  Yep.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Look at me.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  I had to do all that.  Yeah. I was just thinking this week about how really, at this point, you know, everyone really  needs to have a freelancer mindset regardless of whether or not they have a nine to five job. I  mean, yeah, you just, you have to have that freelancer mindset and, you know, try new things  and have different ventures and, you know, try and fail and start new stuff and see what happens.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's so much more satisfying to be honest, if you could just do it. It's scarier, just like you,  Gina, with this book, it's scary, but in the long run, it's so much more satisfying. You have to  control, you're creating, it's more vibrant, it's more exciting. And I think this is-

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Leo, what were the biggest lessons you've had to learn those when you set out on your own?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think delegation was important. You know, you can't do it all by yourself, so it was very  valuable for me to realize that I had to let go a little bit of control. You know, you can't be a  control freak, you have to get help, you have to collaborate with people. So it can't just, at the  same time as you're being an entrepreneur and it's all about you, you have to also be collegial and  collaborate. That was a very important lesson for me. Were you good at business? No, I have no business  skills. So what did I do? I found people who were. Now, I don't know if that's going to work  for everybody. You kind of need some business skills. I wish I had some, but I just, I think,  you know what, I'll say what the lesson was for me, Jeff, is knowing what I'm good at and what I  love to do and focusing on that. And not feeling like I had to do it all. Whether you hire a person

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  on staff to do your business stuff- Or outsource. We do this project at CUNY on new business models  for news and one of our key beliefs is that there have to be organizations that do things like set  up networks or critical mass to sell ads. Yes. And that's how we sell our ads, by the way. We're

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  going to have to have technology help. You're exactly right on. We don't sell our ads ourselves,  we outsource to exactly that kind of organization. So the gig economy also requires cooperation and  doing what you're good at and having others outsource to others the stuff you're not good at.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yes. My cheap blog line is do what you do best and link to the rest.  Perfect. T-shirts soon to be sold.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's true. We're running out of time. Can we save lists for next week? Because it really is  a big topic and I think the Twitter lists we should talk about for sure. Because it brings in all of  these issues, including authority and so forth. Metadata. I think they've gone now  Twitter wide, have they? I know I see a lot of people now talking about them.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I think they've gone wide. Have they gone 100%? They were rolling it out pretty quickly this

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  week. I saw some folks panic that they had it and they lost it. I'm not wrong, but there was promise

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  they would get it back. I created right away about 20 lists. It takes forever. I complained about

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  that and Fred Wilson, who of course invested in Twitter, came on and said, no, no, that's what  developers are going to do is create easier ways to do it. Yeah, third parties need to do that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Partly because I don't even know if they have an API yet. That's part of what's holding it back.  But I look now that I think it's gone wide because I'm now on 3000 lists up from like 200 a week ago.  So that's a significant number. And I noticed that on some of my lists, I've got hundreds of

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  people following some of my lists. Oh yeah, my list number went up a lot too. A lot of people  definitely got this this week. Yeah. If not everyone. And the API is rolling out, but  TweetDeck is promising some really cool... They said they're going to have it. Yeah.  Anyway, we should save it for next week. Yep. It's a good subject and I think there'll be more to

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  say. And I'm just saying I'm on more lists than Scoble, so that's all I care about.  That's all I care about. The number's back, baby. It's all about numbers.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Your site is up. Yay. You're a podcast star while you run servers. You are so impressive.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's pretty good. Wow. Give the URL again.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Okay. We're going to do this again. Okay. We'll watch it go down again. It is completewaveguide.com.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All right. Don't all go there at once. Okay. Kids, kids. And a shout out to all the Twig waivers.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm going to be in Wave this afternoon, you know, pimping my stuff and I'll stop in and say hi

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  right after we... Yeah, there are a lot of Twig waivers. And people keep saying,  why aren't you doing an official Wave for Twig? I can't follow it and do the show. That's why.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. It's, yeah, the nonlinear thing is tough. And also busy waves, they just, they break. I mean,  once you go over like a hundred blips and people add gadgets and bots, things get really unstable  and you start getting Firefly error messages and it all goes to hell. So it's not that we

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  don't love Wave. It's not shiny. It's not shiny. All right. Let's wrap things up because it's  Halloween evening and I'm sure some of you want to go out and trick or treat. Let's start with  Gina Trapani and her tool of the week. My tip of the week. I'm sorry. Tip of the week. I do the tool.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So there are a couple of really cool things this week. I'm going to go with one. Google Docs  released the ability to batch export all of your documents.  Yay. It's a zip. Yay. It's really cool. As is it file, which is fantastic. Right. So before you  could open up a doc or a spreadsheet or whatever you had and save it locally or export it locally.  But if you use Google Docs, you have a big collection of documents already. So,  so as of this week, if you are in Google Docs, which actually got a, a, quite a nice little  facelift recently, if you're select all items from the dropdown, you can choose select all.  And then from the more actions dropdown, choose export and you can convert to Microsoft Office  formats. You can choose the formats you want to convert to PDF, open office, Microsoft office.  It continue and you've got a zip file of all your Google Docs. So, so this, this is, this is pretty  cool. You know, I'm always worried about storing too much of my information on Google and I'm sort  of having a monopoly on my stuff. But when they give you this kind of, I tweeted about this, when  they give you this kind of escape patch, a batch easy export, it really kind of makes you feel  better. Like, okay, this is my data and I can get it in and out easily. I've seen some plugins.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I saw one and I'm going to give it a try that allow you to kind of have a toolbar for Microsoft  Office that interacts with Google Docs so that you can go back and forth. And that's sweet. Yeah.  Have you tried that kind of thing? Do you know about that? I have not, but that's pretty sweet.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm going to find out about it. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, think about that. Like saving locally and  saving to the cloud and the same one shot. I'll give you an example. Our business manager says,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I cannot use Google's spreadsheet because it's too slow. And I need, you know, I'm used to Excel,  so I want to use Excel. So now I can say, yeah, you can use Excel, but you can still share them  on Google Docs. You can save them up there. You can access access them from there. That seems like the  best of both worlds. Right. Very cool. So now look under more actions. Once you've selected all your  docs or some of your docs and you've got an export command, it'll give you all sorts of formats,  open office, Microsoft office, rich text, PDF. I like PDF. I like PDF. PDF rocks. PDF rocks.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And Jeff, have you? There was a, I think it was the Sunlight Foundation had a great piece this week  about how PDF is the ruination of government data. Government thinks it's put the data out as a PDF.  And then we got it out there and we can't analyze it. We can't do anything with it. PDF is. Oh,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  interesting. They, they, they, they promote text, I guess. Right. Yeah. Huh. Just plain text. Yeah.  PDF is, I think is encumbered. Isn't it Adobe's proprietary format? Yeah. That's the problem.  So that would be a big problem. Yeah. Can't analyze it very well. Does you have a number?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I do. You stole the first one, which was 10. I'm sorry. That's all right. That's all right.  1.4 million is the number. It is the number of Google voice users.  Wow. Half of whom use it daily. The number was in some document that was supposed to be redacted  on the FCC discussion of Google voice, no-nos and Businessweek ferreted it out. So now it's out now

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  on. It was a PDF. It was a PDF that was miss formatted. Google miss formatted this PDF and  meant to redact. They meant to redact the numbers and they didn't. And so the P the FCC published  this document and then they pulled it as soon as Google realized. But I just, not to point and laugh,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  but it's just, that's a big mistake for Google. But that's easy to do, I think, because you think

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  you've protected it, but you haven't. Yeah. Yeah. But they've had a couple of these nephews, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. With metadata and PDF problems. Anyway. So has Microsoft. So has everybody. Yeah. Yeah.  It's not uncommon. We had, I worked with a host at Tech TV who had some headshots done and some of  them she was naked. Don't ask, but she used a thumb. I think she was Photoshopped to reduce,  to crop them. Oh no. But the thumbnail still had the full image. Oh, so she distributed the  cropped version. Somebody saw, Hey, wait a minute. She's naked in the thumbnail. It was everywhere.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You remember that, Jeff. Oh, of course I didn't look. I felt so bad. I felt how embarrassing is

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  that. But that's how easy this stuff, you know, it's hard, these formats, it's tough.  My tool of the week is brand new this week from Google and it allows you to search for music.  Oh, hey pirates. Search Google for music and our song artist or album name. And let's,  let's pick somebody who puts their music up online so that we don't. I actually, I'm sorry,  I'm going to have to search for Metallica. I have to do this. And now you do get a Google ad,  but then you get a lot of MP3s. Probably many of these are not legitimate, but they're out there.  But this, wait a minute, this is the wrong one. This is not the one I want. This is not the Google  music search. This is somebody else's Google music search. Let's, let's do this again. Take two.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I was like, wow, Leo found a whole different interface. Somebody else was doing that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is the one I wanted to show you.  That's what happens when you Google Google music search. And I wasn't paying attention. I said,  oh yeah, this is cool. So it's similar. It's similar. Let's, let's, let's click and do  Bob Dylan. This is a much better results page though. And you even get a little player on it.  So you can play the Bob Dylan song with a nice little player and like that  violate copyright like to your heart's content. Now notice a buy MP3 link on there. That's coming  from my space. So this is interesting. I don't, you know, Pandora, Rhapsody, Lala, this supports,  I think the purchase of music, but I don't know if it's limited to legal music or not. I'm not

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  sure how they would even do that. It acted differently for different songs for me. Like you  would get a, you get just a little excerpt of a song on some and others you get the whole thing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So yeah, I think it's a great feature. It's a nice thing to have. It is. That's now don't go to the  one I went to go to google.com. Now this says slash landing slash music, but I bet if you go  to google.com slash music, yeah, that works. Google.com slash music for the Google music search.  Or I bet let me see music.com. I wonder if that would work. I bet it would.  They're good about giving you all the, all the conceivable ways to get somewhere. No, it doesn't.  You got to go to google.com slash music. Well, that's it for, for us for this week in Google.  What a fun show. As always, Jeff Jarvis is a fantastic blogger. If you're not reading his blog,  you're missing out on some of the best writing on the internet right now.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, but I've been, I've been abandoned lately. I feel bad. I tweeted yesterday that I wanted  to do nothing this weekend, but blog, but I haven't even blogged yet.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That made me so happy when I saw that. Yeah. And we all feel that way.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We're all, we're all guilty as sin of, you know, not, not blogging enough,  but you write how many thousands of words a week? Yeah. And your posts are just gifts, Jeff.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, they're so good. I had fun this week. I've got to put up some audio. I couldn't because of  my health, which is fine. I couldn't fly yet. And so I gave talks to London and Munich and New York  all in the same day. Thanks to Skype. Thanks to Skype video. Skype video is amazing. It's amazing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's a, it's a, it's a revolution. So you're feeling well. Yeah. Yeah. And the, and the, do  they, is there a, you know, like, do they go back and check or is there anything that?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Three months from when I got out, they, they did a blood test. Okay. Good. You'll read about it in  the blog. It'll be there. I know. I guarantee you. I'll make Gina blush again. No, no. I love your

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  post about it. It's giving me insight into the male. I mean, I, you know, I'm married to a woman,  so I don't even, I don't even know how most of this stuff works at all. This doesn't come up for you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You're lucky. This is, this is foreign plumbing. Yes. Nothing you need to know about.  Uh, it's, I, I love it. I really, I think Jeff, I am serious. I just love Jeff's blog,  buzz machine.com. And I have to say the same about Gina. I don't know how you find time to  write all of this and. And a book. A book. You are so prolific. It's kind of amazing. The book is,  let's break the site one more time. Complete wave guide.com. And her blog site is smarterware.org,

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  where you also find, Oh, you've redesigned. Yes. Yes. And in fact, the blog has been sort of  abandoned because I've been hacking out, hacking away at the book. I like the new design. Oh,  thank you. I just want to thank you so much for letting me announce the book here on the show.  And thank you to everyone who broke my server again. Best problem you can have in the world.  Seriously. I feel grateful and the book's still going to be there. And, and I really appreciate

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  it. It break it. Let's break it all week and break it all week. Yeah, seriously. I'm all about it.  Bring it down, baby. Oh, I just, I, Gina, you're the best. Congratulations on the book. I think  you're doing exactly the right thing. This is how a book should be done, especially a book about

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Google wave. Thank you. And I can finally take these silly glasses off. No, you can never take

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  them off. She's back. She's back. Complete wave guide.com. We thank you for joining us. Don't  forget. You can listen to this week in Google. It's on iTunes. It's all the podcast clients. We  are soon going to have video. We are recording video. We're editing video. But as always, these  things take, these things take time, but we will get them. We get the video out soon, I think in  the next week or so, as well as live streaming on most of the platforms that you're using today,  including most of the phones and so forth. So just keep watching for that.  Meanwhile, we'll see you next week. Thanks for joining us on this week in Google.
