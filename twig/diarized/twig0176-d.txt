We love having  you. And we're going to put off the change log a little bit because we have another guest to talk  a little bit about YouTube. Lamar Wilson is also here. Hey Lamar. Welcome. I'll do my crazy

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  like high like this. Cause Jeff loves that. Let's all do it together. Hey, hey, hey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The left side of the aisle is not going for that one. Not one bit. Not at all. Lamar is a  well-known YouTuber. Lamar Wilson is the channel comical videos about my everyday life.  That's a new, this is new. This is a new name. And I rebooted the channel a little bit just to

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  make it more personal. I still talk about gadgets and tech stuff, but I try to integrate it into a  more personal story. And the audience is responding. Well, it's awesome. 19 and a half million video

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  views. Somebody's watching. Hey, and as we look at this, you could see the new look at YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There is a new look and we're going to talk about that. Is this the new look?  This is the, the, the chat, the channels haven't changed. It's the other,  it's the front page. It's the front page. The video page. Let me, let me go to my front. Oh, welcome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It says to the YouTube homepage. I love it. Kind of got it. All right. All right. I wrote that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let me close the ad, which is half the page and then click. Got it. And here we go.  Here we go. It's got a what to watch section recommended for you because you watched  like, so good. In fact, quite a bit. Here's another one recommended because you watched  likes doing this. This is scam Sasquatch and supernatural full lecture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to find out what the connections are in the database between, between these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because I watched big heads, I get the zombie slayer because I watched how nexus Q works. I  get a Google I O a keynote. I'm what's interesting is I'm getting a lot of my own shows, which is,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I guess, good. Which probably shows that you haven't watched your own shows, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, really? Watch them. I haven't. Yes. Because I watched like, so good. It should watch the final  episode of the Totally Rad Show, which is full of reggae. Yeah, look, I do not watch my own show,  but I'm pleased as a, as a podcaster that YouTube is in fact putting my shows there. Now is that  why? How does this work? Tell me all of them are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay. So last Thursday, YouTube, you know, completely redesigned the site. They gave  us a warning here in LA. We went to the YouTube space, LA, the brand new site, and we kind of got  a tour of it on Monday. And, you know, overall, it looks great. What YouTube is, and just a little  history also went to Google a couple weeks ago to see Vic and Dottra and another YouTube guy named  Shashir to talk about it's kind of this YouTube and Google plus certification that they're doing.  So I kind of got an inside track before this was happening. But what YouTube is trying to do  is what they first did is they separate, they had 12 pages on YouTube of different content.  And so they decided to get rid of the pages to just three, your channel page, the video page,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  and what's the other page, the homepage. Now I have to say that what we just saw was if  you were not logged into YouTube, what you get as you just go there. And I think the issue with  YouTube is discovery, is it not? They want to, and it's not merely discovery. They want you to  watch shows. Well, correct me if I'm wrong, Lamar, but I would guess that Google and YouTube are  using this as a way to promote shows that promote their agenda, which is to make YouTube be more of  an almost like a TV network, like an established purveyor of quality programming, as opposed to

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  groin kick videos. Right. Now, if you go back to the main page, because there was a bar on the

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  right that I wanted to address. So go to my page. Cause this is if after you log in this one,  cause I've got what to watch my subscription social right there is fine. Cause I wanted to address

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  the right side to answer your question. If you look at the right side, Oh yeah, this is where  you want to be recommended channels. Yeah. Now before it used to be recommended videos, the  100% focus right now for YouTube is subscribing. And here's the reason Leo, there are four to eight  million approximate partners. Partners are people who make money like myself, you know,  we can add to the site. However, there are 800 million people who watch many of whom do not even  have accounts who log in and don't even know what subscribe is. Right. So they've tried,  they're trying to increase the watch time. So of course they're going to have people,  they want us to get our audience to log in to subscribe, to be part of the site. Obviously,  you know, they want that data of course, so they can give better discovery. You know, I think it's  watch time on YouTube, Matt, correct me if I'm wrong. I think it's 10 minutes now and they  wanted to increase it to about 30. They really want to triple, you know, the usage of someone  who just going to YouTube casually to stay there and watch. And then we get rewarded as partners,  the longer they stay and search results and, and so, so that's the kind of the reason of this big  redesign is really about subscribing and about giving attention to channels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How do you get to be on this recommended channels?  It's algorithm. Yeah. Cause I'm looking Phil DeFranco. That makes sense. 2 million subscribers,  windows 99,000 Vsauce three. I don't know what that is. 300,000. It's a science channel. It's  actually really good. It's, it sounds like this is kind of based on what I'm subscribing to, although  I see the Ellen DeGeneres show, which is not in any way motivated by anything I've ever watched.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think I got, I got Ellen recommended and I was like, Oh my God, they know about me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, they know I'm a lesbian too. And no, I just have a thing for Ann Hesch. Does that count?  Actually, you know why I'm getting this? Cause I did, cause we did watch a bunch of Ellen  DeGeneres videos. I think maybe they saw that. So this, but I've never watched Vsauce, but maybe  they noticed I watched, watched a lot of science. Absolutely. So that's the discovery they're trying

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  to do for the channels. And you know, there may be some lucky people who get to get pinned there  regularly to, to boost up their numbers because they have popular shows. One of the things you  notice on the left side, since you're logged in, I'll leave you back to that is there's a, that bar  on the left side is persistent. So at the bottom, you see your subscriptions, which you can never  really see before. So now you get to see channels and you get to see what activity that you haven't

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  seen from them. I'm so glad to know I'm part of the kin community. I guess. Yeah.  I must've subscribed to that at some point. I don't even. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  why don't you click a video so that I can show you the, so, so as I'm, oh, I know what this is. This

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  is a good friend of mine. Stacey Barcelotta used to be on tech TV on call for help has a kin.  She's part of the kin community. So now I'm watching Beth's Christmas morning breakfast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So now the left side, you see the guide. So go ahead and click the guide to have that drop down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay. Here's my guide. So it's initially collapsed, which is good. So it's kind of out of the way,  although that bar is there. You might as well just, I mean, I don't know what I've gained by  having it collapse there. Yeah. Never get lost. Browse videos from the previous page and clean the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  hump. Got it. So I'm going to close that. Your subscriptions are on the left side. So now if  you're watching a video, you don't have to leave the video to go back to the homepage to see, oh,  what else can I watch? They have it right there on the left side. If done, is they move the  subscribe button and the title below the video so that you can, you know, they're trying to  encourage subscriptions and they want your eyes to be lower, just, you know, to like the video,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  to share it and things like that. So they also probably, I would guess, want to do is hide the  comment area. That's what first thing I do is hide that well below the fold. They don't want  to make that very, let's not look at that folks. I don't know if that was intentional, but what do  you see Gina on your recommended channels besides Ellen? I got Nerdist, Rihanna, the New York Times,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  HBO. I've actually just subscribed to like 12, just in the time we've been talking, I've subscribed  to like 15 different channels. So it works. Annoying Orange. It does work. Wait a minute,  why did they recommend Annoying Orange to you? I'm sure that I watched, I watched Annoying Orange  in the past. I got, I got to it, although I was already subscribed to it. So I got a lot of  suggestions to watch Twitch shows, which is totally spot on. It kind of turns it into an RSS reader a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  little bit. It's interesting. Yeah, I once watched an H, I subscribed to H plus that show and then I  got annoyed at it in episode two, episode 41 of it now and recommendations. I know Phil DeFranco got

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  replaced on my page by Aura TV. Oh look, you should be watching Al Jazeera. You must be a terrorist,  Chad. Look at that. Al Jazeera is right up there. Also there's, that's Z Frank. Now Chris Perillo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That is a featured, so that's actually, it looks like that's not something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I got ABC News, Michael Jackson. I just recently watched Billie Jean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got Google Nexus as a channel, just the Google Nexus commercials.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Huh, but it does sound like they're paying attention to what you watch, not just on YouTube,  but it sounds like they might be paying attention to what you search for. Yeah, they do. And I will

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  be remiss if I didn't talk about some of the problems. I think if I left here without addressing  those, my audience would kill me. So the main page, if you look in the center, if you don't  know what's going on, you now see a page of likes, recommendations, comments. If you were subscribed  to people who might say, tweet uploaded, tweet added to a playlist. And that's good for discovery  of the 800 million people, because I think the average subscriptions are only like three. So the  average person only subscribes to like three people. However, we have power users like myself,  who are furious at this because it takes three steps for the user, our subscribers, to go to  uploads only where they can see our content. And so what's happened since Thursday,  all of our views have dropped about half. I see it as temporary because I kind of have an open  mind. I see what they're doing. But because people are now lost because they have all these  recommendations, they can't see my video that I uploaded by the hour 40 minutes ago, because they  see all this other content of people who like videos, people who comment it. So I talked to  YouTube, they said what they're going to do is make it sticky where a power user can by default  just have it go to uploads only because I'm going to be honest, if I'm subscribed to you, Leo, I love  you, but I don't really care what you like or what you comment on and things like that. I want to  just see my uploads and see. And that's one of the biggest problems right now that we're dealing  with in this last week. Interesting. So it's bad for us content creators and power users. But like  said, they said they're going to fix it. It might be more egalitarian though, right? Could that be  part of the reason? I mean, well, what they didn't want to make it by default uploads only, even  though we would love that as creators, because for us, they want discovery. They don't want you to go  the same old ruts, right? Yeah. And the problem is most people we look at it from kind of a selfish  point of view as creators, but most people who use YouTube don't subscribe to people. They just want  to go there. They don't want to see a blank list. They want to see videos. So I understand what  YouTube is doing. It doesn't mean I have to like it. Right. So I hope they definitely fix that.  I think the main thing, they're trying to slowly integrate Google+. And we talked about this a  couple of weeks ago when you weren't here about them trying to kind of Google-fy YouTube. I just,  I told them when I went to go visit that I wish they would find a better way to educate power  users about what they're going to do ahead of time. It was a good start that we had a private  meeting before, but I think they just need to do more. I advocated for some kind of advocate for  YouTube or Google+. Someone to speak on behalf. That's a creator. I think Phil DeFranco did a  really good video ahead of time. We need more of those people to explain, hey, I know this looks  confusing to you users. Here's how you fix it. And maybe it'll make for a better experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think over time people will figure that part out. There's also a social button,  which is interesting. Google+, of course, is already connected, but they do have,  you can connect Facebook to it. Oh, sorry. Something didn't work like it was supposed  to try again. Well, you can connect Twitter to it. So that way you, let's authorize Twitter.  And that way, oh, sorry, something didn't work. So try again. I guess you, in theory,  because there's buttons, you could connect those if it just worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So everybody you follow, they share videos. Right. Unfortunately, right now,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  it won't let me connect Facebook or Twitter, but Google+, works. No problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. I want to say I overall like this. We got to see in LA the channel changes. Now, if people are  going crazy about this change, the channel changes are going to be unbelievable. We couldn't take  pictures of it. We couldn't really give details, but they're going to do that in the first quarter  of next year. And again, they're trying to make it all about discovery. And so us as creators,  we kind of have to, we're forced to, we don't have a choice. We kind of have to put ourselves  out of the equation and see the bigger picture. YouTube is focused on getting all these 800 million  people in to be part of it instead of just casual viewers. Right. So I like what they're  doing. I hope my views being cut in half is not permanent. Geez. Or I'm going to be living with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We have a place you could just bed down in the basement here. It's very comfortable.  All the YouTube creators will be there soon.  So yeah, you're right. Featured has been rotating and that's Phil DeFranco. These are Al Jazeera.  These are paid. I have the Wall Street Journal now. So that's probably, I don't know if Features is  paid or it's something that YouTube's doing. And then I get, I'm getting the same recommendations

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  here over and over again, below the Featured. Search in the search box at the top for just  random topic. You'll see the ability to subscribe even from there and that's new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm going to search for Epic Meal Time. And okay. And now, yes, I did mean Epic Meal Time. So let's see,  by the way, I get Kraft Cooking School videos above that as an ad, which is good. Oh yes,  channel or subscribe. So I can just say subscribe right there. And then now I'm subscribed.  I have a KitchenAid ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You see it on the left, it highlighted it and showed you on the left that you subscribe. That's  another thing because a lot of people will click subscribe and not know what that means. Plus they  never watch the videos. So now they see, oh, on the left, that's where I can see all the subscriptions.  So they're trying to train the masses on what subscribe is. And I think it's going to be a  slow process. I don't know what they're going to do, frankly, when Google Plus and YouTube Merch is  are they going to go to follow as a word?  Right. Circle.  They're debating it right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So that's an interesting point. Do you notice as a YouTube creator that there is a correlation  between number of subscriptions and number of video views? In other words, do you want to really  promote subscribers? Because as far as I can tell, subscribing to something doesn't really  send it. It's more like an RSS feed than it is a podcast, for instance.  But it's going to show up in your list of recommended videos.  Now it will show up here on the left. Chad, you do YouTube videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, and I'm sure Lamar will say this, but in the past, a normal YouTube user would subscribe,  check YouTube in the morning, and then watch the videos that came in from the subscription.  So it was a direct correlation. But now, when it's more algorithmic, maybe not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it still is to a point. And the good part is that as a user, I have an option to go in my  subscriptions and check, get email upload. So they will get an email whenever I upload a video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. And I have to say, if I go on the left here, the default is what to watch.  But I can also click my subs, then that's the one that's algorithmic. But then I can  click my subscriptions, and this will be all activity. And here, Lamar, I can see uploads  only. So I can see new uploads. Right. However, that's also a problem because

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  how many steps did I take you? Yeah.  It took you three steps to get to what you wanted to see. And-

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know what they should do? Just let it stay there. That's my indication that that's where  I wanted to be. It should always load to the last place I went.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the problem because if they make it default, most people are only subscribed to  a few people. So they'll come to a point where there are no videos there. So what they're going  to do is make it sticky for people like you and me who are power users who want that feature  to keep it sticky. So they're definitely going to do it. I wish they would have done it at the  rollout because that would have made it life a lot easier for us. Lamar Wilson's channel is Lamar

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wilson with two R's, L-A-M-A-R-R Wilson on YouTube. And Lamar, it's great to see you. Come up and  visit us. Thank you for having me. Yeah. The tyranny of the default is what they call that,  isn't it? Cyber dog. See you Lamar. See you Lamar. Bye-bye. Thank you. Good to see you Lamar.  Let's take a break. We'll come back. Change log. More Google news than you can stuff a pig with.  And it's the end of the year. So Twitter, YouTube, and Google. Google started this years ago with  Zeitgeist. Now everybody's doing it. So YouTube, Twitter, I mean Google, Twitter, and Facebook now  all have year-ender videos. We'll have the battle of the year-ender videos also when we come back.  First a word from Stamps.com. I don't want you to go to the post office anymore. I don't,  especially if you're a pro. If you're a serious person, does a lot of fulfillment, a lot of mailing,  your business, you send out invoices or marketing material. If you're a seller on eBay or Amazon,  you're just mailing a lot of stuff. Last thing you want to do in December is go to the post office  because that's the month of the amateurs. That's when the amateur, you don't want to be mixed in.  You're a pro. Pros use Stamps.com. It's the ultimate way to do mailing because it means  you can do everything you need to do from your desk.

You have a  USB scale so you're always paying exactly the right amount. No postage due, no overpaying. That's  what I always do. Put too many stamps on a package because you want to make sure it gets... Never  again. With that scale, you just plop the package on the scale. It automatically prints exactly the  right amount.

The Zeitgeist year in review is two minutes,  45 seconds. It's a little obvious. Yeah, but let's just say here's to 2012. It says here's to the  curious and it shows Felix Baumgartner jumping out of that capsule 120,000 feet of. It shows  this is the Olympic runner, right? Right. What's his name? Yeah. What's his name?  It shows the debate between what's his names. It shows Sai. Here he is. Oppa Gangnam Style.  I guess he was really the video of the. There's the SpaceX launch. That's cool.  We searched for firsts. The first Higgs boson, the first person cured of HIV. China to launch  a space mission. Hurricane Sandy. I like these Zeitgeist because it also reminds you what happened

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  early in the year, not just recently, right? Yeah. And if you go to the, there's a Zeitgeist site

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  that has the tops in all these categories. That's what I really like. Stop Sopa.  They use the Egyptian Spring. Or is that Syria? It might be Syria. This year I think it'd be Syria.  Well, it's just stuff going on in Egypt too. So this is a nice video. I like it. And yeah,  so is it google.com? I think it should be on there. Oh yeah, of course. Just click the link.  I'd go to google.com. How many, did you start, when did you start doing this, Matt? Do you remember?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's been a long time. It's been several years. Yeah. And there's always a hot debate about whether  you show the most popular searches, which are like free or Facebook or whatever. Or whether  you show the first derivative and then you get into the trending stuff and the stuff that's hot

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  topics. So that's why it doesn't say the most common search because you're right, it's stupid.  You get trending. Hotmail, whatever. Yeah. Yeah. So for instance, in trending searches,  in entertainment you got Whitney Houston, number one. Gangnam Style, number two. Hurricane Sandy.  Actually, this isn't entertainment. This is searches. Okay. iPad 3. Do you get involved

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  with this matter? How is this done? It's kind of interesting. There are some engineers who built a  lot of the code to figure out what are the trending topics. But then after that, it goes to a great  team of people who sort of look through it and pick out what categories of searches are especially  interesting. And it's a lot of fun because you really do feel like you're looking into what the  world is thinking about. I've always loved cyclists. Yeah. Do you know, Matt, do they resolve

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  misspellings? I presume there's many styles of gangnam people guess. Yeah. That's always a hot

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  debate. Do you give the exact raw answer or do you basically say, well, okay, you're looking at the  curated stuff. Oh, this was a bot and you take that out or something like that. In fact, I've

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  noticed over the years it's gotten more and more curated. This is much more editorial than it was  in the early days when it really was kind of, because everybody, Yahoo and AltaVista, they all  did it. And it free, you're right, free naked sex, all of that was on top. For trending images,  One Direction, Selena and iPhone 5. For athletes, Jeremy Lin, Michael Phelps and Peyton Manning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For events, Sandy, Kate Middleton, Olympics. For people- Electronics is interesting that it's iPad

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  but then Samsung and iPad. Oh yeah, and iPad. Now the big thing, and I hope I'm not stealing  your numbers, is that your number? No, I knew better. You knew that's a story. 1.2 trillion  searches. How much bigger is that than previous years, Matt? You know, it grows quite a bit every

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  year and then lately we've seen mobile and mobile is growing at a phenomenal rate, like at the early  days of Google. And so you can see in maybe not next year, but in a year or two after that, we  might cross over and have more searches from mobile. So that's been a big driver of a lot of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  new searches. I would love to know the difference. For next year, Matt, I would love to know if you  separated out mobile searches from web searches, what that looks like. Yeah, you definitely see a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  lot more like local sort of stuff when you do the mobile searches, you know? And so there is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  distinct difference between those types of queries. It's also fun because you can go by country, you  can see what the top searches in those categories are in all these different countries. And of  course, Norway, the top searches are very different. Netflix is number one because they got Netflix.  So that's cool. But this is really fun. But now everybody's doing it. So Facebook has their 2012  and a special kind of a timeline. And so does Twitter. In fact, I think it was our friend Karen  Wickery who did the post on that. Let's see if I can do the Facebook one. I can't remember what was  it. Facebook.com. There's Karen's blog post. And they made a video too. And actually, they might  have had the most iconic image of the year, which is President Obama hugging his wife.  And that was his

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  scroll down on that page to Leo, you also see that they have things like the most retweeted tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, actually scroll down a little bit. Yeah.  Click the link there. So you see, you see golden tweets, go do the golden tweets,  because the number one tweet of the year is four more years on the at Barack Obama account with  that picture, which became, you know, famous. Justin Bieber, number two,  RIP Avalon, who was a young fan of his who passed away. We will skip over that one.  Sorry, I should have warned you.  No, I knew I've actually looked at this. There was an NFL, a profane NFL tweet that actually was  great. It was that I'll give find me NFL and I'll give them and pay and pay the referees so  they can come back, which I kind of liked. That was TJ, right? It's kind of fun to look at these.  And I think this is a smart marketing tool for all three of these companies. Facebook did something  a little different, though. Facebook made a timeline out of your stuff, which I think is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  kind of interesting. Well, Twitter did something similar. They did a partnership  with Visify and you could do your year on Twitter. Oh, OK. Yeah. Yeah. It's like the  tab all the way to the right at that golden tweet site. Do you want to do yours, Chad,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  or should I do mine? Let me do mine because we don't know what I've already done mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We don't know what Chad's been tweeting. Yeah, right. It shows you have to import in and have

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  you done yours yet? Oh, you have to import it in. Well, you better show yours because I haven't. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  so I did the whole thing. That's cute. So you get all sorts of stuff. It'll show like this is a  Christmas holiday thing. And this is like a net, you know what? You're a good tweet. These are words  that I've got. Look at that. We have a whole bunch of pages. So like, so what's the number one word

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  that you've tweeted? Can you tell? Show show like show shows huge show pic, but it's divided into

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  a it's a timeline. So it's over the months. Yeah. You'd also see I had an automated if this than  that thing, which posted new episodes of of my podcast. And so you can see these these trends  right here. But but what Gina's talking about is year on Twitter, which is the last one. And so  you can see my golden tweet, which was right after the SpaceX launch. What makes it golden?  Is it the most retweeted? The most retweeted. And this was retweeted 20 times. And then my  golden follower is actually the fellow who made the posters. Oh, man. Martin Martin, Martin Anderson.  And he's mentioned me 60 times this year. Thank you, Martin. Right. And then it sort of does that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  sort of words thing that was was before. But so where do I find that? I want to do that. Just head

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  on over to Visify and then you can you can log in with LinkedIn. You can log in. Oh, it is if you

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  go to 2012 dot twitter dot com. Perfect. It'll give you golden tweets pulse of the planet only  on Twitter trends, new voices, and then your year on Twitter. And so that's neat. Visify is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  a third party, right? Right. Right. And so it does a lot of things. So like here's here's four  square check ins on places that I've eaten. Dinner is my most recent check in. I go to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you could have done this, Gina. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Beautiful. Yeah. That's great. What's funny is  that, you know, the Twitter API only goes back three thousand tweets. So Anil, my partner, did this  and he like it went back to November. Oh, he's a heavy tweeter. Yeah, he's a heavy tweeter.  For me, I'm only at two thousand. So it got everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay, so it's just imported my my tweets. My golden tweet. Oh, is was while we're watching  the Mars landing, the first person who will walk on Mars is probably a high school student  watching this right now is the Curiosity landing retweeted nine hundred eighty six times.  And the TriCaster is my golden follower. Thank you, TriCaster. I say show a lot too, apparently.  This is cool. I don't know how many tweets does where do you find out how many tweets it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  synthesized here? Good question. I don't know if it's not really for, you know, settings and  really diving in to analyze. Right. It's more of a visual representation. So it may not give you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So if I click get more in for graphics, I know that makes me a Visify customer.  Right. Right. So that's that's their little plug. And my mind says, oh, tweetaholic. Twitter lets

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  us analyze your last thirty two hundred tweets so we can only go back to January 2012. So I guess  I guess it took me back to January, but not quite all the way. My golden tweet was a tweet about a  certain domain registrar. I tweeted about that as well. Yeah, he supported SOPA and kills elephants  and objectifies women. So that tweet went far, apparently. Not fond of him either. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So my golden tweet says every night millions of players sit down to play the addictive,  massively multi online player game called E-mail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is a good this is a measure of your wittiness. What is yours, Jeff? Might as well.  This is V-I-Z-I-F-Y, right? No, just go to 2012.twitter.com. Oh, OK. 2012.twitter.com.  And then the last one is your tweets. It does take a little while to import  all of that. And while we're doing that, let me see if I can find what is it? Facebook.com. Maybe  it's slash 2012. No, that's that's some guy got that. Jason Rubinstein. Well done.  He knew that that someday it would be valuable to have that nickname.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The spammers are instantly grabbing 2013. Yeah. Brilliant. I believe it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Facebook.com slash my hyphen year hyphen in hyphen status. You can look for it's easy to  remember. Super easy. Thanks, Facebook. Just you're on Facebook. You don't need the hyphens. No,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  this isn't it either. No, not it. No, no, no, no, no. I bookmarked it. Let me just check my

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  pin board because I was so excited. Maybe my golden is this debate needs a half time and

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  an angry coach in the locker room. That was the first debate probably you were saying somebody

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  needs to spank President Obama, I think. Yeah. I don't know how many it got for me because it  doesn't go back very far. I'll bet. Yeah. Considering that I'm a loud mouth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, so here it is. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, the Facebook blog doesn't have anything on it. I'm just Googling. Oh, here it is.  Facebook.com slash year in review. Year in review. And so you get the year in review and you can see  the trends, memes, events, most listened to songs, movies. They got a lot of signals. They got a lot  of signals. This would be very interesting. I mean, still not maybe as many as Google, but this would  be very interesting. What do you want? You want memes? What are the big memes in the US?  Number one, to be honest, TBH, Linsanity, Big Bird, SMH, Shaking My Head. So these are just like  phrases, I guess. Huh. All right. I'll show you my... So then you click this to see your 2012 year  in review. I don't know how it's doing this, but I have a feeling this will do well. So instead of  the year in review for everybody, who cares about that? We're a narcissistic generation. We want to  know what's number one with us. And so what they do is they take your timeline and you go back and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  through great moments in your year. Yeah. I mean, mine is just like, it's basically just like a  hodge of pictures of my daughter. Yeah. Like, yeah, that was my year. As it should be. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  As it should be. There's our Christmas card. There's me and my new boyfriend.  There's Sarah Lane, my ex-girlfriend. Here we are in Norway. Yeah, it's cool. That's cool. I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that this is kind of spring. Isn't that your timeline already anyway? It's just... Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it just seems like it's presented. I guess they surface the stuff that got the most responses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, probably the most thumbs up or something. Yeah. So it's kind of cool. I mean, it goes back

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  in chronological order. Yeah. Yeah. Mine is heavily my daughter and that was only like the  last couple of months, but I just got a lot of likes and stuff from a family. So that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, here's the first thing I posted in 2012. I had just gotten the car prepared. It was back.  It was all clean and nicely done. Oh, geez. Oh my goodness. I knew I'd get some use out of that  someday. That's cool. I think it's fun that Twitter, Facebook and following in Google's  footsteps, I think Google did it first. I'm just saying that because you're here, Matt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I appreciate that. I noticed that in December, a lot of the stories in the regular newspaper are  like, yes, here's the top 10 trends or whatever. And it's like, yeah, everybody's going on vacation

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  early. Yeah. No, we're going to do that. We do our best ofs. In fact, this would be a good time  to send you to twit.tv slash best of. And we're so lazy. We ask you to tell us what the best  moments were. We don't know. So go there and nominate your, we're going to do one for Twig,  right? Correct. Yeah. Nominate your best moments for Twig. What I always did was the year behind  and the year ahead. So like we do one day, Christmas week, you do the year, you know, 2012,  year in review. And then the next week you do looking ahead to 2013. Because what else are  you going to do? There's no news. Yeah. Nothing to talk about. I think I'm going to channel

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Dvorak right now. I hate those lists. I know. Well, everybody does. I'm sure the newspapers do,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  but what are you going to do? There's no news. The predictions are fun. I do like reading what

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  people predict about Apple's going to, you know, beat Microsoft or all those sorts of things.  It's, that's a lot of fun. That's what we should do. Yeah. We should. Yeah. Predictions are fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I also like best music of the year because I'm old and don't keep up with new music. So I rely  upon other people's lists of like best music of the year and be like, Oh, I missed this.  Although all of them have called me maybe at the, at the top. So I don't know. Yeah. Right on.  I'm looking at the wrong list. Right on. Great song. I'm actually surprised that call me maybe  isn't number one on Facebook. It's we are young is first. We are young. Yeah. And then somebody  used to know and then call me maybe. Well, also TBH. It's we are young that goes tonight. Yeah.  Yeah. That one. We are young. And TBH, which is to be honest, which I've, TBH haven't heard of  before this. Yeah. Beat out YOLO. What's up with that? YOLO is what is YOLO? You only live once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a thing. That's a thing. It's so much of a thing. It has a backlash already.  It does. You're kidding. No. Yeah. People are like, I hate people that say YOLO. And it's like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  okay, but you do only live once. So. Well, I like FOMO, fear of missing out, but I didn't know about  YOLO and oh no. So golly, I feel. So is that that means that that happened a lot in status updates?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That has to be what it means. Yeah. That those words occurred the most in status updates. The

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  biggest memes and apparently a dog with a collar on it. Yes. All right. Here's a challenge, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can we start a meme so next year it gets on the biggest memes list? Shouldn't be too hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If TBH got number one. Yeah, come on. I always liked POS. Oh, I see. POS stands for parents  over shoulder, by the way. Not what you think. YOLO, LOL, JK, I am a cat. Because they live

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  nine times, you know. Oh my God. These are all the YOLOs. Yeah. Yeah. Holy YOLO. Yeah. What does this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  is know your meme? Oh, right. This is yes. Know your meme. Thank God for know your meme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, seriously. I wouldn't know. So most listen to songs. You just said that. Okay. That's to  we are young. Somebody that I used to know. I liked that. Call me maybe. What makes you beautiful  by One Direction. I never even heard of One Direction until you are way too old. I guess so.  Well, it was the ads. It was the Pepsi ad that the payphone by Maroon 5 Kanye Westmore. And look at  though how big compared to the other ones. We are young is got a big wedge. I love this stuff.  Okay. You want to guess what movie or is movies? Hunger Games. Hunger Games. Right. Avengers was  number two magic Mike. You know, I was shocked. It got on the New Yorkers top 10 movie lists of  the year. What for the ads? I mean, what? I think it was for the abs. I think it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know if that's if it's Twilight or that is more depressing. What's what's more depressing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So on Netflix, I've just started rewatching my favorite movies. So Idiocracy, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Office Space. Good movie. You're a Mike Judge fan is you're just with the Mike Judge Film Festival.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Instead of doing the new stuff, you're just like, well, why not just go back and watch

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  a classic Princess Pride, LA Story. That's good. All right. So there you go. The year is over.  And so is this year in review. Thank you very much. I want to talk about your op ed  about privacy, Gina, in just a little bit. Okay. And also Marissa Meyer starting to make her  presence felt at Yahoo already some big upgrades. In fact, the biggest upgrade that everybody  thought should be upgraded might be the one to talk about flicker. And then we'll ask Matt Cuts  where that $10 billion is. He knows what I'm talking about. It's in Bermuda.  I don't know if I can get angry about that, frankly. I mean, if I had $10 billion to hide

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  in a tax haven, I would hide it. I can join in on that conversation too, because the UK is just  being, I think, ridiculous in demanding that you basically volunteer money when the problem is the

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  law. Right. Please give us some money. Because just to be a nice person. But we will be back.  Google and Apple teaming up finally. It's about time. Yeah. Peace in the kingdom. Peace in the  kingdom. Lying down together. But first a word from Ford and the fabulous Ford autonomous vehicle  program. Because that's what it's starting to look like. Google may have actual autonomous vehicles  with hundreds of thousands of miles on the road. But look what Ford's doing. Sneaky, these guys.  I'm going to talk to Alan Mulally, CEO of Ford at CES again this year. And I'm going to put him on  the spot and say, Alan, every year I say, are you working on autonomous vehicles? And every year,  Ford says, Alan says, Leo, people love to drive. But I'll tell you what I learned in my many years  at Boeing designing cockpits for planes like the 777. That you need a pilot. You need a guy  at the wheel or the yoke or the joystick. But you can have these systems, these autonomous systems,  help them be better. And that's exactly what Ford is doing with things like, I've talked about the  adaptive cruise control. And we talked about the lane assist. Now what about bliss? This is something  really cool. The blind spot information system, BLIS. Watch this. Sensors in the vehicle's rear  quarter panels are scanning blind spots in traffic. If another vehicle is in your blind spot,  you'll see audible and visual alerts. So you know, you know this thing where you can see them,  but then they disappear for a while in the mirror. It also enables a feature called the cross traffic  alert that warns you of oncoming traffic when you're backing out of a parking space. And I had that  the other day and it was so cool. I had two big, you need it nowadays with trucks and SUVs. Everybody's  got giant cars and I'm driving the Fusion and I'm backing up and it says, there's somebody coming.  You can't see him. It looks around the corner and knows when there's oncoming traffic. Even when you  can't see, it can. Awesome. Just a great tool. Now I've also used the active park assist. Now this  did not work out so well for me, but it's not Ford's fault. It was my fault. So the idea,  why is it so that you have the video checked? Because it's really cool. So you're driving along  and you want to park. You press a button. I was in a Ford Flex. We did this on the test track. I think  they kind of knew Leo was an idiot. And you press a button and as you drive along and it measures the  spaces as you drive by them. And when you go by a space that's big enough, it says, I see a spot,  literally. And then space found. Then it says, pull forward. You pull forward. You'd press the  button to do the active park assist. Now here's the thing. Keep your feet on the brake and the  accelerator like it says to. I just lifted my hands and feet off the wheel. Now this does do  everything, right? But the car is still in gear. So I parked, I thought, wow, that's amazing. And  then I kept my foot on the accelerator and backed in the car behind me. There were a bunch of  engineers in the car behind me laughing uproariously. It was so embarrassing. But it is amazing.  The truth is, my mind was blown. What did you do? Hit a Chevrolet? Yeah, no. It was a Fiesta or  something. They had it on the test track. What they did, they set the whole thing. It was so cool.  It was amazing because you push the button and the wheel starts going zzzzzzz. And you know how hard  it is to parallel park? You're supposed to look and you would do the thing and it's all geometry.  It does it. And it parks itself. It is the first experience I ever had of a car driving itself.  And I think I was just so flabbergasted. It was amazing. It's really, really cool. Have you  ridden in the Google autonomous car? You must have, Matt. I have not. You know, I threw a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  coincidence and a strange bad luck. I've had two or three chances and each time I'm like, oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm the last guy in the line. Oh, I'd love to do that. Well, next best thing, the 2013 Ford Fusion  and the 2013 Ford Taurus, both of which have available bliss and active park assist. You  could find out more and look at the videos and all that stuff for dot com slash technology. It is  really, really neat stuff. And yeah, I'm happy to say that I will be interviewing Alan Mulally and  Paul Macarena. Alan, of course, CEO of Ford. Paul is the CTO of Ford at CES this year. We'll get  those interviews up on the network too. So in fact, if you've got questions you'd like to ask,  I'd love to hear them. And I'll be on the Ford stage. I think that's the first day of CES,  Tuesday. Thanks to the folks at Stitcher who are setting this all up for us. And thanks to Ford for  their support of this week in Google. So Gina, is this your first time writing for the New York  Times? It is. It is. Cool. Yeah, thank you. So this is in the room for debate section of the  opinion pages. And it was about privacy. And so there were a bunch of people. There's Ed Felton  from Princeton, somebody from Pinboard, from the Cato Institute, from the EFF, of Vivian Redding,  we've talked about before. Vivian Redding, yeah. Yeah, she's on the ECs, the European Commission,  and has been very, she's the one who wants the right to be forgotten, right? Right to be forgotten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She has the four principles, four pillars of privacy that I've gone on about the show. So she

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  would be the privacy hawk in there. So what did you say, Gina, in there? Well, the question was

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  about whether or not when we use apps, we should just face the fact that we're relinquishing our  privacy, right? And the question was hooked on this new FTC study, a report that just came out  this week that basically showed that alarming percentages of apps, like 60% of apps that children  use, this is actually a report about children's apps, secretly transmit data about usage data  without letting parents know, without user consent. So things like telephone number, device ID,  tracking information for apps or games, say, for example, that have advertising in them,  that transmit information about usage across various apps. So this FTC report comes out,  it sounds like lots of apps in the Google Play Store and the iTunes Store are transmitting  information without consent, questioning whether or not that this violates ACAPA,  which is the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. And then The Times kind of rolled this up  and said, well, children or adults, no matter what, web or mobile, should we just face the  fact that we just don't have, you know, you were relinquishing our privacy just by using technology?  Which, of course, is a totally loaded question and like a terrible way to frame it. It's not a binary  thing, right? So I wrote a piece, it's just a sort of a mini op-ed, but what I was saying, and I was  trying to channel Jarvis here, especially in the second graph, but I was saying that, you know,  that basically the sharing information isn't necessarily relinquishing your privacy,  that it's not a black and white thing, right? And that sharing kinds of information, we share  information when we use our credit card in a restaurant, when we use the EZPath at the toll  booth, that was sort of a Northeast reference, and that we share information in order to partake in  this kind of speed and convenience to certain services, and that the problem isn't the sharing  of information or the data transmission, the problem is the secretiveness. And this is an argument  that I've made here on the show a bunch of times, is that apps should disclose what kind of information  they're gathering, collecting, transmitting, why and why they need that information. So I talked  about how Path earlier this year, that a developer outed Path for transmitting people's address books,  the contents of their address book from their iPhone and storing it on their servers on their  side without letting users know. And that, you know, there was an uproar, people pointed out they  were doing this, and it kind of came out that this was kind of a standard thing that a lot of  different iOS apps did. And in response to the uproar, Path changed the behavior of the app and  asked for permission with the ability to opt out, and Apple added an address book permissions  prompt into iOS 6. And I think that this is how we're evolving at the moment, right? Like,  we're still really early in the kind of smartphone plot, particularly with smartphones,  era, and I think we need to figure out, you know, what kind of behaviors are okay, what's the best  user experience for these permissions. We've talked about on the show here, we don't want to  recreate Windows Vista, you know, where every single thing that you do, you get a permissions  prompt, but there's a happy medium. So that was kind of the gist of my take on it, that, you know,  I'm an app developer and I'm a mom and I'm concerned about privacy, but I also understand,  you know, that sharing information makes for better experiences.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really, really well done, Gina. Yeah, I agree. I'm tough on privacy things, but I couldn't have  said it better myself, and which I hope is a compliment. And, you know, the beauty of it was  that, yes, you share the concerns, you endorse working in ways to preserve our privacy in those  concerns, but you also just are plain out rational and say that this stuff has a good end to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I put out like Google's dashboard, which lists all your products with all the data that  it stores and kind of like how we want to encourage that kind of transparency about what apps are  storing, why they're storing it. And I use the example, you know, and I don't know if this is  still true Pandora, but there was a point at which I installed Pandora on my phone and it asked for  access to my address book. And I was just like, I couldn't fathom. Why would you need that? Yeah.  Streaming app need access to my address book. And it turns out that they just haven't ever share  this playlist with your contacts function. But I didn't know that. I couldn't tell that. And it  made me suspicious. And I actually think that you should have a healthy skepticism about it.  I think you should question why do you need access to this or that? And I think our permissions  models could be a little better. In the case of Pandora, for example, the app's not going to work  if it can't access the internet connection. And that's obvious, right? The music streaming app,  it needs the internet connection. But the app should be able to work maybe without that easily  share my playlist. I mean, users should be able to sort of selectively opt out of certain of certain  of giving apps certain permissions. So I actually think and I didn't say this in the piece, I think  Android's a lot farther along with this. And it kind of always has been than iOS. Androids always  had sort of a list of detailed permissions that every app needs. If you look at any app in the  Play Store, you can see that. And Google in general, I think has been. I'm not trying to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  kiss up because Matt's here. I'll go the extra mile and actually give some kudos to Windows Phone  8 because they have, I think, a kid's corner feature where you can say, OK, designate apps  that are safe for your kid. And then it's I think I haven't used Windows Phone 8, but it's like locked  down so you can give it to the child and know that they're only going to be using the apps that you  said are OK. And that seems like another great way to you know, you don't want a kid randomly  pressing the buttons on your phone anyway. And so, you know, there's a lot of different ways you  could try to think about putting the power in the hands of the parents and then trusting the parents

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to do what they think is best. Well, but the problem with some of the like,  cop legislation is that what it says is that the parent, if let's say the educational app wants to  do geography and starting from the town where you live, the parent is required to fax, scan,  or video call with the company to allow that. And, you know, what happens is you're not going to do  that, whereas that's a very simple thing. The parent knows what's going on. The control is local

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and it changes it around, makes it easier. Yeah, I mean, it's a huge challenge to get this  permissions thing right. I mean, I worry about this stuff. I think about this stuff and I blow  through the like, yeah, allow next, next, next screens myself during, you know, when I'm installing  apps. I think part of it is the onus is on companies and app developers to explain what's  happening in very brief, very clear language, but also the onus is on the user to kind of look and  see what does this need access to and then accepting. So we have to write better terms  of service and privacy policies. You know, they can't be these, these long tomes and legalese.  They have to be clear and brief. But at the same time, like I, you know, I want to teach my kid  and hopefully things will be a lot farther along by the time she starts using these new platforms.  You know, to think about the difference between, you know, I think there's like a spectrum of  sharing information, right? There's like sharing your email address. That's one thing. Sharing  photos is another thing. Sharing your location is another thing. And then they're sharing your  social security number. You know, and that's a huge spectrum, you know, from one end to another,  under very few circumstances has she ever shared her social security number, for example.  But under many, she would share an email address. So I hope that, that I think that the experiences  for these things will get better. It's a challenge though. It's a UX challenge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yep. This is actually, I recommend people read the entire section and all the different debaters.  Some nice viewpoints. I mean, Gina, you're certainly the kind of the moderate in the bunch.  You got Vivian Redding saying it's all up to the good laws. And then, you know, I almost,  I hate to admit it, but agree with Jim Harper of the Cato Institute, who says, just get over it.  And then his coda is that the children who take the lead in the information society will be the  ones who learn from a young age how to live in it. It's that moral panic again. What about

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the children? Exactly. Exactly. It's the effort to regulate the technology rather than the use  rather than the behavior. I spoke at LexisNexis last week when I was down in Florida. And,  you know, this is the side of it that uses data for things like insurance and risk and all that.  One thing they said that I had no idea is that there's a national death registry.  And there's an effort to stop any use of that. You're dead. The fact that you're dead is not  privacy anymore. Right? But that's how far this has gone now. No, no, no, no, no, you can't know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there are some interesting loopholes, though. So there's an actual file that's when you die,  you can buy a file from the government that lists what your social security number was.  And that by itself might not be private. But by looking at when people die and what their social  security number was, things were sort of allocated in sequential order. And so you're able to guess  the social security number of people who are alive. And I can neither confirm nor deny that I  like have went around and found a copy of that file just to play with it and see what sort of  stuff you could do. But it's pretty fascinating how sometimes you have unintended consequences.  But I completely agree with your larger point, Jeff, that people often get a little too worried  about it. You know, it's almost like there's an industry, as you've said, to sort of make

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  privacy scarce a thing. And now it's not just technology. It is. And you had the book last week.  The notion of big data, Rick Smolin's book, which is very, very good, very, very huge,  but the phrase big data has become so has become as freighted as anything with this fear,  the techno panic. Yeah. And I think we got to get off that. It's not it's knowledge, right?  At some point, it's merely knowledge. And I was at something I was at an economist event,  and I'm growling and tweeted that when books came out, that was big data.  Right. Oh, my God, look at all this stuff. It was big data. It's just knowledge. That's all it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yahoo has upgraded Flickr for iOS. Flickr for Android was updated similarly a couple of months  ago. Yahoo Mail has been significantly updated. It looks like Marissa Meyer is starting to get a,  you know, get some traction over at Yahoo. Any thoughts on the new Yahoo Mail?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You going to switch your mail to Yahoo? No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I actually I have family members who use Yahoo Mail as their email address. I'm going to ask  about this about the app. I've been using Flickr actually quite a bit since my daughter was born  just because I really like the tool and I kind of spreading the love across different service  providers. So I'm really excited about this iPhone app upgrade. I mean, honestly, Flickr has been  kind of in my community really just been like this tumbleweed blowing through. It just hasn't  been a lot of people there. But I like the way that you can set up guest passes and that there's  friends and family sharing. Kind of there's some I like the privacy settings and Flickr. But the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  iPhone app update is amazing. It's awesome. Do you think that part of her strategy versus  strategy was knowing how much geeks respect Flickr and care about it and didn't like the  fact that it was orphaned, that it was a smart place to go? Or was it her Instagram?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I think so what was it was like dearmarissameyer.com was like the first  kind of website when she got hired CEO was like, please save Flickr. And then she I think for one  of the first things she did was was give was was assigned a few employees to the to the Flickr team.  So yeah, I mean, I think this is I mean, I like to think that she just knows that this is a beloved  app that's sort of gotten dusty over the years and watching what happened with Instagram. And  interestingly, Flickr also just added support for Twitter cards in this update, right? So as  Instagram pulls back and says, No, you can't, you know, embed our photos into Twitter, Flickr is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  going the other way and saying yes, so did Pinterest Pinterest just did the same thing.  So they're stepping in where where angels fear to tread. But my inbox was overrun today with

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  contact requests from Flickr because there's a Find My Friends function. It was app that uses  your Twitter contacts and your Facebook. So So I wonder if there was some conversation between  Flickr and Twitter where Twitter is like, look, if you enable cards, we'll let you you know,  access our social graph, or if there was no conversation at all. And and and hopefully,  you know, hopefully, we won't see the story where Twitter says, well, we're just going to we're  going to cut off the social graph access. But hopefully, that won't happen.  Go ahead.  I was gonna say just go the other way from from Instagram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The mail thing is interesting, because I got enraged a couple years ago, I had a Yahoo account,  and then they just killed it. And there was stuff in there. Yeah, I hadn't used it. Sorry,  because it wasn't very good. It was dusty. It was dead. And I complained about that, as I tend to do  on Twitter and lots of other people complain about the same thing. And to this day, I wrote  a blog post about it. I still get somebody comes in cursing Yahoo mail. Well, all right, let's  assume Marissa is going to get over that kind of idiocy. And I she has real vision, you know,  we talked about the show about the hyper personal news stream, the idea of services and tools and  mail, I'm going to bet that maybe not this version, but the long run, she's going to do a  spectacular job with it. But I just keep on thinking that that the horses left the barn is

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  over the horizon. Well, that's the problem. I mean, I have a Yahoo mail account, but I'm not  going to switch to it because I've already invested in Gmail, right? So invested to the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  point of hundreds of dollars, right? You know, and there's this this tweet by Ryan Sarver, who's the  director of platform at Twitter who says, I know X Flicker people everywhere are cursing today.  That's the app we always wanted to write a ship. Right. So, you know, it's so in some sense of  Marissa is letting the core engineers get to the guts of what they've always wanted to do and  freeing up the resources to do that. I've always been bullish on Marissa, you know, at Yahoo. And  I think, you know, if this is part of her first initiatives, I think it's a great first step to

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  be taken. So you're never going to tell me the truth on this. But is there what is I'm going to  ask anyway, you all rooting for Marissa? I mean, are people looking across town and going you go,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  girl, or what? I mean, you obviously know her well. Yeah, I would say I would, you know, I can't speak  for Google as a whole. But I would say the people that I know are rooting for Marissa, in part because  everybody at Google knows it's in our enlightened self interest to have strong competition.  And so if we have, you know, Flickr and Instagram and Snapseed on Google side and people are all,  you know, competing, then the company that's the most proprietary, the most closed, you know,  the least letting you have your data. Who would that be, Matt?  Just in general doesn't treat you well, for whatever reason doesn't let you have the best  filters or whatever. You know, so I think that's what's good for users. And that's going to  force everybody else to do a good job and compete on the merits. And that's exactly what

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  what we should want. And I think you're right, Gina, everybody's rooting for Flickr because  we all love Flickr, right? We all that was the first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Such a great point. I know people in our community are kind of felt icky about the Facebook acquisition  and Instagram. So I'm hoping that this is the like every all of my friends go back to using  Flickr. I hope this is the tipping thing. I have a Flickr pro account. I still have it.  I renew it every year. It's like 25 bucks totally worth it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I let mine lapse for the first time in years. And I'm not alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've gone to automatic upload on my devices now. And so I'm using Google plus photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, what's interesting about automatic upload is Facebook's doing it now too. Did you  notice that? Yeah, just turned it on. So now on my iPhone, for instance, every picture I take is  uploaded to Apple, Facebook and Google. And we're worried about privacy. You didn't start up  Dropbox? Oh, yeah, Dropbox. I forgot Dropbox too. It's like the least I will never lose a picture.  Redundant cloud backup. I don't think the Flickr app on  Android doesn't have that feature yet. But I wouldn't I wouldn't be surprised if they turned  it on. Let's see filters as well. They have filters. Yeah.  I'm so sick of filters. No, but I think it's consensus is that filters are what made Instagram  succeed, right? Yeah, that's because you feel like an artist with every picture you take. However,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  crappy. The journalists get very haughty about it. Oh, you must have used filters. No, no, no,  it's not that that you're you're you're faking news and history. Oh, in the record. I don't think a

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  sepia tone is ruining the record. But maybe here. I don't know. Let's play. I don't trust my cell

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  phone camera to have the perfect representation of lighting and I agree. I agree. So this is this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  the Flickr app on Android, which I think is actually they predated the Flickr app. We don't  have that over the shoulder. I do. But it's way over there. Why don't the cameras get moved? It

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  was moved for all about Android. Okay, here we go. I'm gonna reach over. Thanks. Thanks for doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  that. This is this is the new stretch. So it does very have that kind of Instagram feel with the  filters down here. But the filters are named after cities. So there's Tokyo, New York City's in black  and white. Gina, you want to explain that? Or actually, Jeff is the Alan. Yeah, Woody Allen,  it's the Woody Allen filter. She doesn't seem to be doing anything. Oh, there it is. And Berlin,  what is Berlin? You know, this is a lot slower than Instagram, they're gonna have to work on that.  I'm getting phone in me again, Leo. Yeah, isn't that big phone? Boy, did you notice how big my

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  phone is? I almost bought one last week and I'm so big. You know, they're not named after cities on

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  iOS. Oh, that's interesting. What are they named after? They're named after animals. Panda, mammoth,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  chameleon, wallaby, iguana. I like that makes any sense at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Toucan. Toucan. Well, Panda turned it black and white. That would make sense. Yeah, no, Panda must

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  turn it black and white. Toucan must turn it into a rainbow of colors. Yes, Panda is black and white

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  as is wallaby and narwhal. On the filters talk, I didn't put this in the doc, but Snapseed was  re-released by Google for Android and iOS for free. Oh, yeah. I just downloaded it on all three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But again, you'd think, well, why don't you just integrate that into the Google Plus app?  Well, so you can share and it's on Twitter has Aviary now in its app, right? So Aviary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They didn't say it came from Google. They said it came from Nick's software when you downloaded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Good. Thank God they're keeping it alive. I hope they keep the desktop plugins alive. That's,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that was my biggest concern. You use those? Yeah. My wife is hooked on them. She's been playing with  the HDR mode and a lot of the different stuff. Like, you know, these guys have been around for  a long time. And yeah, if you haven't played with Snapseed, I can actually see Jeff's point about,  you know, history and whether you're doing it accurately, because you can very easily click  on a seed point of the sky and make it more or less blue and like change the gradient very quickly.  And you're like, well, you would never know that that was not the real sky, but it just looks more  dramatic. And so I can actually see where there'd be some concern about, you know, is that what was  really happening or did you filter it up a little bit? But I think those of us, and I'm sure your

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  wife too, who know Nick, love Snapseed. It's not, it's, but it's an app. And then Nick makes these  desktop plugins for Aputure and Lightroom that are spectacular. And we would all just suffer  without. So I do hope Google does what they can to keep HDR effects and color effects and  Viveza and silver effects and sharpener and define it alive. I'll keep lobbying. Would you please?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's great software. Yeah. You want that to be available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. And it's, you know, it's pretty obvious Google bought it for Snapseed.  So that's what worries. I think it's where it worries a lot of pros. It's like,  of course, if they open sourced all that stuff, that wouldn't be so bad.  That would be pretty cool. That'd be really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Make it like when we bought the video codec and made that open source.  WebM. Yeah.  Yeah. But I don't know what the plans are. So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you're not speaking for Google. You need to have a lower third format that just pops up  and says, I'm not speaking for Google. You can save yourself the effort.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. Please don't fire me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So Larry Page did an interview with Miguel Helft at Fortune. He does speak for Google.  And we'll talk about that in a minute. But I think this would be a good time for the change log.  We don't want to get through the whole show like we did that other time and not have the trumpets.  So if you will.  The Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So easily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Gina Tufani has the newest new stuff on Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The big launch was actually last week after we did the show last week was Google Plus communities.  Do you have you guys played with this?  Yeah.  It's a way to set up a group of Google Plus users around the around the topic.  So you could have a twig community, you can have a photography community or a food community.  And so you probably both of you or all three of you probably got inundated with invites to all  sorts of communities. And I'm actually still playing around with this, but you can join a  community and you could do posts on a certain topic just to people in that community and they're  public and private. And you can sort of have conversations about particular topics that you  like. I think I've joined. Is there a twig community? I think there is.  Yes, there is.  There is. I have to join. And yeah, it's pretty cool. Have you guys played around with it?  Are there any communities that are really happened that we should join?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, there's this is Sparta Mike Elkins community for people who love Greece.  Yeah. So I did this as twit because I said, well, what the hell. And actually, Jeff,  you were asking whether we should do a twig community. I think what I'm going to do with  twit is we'll have a twit community. I also have a tech guy community, but we'll let each show  create its own community. Why not? Right. So there should be a twig community. And I don't,  I won't keep hands off if you want to do it. Go ahead. But what's nice is you can add moderators.  So for instance, the twit community, pretty much everybody who wants to, including I think you guys

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  are our moderators there. I don't know if I got elevated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, well, it's a pain to elevate because you have to go through members. And now we already have  1640 members. So I have to go through them one by one and, and add moderators. But most of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  hosts are moderators. Chad, should you start the group?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Twig group? I think Jeff should. It doesn't matter. It just whoever owns it. All right,  I'll start it. That way you can never be fired. Aha. You have the keys to the group. It's just  like being a professor. I have tenure. Tenure to Jeff Javas. I, I, my reaction,  and then we'll go on with changelog, but just my reaction to Google Plus communities is this is  this Google Plus was kind of dribbling off. None of my friends were there and a lot of photographers.  I mean, there's activity there, but it wasn't, to me, it wasn't gripping the road. Google Plus  communities is awesome. And maybe exactly the feature to me that could try and turn around  Google Plus and make it a really valuable place as Google groups, which I used for a long time,  have kind of gotten less interesting. This community takes over. Yeah, considering changing a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google group that I run to a community. Is that easier? Can you desert a way to transfer it over?  Probably not. I don't believe there's a way to migrate. And I was thinking about just starting

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  fresh and saying, everyone, hey, just do this. I get you've got, you've got invitation, you know,  events is built into it. It's got the ability to have different, you know, discussion groups  within the group itself. The notifications, of course, are perfection. This is a selfie group.  I think I'll join that. Anything itself I'm all about. There's an internal group at Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  dedicated to Tesla. And I joined that and it's incredibly addictive. And I'm like, must not buy  Tesla. Yeah, that's the upshot of that. Yeah, this is an expensive community. So it looks like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  inside the This Is Twit group, there are discussions set up for each show. I set up some discussions,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  but oh, I guess, oh, really, they put it, oh, they did. Somebody made discussions for the shows.  Interesting. Right now. So but I think each show should have its own discussion because otherwise  this will get unwieldy fast. And that is the one negative on Google groups, a very, very active

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  group would kind of swamp you with content. Chad, can you send me a larger version of our logo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, get on that. Yes, I don't have it here. So it'll whatever. Yeah, what I did with

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  the team tech guys use the album art, which is probably the most recognizable graphic  to go with a community. What's the do you know what the biggest community is right now? Do we know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We can't sort by size. So maybe photography, I'm not sure. I wouldn't be surprised.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I wouldn't be surprised. Well, 16,000 makers, hackers, artists and engineers, 19,000 space.  There's some big communities 12,000 Star Wars members. So there's some big communities. This  is I think, to me, this might, it's funny, because it's so social is so interesting.  You could just the one right feature could flip the whole thing on its head. And the one wrong

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  feature as my space learn can kill you. Well, in the Larry Page interview, I think I think it was  in there that it was the first time I've heard Larry and Eric kind of position themselves against  Facebook. Yeah, we'll get to that. But let's continue with we're not we're not. Let's get Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  let's continue with the change. Because I don't want to get sidetracked. But I did want to talk

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  about communities because I think it's big. Yeah, no, it's a huge story. It's really, really the  biggest launch of the week. Oh, yeah. A few a few other little things. Well, we talked about the  YouTube resign earlier with with Lamar. Google Apps, a change to Google Apps, no longer available  for free. So so there used to be a free sign up for individuals. Now it's the business version  only. So so people who already have a free Google Apps account, those they will continue, but there  are just no new new member sign up. So that for the for the free package. So basically, you have  to sign up for a business account, which I believe is $50 per user per year, includes phone support  and and all that other stuff. I'm a huge I'm a big Google Apps user. One of the reasons why I really  like Google Apps is you can associate your domain name with it. So if I you know, if I wanted to  change email providers, if by some, you know, if I had some crazy day where I want to switch to Yahoo  Mail or some other email provider, I could do that because my email address doesn't change.  But I guess, Matt, it looks like you added a link in here. There's a there's a little hack to still  sign up for Google Apps. Oh, click. Tell me how on it's on digital inspiration. It looks like you  have to sign up with App Engine. I actually haven't tried this out. But if it's an labnull.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is one of these things where I hope it's not a firing Matt occasion. But so  but so as I understand it, Google App Engine needs to authenticate. So if you want to run your your  app on, you know, on some other domain or something like that, you actually right now need to  authenticate using Google Apps. And so if they were charging for Google Apps, then you wouldn't  be able to use Google App Engine on some other domain for free. And so there's this write up that  basically talks about if you go in via Google App Engine, because it actually checks your referrer,  then you can still sign up. Now you don't get 10 people for free. I think you get one  account on a domain for free. I actually hadn't set it up on any of my Google Apps on any of my  domains because I usually just use a Gmail for my personal stuff. But I I tried it and as of like  Sunday, it worked. I don't know whether it'll stay up. I don't know if eventually App Engine will say,  okay, you don't have to authenticate with Google Apps. So if you do want to try this, you might want  to try it right now. I don't know what the lifespan will be on this particular method.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, you know, I should say as a Google Apps user forever, you know, there are times when Google  Apps users don't get features as quickly as regular kind of vanilla Google account users.  And there's plenty of ways if you just want a custom email address, like there are plenty  of ways to do that with regular Gmail. You don't need a Google Apps account to set your, you know,  you're from your your sent address or or to get your mail from another provider. I mean,  Gmail has tons of those tools built in and just, you know, your free Google account. So  it's not it's not not that big a big a deal, but something to something to note.  Let's see. What else do we have? Oh, Google launched the new Chrome extension called  Save to Drive. It makes it easy to save an image or page or web page, HTML or Web Archive, which is a  dot MHT file. That was a new one on me to to to Google Drive. So you install the extension,  you can right click and you can save things directly to Drive and a couple of new ways to  work with images as well. You can zoom by scrolling or you can leave a comment about a specific part  of an image that you've saved in Drive or leave comments on the side. Pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gina, question on Drive. Quick question, because I'm an idiot. There's no folders or tags there,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  is there? In Drive itself? In Drive itself? Yeah, there are folders. There are folders in Drive.  No tags. No tags. No, no tags. Correct me if I'm wrong, Matt. I'm pretty sure that they're just

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  folders. That's a really good question. I think that it's just folders. It's kind of like in Gmail,  you can have labels so you can recreate both folders and tags. The impression I have is that  in Drive, it's usually going on a folder model rather than a tag model. I was getting the like  the Evernote model with tags. That's good feedback. I'll actually pass that on to the people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the great thing about having Matt on the show. Like a broadcast news moment. It goes from  my mouth into his ear into the computers around the world. It's a great thing. Well, and you were

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  talking about your Chromebook and losing some data from Evernote because of the way Evernote  wasn't like locally saving or wasn't refreshing data. And so that's like one of those things  where it's like, okay, is there stuff we can do to like help make that a little bit better? So  that's good feedback. You know, tags would be helpful there. Yeah, I think I've been in connection

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  with Rick Byer. Rick, somebody from the Chrome team who was great. He reached out to me and I made  some suggestions and he put in some bug reports and I'm still using it. Yay. Did you see some of  them are dropping down to $99? Well, for schools through DonorsChoose. DonorsChoose is a great  organization where teachers can come in and ask for things. And so until I think December 20 something,  you could go find a school, find a teacher who wants it and you can pay the index and get a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Chromebook into a school. So a hundred dollar laptop. Didn't mean to hijack the- No, no, no,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it's great. It's great. It's huge. I have one last change log item and this is something Jeff found.  This is pretty interesting. The Google's search results, it's called the knowledge graph, right?  That sidebar now lists side effects and information about drugs. So if you search for say,  acetaminophen in Google, you'll get one of those panels on the right side. Oh, that's great.  Yeah, it's fantastic. And actually not only side effects, lots of different information about

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  whether or not to- My heart drug is RIVMAL. And if you look at that, you'll find that it's a really

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  useful list of things. And be careful with acetaminophen because it'll kill you.  And that's all I got. Another story for another day. No, it's easy to overdose on acetaminophen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it's in a lot of stuff. It probably says that right there. It's very, very, I think they should

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  ban it. But anyway, and I just signed up for a Google app for free. So that's cool.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  She wanted to do it before they turned that back door off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Get grandfathered in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It looks like that search trick works if you search for the brand as well. So if you search  for Tylenol, it'll give you the information about acetaminophen. If you search for Advil, you get the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what I just did. Yeah. You can see it was only Tylenol.  Yep. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. And the possible side effects lists are lovely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Actually, I know a young woman who died from acetaminophen overdose. It's very easy to do.  It was accidental overdose because it's in a lot of stuff that you don't know.  And it has a very low toxic toxicity. So don't mess with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  On that note-

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Bad for your liver. Seriously, I don't know why it's- Well, that's another-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's sad. And that's your change log and Tylenol warning.  Moving along, Larry Page sat down last month with Miguel. It's Page's only, Page's second  big interview since his ascendancy to CEO, 70-minute conversation.  And do you guys want to pick out some highlights on here?  There's some good stuff in there.  They asked, what else would you change in a world with self-driving cars?  Would we not have streetlights? Would the cities be different? Do you have a vision for what could happen?  This is hard to predict. I think you know one of the issues we face here is parking.  The cost for a parking structure is about $40,000 of space. Google's actually faced with this, right?  It's all concrete and steel. Do you really want to use all your concrete and steel to build a  parking lot? Seems pretty stupid. If we had automated cars or even some fraction of them,  we'd save hundreds of millions of dollars on parking garages.  Just at Google.  Just at Google. That's kind of amazing. When things, when you get to scale, things change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He had one part that was pretty good about one of his challenges is to try to keep people thinking  about how do you think big? How do you be ambitious? That's something he cares about is  what are the big, hairy, ambitious goals that Google should be tackling in the next year or  the next five years? I think the way that he said it in the past is the easiest thing to do when  you come in in the morning is the thing that you did yesterday. But that's not always the best thing  that you should do for the company or for the world. That sticks in your mind a little bit.  Instead of just getting locked into blinders of I'm going to do things this way or I'm going to do  things that way. How do you come at it and try to come up with a different approach or something  more ambitious? Because his point is always that people don't try the ambitious stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He talks about competition and Miguel to his credit just will not let it go.  Miguel starts in the old rule of desktop search, your main competitors at the time were Yahoo and  Microsoft. Is the competition now something totally different? Is it Siri? Is it Amazon  for commercial queries? Larry says, I don't really think about it that way. Because you  don't think about the competition? Obviously, we think about the competition to some extent,  but I feel my job is mostly getting people not to think about our competition, which I think is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the right thing. Yeah, the question is, what would an ideal search engine do? Or if you had all this  technology, what would you do? Not just like, right, the last person do? What is your competitor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The last thing you should do is be reactive in that way. He says, Apple's still a partner.  It's this is Miguel. It's a competitor. You and Steve Jobs are friendly. Larry says at times,  I like that. You said he said something about it for the first time that both Eric and Larry  kind of admitted to competing with Facebook. Jeff? No, that was in other things, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or maybe it was Larry's, but I think I've seen that. Yeah. He says, we talked to Apple. We have

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  a big search relationship with Apple and so on. So we talked to them and so on. He says that Google  Plus is a big bet. Actually, Miguel said that and he agreed. I think it's gone pretty well. I'm  pretty happy if users of Plus are happy and the numbers are growing because that means we're on  to something. We've got a huge team actually in this building. If you walk around, you see everyone's  excited and running around and working hard on it. Well, that's nice. He said he's never satisfied.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's his personality and his job. Shouldn't be. That's the difference between me and Larry Page

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  because I'm completely satisfied. I'm very happy. He's a content man. Yeah, I'm content.  It's a worthwhile interview. I'm not sure. Any good CEO, actually Larry did this very well.  Any good CEO is not going to say anything of material, but he gave the impression of saying  things that were material without actually saying anything of material. That's actually,  that's A plus because usually they say, well, I can't talk about that. I'm not going to tell you  that. He seemed like he was really being candid. For instance, Miguel says, how long do you see  yourself as being CEO? Last question. I don't know. It seems impossible to predict. Like I said,  I'm motivated to make Google into something even more amazing. We have a tremendous positive impact  on the world ultimately. He completely deflects. We're still number one. We're still 1% to where  we should be. I'm sorry. I feel a deep sense of responsibility to try to move things along.  Not enough people are focused on big change. Part of what I'm trying to do is take Google as a case  study and really scale our ambition such that we are able to cause more positive change in the world  and more technological change. I have a deep feeling we're not even close to where we should be.  I like that. That's a technologist talking. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Larry is pretty consistent on that. He's trying to get people to think bigger.  I really feel like he views Google as a platform by which to make the world a better place and  have a technological impact. He's looking at the world of possibility and asking, why aren't we  doing all these different things? Then how do we get to where we have the people and the resources  and the ability to do those things rather than, okay, how do we make the most money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's really amazing, Matt, because you're right. Google does more than so many other  institutions have the power and ability and resources and thus the fact that he feels that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  responsibility I think is great. I love it. You can tell he's a programmer and engineer because  Miguel says, one of the first instances of plus being woven into other Google services was in  search. There was a fair amount of criticism in some cases where somebody's not an active user  of Google Plus. You put their profile and search results. Lady Gaga was the example we used.  That's not necessarily the best use of that real estate. Some people went as far as saying,  you were betraying the promise of always giving the best unbiased search results. What's your  reaction? He says, well, what you should want to do is really build amazing products and really  go with the long-term focus. We think about it somewhat differently. This is the programmer.  We're going to have people as a first-class object in search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's people.search. Got it. I was really surprised nobody took that completely out of context and  said, you want people as a first-class object? That is a programmer speaking. People should  understand who people are and the relationships so that we can help improve things for them.  But saying it's a first-class data type is a very techie thing to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I love it. I thought, God, that's great. I am surprised nobody took that out of context.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Everyone knows that's nerd.  Nerd talk. Nerd speak.  First-class object. I want to be a first-class object in search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want a T-shirt. I want a Google T-shirt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Actually, though, as much fun as we're making of that,  I think that that actually is really a telling statement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gina, you are a first-class object in search because if you search for Gina  Tripani, you're in the knowledge graph because of Wikipedia. There's pictures and then we want  to know the connections in the nodes so that we can say people who search for you also looked  for Jeff Jarvis and Leo Laporte. It's kind of funny being actually rolled out something very similar  this past week. It's based off the same data, this free-based data where we acquired the company,  and it's based off of Wikipedia as well. But it just shows all the search engines are trying to  get to answers and trying to understand the world more. So you are a first-class data type.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know. When I saw that panel, I felt very first-class.  I also felt pretty first-class when author attribution rolled out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's nice, too. I love that.  Just to defend Google Plus after my remarks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're going to eat crow, Mr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it's numbers. I keep hearing these numbers, but I got to tell you, it still doesn't feel like  it's a vibrant community. More than half a billion people have upgraded, I guess that means they're  using Google Plus. 235 million are active across Google Plus wanting apps and Google Play, hanging  out in Gmail, writing reviews and maps. And 135 million are active in the stream. That's the real  number, 135 million users, because hanging out in Gmail doesn't mean you're a Google Plus user.  It just means you're hanging out in Gmail. But 135 million, nothing to sneeze at.  Speaking of numbers, half a billion dollars, that's the amount that Google and Apple are paying  together in harmony for the Kodak patents. This was necessary for Kodak to exit its Chapter 11.  So that's good news for Kodak. I think in a way, good news because it's saying that Google and  Apple are going to jointly own these patents, I presume, or maybe they're going to divvy them  up. I don't know how that works. I will sue you over these, you sue us over those. I don't know.  I would guess that it means fewer suits, but I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What struck me about that is that, okay, so now Kodak doesn't make film, it doesn't make pictures,  it doesn't own photographic patents. Why does it exist? Because of equity markets, right? You've  got to try to hold on and make this thing still live on, but it's nothing like what it was. It

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  might as well just have died. I am loving Google Now, by the way.  And now it's coming to Chrome, apparently. I think Google Now should be everywhere.  And I didn't realize this, but Google Now is going to now offer activity summaries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But only once a month, it says, which is so weird. I want it every day. If it's there,  I want it every day. I'm carrying around my Fitbit. I mean, not my Nike Fuel Band. I was  ready to buy a Fitbit, but if Google can be my Fitbit, I want it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It could do exactly the same thing, couldn't it? Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hopefully. But you have to remember the Fitbit, it works for like five or six days  before recharging. The phone, to have the accelerometer always on, could sap some power.  So until they come up with some low-power way to do it, you might be recharging your phone every  afternoon or every night, something like that. But it's certainly the case. I love Google Now  as well. And I think it's pretty funny that at the beginning of this year, a lot of people were  like, how dare Google have a unified privacy policy, much like all the other tech companies do.  And yet it's exactly that sort of thing that allows you to say, hey, you've got a meeting  20 miles up the peninsula and traffic is bad, so show me a little alert that says leave now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Google Now is my response to this whole privacy and apps thing is like, but if you give them  information, it's amazing. The synergy of, because Google knows everything I do,  they could tell me good stuff. Like they tell me every morning, you better leave for your  Pilates class now, you got five minutes. It knows, it knows I go there every morning,  it knows how long it takes to get there, and it actually tells me it's time to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, Matt, I have a complaint about this on the show. I don't get enough from my Google Now.  I want more. Yeah, he needs more.  I guess we two cars like giving me Facebook stock and the weather. That's it. Yeah.  How do I have five million times said, yes, you can share everything you want with it and all

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  this kind of stuff. I don't get enough. I actually agree with you because twice in the last week,  I've run into really bad traffic jams. And, you know, like parking lot on one on one. And I'm like,  come on, Google, you know, I'm going to work or you know that I'm driving on the street on the  way home. Let me know that I should go some other route. So as far as I'm concerned, yes,  you do have to worry about eventually becoming too annoying, but I'd like to see it more as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it makes sense. I think it would gradually roll out these features. So it's not to not to.  So you're getting the fitness thing, Jeff. Are you seeing that? Because I haven't seen it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I haven't got it yet. I just found the article, but I didn't know that it was kind of hidden  in the December 5 announcement of the new Google Now. And so it says that once a month,  it'll have that as part of the travel thing. I guess it knows how far you've gone. It knows

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  when you were sleeping. It knows when you're awake. And it tells you how many miles you've  biked and how many miles you've walked. It would be cool if it was like you drove this many miles  and you'd, you know, spent, you know, spent this much on gas or use this much gas or here's this  route that you've taken over and over again. If you take this other, you know, turn, you'll save  this much in gas or time. I mean, you really can see, I feel like Google Now is this dark horse.  I feel like it's just going to keep getting better and better. Like it just feels like the  perfect interface. It feels like it should be the interface on Google Glass. It's a really,  really, really good product. Not a lot of people know about it or talk about it yet. I don't know  if that's just because it's sort of new or it's just on newer versions of Android or what.  You've got the issue, you know. Yeah. Yeah. But I think by this time next year,  people will be talking about Google Now a lot more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wow. Snoop Dogg's coming to the Phoenix next Saturday. Oh, sorry. Actually, I'm on the list.  Go see Snoop. It's right across the street. Did you ever do show more cards? Jeff, did you get  more cards when you showed more? No. At the bottom, it says show more cards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have a tip for this. Jeff, do you happen to know if you're signed into your apps account on Chrome  and then signed into a different account on Google Now? Because if you are signed into two  different accounts... It wouldn't know all your stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I did that. I've shifted everything to my apps account. The only thing it's not  is because, damn you, Google, I'm still stuck with my other address for my Google Plus account.  There you go. That's why.  Because it's free apps. But everything else, everything else, calendar, email, everything,  is on my apps address. And Google Now and the phone and the device are my apps address.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay. So there is a path where you can try to migrate your personal Gmail to your apps  account on Google Plus. And my guess is you could try that and then if you run into any  obstacles, we could probably try to make sure that everybody gets migrated correctly. But  I'll see if I can find the link and post it in the rundown chat, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay. This is my weekly complaint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We like the tech support sessions with Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Instead of having the number of the week, we shift to Jeff's wine of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I love it that for instance, if you're in a different country with different currency,  it'll show you currency conversions. I mean, there's just so much cool stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want Google to take over my life. I already have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. I basically gave up. Take me Google, I'm yours. I'm yours Google.  But there's one thing I got a bone to pick with you, Matt Cutts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh-oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Google tweaks image search to make porn harder to find.  Did you do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did not do that, but I knew that was coming.  Hey, careful.  So how long of an answer do you want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I like it long.  Oh dear. Okay.  From now on, the whole show is going to be double entendre.  Just because of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Show title.  Grey lower third. Grey lower third.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, please don't fire me. Thank you. Don't kill me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So if I type porn in my search and I do an image search, I'm less likely to get...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A little bit less likely. So the reason...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Actually, I'm getting some good stuff here, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there's a historical artifact, which is when we did save search for web search,  it could either be on or it could be off. And that makes sense.  The problem is when you start to apply that to image search, well, we don't want to, you know,  assume people don't want anything by default, but we also don't want porn, you know,  loading up in everybody's searches. And so we had a middle ground for image search  that was called moderate. And that would say, you know, when you're in moderate mode,  which was the default, okay, just sort of don't show, you know, unless you're really,  really sure that someone's looking for porn. If, you know, our job is to help you find what you  want. If we're really, really sure that you're looking for porn, maybe then fine. But otherwise,  for the most part, try not to just like barrared you, you know, throw a bunch of porn in your face.  Right.  And so, but at the same time, having all these different settings is a little bit complicated.  So we're trying to simplify things and just say, okay, save search is on or save search is off.  And so we've moved that setting over to image search. And now on image search, if you want to,  you can click, there's a save search button in the right hand side, and you can select  exactly what level of, you know, you do, or you don't want save search on or off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And that's it now. It's just binary. It's either on or it's off. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Instead of having three settings, which is a little weird.  So I can't get moderately sexy pictures anymore.  Well, so again, it depends on how long you want to go on the porn stuff. But essentially,  if you want the porn, just search for porn terms and really explicit porn terms.  But if you search for like bikinis, we don't know that that's what you're looking for.  And so we'll err towards being a little bit sexy.  That makes perfect sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they'll abort nude. You would assume I know what I'm going to get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Those pictures, I took them out of circulation there, I think.  I was young. I needed the money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have an entire team of people whose job it is to do well on porn searches. And so we think about  what are called porn seeking queries. And their job is to make sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on right there. This is too good.  So there's a porn department at Google?  Of course there is. It's huge.  Oh, there's got to be. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's massive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it comes with therapy, doesn't it? I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I remember reading an article by somebody who was doing that. It just said it just wears on you after a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You get a little bit inured to it after a while.  But I was reading the Slashdart article one time and they're like,  oh man, imagine being the porn person at Google. That would be the best job in the entire world.  And I was reading Safe Search and I was like, well, that is an okay job. It doesn't suck.  You get tired of it after a while.  But there are a lot of people who would actually maybe want to do that job.  No.  Group of engineers, they're well-trusted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's the same thing my son says. I'd like to be a video game tester when I grow up.  It's not. It takes all the fun out of it.  Right. But it's not as fun.  Now, but you did do something right. Because when I search for Christmas on Google, I get Christmas stuff.  When I search for Hanukkah, I get Hanukkah stuff.  But when I search for my favorite holiday, Festivus, I not only get a search results,  I get an actual Festivus poll on the web page.  Yes.  That is crazy, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel good. I actually proposed this Easter egg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yay, Matt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because Paul Buckeye, I remember years and years ago, he had left Google and he was at FriendFeed.  He was saying, yeah, they do Hanukkah and they do Christmas doodles.  But I've never seen a Festivus Easter egg.  Hey, how are... And of course, our doodle team is phenomenal.  And so in like two hours, they're like, oh, how about this?  And you're like, wow, that's incredible. Yes, that would be wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a Festivus miracle. And I think we have our own Festivus poll here at the studio,  which almost killed me, by the way, the other day, because it wasn't completely hooked up.  So Festivus is a... For those of you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought that was your stripper's poll, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I do have an amazing core, but I'll show you that another time.  Festivus, for those who don't remember, was a fake holiday invented on the Seinfeld show.  But it's by George Costanz, of course.  And the truth is, in this politically correct era, I think it's better to wish us all a happy  Festivus. It's a non-denominational holiday. I didn't know this, but it's December 23rd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you can celebrate multiple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Both. Oh, you get them all. And of course, there's an aluminum pole. There's no Christmas tree,  but it's an aluminum pole set up like a Christmas tree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It needs no decoration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The annual airing of grievances and feats of strength are very important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you know it's actually based on one of the staff writers who actually did have it  as a fake holiday in his family? Oh, that's great.  Oh my God. Oh, that's awesome.  It's like this whole cult of Festivus and the war on Festivus, and it's pretty crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Congratulations, Matt. You have made a permanent mark on the world.  I think that's the greatest thing. A great Easter egg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you have Christmas and Hanukkah and all those. So if you search for those, you'll also see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I didn't see anything. So if I do it, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Assuming we can spell Hanukkah, which...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The truth is, when I want to know how to spell Hanukkah, you know where I go? Google.  Oh, you mean H-A-N-U-K-K-A-H-A-H. Oh, that Hanukkah. Oh yeah, see,  there's the little stars of David. I didn't see anything for Christmas. Let me do Christmas again.  Oh, Christmas. Let's spell it right.  I don't see anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess closer to the date. It is Hanukkah now. That's why, right?  Well, Festivus is awfully far away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You guys have something against Christians?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. It's the war on... Hey, Fox News. Google has a war on Christmas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But somebody literally did do that article because they can't help themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's unbelievable. We are joking. It's not true.  Oh, we have so much more we could talk about. The ITU is just winding up their  secret, super secret meeting in Dubai.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know if... I went to the ITU site just to see what they were saying.  And Tunisia had tried to pass a statement from the ITU saying simply that the rights you have  in life you have online. And they wouldn't do it. And instead, honest to God, with straight face,  they ordered that the director shall release a strongly worded press release.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hey, sometimes a strongly worded press release is all it takes. Just ask Reed Hastings.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Speaking of which, Redbox is starting up its Verizon streaming service to take on Netflix.  Facebook has decided even though it got 88% opposed, 668,000 votes, they've decided  you're not going to get to vote because 30 million people didn't weigh in.  300 million. Is it 300 million?  Oh, you're right. It's 300 million. It's got to be a third, right? So democracy is dead on Facebook,  of course. Whoever thought that was going to even happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was absurd to have the town hall model on Facebook. I do, however, still... I've argued  this with Google in the past. I would argue with Facebook. And I think there is a role for a kind  of council of peers as an advisory group that you could even be elected or something.  That when Google's greatest vulnerability to me is that an advertiser can say that you hold the  power of God over me because Google's main area of monopoly is advertising. It's not search. It's  not other areas. The power there is advertising. So I would argue that you could have some kind of  court of appeal. I think Facebook should have councils of users. But the idea that 30% of all  Facebook users would vote for anything was absurd on its face from the beginning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  As I remember, it was proposed as a settlement to the FTC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, not so much to the FTC. I think it was before that. I think there was a  kind of a protest group before. So it doesn't have legal clout?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because I thought it was something that they had agreed to do.  It's true.  Oh, anyway.  You're wrong. Someone will tell me if I'm wrong.  Well, obviously it wasn't because they've decided they're not going to do it anymore.  And it wasn't going to happen.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Someone wrote a piece, maybe it was Matthew Ingram, who basically said,  you know, this is actually a good thing. Why should we pretend that this is actually democracy?  It's better that we just stop pretending anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's an illusion. Yeah. I agree with Matthew. Because, you know, I mean, come on. First of all,  30 million people are not going to ever vote on anything or 300 million. Pardon me.  Anyway, the whole thing was nuts. So just send me some chocolates from your Facebook account and  I'll be happy. This is bad news. Boy Genius Report did some, somebody did some calculations  and figured out that if Google were to fiber the entire country, give a gigabit fiber, the stuff  they're getting in Kansas City, it would cost 140 billion dollars. Actually was Goldman Sachs that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  estimated that. Not so fast buster. Oh.  Because then Forbes came back and said, whoa, you know what? That's not so expensive. That's  not as if Google has to pay that all out of its cash. This is a capital investment over a long  term. It's basically like a thousand dollars per household if Goldman Sachs is right. With  the return you'd get, it's pretty incredible. And Eric Schmidt did just say that Kansas City is  not the end. Good.  That goals, ambitions will spread past the lovely wheat filled plains of the Midwest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And Netflix weighing in saying, in fact, Google fiber is the most, cause they know, cause they  push a lot of video, is the most consistently fast ISP in America, beating even Verizon Fios  for that honor. So that's good. There you get, if you got fiber from Google, you're watching your

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  movies in high def. Someday we'll get that. The whole stat about it would cost 140 billion  dollars to wire fiber up on the whole country. For some reason that reminds me of the analyst  report that said YouTube must be losing hundreds of millions of dollars a year. It's like,  you know, analysts are taking guests, but they don't really know what the cost structure is,  what the scale is, all that sort of stuff. And Matt, you're right. It's also that you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  not looking at the full P&L. You throw out one big number and say, well, that's scary. But  imagine, imagine if we could suddenly all get, of course it shouldn't be fiber. Imagine if we  could all get really good internet access without all of the net neutrality fights and all that.  We actually had competition in this sphere. How wonderful is that world?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And asymmetric. So upload is as fast as download. That would enable a lot of interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  things. Incredible. From thought catalog.com, William Hudson figures out how to have  chipotle. Get more meat in your burrito. Get if you eat. So this is literally a chipotle mind trick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Twig listeners pointed, brought this to my attention.  And this is relevant to your interests.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When they ask you, I have not so many recommendations for this this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  When they ask you black beans or pinot beans, did you know you can say both?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I had no idea. That's crazy. Crazy talk. Crazy talk. Now he does say execution is key. If you

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  make your eventual position known from the start, your chipotle is going to turn its back on you.  So answer the question with one bean. Don't tell them both. Timing matters. Wait for the  beans to be applied to the burrito. Then say, can I have pinot beans too? This method ensures

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  two full scoops of both. I say I'll have a little brown rice and a lot of black beans. So I always  get double scoops of black beans because at my age, of course, I need the fiber. I go light on the

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  rice too. Now, here's another handy one. When you're asked what kind of meat you can say,  half chicken, half steak. And the point he makes is now that sounds like one half plus one half,  but because a scoop of meat is just a scoop of meat, nobody in chipotle management has introduced  half scoops. So you can ask for half chicken, half steak, and you'll get more of both. Unlike  with the beans, you should make your position on the half meats clear from the beginning. Otherwise,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they'll charge you for extra meat. I heard a guy in there last week, because it proved I went there  last week, saying that he got charged for triple meat. Right. If I had this burrito with double

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  beans and double meat, I would have passed out. But there's more. I already full. There's more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Ask for fajitas in your burrito, the grilled onions and peppers. They're next to the rice.  They're right there. They don't ask you, but you can say you want them and they'll know, you know.  You can make two meals off of that. It also says, and I think this is the final bit,  make an informed decision regarding the guacamole. You may be not all three salsas, okay?  But the guacamole situation requires a real value judgment. Basically, you could get  two whole avocados at the market for the price of one scoop. Consider ordering a burrito bowl  and adding your own sliced avocado on top. If you forego the meat, the guacamole is free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just a little tip there. That's a good tip, actually. I do that. Google onion chipotle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You'll find the piece from the onion. Chipotle employee just gave Guy in front of you more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Breaking news. And the onion's on it.  Of course, I haven't had lunch, so I'm faint with hunger right now. So thanks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, just get Guy in front of you.  I loved the onion article that was like, Google shuts down Gmail for two hours to display its

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  immense power or something like that. By the way, there were outages of both,  wasn't it, Gmail and Facebook this week. Not long, but enough to cause me some shakes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  These things happen. You're just like, oh, it's going to be one of those days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I might have to go outside. Maybe visit a chipotle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is one of those moments that we question your life when you're like, wait a second,  I don't have this thing to play with. I missed it. I missed the Gmail outage. I saw friends of  mine talking about it and I was like, whew, good thing I didn't infect me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dodged a bullet there.  Speaking of going outside, have you guys played ingress at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I just got it thanks to Chad. And he didn't warn me that in fact, you have to get up and walk

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  around. I'd like to go to the tapes on that one. I think that I warned you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm a little upset. Chad warned.  What kind of game is this? You can't play it if you're sitting at your desk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you got to walk miles and miles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Matt, are you resistance or enlightened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm resistance because I'm like resistant things.  Are you enlightened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm enlightened. I went with enlightened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So now I'm still in the tutorial because I have to walk around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I know. It's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So the idea is you're collecting this XM stuff. And now I've got to go to a portal,  enemy control portal. But the problem with that is, okay, it sees where I am.  This is my range. The portal, I have to get up and go there.  I can't just sit here and play the game. XM will come to you, but the portal won't come to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's the speakeasy across the street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was going to say that that portal is so close to you, Leo.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I'm in the middle of a show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, okay, fair enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I can't go there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can remotely do things to portals, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just right outside of the 50 year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Nothing. Hack, deploy, recharge, upgrade, nothing. All I can do is cancel target.  But this, I have to say, I don't know why this game... This is from Google,  right? The same people who did Field Trip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  Niantic, yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Niantic. I don't know why Google is doing this to me.  Is it because they want me to exercise more?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have heard people who said, I've lost 10 pounds playing Ingress, but  if you wanted to be cynical, you could say, well, people can submit points of interest.  So these portals are around things that are interesting, like statues or post offices.  And you actually learn a lot about your town walking around. I've been to five or six statues  I never would have seen. And so cynically, you could say, well, Google could gather data or you  can submit new points of interest. But a lot of people have been losing weight or getting more  healthy playing it, except for the one guy who said he actually got arrested. Because he was  playing at like 2 a.m. at night and the cops were like, what's this guy doing with his phone open?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It makes a lot of noise while it's going around. It's talking to you and it's making sound.  Well, I have to take a day off just to play Ingress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you do. I was talking about this with Kevin Purdy and he was saying that,  he was reading a Reddit thread where people were saying post offices are very popular  place for portals to be because they have to be public places. But you got the guy standing  outside of the post office, like taking pictures and like tapping at the phone.  And we started to get like kind of a hairy eyeball from the police officer.  I don't want to do this.  What's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, this is the, you know, the Homeland Security is going to be shutting Ingress down.  So I didn't get an invite. So Chad invited me. So I'm brand new at this. Just started this on Sunday.  So what, or no, yesterday, what do I do? So I'll choose at some point whether I'm enlightened or  Yeah, resistance.  And then does that mean anything? It's just two teams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, blue team and a green team. And what people recommend is pick the underdog because,  you know, if you're part of the dominant group in your area, you're not going to get as many  points and experiences. Whereas if you're like trying to take down and hack the portals of the  over, you know, dogs, then you get more experience and you have more fun with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  See, that's, see, when I was born, I asked to be a white male and  Yeah, chose the wrong side.  Chose the wrong side. I guess straight white male. Look where it's got me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Playing on easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I am. I'm playing on easy. You guys, you go ahead. You do the hard mode. I'm taking it easy.  I'm told you I'm not, I'm not ambitious. I'm taking it easy. I'm satisfied.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's good to be content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Throw title.  So what you'll do is you'll go hack portals and that covers the area. So you're claiming  area for your side of the game and that'll help, you know, should I do it at work or home?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, you're where it's available. You're in Manhattan. You got to go out the door. You  can't do it at work or home. You can't. You have to walk. That's what I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But where do I start? If I start at home out in the burbs? No,  it doesn't matter. It's just where you are. Right. You can play at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Go to, I believe it's ingress.com slash Intel and you can see the portals around you. So you  can see if there's a place that has more portals, you'd start there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Petaluma is probably a very good place to play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not as good as San Francisco, but big city. See Jeff's got the great opportunity there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes. He's going to be here in heaven. Now you can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This Intel site is great. I have no idea. Pro tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Pro tips. Thanks, Chad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Chad's the king of pro tips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's also a sub Reddit called ingress and they share some codes that will get you extra  experience points and resonators and hacking stuff. So you can tell Chad and I play quite a bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Actually, in all seriousness, it is an awesome game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's kind of addictive. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you can hear the portals in Petaluma and see these ones have been connected by the enlightened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And so this is their area. Oh, so as resistance, so I'm going to be resistance.  Right. So can I go in there and break it up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly. That's what you want to do. And so if you were to take this portal here,  that would mean they wouldn't have any...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The show's over. I'm out of here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, what you really want to do is walk, instead of walking to this one that's closest,  walk over to here to this one. That's my old apartment. What the hell?  Because then you would have all of these connected.  Oh, it's the Petaluma Fire Department. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. So I'm going to go over to the Petaluma Fire Department,  act suspiciously, take pictures, and I'll win the game.  Hang out there for 20 minutes while it packs. On the way to Guantanamo Bay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't have to take pictures, but a lot of the points of interest are elementary schools,  which feels really, really creepy unless you come on the weekend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  U.S. Post Office Fire Department, Penry Park. Do it after 5 p.m.  No. Petaluma Historical Museum, Volpe's Grocery, which is a speakeasy across the street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And so that was in... That's the one I was seeing.  That was most likely in a field trip because it has history. It was probably already added

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  to field trip. Got it. So field trip has... There's a nexus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. And so if you even look down here, it looks like there's a point of interest that  hasn't been claimed yet. This is that... That's my house.  Petaluma Wildlife Museum. Oh, yeah, yeah. That's at the high school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. So... I'm going to get on my bike and play ingress.  A bike is a great way to play. Username Chief Twit, by the way.  And does that matter? Is there a social element to this? Can I team up with you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. There is. There's actually chat on each side.  And so you can arrange to mount a massive attack. If there's some high level portal  that you couldn't hack by yourself, you can get a group of people to attack it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This might be the most interesting massively multiplayer online game I've ever seen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. And just as a thing, I just want everyone to know on Twitter, I have no  invites left, unfortunately. You can see that right there.  You can try to hit me up on Twitter, but no invites left. Sorry.  I don't have any invites either. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because you start with zero. I would love to see what the Mountain View map looks like.  Have you played, Jeff? No, because I've got to get the same  thing as you, Leo. I've got to get the time and go out and do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Ingress.com, you sign up for... Are they sending out invites now pretty quickly?  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it might take a couple of weeks to get an invite, but Jeff, to your point,  Mountain View is crazy. It's like full on, the portals change sides two or three times an hour  kind of thing. It's pretty nuts. Well, there's 28 million enlightened. Is that people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  24 million resistance. Mind units, Leo. Mind units.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But that means there are 52 million mind units playing this game?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no. So whenever you draw one of those triangles that's covering a certain number of houses,  and so a mind unit is roughly like a residential house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I see. So these are the people we've taken over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. It's a lot like RISC, except in the real world. It's a lot of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's freaking awesome. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can see right for the Googleplex. The Googleplex is a hotbed of activity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Look at that. How are they getting anything done?  It's my 20%. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Holidays have started. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to be working on my 20% today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can tell which Google side is resistance or enlightened by which building has nodes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. So Matt, is Niantic, tell me about Niantic.  Was this an acquisition at Google? No, it's John Henke and Michael,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  like a whole bunch of people who had done sort of Google Earth and Geo sort of stuff.  And I think it was one of these things where they were thinking about leaving Google  and instead Google said, well, why don't you make a company inside of Google?  And so I think Niantic refers to the name of a ship that actually is underground in San Francisco.  And the idea is all around you, there's all kinds of interesting history and things to discover  that you might not know. And so Field Trip is one of those things that helps you find things near you.  And then this is another fun game that helps you discover stuff near you.  And then you can also submit potential portals. There's also an alternate reality game that's  sort of got all these conspiracy undertones to it. So you can get in at whatever level  you're interested in enjoying. That's the Niantic Project?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Nianticproject.com or twitter.com slash Niantic project, a slow leak of information.  This was when I was been worried about all along is that at some point I would be subsumed  by some highly compulsive technology. Like the internet.  Like the internet. And I've avoided it up to now through podcasting and other distractions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Joey Edo was, the man is now heading the MIT Media Lab for like two or three years.  World of Warcraft. We lost him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He did nothing but play World of Warcraft.  We lost him to World of Warcraft. Okay, we didn't mention Habermas,  but here's your Gutenberg moment, ladies and gentlemen, a visualization.  Oh, first a sponsor message. Let's just skip that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can drink anyway, he said Gutenberg. It's fine.  It's not that good.  You know what's better, Leo? If you want to take one minute, go back up to the bottom of the Google  section, the punch card thing. Have you seen that? No.  What Google would have been in 1960, the mad man theater.  It's wonderful. It really is brilliantly done. And you can just get started and get the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I started watching a new BBC show called The Hour that's about the BBC in 1956. It's kind of  a British madman. It's quite good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's an interface to current search. You can search for the port.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay, so it's with the punch cards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like Fortran all over again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, anybody of a certain age is going to really kind of be scary.  Oh my God, there's the teletype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh my God.  This is the best part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For those of you who will see it on the podcast.  This is how it was. I hate to tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's showing an impact printer going along. It does an ASCII of Google.  That's a teletype.  And then it makes you make a choice and teletype.  You misspelled my name, you nitwit.  Oh, did I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm also switching the show, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, that. Okay. Well, if you're going to use the punch cards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's see if 1960 Google asks you, did you mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, that's actually accurate because with punch cards, you make one mistake.  The whole job is ruined.  Right, right.  So in a way, that's actually very accurate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so it does that. It goes to the teletype and then it goes to a tape drive.  And this is very funny, but it's really very, very cute.  It's got the lights on the front.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's what they sound like. This is real.  This is exactly.  And when Bill Gates started programming, this is how he was programming.  With the timeshare computer with a teletype.  Wow. Reading for channel four device card reader.  And it was this fast, by the way.  So I could do an image search. That's got to be a hoot.  What's that going to look like?  Is it ASCII? Oh my God.  No, no, I guess so. Now we have a tape drive.  This is skeuomorphism put to a good purpose.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have you seen this, Matt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. Have you guys seen the Google postcard?  That's also kind of fun.  Where they mail you a postcard with the search results.  I'll paste it into the chat, but it's basically like,  if Google were a postcard where you write what you wanted  and then send the postcard off and 30 days later,  we'll send you back an answer.  This is mass work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  M-A-S-S-W-E-R-K dot A-T.  Which I think is Austria slash Google six zero.  Wow.  And it's going to do an image plot.  It is. It's ASCII art.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, ASCII art of the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Holy camole.  That is a hoot and a holler.  Le père du bébé de Rashida dati n'est pas la porte.  So this is somebody else, but that's good.  I'm glad to know I wasn't the father.  Ladies and gentlemen, we take a break.  Come back in just a minute with our tip tool,  a number of the week, and then we'll wrap this thing up.  Triangulation is coming up.  Our guest today on Triangulation is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Guy Kawasaki.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Guy Kawasaki.  He's got a new book out, former Apple evangelist.  And let's hope he's patient because we're running late as always.  Our show today brought you by Squarespace,  the best web hosting out there.  I'm telling you, not just good hosting, great content management system.  They're tightly integrated, which means you get the best of both worlds.  Hosting that doesn't go down,  software that's always kept up to date and secure.  You never have to worry about updating it.  And they've done features, they've done things that the other guys only dream of.  Mobile responsive design on all sites on Squarespace now.  So that means when you design a site and you use the great templates,  you don't have to know anything about what that means.  If you do, by the way, know JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, all that.  They've got a developer platform that's fantastic with code coloring, syntax, and all that stuff.  But even if you don't, you just drag and drop, you take the template, you customize it.  And automatically, as part of the package, that site's going to look great.  There's no mobile version.  It's all going to work great on any size screen,  from three and a half inches to 27 inches and everywhere in between.  And when you post, you automatically resize all the different,  you get seven different image sizes so that they'll use the right image.  They do the whole thing.  It's beautiful.  They flow it.  It's really good if you're artistic.  If you have an aesthetic, a poor photographer or a designer or an architect,  and you want a site that reflects your aesthetic, you get these great templates.  You make the site look your own.  And it's really good for images and all of this stuff.  I really like Squarespace.  I know you will too.  And the best part is you can try this free for two weeks if you go to squarespace.com  and just click the Get Started button and they'll walk you through the process.  You can import all of your existing content if you have a site already.  The major APIs, Blogger, TypePad, Movable Type.  If you decide after looking at all of this that, yeah, I like this,  go to the pricing section.  You're going to get your mind will be blown.  Two weeks free, 27.47 support and everything.  But they only have two plans now.  They've really simplified this.  There's the $8 a month and the $16 a month, in both cases when you pay annually.  Don't even forget the eight.  I mean, I guess if it's just a simple site and you just want something quick.  But look what you get for $16 a month, unlimited pages, unlimited galleries.  If you're a photographer, that's great.  Each client can have their own gallery, unlimited blogs, unlimited bandwidth.  You don't have to ever worry about suddenly getting popular and getting a bandwidth bill.  Never.  $16 a month, that's it.  Unlimited storage, unlimited contributors.  When you buy an annual plan, they'll automatically give you a custom domain.  You choose the custom domain.  They'll register it for you for free and hook it up to the Squarespace site.  Lots of great features.  I want you to try it today.  When you buy, do me a favor.  Use the offer code TWIG12.  They'll know you heard it on Twig and you'll get 10% off as a thank you.  10% off your first purchase with new accounts when you use the offer code TWIG12.  Google Dash, by the way, thank you Squarespace.  You always tell when it's not a Squarespace site because we bring it to its knees.  Let's see if we can bring Google-classic.com.  Is this the postcard?  This is the postcard.  That's hysterical.  Please allow 30 days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like how each character gets its own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's great.  Yeah, its own little spot.  Space.  Actually did the search though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was one that was like medieval Google or something like that.  I couldn't find that at the time.  What death, what dof, bow seek or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  YTMND, medieval Google.  Lettings, I don't know if this is it.  Webby Portraits, Guilds, Cryer Kingdom, Thine Query.  Hythehence, Feelest Thou Fortunate?  It's on burlap.  All right, time for our tool of, I mean, sorry, the tip of the week from Gina Trapani.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I have to thank Yoshi Oni in the chat room for this one.  I actually missed this.  It should have been in the changelog, but it just got released today.  I think Google Currents for Android got a pretty big update.  It's not for iOS yet.  It's just Android.  Makes it easier to scan headlines and get breaking news and kind of groups publications  into different categories.  So Currents is the kind of Flipboard-like tablet app for reading blogs and online magazines.  This looks like a pretty nice update.  Leo, you're a Flipboard guy, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I love Flipboard, but I like Currents a lot too.  I'm glad to see the competition.  Oh, I have a lot of-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google News also got a big upgrade.  If you just go to the webpage on an Android device for Google News, it's much nicer as well.  Oh, good.  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's good.  Because I want to see news and Currents kept up to date.  I mean, I think Google Plus scares me that it's going to take over all Google interfaces.  So that's nice.  Boy, Shopper's being updated, Google Earth's being updated, Google Drive's being updated.  That's probably the save you were talking about.  And the Google Currents field trip is being updated.  So lots of updates.  I just got all of a sudden.  I'm going to buy it, Leo.  The what?  The note?  Yeah.  Pretty sweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is.  I'm liking my Nexus 4, but I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's pretty sweet.  It's ginormous.  I was walking around talking on it yesterday and they were mocking me.  This doesn't look weird.  Hello.  What?  That doesn't look weird.  Hello.  Yes, I'm on the phone right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does that look weird?  I don't think that looks-  It does have a bit of Fisher Price about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Maybe I'm just used to it.  I don't talk on the phone that much, but-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  From the side angle, it might look a little large.  But from there-  That's what she said.  There's a tablet stuck to my face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I like my note too.  I really do.  I really, really do.  Okay.  So I'm updating Currents.  Actually, I could show you.  I think it got updated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh yeah, cool.  I was going to ask if you-  Currents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it just got updated.  So let's see what the-  Oh, I have to hold it way over here now.  The stretch.  Oh yeah, it's very different.  Whole new look to Currents.  So yeah, it's not quite Flipboard,  but I think it looks good.  I like it a lot.  You know what I miss?  Oh yeah.  Oh, it's got-  You know what it's looking like?  Google Now a little bit.  It's got a little bit of a Now.  Card.  Oh yeah.  Oh, it's got that Google Plus slide-up thing on the bottom now.  Oh, I like it.  I like it.  That's good.  That's good.  I forgot to mention that Google's got $10 billion in Bermuda,  but we don't need to mention that anymore.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is good.  Can I share it now?  See, one of the things I do is I share it.  It's got all the sharing things.  Yeah, that's cool.  It's one of the things that really makes Android special.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow, your share menu is voluminous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can share it anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good God, look at that.  That is impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's as big as my phone, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Your phone isn't even big enough to accommodate-

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, it's dynamic, but that's what I love about it.  I love that.  That's-  iPhone doesn't do that.  It's Facebook or Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You are the god of oversharing.  Roger Cohen in the New York Times had a column going against oversharing.  How awful it was.  And he had this tweet that he said,  I just happened upon this tweet by this woman named whatever,  that I had this volcanic zit.  And I thought, boy, it sounds weird.  I went looking on Twitter for the tweet, couldn't find it, went around.  I realized I quoted it in my book.  Oh, boy.  Two years ago.  And at the Times, she had to put up a correction about it  because that's the latest tweet he could find.  It was awful.  But you, Leo, you are his poster boy for oversharing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Overshare.  I like this.  You know what? I'm going to use this.  I like the new-  The redesign's fantastic.  Really, really, really nice.  Yeah, and so easy to read.  Congratulations to Loic, by the way.  He's been trying to sell it for years.  He finally found a sucker to buy it.  Oh, he did?  Who bought it?  Read Mitem.  They're a big conference organizer.  They don't do any tech conferences.  This will be their first tech conference.  They do a music conference and I think a television conference.  And they bought a majority stake,  but Loic and Geraldine will still be doing the show.  It's actually one of the best.  Oh, okay.  It's a wonder.  Have you ever done one with the web?  It's just-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wish I could.  It's a bad timing for me.  It's my graduation, pre-graduation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's London and it's Paris and it's just the best.  We didn't go this year and I'm sad.  I love it.  Great event.  And so congratulations, Loic.  That's great.  Do you have a number for us, Mr. G?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I do, real quick.  Removal requests to Google are up 10x.  Six months to 2.5 million per week.  And Google, by the way, removes 97.5% of them.  And guesses as to why, but one guess is just a lot more.  The interface to submit them was made easier.  Thank you very much, Google.  And that there are more routines to try to find allegedly offending content online.  And you get this from the Google Transparency Report,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  which is cool that they actually they publish this information.  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah.  But they're not all DMCA.  No, they're not all.  A lot of them are.  And you can see the different organizations that are asking for it.  Top copyright owners in the past month, top domain specified.  Most of them are torrent sites.  In fact, at least in the top five are torrent sites.  So probably a lot of them are.  But look at that graph.  This is 2012, 2011.  Just jumped.  Per week.  That's the per week requests.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go ahead.  I have a community on Google Plus that's there now.  Is for Twig?  I did you guys, yeah.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I guess you could search for communities.  So search for Twig in communities.  Oh, there it is.  Look.  Preview community.  That's cool.  That's nice.  My tool was going to be Ingress.  But I already showed it.  So sorry.  No, no, I'm thrilled.  That's just I got some pro tips.  That's important.  And I'm about to walk out the door and go take over the post office.  See, you say things like that and I think the government gets upset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just out of context.  Yeah.  That's all.  The post office needs somebody who cares about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm not going to I'm just going to take my cell phone and tap a few keys.  And then it'll be mine.  Now that's not right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I think the government would say, Leo, you're welcome to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I, I, I'm going to I want to.  The government would say you stamp.  I want to take it for the resistance.  See, all of this is just asking for trouble.  And you know that the NSA is running an automated filter on this podcast.  And that as soon as they hear this, I'm if I disappear, you'll know why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're not there with a phone because it's too big.  It must be some strange new tricorps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, exactly.  You want to show you want to flash this.  You're in trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're at least people aren't using words like bomb making.  Hey, stop it.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Thomas.  Oh, sorry.  Sorry.  She's.  There was one guy in the Usenet days who his email signature was like every  keyword he could think of that might trigger things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He was trying to he was trying to get echelon to by the way, whatever happened to that guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't hear from me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That kind of disappeared.  Got very quiet all of a sudden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And Matt also has a tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, Matt, Matt cuts a tip from the Googleplex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sure.  So this actually came out this morning.  You know, we have a free thing at Google dot com slash webmasters  that lets you get all kinds of great information from Google.  But there hasn't been that much of a way to give information to Google.  You could mark things up and do all the HTML and all that sort of stuff.  XML.  But that's kind of a hassle.  So we just want something that we announced on the Google Webmaster blog  called the data highlighter.  And so instead of making the markup and editing your HTML, you can go to here.  Right now it's for events.  So things like concerts.  But you basically can highlight something and say, OK, this is the name.  You can highlight it.  This is what the data is.  Google will learn the structure of that page and all the other stuff on your page,  on your site, and then we'll possibly be able to highlight that in the search results.  Brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, cool.  Semantic web.  You tell Google.  Without all the hassle.  That's really great.  By the way, Matt does some great on the Webmasters tools.  He does great videos that everybody should be watching.  Just really love your stuff, Matt.  You're very helpful to everybody who wants to show up well in Google.  Are you demonstrating something, Chad, there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is just the video that was on the...  Oh, there you go.  There's Matt Cutts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jack.  He's like two offices down.  Jack.  It's Jack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hey, thanks, everybody.  It's so much fun to do this show.  Thanks to Lamar Wilson, who joins us to the beginning to talk about YouTube, Matt Cutts,  who is the guy who keeps spam off our web results.  We love you, Matt.  We love Matt.  We invite you back on the show.  Thank you, Matt.  He's one of us.  That's why we love him so much.  Always good to see you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's a first class person.  You're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're resistance, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  First class object at Twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All right.  Resistance.  Resistance.  For the horde.  Also, Jeff Jarvis, who is about to...  What's the opposite of matriculate?  Commensulate?  I don't know.  He's going to walk in the commencement.  Ridiculous.  Doesn't have such a huge hand.  Looks good.  No, it looks good.  You look like the professor on those videotapes.  Video professor.  Jeff Jarvis.  Profes...  Special effect.  Tenured professor of journalism at the City University of New York.  Actually, are you?  I am.  Full professor.  Can't get rid of me.  He's the man.  Cannot be fired.  He also blogs at Buzz Machine.  Good thing because he blogs at BuzzMachine.com.  And his book, latest is Public Parts, a must read.  Fabu.  And of course, the wonderful Gina Tripani.  Mother of Etta.  They're of us all.  That's all you need to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That does seem to be my primary thing these days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It changes your identity completely to have a kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It does.  It really does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You didn't see it, but Henry walked in during the show and I actually wandered off because I had to  give him stuff.  Because today was supposed to be his driving test, but he didn't have the insurance  card for the car.  You guys were cancelling the conversation just fine.  So I just took off.  That's the priority.  You're kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Chad's worried for silence, but then again, we never have silence with this group.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing.  I knew it was during the Flickr conversation and I figured you had more than enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  I was ready to just play the Trangelog video and hope Gina just took it after that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is actually a bad sign.  I've taken to wandering off during the shows a lot.  But now that I have Ingress, I have an excuse anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you got to get that exam.  Yeah.  There's some exam out there.
