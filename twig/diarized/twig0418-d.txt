Transcript:  Yeah, we did it was late at night and we just you're a daredevil circling through your  Colsters are safe. I guess and my daughter loves roller coasters and so does my husband so it's like a bonding activity

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I went to high school in Santa Cruz where they have the Big Dipper, which is an old wooden roller  Cuz one of those classic old coasters and people would die on it from time to time  It made it a more interesting experience, you know, you know, it's not guaranteed you're gonna come back  It's a little  Dollop of soup son of excitement excitement. That's exactly I'm glad Jeff Jarvis isn't here  Apparently he's still in an apoplectic fit or something. I don't know  Hey, you know what? The great thing is about President Trump. What's that? We're not gonna be talking about the Google memo today. Oh  Yeah, wow, but they did you know what that was kind of neat so the Daily Stormer has been around for ages  Yeah, and it is a neo-nazi website. I don't think they would even  The funny thing is they wouldn't even prevail at that. They wouldn't they would say yeah, you're right. We're a neo-nazi website  They were one of the websites that encouraged the violence in  Charlottesville told people to go armed with shields and helmets and people did and they did I  Think that's safe to say is encouraging

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They had stashes of weapons buried all over the city now the thing that's interesting is they've been hosted by GoDaddy for years

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  forever  But I guess this was a bridge too far or is just I think more is there's too much publicity now, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so. I think they're gonna eventually the the white supremacists are gonna have to have their own host something like go Adolf

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They got kicked off of GoDaddy they went to Google for three hours got kicked off there was a good three hours though  They had  And they went from there to I think they're now on the dark web there  They have a dot onion address. Is that right? But still somebody has to host them. Yeah. Yeah, do we know who hosts them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They'll find a host. I don't I don't know who hosts them at present  Maybe the chat room does but I you know, I think it's not impossible to find a host somewhere in the world  it can be anywhere in the world, yeah, and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  some people some people host it out of a  A  Support for free speech, right? Right. Yeah, yeah Russian. Oh, what a surprise Russian help  It's found a home on the Russian internet after the American tech companies refused to host it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They couldn't even you know host the domain lots and lots of things are censored in on the Russian internet  But not that is really isn't that funny? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Haha funny. Yeah, it's hilarious  Okay, anything more to say

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I do think it's interesting that  So this event is seen as a very negative thing and there is a plus side to it  Which is exactly what's happening sure has they're being shunned from polite. Yeah, it's really interesting because as I said, this is oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They've oh, this is not a new site. There's  Groups like this on reddit. Yeah, they've survived. Although reddit has now pulled down a number of them  So I think you have by big becoming  more than just  Kind of a jokey background noise. Yeah  People take him more seriously and as soon as they're taken more seriously after Charlottesville then they get pulled out now  There's an interesting debate. I'm very curious what you think about this because their site  I guess I presume their Russian site as well is  Is goes through cloud flare it has DDoS and attack protection from cloud flare  cloud flare says  they won't say anything specific about that site, but they say we serve anybody who wants to because  But I heard they dropped them now have they dropped I believe they have they said it because and I think I kind of support  This oh good for the cloud flare good for cloud flare. I think they kind of support this I  Support I understand why they do because they say we're you wouldn't say to the electric company turn off that guy's electricity  He's a Nazi or to the phone company don't allow phone companies by  Racist people they're common carriers and so they are historically not  Neither responsible nor nor expected to be aware of the kind of content  And I think that was cloud flares point of view for a while anyway the difference is that the difference is that there's a?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  stigmatization of a company that attends that so you know certainly they have the right to continue to host anyone they want but they're  Going to lose some business and it's just bad business

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's you know and that's I mean you could you could be a cynical and say yeah go daddy and Google didn't mind  Having them well Google didn't have for a customer for a long ago  did he not demand having from a customer because until it became a  Lie a business liability as opposed to well good for good for cloud for I have to say I'm gonna  Fair fair disclosure. They are they have been a sponsor and they had ads today, and we contacted them he said  Can't do an ad for you today  Or ever now actually I had told Lisa if they decided if they changed their mind we'd love to have them back so  but

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good, I'm really thrilled to hear that actually yeah, it's awesome and and really I think that I think the most important thing is not laws  against  These types of groups. I think it's social stigmatization is the key ultimately

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Scorn and ridicule yeah, I think that's exactly right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think also I think I think and I'm sorry to keep stepping over you  Stacey there, but just one quick point, and then I'll turn it over  But basically Google and and and these other companies go daddy have been hosting them for years  But I think they may be in the same boat. I am I never realized how serious these guys were like I knew that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what I meant. They were jokey back. You know I just thought they were just a bunch of whiny for years  We've had I'm sorry Stacey go ahead

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like guys I'm not in the studio that's your disadvantage, and I'm sorry  Well, it is no I was just gonna say I'm gonna throw something out there because I think that  This idea of being a common carrier something that even cloudflare so cloudflare  says this a lot of people say that about Google and Facebook and even things like  somewhat Twitter  that you know  Disbarring people from the platform based on their beliefs isn't a great  Isn't a good idea and this isn't just neo-nazi people  This is other people and the question then becomes where do you stop ostracizing folks?  Well, it's very clear to say Nazis are bad right. I'm not arguing that Nazis are bad or good  but  you know if you have  I'm trying to think of  What group is next to Nazis but not as bad as not

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Men's rights groups men's rights there you go, okay, but if men's rights groups start committing acts of terrorism

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Advocate violence right terrorism. That's crossing the line. That's right this this event that took place  There's no free speech if you're advocating violence. That's not protected. There's it that is not protected speech

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  inciting violence  So and that's that's a good thing to keep in mind is how do we think about that?  Although I would say men's rights groups incite violence  They offer ways to drug women to rape them, which I feel is a pretty violent act  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's the basis on which you you ban them  You don't ban them because they believe in men's rights or whatever it is  You ban them if if the site openly advocates certain things you ban the people but if the site or the group or whatever  Sort of goes along with those kinds of practices. You got to ban it because that's just you know, you're inciting  Violence against people and that's you know  I think that's becoming the universal standard for banning and blocking and censoring and stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See but would you expect the power company to cut off their power?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, this is the telcoms argue this when they're talking about they say that they that Google and Facebook all  Should have to follow some of the same rules they do about being a common carrier. This is this is an argument  I don't necessarily agree with but this is what they talk about when we're talking about net neutrality  So it's it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just because they're politically  Challenging I mean, you know some would look at Hobby Lobby didn't want to offer  Birth control to its employees because that was they claimed. I don't know if I buy it religiously

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Against their religious beliefs. That's different. Sure. If you have you have things like and again, I'll go to MRA groups  There are definitely places right now sites that Google hosts or go daddy hosts that would tell you like hey  Here's how you get a woman to have sex with you without consent, right? Right. That's not good. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But now I would cloudflare  I mean cloudflare hosts or not host isn't the right word because they don't host they protect something like 30% of that mean  Millions tens of millions of sites  They could reasonably I think I understand why they could reasonably say well if we get in the business of saying well  This one but not that one. That's a that's a never. That's a tough never-ending battle  But so I understood their point of view  To me it's kind of response. I'm glad you know what I'm glad they basically they did the right thing  Yeah, and I'm glad they did it  In fact, I'm gonna give him a free ad in this show because I'm glad they did that  And we had ads for them earlier today that we decided not to do and but we're gonna give them a cloudflare  Thank you did the right thing Matthew Prince or CEO I think I was taking what he believed was a principal stand  Yeah, principal stand, but in the long run that right the price is too high

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So here's the here's the thing that's different between Google for example and the power company the power company is provides  Heat, you know, you can make food. It's like necessary for your survival. What Google does is a massive and historically  brand new amplifier  So if you think of the recruitment that Isis has done on the Internet  And you realize that you know, yes the Isis type people have always existed but they used to be powerless  They used to be sitting in some place with no ability to affect global change now  They can use the Internet to spread their ideas to recruit and this is this is what's happening with the with our domestic terrorists as well  They're they're recruiting. They're spreading this stuff using the Internet using Google using  Social apps and all that kind of stuff  So do we really want to just empower everybody with this enormous capability to spread, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We should also point out that the First Amendment does  Protect Nazis and Ku Klux Klan in that government is not allowed to make a law against exactly  And the exemption as we pointed out is if they if you yell fire in a crowded theater was it was Justice Brandeis his famous  Example that's not protected because that's dangerous  And that's what I was gonna say is I remember for years  Ku Klux Klan little tiny groups of 12 people in the town square and everybody would kind of mock them and laugh at them  There was never any violence. They just do their little thing and they and they go off  Yeah, and it was tolerated in the name of free speech a lot of people didn't like it  Right, but it was tolerated in the name of free speech. They got a permit and they were allowed to do it  The right thing to probably to do would be to surround their protest with peaceful with more speed counter protesters with more speech  It's different though on the net is see we're in terra incognita. This is a very different world  Yeah, should the cloud flare does cloud flare now have to block. Let's say they protect ISIS sites  I don't know that they do I'm not saying they do but they have to then now they have to go and look for them  Right. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the thing with the thing with the algorithmically sorted internet, which is almost the entire internet  These days when you're when you're going for content is that it's a dumb beast that we haven't figured it out yet  So essentially let's say that let's say you know, I I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google block Daily Stormer search results

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know  But but I think to a certain extent they should because what happens is if you are have a certain  thing that you look into a lot it'll give you more of it and and  More of it and more of it and the more you get in to this rabbit hole the more extreme the content  You can follow that all the way to the worst parts of YouTube

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  For example where right but you have to have people allowed to search for that for research purposes for government purposes  I mean, that's  Messing with search results. Oh Jeff would love this. This is it. Well

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're not gonna come to the answer here. I think we know we've demonstrated how tough this is. It is. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  absolutely, and it's it's a tough call and  What again and then you have the issue of international, you know different nations have different values  Only the US has the First Amendment other countries have different takes on free speech in Germany  For example, most of the just the t-shirts these guys were wearing would have put them in jail. Yeah, so  You know, it's it's it's a really really tough thing. It's it's interesting though by going so far and you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Plowing a car into a yeah band of counter protesters for instance and killing one and injuring many  You're right they raised the level so while we while people were tolerating this  The minute that happened. I think it's shifted. Yeah. Yeah, and I think the country it's interesting to watch  What happened today the country shifted not just not just Google and go daddy and cloud flare the country shifted

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely. It's it's a clarifying moment  It's it sort of forces everybody to really think about this stuff and to understand what's really going on out there, right again  I think the internet is a key part of what's different  It's a big big deal if you search right now for daily stormer on Google you get of course mostly what you get is news stories about

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, this whole issue right now, but you will get stories that link to the daily stormer  You're one link away from the daily stormer, which incidentally according to ours  Technica is down because as soon as cloud flare pulled their DOS protection DDoS protection  They got hammered. They immediately got hammered and now that you've searched for it. You're gonna get advertisements

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hammered and now that you've searched for it, you're gonna get advertisements  The torches that they have

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh my god, all right, it's such a grim subject. I don't want to belabor it  I think we've demonstrated we've just by talking about we demonstrate how hard this is  To solve and I do think there is an argument for common carrier status  For some of these are we I think we may be asking too much of these companies not for anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's algorithmic because if there's an algorithm rewarding you for with more of the same content then that's not a neutral thing  Electricity is neutral. It doesn't it doesn't entrap. You know, it doesn't draw you deeper

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a good point DDoS protection is in that's an interesting point. Yeah, you are doing something  Now cops are gotten a little bit of trouble because in the past what they had done is if somebody complained about a Nazi site  They would send the complaint on to the Nazis including email address and and and open those complainants up for harassment now  They stopped doing that almost immediately as soon as that happened. Yeah, but that show shows you this is a car  This is freaking complicated and I don't I don't know. Anyway, thank you cloud flair for solving this for us  Anyway by by doing I think doing the right thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You you want to talk about the pixel phone because you know how I am super psyched about next-generation Google phones

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you be hey, I got some good news  I got an email this morning from Andy Rubin saying your essential phone is ready. Oh, wow, there's an  Andy I can't wait. There's actually an event Friday for essential. Yes. Okay, and of course  Neck and I ordered it and I should have it within seven days. So I made a deal with Jason Howlett all about Android  I said if it comes by Tuesday, you can have it for all about and you can have it and use it on all that  Comes after that it's mine, but the problem is I don't think either of us are gonna want to hold on to it for too  Long. We should just say Andy Rubin who's created  Android the operating system  Yeah  Sold it to Google ran Android for many years eventually moved on in Google to do something else then left Google and this was his  Next act is a Android phone before all that was sidekick sidekick. That's right. Yeah, you know, he's got great credentials  But what can you do, you know?  Is he a one-hit wonder well, it's not even I know I don't think it's that I think he's a genius  He's brilliant. What can you do today with an Android phone that would be in any way?  Different yeah, it's really a challenge. Yeah, he's doing the Motorola thing with he's got this the  Poco pins in the back so you can attach not just cameras, but other things  He's a bezel is design. I have to say that I would you would be nuts to buy a phone with a bezel

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You look so 2016. Yeah, wait, no the Google phone the new the new FCC filing for the pixel 2 has no that  Looks like it has a bezel crap

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google has to be said also that black moon is a great name for something shipping around the time of the eclipse

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the code name black moon. Well, it's really the black Sun

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true excuse me be the eclipse is designed well

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, the essential the essential phone you could get pure white or black moon. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe they'll come on it. It'll come on Monday. That'd be fun if it came during the eclipse

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you is Andy Rubin that clever the Sun would come back and there's a package?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So do they do the FCC filing have oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is what the SEC filings for the pixel 2 so just not to confuse things more so we're talking about

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, we're done for no, we're done with the essential phone. No, no, we can't be done because they're more hundred million

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What well we talked about them raising their money WUT  We talked about this last week. Didn't we the essential phone running its news. That's okay. Go ahead. Oh, okay  But now they're a unicorn. They haven't shipped a phone. Oh, I look at the phone and I'm like  How can you be worth a billion dollars when you haven't?  Did they I mean were there lots of people like you well, I just I don't I think that the money raised was not

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The phone it was there. They have a smart home. They're home

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that their smart home thing isn't even coming. I mean, that's the least fleshed out part of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the value was Andy Rubin himself everything that he's created. He's sold spot by  You know for huge amounts of money so they're gonna have a docking station

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Uh-huh, but he did danger and that was like a five hundred million dollar deal

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was back in the days before that was a unicorn for those times. Yeah, that was

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That guys that guys they say you can drop it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wait, is this the essential or are we done with that? No, I'm not done with it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's made out of titanium  Not aluminum or tight if you say aluminum do you say titanium I think you should

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just out of fairness. Hey, it's all Johnny. I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's made of titanium

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really what I mean honest if it's a aluminum  Alright, I'm just saying  Now they have other colors too. I got black moon. They have pure white stellar gray and ocean depths is pretty  Puke green

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I feel like stellar gray is such an oxymoron

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You hear that yeah, so is black moon  Well, not really you can't see it, but it's black  With the essential phone stunning edge-to-edge display. This is the one with the notch  although  You know that notch is gonna look prescient when the next iPhone comes out because it has a bigger notch  Supposedly what we've seen in the middle because it has to accommodate all those extra sensors and then Samsung will come out with the biggest

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The new the new super notch the not the not the note notch

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I you know, we are I ordered it. It's 800 bucks or something. It's ridiculous expensive. It's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ridiculously cheap compared to the upcoming iPhone. Yeah, maybe yeah  That's what they're trying to do is have a really premium Android phone. I'll have a review for you by next

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Show it now. This is the home base. This is where I think the investment is this looks like a nest  Kind of it's got a it's got a screen face, but it's sitting down instead of on the wall

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But he wants it to run all of the all of the assistance. Well, you're the IOT person Stacy. You think this is credible

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, he hasn't said enough for me to determine if it's credible  I mean the data on the home is like it'll be magic everything will talk to everything else and I've heard that a thousand times  so I'm kind of like  Maybe I imagine if I could get my hands on an investor  Deck there'd be information that I could use and be like, oh it really is worth a billion dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we'll see I think this is a very bad time to be a new phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You got the very bad time to be a smart home too  I mean, honestly, this is the year of the winnowing the winnowing winnowing the smart home the winnowing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's after the conjuring

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, cuz we you saying that cuz of Apple the home I know I'm saying of it because there's a lot of companies that got money  have  Either died or been acquired. It's just it's time. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's been time for a long time  This thing is that this is next to the PC  TV convergence. This has been the most overhyped and under delivered technology

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Category and wearables to I think I think the the wristwatch wearable  Revolution did kind of like yeah, and we thought everybody thought that was gonna be enormous

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Everybody be wearing a smartwatch. So I was gonna say everybody thought this well, I'm wearing one but I'm an idiot

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm gonna fit it. I think it's smartwatch is a demonstration. You're not so smart  I  Think you fell for it. You're right. We fell for the market

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a $400 device that does that gives you $25 worth of value. Yeah, I'll show you how smart I am

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I bought the $1,200 device. This is the  Edition the ceramic because I think ceramic I'm as interested in the material  Yeah, and it you know to it doesn't cool hasn't scratched  All right, but my original point is what a crappy time to release a phone Andy  You've got the note 8 is gonna be announced on Wednesday probably for pre-order and delivery  typically Samsung  Announces you order and you get it pretty quickly like the next week or two  So I the note 8 is gonna hit the market and the reason they want to hit the market now is because the iPhone will be  announced within a month almost certainly  Within a month almost certainly  Latest iPhone and it's gonna be fancy  Schmancy it ought to be for it more than a thousand dollars. There'll be three. It's the latest thinking is there'll be three iPhones. They'll be  Something equivalent to a 7 plus. I'm sorry 7s and 7s plus  And then there'll be the iPhone 10 or iPhone Pro or maybe just iPhone  Right  That was this those are the three names last yesterday and last make-break weekly. We talked about this. Those are the potentials  I'm going for the pro cuz they even asked an iMac Pro right and they have the iPad Pro. I'm going for iPhone Pro. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No matter what pro all the way. Yeah, you are professional

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like one of those armor sets you get in World of Warcraft  You got to collect the whole right pro set if you want to be fully protected. It's exactly like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mm-hmm. I have the  the myth of witch crafting  armor set and the  Boots of Legionnaires disease. I'm ready. I'm ready to go

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Back to your point though. I mean what I'm curious about is Andy Rubin is a really smart guy

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sidekick and Android were both completely out-of-the-box products and great. I loved my sidekick. Oh, yeah loved my son

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and so I way ahead of its there's got to be something about this phone that we don't know about yet that  Justifies its existence. It can't just be another Android phone. It can't you know made out of titanium here. It might be I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fear it my we're such peak phone  It's hard to imagine what you would do if you have an ecosystem a massive ecosystem as Apple does you could push people?  To AR kit right you can't as Andy Rubin  with a phone nobody has push people into  Whatever it is. He's hoping to create a platform for there's no way this can be a platform  You don't have enough cloud. Yeah, I think timing  I think timing is and you might have made the same argument with sidekick the timing on that was it was too early, right?  This might be too late. Yeah, and  Then so let's talk about the pixel. So Google's pixel phones the pixel 2 are not expected to be out  What's the latest you said they just went for FCC approval?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, there was an FCC filing for the HTC Google pixel 2 so we're not sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The big one is the LG and the HTC will be the little one  They this the thinking is that HTC is gonna put its dopey squeeze me feature in  Is  Dopey it says that me oh it does it says in the file it says it says active edge

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah squeeze features part of the filing. So why do you call it dopey? I'm curious cuz I I really like I  Loved my moto because it had those kind of short

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Moto X you if you did if you shook it like this it would launch the kit, you know  Like twist your wrist right watch the camera. Yeah, what was the flashlight was a V?  You just shook it twice or something. Oh, I thought that was just

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, the camera was a you just twisted it. Okay, this is like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the problem  No, you did this you did this and then you did this yeah, and I would always turn the flashlight on by accident

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this squeeze karate chop, that's what it was. That's how I always I was I was like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was another one what was the other one I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just did the camera in the karate chop. I think it was when you picked it up. It just turned on  Yeah, oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, or if you put it down in the phone would hang out something something like that  But the point is that those kinds of things are theoretically cool. I think what where we're headed because of AR  We're getting all these like there's a rumor that the next iPhone will have a laser in it  but all these phones will have ways to detect what's going on in 3d and space and  Distance which means we'll be able to use in the air gestures the phone on the table  We'll be able to like swipe through things by doing this all some phones already do that, of course  But those will become more sophisticated. I think and and that that's gonna be pretty great

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't have a problem with gestures, but they have to be organic. They have to be fit into for instance  Most Android phones have a gesture where if you shake it  We were so angry. It then pops up a tech support bug. Yeah bug report  That seems organic and natural because you're already pissed off and you're shaking her crush

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I feel like a lot of things weren't originally organic. So remember turning on the iPhone pinch to zoom

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Swiping they don't do you think that felt?  Pinching is what's happening. You're making it bigger. That's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, and no, I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm afraid to ask but what else gets bigger when you when you pinch it? I mean, I know it looks odd

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But what I'm trying to do is I'm just I just feel like that's that's exactly right. You want to make that bigger  You go like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is a natural perfect example of an organic gesture. But why is that natural? What else in the world does that?  Well

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Apple picked a gesture that made sense for people actually and maybe predated Apple, but okay. Sorry  You're right. Sorry, but the gesture there made sense and I don't know if it was organic so much as they picked something  That seemed more natural now. I think that I mean, I'll be honest  I think that turning your camera turning your phone around to open the camera  Does seem kind of natural because yeah, you're looking at it and you're like, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the challenge though because you can't do it just once because that would happen accidentally so you have to do it twice I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Think you just did it. I feel like you just did it once I want to take a selfie when I do you just had to have a  enough like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's a good example. How about double tap to zoom? Does that seem and that was something that Apple did?  invent for Safari  So you could be looking at a web page and a web page on a small screen would be too small you double tap the  Paragraph and it brilliantly zoomed just to fill the screen just right  Yeah, that wouldn't I guess that would be one where you that wouldn't be a natural gesture, but it but we quickly incorporated it  Yeah, yeah  So so okay, so I the counter example is I think  proves that you could have a gesture that doesn't natural but does become part of the  Vocabulary and you read you need you do need to expand the vocab user interface vocabulary  Especially with things like phones and watches where you're really limited so squeeze to get back to squeeze  What does squeeze do I know it's on the HTC builds your forearm muscles?  You squeeze the phone has to be so  That comes natural is at least if it's not organic at least makes sense after you do it a few times  But isn't triggered accidentally and I guess I feel like I squeeze my phone a lot  Like you're holding it. Yeah, I mean it's sometimes you would hold it hard. Maybe not  Does anybody in the chat room have one of these HTC? What is it the 11?  I'm curious what it what it does. Anyway, this will be HTC will build this into the new  pixel to small version  Yeah, it's the u11 it's branded as active edge it's in the languages input and gestures setting  It's to launch macro you can program launches no launch well, maybe it is but on on delivery  It launches the Google Assistant that I like  It's not intuitive but  Maybe it would be because you need an easy way to launch the assistant and it can't be okay. You know who yeah, right?  That's that's not that's problematic  All right  All right  So you squeeze it now, but what's gonna be weird is the bigger pixel made by LG will not have that feature  I don't think  Storage is listed as 50 gigabyte. This is all from the FCC filing 50 gigabytes free  When 21% is used that means well, it's a 64 gig  capacity  The device's processor  Is likely to be a  hmm  It's either a snapdragon 660 or an 835 could be a 35, right?  It's gotta be the 835 that's they know that because the Qualcomm Wi-Fi chip used only works with those two snapdragons  So it'll be an 835  Doesn't I don't think there's any information about screen resolution or actual size  See here be model G 0 1 1 a made in Taiwan  these  Are the screenshots?  This is oh they have to show I guess the FCC where you would find the legal information FCC very kindly allowed phone  Manufacturers to stop it printing that on the back of the phone  It was so ugly, but you have to still show them you've got that information and where it's where it's hiding  I guess under legal information. All right. Well, I guess that's all we know  But if the okay so FCC how okay, here's a question how long does FCC approval take

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're not a lot of times. Well a lot of times you don't file with the FCC until you're ready to launch it is  Historically what companies do because this outs what you're doing, right? So it's ready

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it can't be delivered until you get FCC approval  You get FCC approval

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, but that can take as little as like a week to a month  And if you're like a vendor like HTC or LG and know what you're doing  That's I mean unless you've got some weird bits and bobs in there  But then you could redact everything if they didn't redact everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I gotta think that and and and today and they are in a hurry because they're gonna have a few good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know short period of time before the iPhone hits. Well, remember last year both Google and Samsung announced right before the Apple  That's not good. I don't think Google's gonna be able to do it. I mean Apple's event will this is the 16th  Yeah, it will almost certainly be in the next month

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I don't I September's I don't think they're gonna ship the super phone on that day  I think they're gonna say well comes out in November. It's funny

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's been back and forth on that the latest supply chain rumors from Ming Chi Kuo  Who has been pretty good?  This close especially with supply chain things is that all three phones will ship at the same time

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And how does he not call his site the status quo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because he works for some other company  Some some analysts some securities company, you know, and that's very possible

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But maybe they all ship in of them  I just it seems like the way the way the rumors are the rumors about they're still deciding on various things

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's always true, but we're getting close now  I  Will be willing to bet that Apple will be on a normal schedule  Their parent according to again to quote they are in ramped up production on them all three models  So I've seen  leaked videos of them, so  I'm gonna guess  That usually they do it  They have to wait till after Labor Day. So they would do it on the Wednesday after Labor Day typically. Yeah, which would be this year. I  Think we said September 8th. Let me look at my calendar and  then  So September 6th is the Wednesday after Labor Day  Renee Richie, I think thought maybe they throw everybody a monkey wrench and do it on the 8th the Friday  Yeah, or if they want to wait then the Tuesday Monday or Tuesday after that which would be the 11th or 12th  Typically in the past and this has been true for several years  They will give they will say pre-orders on Friday delivery two weeks after that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do we know if they are ready to announce and use the Steve Jobs amphitheater at Apple?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I asked that too cuz that's the and I'd be shocked if they weren't it's the 10th anniversary iPhone

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The thing to understand about that is is genius for secrecy  you can announce the event the day before right and everybody would show up and  You'd have no like people taking pictures of the banners and stuff like that at in San Francisco

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the campuses is being occupied in fact  Yeah, it's not a Google story. But that's one of the stories is that people who hate it they hate it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, the open plan. Yes, really bad idea. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I shouldn't laugh. That's sad. People always hate new offices

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  but but  Open plans are particularly irritating. Yeah, they're a bad idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is not the one I want to show and somebody in the chat room said that the Apple Park isn't ready and stuff like that  They haven't planted grass and stuff like that. But that doesn't the amphitheater is kind of a separate thing  It's it's on the property, but the parking for it is outside the property  so when you when there is an event you park sort of across the street and  Then they shuttle you in or there's a secret tunnel or I don't know how you get there  But basically it doesn't matter if the rest of the campuses avail is ready to go or not  The the amphitheater is its own thing and nobody knows how done that is now this this is about three weeks old

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They've actually stopped drones now from flying over. Yeah, so this is the last road. This is Duncan sinfield's there's by the way  Oh, it's done. That's ready. Look in there that I would say that's this the Steve Jobs theater is the little staircase where you go down into  Yeah, and we can't we'll never know you see the staircase there. We'll never know  What's underground whether that's ready because we can't see it, but I think this is ready  Yeah, it looks pretty ready. That was three weeks ago three weeks from now or four weeks from now. Of course, that'll be ready

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Admittedly, it's gonna be muddy and dirty, but they'll I would know then it may not be ready by Apple standards

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's interesting. Boy. This is a this is a chance to get a lot of press for your campus  Yeah, it is the 10th anniversary iPhone. Yeah, they do have that problem if they want to get  You know Flint Center, which is probably where they would have it in San Jose, right? They'd have to book it already  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean really they don't for the exterior the parts where they would allow the riffraff press to wander around  They don't they're gonna plant grass. You can put turf on this and have it ready. They're gonna roll it out  Like you know like like a rug

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The trees are all in  They're not gonna bring them into the inner circle  In fact, that's part of the fact that that is the thing that Andy and Ako and Renee which yet our Macbrake weekly  Said would be the thing that would hold it up is if they weren't able to control  Journalists and keep them in the Steve Jobs theater area. That's Renee Richie anywhere near this campus until it's completely  Yeah, you don't want but but on the other hand what I what I mean, I'm sure this is what they've been shooting for  Yeah, it would be a little bit of a letdown

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If they couldn't do this, right I would think it we've all we've all I mean if you've ever built anything, you know that  And I haven't it's kind of like you're like they'll be like you'll be in by Christmas or you'll be in by this date  and then you know a permit gets delayed or a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Contractor gets sick or tell me if I'm wrong. That's somebody saying  Oh, you can't have people until there's an occupancy license, but they are putting employees in right? Yes, they are  So they have an occupancy license. I think they do

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  so I think they're I think it's I mean really it's  The the external parts of it look less like we're saying they look less done than they actually are this did they're just you know  Right, they have to move the mounds of dirt move the trucks off and put some grass down

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're pretty much that stuff always looks bad right up to the day, right? Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and there's but there is a lot like  Again, anytime you move into a renovation or renovated office new office new home, whatever  There's always that that last ten percent that is like I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Takes forever, you know, it's so true you you did you build your house or just  Ma we built it you built it. So, you know, we built it  Oh god, it was but I would also say that it also just before occupation looks like they're never gonna get this done and then boom  It's suddenly right. Yeah, that's true

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The the two most surprising things about building a house or framing cuz that's like super fast and you're like, whoa, it's done  there's a house there Wow and then  Then like the week before you move in wouldn't like, you know, there's electric wires hanging out of walls and crap everywhere  And you're like this isn't gonna happen. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Love really being completely unhandy and not knowing anything because it's just magic to me. Yeah, it's a miracle  Nobody knows how it works. It's like David Copperfield. He made a house appear  Yeah, sure. It took nine months longer and a hundred thousand dollars more, but he made it happen. Yeah  Magic  Let's take a break Stacey Higginbotham is here  I didn't really give you a good enough plug at the beginning iot podcast comm for her show that she does with the beautiful  talented and ever so lovely  Kevin Toffle  How's Kevin doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and it's a great way to see I think this is better than the  Travel I tend to do it's not touring you're going you're gonna stay in a place  You're gonna experience the food and wine of that place. You're gonna cook you're gonna have a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Make we're gonna learn how to make cheese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Astronomant excellent, but but not the good stuff. Well, we also we also hope

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We've decided that we're gonna do some in Sonoma as well sometime in the future. So, oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  Mexico City one, but there's no dates yet. So I have no idea we're gonna do that Morocco Prosecco Italy  Southern France. Yep. Wow, so no, I don't see Prosecco Italy. It's not up

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, pages are going a couple of days. But yeah, and if you um, yeah, it's  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Say next year I turn 40 and I'm looking for a great event for my best friend

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, one of the things that for the nerd audience one of the things you can do what we that we can do is we can  Give people an experience that they couldn't do on their own. So for example, the house we're staying at in Barcelona has gigabit fiber  Connectivity try tell me that try finding that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  From there

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so we try to do that at all the places where we stay so it's okay nerd now now my mind is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just blown blown  So is your friend turning 40 also?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Where our birthdays are like 12 days, isn't that all I've noticed I was 11. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's so cute. So when I sat down and Mike you'll vouch for this I sat down and I saw oh  There's somebody at my front door  I  Guess it's a delivery. Yeah  This is actually great. This is the ring video doorbell. It's a camera  That is your doorbell  It's a camera microphone and speaker if they ring the doorbell it goes to none on my phone and I can pick it up and  Say yeah, what do you want?  Now that's nice for security because even if you're not home anywhere in the world you're on the internet  Your your doorbells on the internet so you could say I'm not here which is great  So because burglars often will ring the doorbell first wait. I'll see if you're home then go around back and break in  This way you're always home. Even if you're not you can also keep an eye on those packages and I since I get so many packages  This is a boon for me. I say yeah, just leave it there  I'll be right out or whatever and it I don't miss packages and I know that they're safe because I could keep an eye on  The ring doorbell but now rings gone to the next level  We knew this would happen when they got that big investment from Richard Branson and his investor group  We knew that that was just the beginning for because Jamie Simonoff the CEO is really a creative smart guy  They've added a couple of things we've mentioned before their stick-up cam now  They have I love these the floodlight cams and this makes sense  You've probably already seen I certainly even had  Floodlights that light up when you come down the the side of your house or the back of your house. They light up. That's nice  That's a convenience. It has some security because you know, it turns on burglars  No, though people have automatic lights, but with the ring floodlight cam  You also have the camera the speaker and the microphone so you can hear them  You can talk to them say yeah, can I help you that I gotta tell you if you're a bad guy  You're walking behind a house and you don't want that light comes on and somebody says can I help you?  I think that's pretty much it. But if it isn't if you get one of those  Persistent guys there's a button on the interface you press that sets off 110 decibel alarm and they go run in

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's so much fun. It's also great for you kids. Get off my lawn

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, get off my lawn. Yeah, you know what I use to scare off the deer  Yeah, cuz they're always eating our roses

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and and I have a whole section in the book that I'm doing a book on the on the  Gastronomad lifestyle and it's on the ring video doorbell. I recommend that everybody who travels you bring it with you  Yeah, I use mounting putty and I just put it there and I have a smart

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's yeah because the original has a battery in it that you charge exactly. So and it lasts a year. So you could last forever

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and so this is great. Like for example when we were living in Mexico. Oh, that's so bright  It was like it was fantastic  and and  They there are a lot of people come door to door in Mexico to sell things like you get bottled water  they're hawking at us right and  You don't know if they're like moonlighting is like, you know, maybe they're checking out if nobody's home whatever  But they you can never tell if somebody's not home because when they ring the bell and you answer they assume probably that you're there  And in any event you're getting video, but if you try is not just for your home folks

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is fantastic. That's a really smart idea bring it to your Airbnb  Yeah, they did this in Wilshire Park a suburb of Los Angeles  If you go to ring comm and look at the neighborhood section ring comm slash twig and then click neighborhoods  They gave not everybody but 10% one in ten homes a ring doorbell in six months burglaries down  So now they have a whole program called the ring neighborhoods beta  It's basically a digital neighborhood watch and you could be part of that. I know isn't that interesting? Yeah, so I have a ring on mine  My some of my neighbors have  The ring as well. So we in effect and you have to give permission and they have to give permission  But I can see their doorbell. Yeah, so  It's it is a neighborhood watch. Yeah, it's really I  Mean anyway, go to ring comm slash twig get started with a ring of security kit the doorbell of your choice in either one  Two or three ring floodlight cams you'll get up to $150 off  Find out more about ring ring comm  Slash twig because we want to make sure that this week in Google gets the credit ring comm  Slash twig we thank rings for much of their support  What else what else there's so many things to talk about today?  We did fortunately get all the phones. Should I set up aloe for the desktop? I was just gonna ask like who's using

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  aloe  Happens with hangouts

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where so Google make which already has the most confusing messaging?  Strategy anybody can imagine now has made it worse  You'd think it's better because when I first read it I went oh good because one of the things missing from aloe one of many  Was the ability to use aloe on the desktop, right? That's a nice  Feature because I use that in hangouts all the time, right?  I use it in Apple's messages if I have a Mac if that's the problem is you have to have a Mac available  But if you have a Mac available or you do it on your iPad if you get a message  You can respond. I don't like to type on my phone  So actually will open up my iPad were more likely my laptop and respond there same thing with hangouts  So now aloe apparently so I've got all excited. Oh neat  So you probably shouldn't show that on the air, but that's okay if I quickly sign up for it  Otherwise everybody's gonna sign up for my aloe  So so I'm gonna okay go to aloe  Allow because what you're doing is you're connecting. Okay now you can show it because well, maybe not better not show it this you can show  so what happens is  Now that fired up a web version of aloe, but the problem is it's getting all the chats from my phone  I have to be using an Android phone aloe on an Android phone if there isn't really a presence on the web  You have to be using Chrome. Yep, and really all it is is a is a chrome based interface to aloe  So now from now on I can bookmark aloe.google.com  Slash web and I have a web based interface to aloe  But if my phone isn't on if I turn my phone off, I think it won't work

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The iOS support is coming soon they say right now it's only Android but you know the thing so yes  It's super confusing that their whole messaging. Nobody understands it. Nobody

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they're close if you let it work with Firefox if you let it work on the iPhone  It I mean on a Macintosh doesn't women I can't use Chrome on a Macintosh to do this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You cannot not right now. Oh, well, there is aloe for an iPhone  Yeah, the phone has to be my iPhone it works on Chrome. I'm sorry the anywhere. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But doesn't work with iPhones. You're right. You have to use the phone for now and the iPhone support is coming  So I found so that's close and then there's one more step. Let it do SMS. That's exactly that's the thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Then it's a full service messenger, right and we can all move to it  But but but and they haven't done that but if that happens and I hope it does  the thing that's potentially great about aloe is the  Assistant built in but but it's I don't know if it still does this because I haven't used it in a while  But in the beginning it was like it would interject itself into your conversations

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You'd be talking to somebody chatting back. So let's say I'm chatting with you and we did this  I think maybe I was Jeff. I said hey, let's go to you want to go to a restaurant tonight, and then it says well  Here's some restaurants. Yes, and you can make a reservation, right and it's fantastic and I want that so badly

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want I want Google in my message. I want I want  I want Google all up in my business. All up in my business. All up in it  Because I because really that's the that's the future of how computers will work. They'll be listening and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Helpfully suggesting things all the time. Now. Here's an interesting point when you're on the web  I can't talk to the assistant. I have to type to the assistant. Yeah, that's not terrible  All it needs is SMS now, right? Maybe right? Yeah, I just like converted everyone over to Hangouts  I know and Hangouts is only any good if you use Google voice numbers or you're a FI customer, right?  Because if you're not it doesn't do SMS, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and I'm nervous I would be nervous about Hangouts because I think at some point they're going to  Sort of cut off the people who are not using well, and then they created Android Messenger

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, which they say no, even if you're a FI user you really should be using Android Messenger. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's nuts, yeah, it's nuts, please Google and people love messenger messenger is a really really great app  Messenger messenger. Yeah, absolutely  Which is Google's good good so  Messenger is is designed so that it can be the default app on your phone for messaging, right?  when you get an Android phone it can have messenger as the way that you do SMS and  A lot of people love it. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what I use you can what Android Messenger?  Surprise which messenger that messenger? All right, so I just created a selfie  Let me just let me just chat and send myself a selfie of me based on a picture of me  Does this look like me? I?  Don't think so not really

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  Yeah, I can't handle it either. That's somebody in the chat room said forget naming it Google. Allo. They should call it Google silo

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Good one chat room good. Oh, yeah, it is. It's Android messages. Yes, that is that is a good app  It works now good show title. Remember when we were talking about RCS

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So yeah, that's one reason they want you to use messages because it supports rich communication services  Why can't allo?  The most why can't allo I give you that and furthermore we talked about it  This is the replacement for SMS and the carriers you would think would be happy to replace SMS that their days of making any  Money on it are gone. They did make a lot of money on it  but  Most of the characters in many manufacturers  But  Most of the characters in many manufacturers aren't gonna do it and if they don't do it  Then what's it's again silo not a low. Yeah  Okay, so our we want alo to support RCS. I would like it to support XMP remember g-talk those are the right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  G talk

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would like it to support  Every phone every desktop every browser. Yes, that's all is that too much to ask

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's all what wouldn't the world would not be so hard if we hadn't broken the internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But what's so we've never figured out maybe Mike you weren't here. We've debated this over and over and why isn't Google?  Doing the obvious you and I and everybody else watching the show knows the right thing to do. Why aren't they doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  they have a bunch of weird obscure reasons for it and  They just need to figure out how to just make it happen because they can  They did it's not hard, but if they did everybody would use it if they had one so there's a few possibilities

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like Microsoft where they have different fiefdoms battling and neither one has a sentinel. No, it's like Game of Thrones  They're all fighting for Westeros. That's not what's happening. Westeros is us. It's all under what's-his-name  Okay, so if it's not that then are they worried about the carriers?  Do they somehow need carrier buy-in are they afraid of being too aggressive and then making the carriers unhappy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, they've launched fiber that was that was a pretty  Screw you guys. That's a good point in Google. Phi is also kind of a screw you carriers. No. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what? I would even be happy if they said well if you have to have five  That'd be okay with me. Of course. I have fine. Yeah  But five's very good  It only works on Google Pixel phones, but frankly, that's the only entry phones. I really recommend. I mean because of security  Yeah, anyway, I don't it's so frustrating if you're a Googler and you would like to explain to us  Why you have this broken strategy on messaging? I would love to hear it because if you don't fix it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is face Facebook or somebody's gonna beat him? Well, you know the well Facebook is just clobbering everybody on users  They've got they've got whatsapp Instagram Facebook Messenger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, really like right and I messages this is a lot of confusion around that I messages the service that Apple  messages the app messages is the app and  And and so you can you can use one or the other you can use it from the desktop  But what you can't do is you can't I mean if you if you do want to communicate with somebody on Android you have  To do it through SMS and they you know on the phone they turn green.

They're changing in a ways that people don't really understand. Nobody knows what the roadmap is, right?  And so it's like what do you use?  You know you use whatsapp. That's what you use

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep, it's a this is this is you quote a Google spokesperson saying we've designed specific products for distinct use cases  So we don't intend to have one app that does everything for everyone. Yeah, which is a terrible

Transcript:  That's okay  YouTube is testing a very interesting new feature, which I think is brilliant  See we we we give us and we take us away  YouTube is testing a number on the video that you're watching that tells you how many other people are also watching this video

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know this brings up another topic which is Facebook  TV and I got a glimpse of it the other day at my son's house and they  What they're saying is that they're bringing social networking into television  Which is a brilliant idea and which YouTube really needs to do and this looks like it might be a start of that  But they show you all the chatter from everybody not just from your friends  Who gives a rat's heiny because you're in a larger community. I'm not I don't want anything to do with that  You know if somebody I know comments on a TV show that I'm watching live, that's amazing  That's great

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And if he Facebook's the only one that can do that because generally speaking they know your social graph generally speaking when you're in a chat  Environment like that, you know our chat room

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They don't know who you know don't know but Facebook does think of think of the Oscars or think of major news events where your friends?  Actual friends that you know are you're all chatting on the screen that you're all watching. That's  Why doesn't somebody do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, that would be amazing, you know why they don't do it because unlike you most of us don't have any friends  It would be really slow in there  That's why there'd be one comment every hour but it's something like Game of Thrones what if we could all yeah, so to this point  Facebook's investing how many how much money a lot of money into into original programming  Apple just announced they're gonna spend 1 billion dollars, which I thought sounded like a lot  yeah, and and then and then it said that's about 10 shows and that  HBO spends twice that yeah, and that Netflix spends 10 times that yeah  Yeah, well six billion six times that yeah  Wow, yep TV productions expensive. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Leo's like I'm doing something wrong. I should be spending billions on this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Billions millions. Why aren't I spending billions?  So a billion dollars Apple has demonstrated a complete inability to create content anybody wants to watch with the planet of the apps  Oh my goodness, has anybody watched carpool karaoke? Yes. It's terrible. They've ruined it. How could you ruin such a easy?  It's easy. I'll tell you how they really they made it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Professional. Yeah, it used to be this casual like, you know camera in the car. Well, it was a bit. Yeah, it wasn't the whole show exactly  But there's product placement in it and it's just it's just horrible and in the old show they had James Corden

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Singing and hosting. Yeah now there's no it looks like he's in the t's there's no host

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He does some of them and then sometimes he doesn't and that doesn't work either

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But for the most part it looks like just the karaoke  Right. It's it's the two. It's just riding along  Rides the two two singing in the car. Yeah Game of Thrones

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like, you know, it's thematic in terms of who's in the car. Let me let's see here  It's just awful. This is from Apple. This is and they have super high production values and that oddly ruins it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nothing. Oh, he's there's cordon in the back John legends driving Alicia Keys is in the shotgun

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Some things to sing because I think you can make any statement. This is more like the original

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had John you first. Okay, do you need a lift bro?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, I'm done

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What you what you notice when you watch it is that it's it's more it feels more scripted more produced and simultaneously less fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's got to be like this show. It's got to be just like Apple has demonstrated in an ability to create good content

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have hired two people from Hollywood  At EQ is apparently at Apple  Determined to make this and if you think about it, there is an upside because right now you have to be an Apple music  Subscriber I think you do you do so they could make some I mean, this is like HBO. This is a profit. Yeah profit  But you have to make content people want to watch will throwing a billion dollars at it change that I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Don't think so Paul. Did you see that Paul Thurotte wrote about hands-free calling coming to Google home? No. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, well you did it today he didn't mention it to me and I was just talking to him

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's why I was wondering if y'all tried it. Oh, it's rolling out today  It's rolling out this week. So mine doesn't have it. So I was like, oh wait, I have to have a home here

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I should have a home here somebody bring me a home  We have a home. Oh  Jeff has a home. So the idea I know the idea was this was announced at Google IO some months ago  That you and I thought this was a killer feature although the rest is it works with phone phones  Right dress you kind of laughed at me, but I thought this is disruptive. You can call any phone from your Google home. Yeah  free US and Canada and  I just thought that was kind of disruptive like everybody to do that. Yeah  But okay, so that's rolling out. So anybody anybody home?  Yes, that's the geek says fetch me a home  You can see how well that worked yeah, I don't see everybody's scrambling  Oh, wait, do we not have a home somebody came in empty-handed? I have several at home  Yeah, and mine doesn't have it. I checked. I think everybody brought him home. Okay, would somebody in the chat room?  Would you try it call Leo and  And I'm also curious. What what is the caller ID? They said it would be your number  What did they say I think they said it would be your number  The call recipient will see either unknown or no caller ID  Google says it will display your mobile number by the end of the year instead your mobile  And if you're a Google fire Google voice fuser, you can have it display that number now  So I could have it display my Google voice or five number, which is the same  So I gave out my number and I realized this show will be downloaded and listen to  By roughly a hundred thousand people over the next and they'll all be calling you over the next week  I've just made my phone completely unusable huge mistake  I thought will only be unusable for a you know, a couple hours cloud cloud flair from the phone  Huh  No, you don't have to bleep it oh  They're gonna bleep it. So only those of you listening live Lisa and the voice of reason right there. Oh, we're bleeping it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Too bad I'm making it the title of the show

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Routing around the censorship running around the censorship

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it turns out Papa John's has tried something that's been a massive success ordering pizza on Facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  TGI Friday started this letting you pay with your Amazon account and  Papa John's has now taken over the Amazon account  And  Papa John's has now declared itself an e-commerce company after delivering surprisingly strong results  So  This is a graphic from Bloomberg, which I just like the name of it online and hungry  Internet users who have ordered food delivery in the past year  69.4 percent. Well, I have have you Stacy  You live in Austin I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Order from like uber eats or from Amazon restaurants. Okay. Yeah, sure. I do that like weekly daily you do it Mike

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sure yeah, absolutely. Can you do it in Europe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you can yeah, we have a lot of infrastructure here. There's grub hub and food learn. There's dozens of come

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They have you know, that's that's you can do that stuff all over Europe. Okay, but this makes sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean like think about how I mesh people get into Facebook and oh my god  If you're hungry and you leave Facebook and turn it off and your eyeballs are not being monetized  But if you order pizza, not only do you not leave Facebook?  But Facebook's like see we're legit platform that you know, you should pay us to be on

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess it's actually in the ad you can see an ad for a pizza. This is very dangerous for yeah  You see that for a pizza you go and you click it and you can order it right there  The company began accepting orders on Facebook in June  The feature was an instant hit hundreds of orders flowed into the first few hours  Digital orders now make up 60% of Papa John's sales  Completely in a few months transforming their business into yes an e-commerce business  amazing  Pizza is a good one because pizza is a real impulse spy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the digital version of having something at the cash register and you're standing there and you're like well  I'll take it. It's in there at the cash register. I might buy it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  McDonald's has a McDelivery program  using uber eats

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, this is this is all gonna make us so much healthier

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Denny's started one. I just saw an ad for Denny's ordering online, but I don't think it's in Facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If I order before 430, can I get the early bird specials?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just think breakfast is not a great meal to deliver like a cold omelet. Right like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's interesting. I read a review of a new restaurant in New York City  That is created by some very high-end  restaurateurs and chefs and  The they have ten dishes, but they're all designed to be deliverable  You can go and get it brilliant and eat it  But they've designed the meals in such a way that they should hold up in a cardboard container for half an hour

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's why Chinese food is such a great delivery food because it delivers so well and it reheats

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know except for the fried stuff the fried stuff that  The steam  No crispy but chop suey does pretty well. Yeah any of the oh, yeah noodles other stuff wet stuff yum

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Any of the wet food tastes great  Well, yeah, I think it's interesting that there you can now have impulse or impulse buying for food

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and I think this this usage is gonna be huge on on the the Google Home and the and the Amazon echoes of the  World because that's really how it should be. I should be able to just say for all the pizza places  Just say you know, I need a pizza. Where do you want it from? I want it from this this restaurant. Okay, do you want the usual?  Yes, I want the usual

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, Domino's has a skill and so you can do that with Domino's on your echo and maybe a crappy pizza

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and and the skills

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Approach is a crappy approach  Well  Yeah, but it's like, you know, it's there's there's thousands of them but it's like you have to remember it's it's almost like the  Command line world you couldn't use a DOS computer unless you memorized all the commands. That's right  You're exactly right. Yeah, and that's what the problem with it  The the the AI should pick the chill for you in time. It will it will in time. That's gonna happen now

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I will say I  Don't consistently order any one thing from a place. So  Getting like right now the logistics of getting a menu and  Do it there are very few places where I have a quote-unquote usual. Yeah, so that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't lie. That's hard to do. Don't lie. They have the Stacy Higginbotham sandwich, but it'll change  Oh my god, I've always wanted a sandwich named after me

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Higginbotham  I was I was thinking the Stacy but you know, I would also accept the Higginbotham  You know, I would also accept the Higginbotham but I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which called the Higginbotham I went to Saltlick and I ordered a Higginbotham  I have a side of Higginbotham's and two Stacy's I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like it, but but I think it'll change behavior though Stacy because I think what'll happen is it'll be I think they'll be like  Surprised me. It'll be like a blue apron or something like that where where  Trust is we'll send you like something you'll love and and you'll people I think people would actually say okay  Yeah, that sounds great. Send it to me. That sounds crazy. Well, that's what that's how the blue aprons work

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't it funny because we thought remember how everybody remember you interactive TV  Yeah, do you remember the cable companies wanted to do that? That was the early convergence, right interactive TV?  There were all these trials. There was a big trial in Florida where they put interactive TV and all people ordered was stamps. Yeah  How is the big product with stamps but they would just somehow got it wrong because we now we order food online  All the time. Yeah. Yep. What's the difference in blue? I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't even remember having to use a remote control. I mean is painful probably. Yep. Yeah, in fact

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It would time in years to come we'll say having to type it in on a website is painful  I know it is I go to we have a petal in my food taxi and you have to go through the menu it takes  It takes a while but it'd be so if that because we'll say that's painful because what we'll really just do is say  Hey echo, I'm kind of in the mood for I don't know. Do you have any salads? Maybe some salmon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And croutons. Yeah, or I want something spicy something and that's that's all it will need and walk you through it and and lead you to  to something and  But the difference I think nowadays is that it's not a new behavior actually to order something on on the internet  We're doing it with all these other products. We're used to it. Yeah, and we know how to do it  We we feel good about our credit card and all that stuff. So might as well throw food in there. Yeah, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bill Gates makes another massive donation Wow  He's running out of apples out of Microsoft stock actually he's not he's still the richest man in the world. That's what's amazing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what's amazing. Although Jeff Bezos is now closer. Yeah. Well, he was the richest for a couple of hours

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I used to be the richest man in the world. He says for a minute  Then my stock went back down Bill Gates is gonna give five billion dollars. He gives it to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation  Yeah, but he's but it's not his first gift  I mean they started the foundation with an even bigger gift 16 billion dollars  Five billion dollars in that was in 99 and two thousand five point one billion. This is now an additional gift of five billion dollars  He it's the largest gift of 2017  Although Warren Buffett gave more than three billion dollars away this year. So did Mike Michael they'll give away a billion  That's kind of I you got to praise the guy  They've given away Bill and Melinda have given away thirty five billion dollars in stock and cash since 94 and he's still  Thirty-five billion and he's still the richest man. Yeah, that's a lot of money  This is the you know, this is the magic of compound interest. Yes Warren Buffett will say yeah  You get you get to a point where you can't give it away fast enough. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's for Warren Buffett to say I know I want to give my money away  I think I'll give it to the richest guy in the world  That's who's getting my money me  but I've said this about about Zuckerberg, I tend to not think that this kind of philanthropy is as  As noble as it appears and and that's gonna sound like a horrible certainly with Mark

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was a little weird. Yeah, his wasn't exactly a direct but but but some of the stuff gates his philanthropy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think his is genuine is genuine

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The problem with it is that when you are when you after the first billion  It's all that you can't there's nothing more that you can buy materially, right?  So what you can buy is power and this kind of philanthropy gives him power. He gets a decide big deal  No, it is a big deal. He gets to decide that Africa is gonna go to GMO  Like that's not something that Africans are gonna decide  Bill Gates is gonna decide because he happens to personally like GMO crops and you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He doesn't decide it is also research  But I know your point his worldview is dictating most of what he does. I support completely

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But what but the point I'm trying to make is that there are all these  Contest contested issues out there and what billionaires like Bill Gates and and Zuckerberg are doing there's saying  You know what?  I I've bought everything I can possibly buy and now I'm going to influence the world to make the world  Match up with my own personal beliefs and I'm gonna crush other people's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Initiatives with my money. I think that's way too much if you look at the stuff he's doing  He's got small grants for things like bringing  Waste management to Africa and places that don't have utilities his malaria efforts. Those are in  All of this is backed by everybody's favorite data and he like his foundation does a really good job  Communicating with people in  researching things it is not like a typical like Zuckerberg's donation to the schools of New Jersey that felt like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I agree with you and this is why this is actually precisely why Warren Buffett  wants Bill Gates to do his philanthropy because of that process you're talking about of of  The vetting is very intense for any Bill Gates always power

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you're always gonna have people who get to make decisions. You can't have total consensus  There's always gonna be compromises and it's just a folly. It's it's kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay before you say I kind of understand what you're saying though Mike because  There are two ways Gates could give away his money or anybody give away the money  One is they could give it to an organization. Let the organization  Decide how to distribute it. Mm-hmm. He does that too, though  That's and if he does that's fine. That's giving up the power and saying I'm merely gonna give you the money  Or you can hold on to it in your own personal foundation as both he and Zuck do  Well, Buffett does not Buffett gives Gates his money, which is interesting  Yeah, so Buffett's clearly not trying to influence the world unless he and Gates are so aligned in worldview that he says well  I want you to do because we agree but Gates is and Zuck both are saying now we're gonna keep the money  Distribute as we we with our advisors and with our research see fit  But your point is is well taken then he is still the guy who's deciding what to do with it  I don't want to lick the look of gift horse in the mouth and obviously nobody who's receiving his charity does  But that is an interesting point is a very powerful. This is a tricky thing, especially in the third world

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So let me let me just give you a stark example from the past  So for example, there are certain parts of of northern Africa that are that have occasional droughts and it's catastrophic for the population Kenya  For example, it will have droughts occasionally or did in the past where there's lots of starvation  Some farmers in Kenya  Actually figured out on their own how to  Farm in a way that survived the drought, but when you give like massive bags of grain  I'm not saying this is what the Gates Foundation did. This is just an example  Essentially and give it away free to to Kenyans  What you're doing is you're running the guy who succeeded out of business and you're giving a foreign solution that  What you should be doing is rewarding the guy  the farmers who figured it out and having those ideas spread locally and have it be a local solution and  and so there in Africa is a particular problem because you know Western organizations always swoop in and we're like we'll save you and  And and it's like we should be doing a lot more listening to them  There's good farmers in Kenya are really know what they're a lot of I should also point out that the amount of money

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Even if you combine Buffett Gates and Zuckerberg the amount of money they're giving away is dwarfed by government. Yeah  Foreign aid and that is exactly why governments do foreign aid the number one recipient  I think it's changed now, but that for years the number one recipient of foreign aid from the US was Egypt  Yeah, and that's from the why because right they're trying to get peace in the Middle East

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm more so that helped and and in other countries  They're essentially buying off the leader to get to get them to play ball

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And there's and there's also economic reasons they want to benefit US corporations. So  America at least has always used its trillions not billions  in  In an effort to exert its will over the rest of the world  So why wouldn't Warren Buffett or Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg do that?  Nick Bilton has a really good article in the Vanity Fair about Zuckerberg's ambitions for presidency  He says he's we've talked about this before he says Mark Mark's political ambitions are grander than you think  He doesn't think he says he may run for higher office someday. I'm convinced he's running in 2020. Yep  But but Bilton who knows mark a lot better than I do  Says he's preparing for the job, but he has other interests and one of them is he got terrified after the 2016 presidential election  When he realized that how much Facebook influenced that election? Yep  And it scared him and he's desperately trying to find a way a better way a way out  That doesn't mean him becoming president, but it does involve him getting kind of involved in  What yeah, you know what's going on right and that's why he's talking to every people in every state  Not because he's running for president. I I think Nick is a smart guy  He probably knows better than I do what Zuckerberg's ambitions are. I  Still feel like I might want to run for president but I mean Natasha

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Can't ever say her she's over at wired. Let me find it wired  Google wired Zuck president and see if

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's real debate now because he keeps making these moves like hiring presidential advisors and  Himself on tractors and stuff. Is this is this the one mark Zuckerberg sure? No, this is an old no

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why it's why people can't stop talking about Zuckerberg 2020 Natasha Tico  And she makes the point that running for president is so polarizing that as long as Facebook is Zuckerberg is  Facebook it would be yeah bad for business yet. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like it or not Facebook is in the game

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, here's a day I mean, yes, yeah, and that's why that's one of the reasons why I think this tour

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is kind of a big deal. I also it has to be pointed out also that Zuckerberg's idol is Bill Gates  And he I think that you know, he looks at what Bill Gates did which was that he shifted into philanthropy mode  suddenly at the peak of his career basically and  Made the huge mistake of handing the whole thing over to Steve Ballmer  but  But I think Zuck probably, you know wants to leave Facebook when he's 40 or something, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I should point out that Ballmer increased the stock value of Microsoft by several orders of may know by several times in  Thereby increasing Bill Gates wealth by yes, so it wasn't such a mistake

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there are other metrics that they showed that you know, they the loss better  Yeah, they could have done they should have done much better  But anyway the point I mean, I think Zuckerberg doesn't want to do this forever  And and I think that at some point he and I would certainly would do this. He wants to just  Get out have a get on a spending thing where he's extracting stock  He's got a lot more Facebook stock than Gates ever had a Microsoft stock  I think and do something so what's he gonna do?  He has a lot more control president do this do that the other thing and he won't be part of Facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go back to our previous conversation  And by the way, one of the things they changed the bylaws of Facebook says that he could take a leave of absence to work  In government wouldn't lose his voting shares  Yeah, so clearly they're thinking about these kinds of things if you're right in saying that they want to exert their power by charitable contributions  Again think how much more a government can exert its power with foreign aid  Yeah, so that's maybe that's the next step  I don't think it wouldn't I don't think it's out of the it's it's a fun one to talk about and we'll know in a few  Years, I think the landscape political landscape is going to shift dramatically over the next three years in very unpredictable ways  Yes, I think we can all agree on that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But how controversial would it be if suck actually ran for president because you know, you know  Nobody knows what other Facebook users see on their newsfeed  They can control those algorithms to say and do anything they want and nobody this is this is one of the scary things about  About the Trump election, which is that they were using this  Jared Kushner Kushner was using this company that  Sir micro addicts  Yeah  That served micro ads and it was all invisible under the radar because each individual was seeing an ad and then it was gone and like  Who knows what was actually happening?  Zuck could easily do that. He doesn't have to run tweak the algorithms and he would be elected  Facebook really does have that much power. That's what I'm saying  And but so he that's why I don't think he can run because that would be so outrageous. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and America is so good at outrage. Oh  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We wouldn't accept a billionaire becoming president. Well, yeah, of course not that would be ridiculous

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's nip that in the bud right now  Okay, I think like like I said  I think we have entered Terra incognita for the last few months and I think it's gonna get it's getting weird  It is by the by the minute and who knows what 2020 is gonna look like or even if there'll even be an election in  2020 yeah to be honest

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the the the good news in all this is that Trump is grossly incompetent  Yeah, that's pretty and so I don't think come apparent his his approval rating is very low  And and probably stay that way, you know, this is worse than Trump's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Crawl in France. Oh, yeah  Yeah, so I don't know. I don't know. I just you know what? I don't know anymore. Yeah, I don't know anymore  I do know this the DOJ has got to be stopped. They've just  Demanded information. Yeah about every visitor to a website  Dream host which hosts the website is fighting this request the website which was a Trump protest website  Which organized the protests? Oh stop the auto stop with the autoplay which organized the the the inaugural  inauguration day protests the warrant  July 12th says authorities will seize any information constituting violations of DC code-governing riots that  Involve individuals connected to the protests on inauguration day, but what they're asking for is this massive  Data dump of every single person who visited the website  Whether you were in in DC or not that day  Including names addresses telephone numbers and other identifiers email addresses business information  The length of service means and source of payment for services and information about any domain name registration about this website  They want the the basically they want the logs

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This request is straight-up Banana Republic stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's just you protest against the president and the Department of Justice comes and says we want the name of every single person  Who visited this website? Yeah, this is this is Chinese Communist Party behavior  Now dream hostess is is gonna fight by the way dream hostess complied  With search warrants and legal processes, but at this point the site is called disrupt j20 org  He said stream host says we are going to fight this  Whether they'll win. I don't know whether the DOJ will back down. I don't know. I'm glad that there's attention we want to  Increase that attention because of course this kind of thing succeeds in secrecy generally

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  well interestingly they the the the the quasi pseudo precedent for this was that they as under the guise of  Cracking down on election fraud or investigating election fraud from last in that election  They sent a demand to the states every voter record and and most of the states said no  Thank goodness. I think all but one yeah, and so that was a good precedent  And I think that dream hostess got to say no if they don't that's really really bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, we'll follow this we'll keep an eye on it, but that's scary. You should not  They should not be able to get your name because you visited a website. I'm sorry even if it's the Daily Stormer  I don't think that that's a yeah acceptable at all. Yeah  Let's see I think we're getting towards anything I've missed here IKEA is gonna do smart light bulbs oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Guys, I got my trot fee lights. They've already been doing them wait. They call them

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Trot fee they're downstairs. What does that mean in in Norwegian or Swedish?  I don't think it means anything Swedish. They have those great names all their stuff has great names  We just bought a mom bed for my daughter. Oh, I had a mom bed for my daughter love the ball bed. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so they're not a self I

Transcript:  We assembled it it wasn't that bad really okay?  It was doable. I had my brother-in-law to it. Oh there you go  Next week if I read well tested it by next week, so yeah  Oh, I guess what's new is that they work with her home kit, so it's not I don't think it's there  Yet that everyone reported it like last week that they were home kid enabled, but they aren't yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't believe you can use them with a echo though  No  They said they're getting home kid a scale. I'm sorry echo and Google home support, so yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, I tell you what I'll tell you next week. What works and what doesn't good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can you do it in Swedish or at least with a Swedish accent I could do it with the Swedish meatball next to me  These meatballs are good, especially with a little lingonberry jelly on the side actually  I made a prediction

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think a year or two ago, and I'm sticking by it even though there's no hint that is coming true yet  But I think that eventually light bulbs are going to be the location for  speakers and microphones for for the Google homes of the world and they right because they're ubiquitous  Right because they have power and they're always in places where people are you know, they have audio light bulbs

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've seen speaking like they had no they have tons. I have light bulbs with sensors in them. They've they put  Lux sensors so light sensors in them. They've put temperature sensors in them. They put  Speakers temperature sensors. Isn't it always hot?  LEDs  LEDs are not as hot. I guess they're away from the led heatsink  Um  Don't I don't know why they're all doing but that's already been happening  You're right in your prediction because it's been happening for a really long time

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would love to see google for example come out with with a home home light bulb goes in the light bulb. No, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, don't don't get google into light bulbs because google should just grab the data from somebody else's light bulb

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So who actually makes light bulbs because you only have so many sockets

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  At some point i'm out of sockets. Yeah, I have to unscrew things all the time. You don't want the pixel light bulb  I do not I just got a home kit light bulb that doesn't require  Um a hub which is really exciting. It's the civilian one that's going to ship in september  So I can try that we can do a little light bulb show next week

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll have lamps y'all can compare. What do you think of this liftoff, which is a mobile app marketing firm?  did a study  data gathered between june and  2016 and june 2017  They said that apps  That have a subscription fee do better if they charge more

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apps in the medium price range had the highest conversion rate  The lowest cost to subscribe to acquire a subscriber at just over 106  That's five times higher than the rate of people with 99 cent apps  what

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why?  Because people have no ability to understand what the value of something is  Okay, but if you put a price on it, that's the value and if the if it's more valuable  Then it's a worthless piece of junk and if it's twenty dollars, then yeah, this must be really good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But fifty dollars is too much like there's a bridge too far  Yep, so an app and this is sunk cost fallacy for a uh, monthly or yearly subscription. It's a month per month. Yeah. Yeah  That's seven to twenty dollars is the right. Yeah, the sunk cost fallacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The sunk cost fallacy is that um, I if I understand it correctly, it's where you um, you pay for something and then  You use it because you paid for it. I think and then because you're using it you keep paying for it  So so if you if you don't have to pay for anything, it's easy and easy out  Easy time easy go no commitment exactly  But if you paid for it, you're like, okay  I'm a user of this thing and i'm going to keep doing it and i've already invested all this money and i'm going to keep  Using it and therefore i'm going to keep paying for it  I think that's what it means. Uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The sunk cost fallacy is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, she's looking up. She's a reporter. You gotta watch out for her. You can't i'm sorry  This has been a very difficult show for me to do because I I am famous for asserting  bogus

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Things and then stacy will look at us fallacy is you make rational decisions based on the future value of objects investments and experience  okay, but  Now you did describe a sunk cost correctly, but uh, the  The idea is that you're a rational actor when you're making financial decisions, but really what happens is uh pricing  changes things  Pricing can influence you like anchor pricing and that sort of thing. Who's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  behavioral economic economists  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah  Yeah, yeah, yeah the ted talk guy. Yeah. Yeah

So there's five dinners in like and she's got two dinners  She and her co there's four dinners per season or four weeks of cooking per season basically  and there's like five dinners in each one plus some lunches and they  kind of  the game plan is they tell you you're going to cook for like  Two or three or even four hours on a day  and  They give you all the instructions for the cooking and they give you the grocery list  And then you start assembling things and it should take about 10 to 15 minutes like last night. We assembled one  That I had pre-made the the tomato compote kind of thing though. It's not a compote. It's a  I roasted some tomatoes like two cups of tomatoes basically. Yeah  Actually, no, it was 12 cups of tomatoes. Oh, like come on I know so  One thing is when you're cooking you cook more because you're cooking for you're cooking a ton, right? So

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why they sell all the all these like jars and bond things to  the website

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You need it on this one

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, sorry, I just I got distracted at food52.com go ahead

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay  um, so the the time away this is bearing out the google memo because

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're interested in the food and the recipes i'm interested in the gadgets that go along with it  Go ahead

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay  No, you're interrupting me. Oh, yeah  That's how it bears into the i'm like go ahead like there we go. Go ahead  It's okay. I mean if it's not interesting, I don't have to go. No, please i'm fascinated  Um  But i'm like i'm trying to review this cookbook here. Um, the time it gives you for cooking is like  A little off so you're gonna probably spend more time in the kitchen  You might also like it makes enough for four people  In these recipes you get a lot of food. We have three people in our house and I think  Kind of like blue apron how there's so much food. Yeah  Um  But it's really nice not to have to think about dinner  so  I don't know if I would do this every week, but there are definitely some weeks that i'm like  Yeah, so and there's there's sites on this online that you know  But I I kind of like cooking from a cookbook because I i'm old school that way

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they also have a podcast. Did you know that?  The food52 podcast it's called burnt toast

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, yeah  So I haven't listened to that you can listen to that podcast while you cook  Because you're going to be in the kitchen a really long time. This is a great time to catch up on all your podcasts

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, if you don't you're gonna be really hungry  Uh, okay. Good. This is good. I like i'm ordering the book right now. Thank you good. I think michael is also a good recommendation

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's awesome. And I um, can I go? Yes go. All right. I have a quick question for you stacy, which is that you're  You have a june oven, right?  And didn't they just come out with a new june oven i'm so mad. How do you feel about that? The june pro?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  um  I it's a built-in though. Right. It's not like so like was I I was not going to  Take out one of my existing ovens to put the june in if I were building a house and I had bought a june  I'd be sad, but that's a pretty small people  It costs a little more too. It's two thousand. It costs two thousand dollars, but it's a it's a wall unit  it's an oven and so yeah, it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it is it bigger than the june?  It is the same size. I believe oh interesting. I think that's this is actually a good idea because the june really is your second oven

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yep, it is. Yeah  Yeah, and I I mean I use my june oven  Almost not every night not this week because I pre-made everything but I mean we use our june oven almost every day. Yeah  And it I mean we even use it to toast our egg of waffles and they taste better. They do taste better

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everything tastes better

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like how does that even happen? So

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right, so okay. How does that? Okay, so my  Tool of the week is  Something called meeting bird. I don't know if you've ever talked about this on the show. I don't know about meeting bird is a chrome plug-in  That unites and integrates google calendar with both gmail and inbox. Oh, I need it. Yes, you do  It's fantastic. Basically what one of the things it does is it puts  A bit of calendar on the side of your email package and when you open up an email where you're discussing a meeting it  Autopopulates the calendar on the date with the information and the name and the person's phone number and all that stuff and it just says  Do you want to schedule this you click one button and scheduled on your calendar?  You can you can toggle between your calendars. This is great  You can talk toggle between time zones. You can set up teams. So you say here's my team  Here's the here's the marketing team and you can have all the people in there and it knows what time zones they're in  It knows what they're you know, what's going on with them?  It's really fantastic. But the best thing of all is the contextual jumping it like if there's any mention of a date in an email  The calendar part of it says do you want to go to this date?  You click the button and you're on that date looking at that date  So it's very very easy to use google calendar from email  And really google should just buy these guys and integrate this functionality because it's just brilliant  And uh, does it cost anything?  I don't think so. I know there's a free tier  But um, i'm signing up right now. Yeah, but but it's in addition to the integration it also  You go to meeting bird instead of google calendar and it shows you your google calendar within meeting bird and it's a better interface  It's more pleasant. It's more functional. It has all kinds of cool features. It's it's more  AI-ish, you know, it's like figuring things out for you  Um, it's just if you use either one of google's email packages and google calendar you will absolutely love meeting bird  It's really really a good, uh, i'm signing up today

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, well I I saw I saw a story somewhere that google was updating google calendar. Yeah, they supposedly uh updated

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I haven't seen it. I was like any

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Changes how update how what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think they redesigned it. I'm not sure if they did it on the  I should know this  Let me see here

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So my pick of the week is something that I am not going to do but I want you to do it  So you could tell me if it makes any sense  I heard about this. It was weird. I heard about this on yesterday on tnt and I thought what are they talking about?  And then I saw more it's called movie pass  Ten dollars a month actually nine ninety five a month  And you can see as many movies you want up to one a day for 30 days  You can't see 3d, which is fine. I don't care. I don't like you have to have a uh, a debit card, right?  You buy the tickets and then you get re  Reimbursed right or it gets reversed the charge gets reversed or something. I think it's brilliant

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's wait, didn't they threaten to sue them?  uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  amc threatened to sue them well, don't use them at amc then  Sorry, i'm like, wait a second. Yeah amc has filed a lawsuit. Uh, I don't know how they can because  From the movie theater's point of view. It doesn't look any different. You're still going in there  right  And buying the movie and they get the full money, right?  Movie pass refunds you the cost  I think the theory I don't understand it at all. The theory is  That the gym membership most people won't use it  but if you go to one movie a month it will pay for itself, but you know, I think that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It it's like if you go to the movie if you've been to the movie theaters recently unless you're going to a really hot movie  The theaters are almost empty. This is good for watching at home, right more bodies and seats  Makes the theater going experience good as long as there are available seats for other people. How is this possible?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean really they think most people won't even go to one movie. I think they're monetizing with data  Oh  they're selling some data to the  The companies or something like they find leo saw these four movies. Yeah  They were charging thirty dollars a month  Then I can see how that might not uh, that's right on the edge  But if they charge ten dollars a month, yeah, it's so low. I can't  I mean now it depends where you live but here in the bay area a movie ticket is like 13 bucks  Yeah, so you're saving immediately right? You just have to go to one movie a month  Okay. Well anyway, i'm gonna pass that along to you moviepass.com the site is  They need cloud flare. Yeah, this site is so slow  Because I think it's like well who wouldn't do this right? They had over a million hits yesterday

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you can't i'm sorry millions of hits yesterday. I can't get on the hit on this on the site now to show it  Variety actually has a really good article  Talking to them. So if you if you want to learn the history the current status and everything else

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And this is a guy who worked at netflix in the early days  So he's not you know, he's not like somebody out of nowhere  But why I still don't understand why amc hates this so much but  anyway  Yeah, the amc is gonna sue him

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  probably because people  It just it just makes the actual price of regular movies so seems so high

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But remember that unless i'm mistaken the movie theater doesn't make money off the ticket that goes to the the movie producer  They make money on the concessions. So after opening day, they make money

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  so  after opening the first that's why opening weekend so  Big is because most or all of the proceeds go to the producer, but then there's a split after  After the first weekend, I believe or that's how I mean that's how it used to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I assume it's still sort of something like that. Well, I want to you know what? Let's try to get the this guy in  And and ask him what the hell?  Uh, how are you doing this?  Um, what the hell man the hell man and mitch low is his name co-founder of netflix  It sounds like they have scc filings. Oh, you know what? He took over from the previous owners  He just took over the service  Uh a year ago july 2016  So it existed before but he it sounds like he's the guy who said let's make it ten dollars.
