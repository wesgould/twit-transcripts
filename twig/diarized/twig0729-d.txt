## This transcripts diarization was very bad. It didn't ca- ##
## tch transitions very well. There is lots of laughing and ##
## over-talking which may be the culprit. But it mixed up   ##
## Ant and Jeff quite a bit. It also captured Leo as two    ##

Start time: 2406.12
End time: 2558.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was a little too much hegemony  That's my review. That's the thumbnail review Christopher Nolan has too much hegemony  He has he's too much power and I was gonna say no to him  He so it's based on the book American Prometheus  which I've started to read now as everybody does after they watch the movie and this kind of the spine of the book is  the last act of  Oppenheimer's life when they revoked his clearance the Atomic Energy Commission and they had a very long hearing and he had to go  through his whole life story and  It makes sense for a book to have that be the spine like flashback flashback  but it made the movie extra long because they keep going from the court from the it's not a courtroom from the  the hearing hearing  To the reverse events to the hearing in the vents in the back and forth and I think that was a mistake to  Be too faithful to the book  It just it's longer than it needs to be but it's a good story  It's a very important story. The really important part of it is I was talking to somebody said, you know, it's the it's really about AI  And I said what oh and it's it's been it's the issue of the scientists  Were more interested in whether they could do it than what the consequences of doing it would be, you know  Right and and and really the story of the atomic bomb is they were worried Hitler was gonna get one  Oppenheimer was Jewish as were most of the scientists working at Los Alamos  Building the or just trying to build the a bomb and they were very worried reasonably so that  Hitler would get it first and it would be the end of the world  And so there was a race to beat Hitler to get it first, but then  it's ve day the war is over Hitler's defeated and  Still the government wants to go ahead and develop the a bomb and then eventually drops it on the Japanese  There's lots of questions of whether they needed to whether they needed to do it twice  Oppenheimer feels a lot of guilt and regret  But he knew even as they were doing it once we release this there's no taking it back once we develop this you can't say  Oh, yeah, don't use it  And he was very disturbed because then there was a push to develop the hydrogen bomb which is a hundred times more powerful  And he said no, no, no, we don't don't do that because it'll create an arms race and  Edward Teller said no. No, we need it. The government said no, no, we need it and we developed the H bomb  of course, as you know, mm-hmm and Oppenheimer's very upset about that and  That's kind of the my friend likened that to the AI  Conundrum is is you do it because you're it's an engine interesting engineering problem, but consider what you're releasing

Yeah, Google has already said we're gonna delete. We're no longer to support in persistent third-party cookies  Starting next year we're gonna get rid of it because people don't want it they turn it off  But Google also understands because they that business 79% of their revenue comes from ad sales  They understand that advertisers want information about who the ad is being displayed to  But they also understand that we as users  Don't want to be tracked and we'll go to great lengths including ad blockers to prevent that  so I think it's reasonable for Google to try to figure out well is there some way I can balance the interests of both sides and  Steve says topics is actually  gonna do it  so

Transcript:  It's a there's a good blog  But actually there's a good ours technical article which I'd recommend but also you can read about it on the chromium  Blog they call it privacy sandbox add relevance and measurement proposal  Formerly known as what was it called? Well there was fledge and then there was flock it all has to do with birds this time  It's just topics  So the idea is when you go in a browser  And you visit a site  that site is  Assigned certain topics like if you came to twit it would be technology  Maybe smartphones  consumer electronics  Enterprise technology that kind of thing right now Google has 349 topics that number might expand to a larger number  that  information  Is  Then attached to your browser  So when you go to another so it aggregates over time  I think it resets every few weeks, but it aggregates over the period of three weeks  So when I go in this browser that I visited a variety of sites  It will say the person not my name the person using this browser has an interest in race cars

Transcript:  The big difference between topics and flock the predecessor was that flock would broadcast that information  To all and sundry this one's a little bit more  constrained, but it supports interest based  Advertising so let me read from Vivaldi the browser which will use it. How does topics differ from flock?  Google limits the amount of information a site can gather to a few topics  Initially from a set that might be as big as well now  It's 349 as big as a few thousands and only allows a single additional topic to be tamed every week  Oh wow, which is a severe limit, right? They also limit the topics advertisers can see  This is very important flocking did not have this limit to topics offered by sites  On which those advertisers are present so I'm on ours technica. I can only see the topics that ours technica offers  Giving topics approximately the same reach as third-party cookies without the privacy problem  Some random topics might be offered as well and Google claims this lessens the chance  That sharing a given topic will automatically be compromising or identifying. It's fuzzed  with random stuff  Google also claims this will reduce the ability of advertisers to gather enough data themselves for building a profile  Okay, I'm sure advertisers will try

Transcript:  The I don't know. I'm like users are able to disable the whole system. So you'll have a you'll have a opt-out and  You can exclude certain topics in a way that can't be easily detected by the advertisers  So you say I don't want to see anything about smartphones  But it won't be no one else the advertiser won't see that they just won't get offered smartphones  Right expect that most users won't change the defaults  But at least it's there right?  This is from Vivaldi in addition the wording and the specification is loose and ambiguous in a way that leaves it open to  Manipulation by Google to expose more or less information  This is especially possible for websites that cover a large range of topics including Google and Facebook  They'll be able to observe the widest range of behaviorally profiled information  but Steve's feeling is and and actually  He might be alone in this Vivaldi says we have no faith in the new topics a  And I think EFF is also weighed in that they're not crazy about it, but Steve says that's a price and I think he's right  Steve says we got to find some system that'll that  Makes ad supported content work right amen brother  it's not for by the way, it's not for podcasting because  It's very simple you buy ads on Twitter because you know our audience is tech enthusiasts so anything tech enthusiasts  You'd be interested in so we kind of are already  Broadcasting that signal, but it's more for site other sites like Google or the verge or Facebook or whatever  Steve says this is a good compromise. It's he really looked closely at it feels like he protects privacy  adequately for the individual but gives advertisers some hook that they  Seem to really need I mean there's always that debate of whether targeted advertising works  But since advertisers think it does and want it and demand it  And won't buy ads unless they get it then this seems to be a good compromise. That's Steve's opinion  That's Steve's opinion  Vivaldi says we believe that spying on people's behavior and profiling them is wrong period  It's easy to get misled by this new variation of flock since it does appear to have made some positive changes  But it still violates your privacy and pretending that behavioral profiling can be okay  As long as you hide a few bits of information or sometimes add false information is really missing the point  You shouldn't be profiling in the first place, and this is the problem

Start time: 3549.62
End time: 3577.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't think it does  Vivaldi says  Stacey's thinking revealing information about the user's interest to various entities even slowly will allow them over time to identify  political affiliation sexual orientation and other personal information about the user  I'm not sure that's clear. You'd have to say well everybody who's interested in smartphones and  Shetland ponies is a lot easier ways to do about it. Yeah  They say limiting

They don't frankly want any advertising at all. Mm-hmm  and I

Start time: 3638.70
End time: 3755.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and that's the problem is our content somehow  I mean, I guess we could say only club twit. I mean it made this may happen if advertising continues to  Drift away and advertising does drift away from us because we don't have enough information about you  So they go to Facebook and Google where there's a lot more information about you, right?  So we are losing advertising and advertisers do demand and want more and we can only give them so much  and if all that advertising goes away, then it will be paywall or nothing and  Yeah, then people will try to get around the paywalls. I don't like paywalls. I get around paywalls. I know how to do it  I'm sure our audience is sophisticated enough to do that  So it's not it. You know if you want me somebody's got to pay John's La Nina  Some somebody's got a banana  Somebody's got to pay and  Jason  You know the funny thing is as an owner of the company I'm the last as  As always the case. I'm the last person to get paid now the company has a surplus  I'm in the money, right?  But if the company is not at a surplus I get no pay I haven't been paid in three months, right?  and and that's I mean, that's okay, I guess but I'm  Kind of take some of the fun out of it. Let's put it that way  So  At some point you got to pay for this stuff  PG&E the light bill has got to be paid or they're gonna turn off the lights, right?  My bandwidth bills have to be paid or you won't be able to download a podcast  I could sit here and and do it but you wouldn't be able to get it  right, so some everybody needs to get paid and  The problem is if people who consume the content say well under no circumstances  Can there be any system that supports that I think you got a problem  So I I think Google is I think they're trying admittedly they have a kind of a dog in this hunt  They both buy and sell advertising

Start time: 3764.96
End time: 3818.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I also there's there's a couple like nuances that are hard to really think about the parts especially in technology one  is  The technology firms really value scale. So it's paying you're paying a faceless someone something  Yeah, so you feel like you're being sold to you don't know what it's for. It feels creepy. It feels impersonal  People do tend to pay  People they know and come like  There's a lot of people who join club to it and sounds like it may not be enough yet. But you know  so I think there's there's a function of scale and then there's also the function of  Income inequality, I think is really hurting some of these people because you feel like  You feel like you're being nickel-and-dime to death for little to no value  Maybe and you don't understand what you're supporting necessarily and that's hard. I don't know. I mean that's that's one of the objections

Start time: 3818.56
End time: 3832.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's also the objection quite reasonable that data brokers  Collect this information and put essentially put together dossiers on everybody  Actually, I was been doing it for years before the internet yeah and then sell that on I mean that's reprehensible that should be stopped

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay next you but I want to stay on Stacy's point about scale for one more minute if I can  Because that's interesting because you know  I keep on yammering on about death of mass media and and rescaling things and I think scale is what's over  I think that's part of the TV story. I think that's what's true of music. I think whether we reduce scale and  and  The internet was never the internet had to scale to become a huge network to enable it to be small  right and and and so  That's interesting Stacy in terms of the future of advertising is that if if it stays  If the presumption stays scale, we have to have everybody have to have huge numbers  Paradisically, I was wondering whether that's worse for privacy than  Yes, I'm looking for a car. It's permissioned. I give you permission to do it. It's more effective  I cannot look at car ads for a few months that I can turn it off  You know, where do we go with advertising right now? It's it's it's scale over everything  You have to have a huge audience so that you can happen to have that one person who might  Take that one box to get that one ad to get your pennies  It's not a good business model in the long run. And and so how would we?  Reimagine if we need advertising to help support and subsidize creativity. How could we reimagine an?  Advertising industry that's happening

Start time: 3925.30
End time: 3936.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think it's happening with Google and Facebook. But yeah, look at patreon look at influencers. Mm-hmm  I think that's happening  In part of what I'm talking about with scale is like a

Start time: 3938.40
End time: 3972.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sense that you know someone like like back when it wasn't even that long ago  Like I mean you banked with people who lived in your hometown you bought  You know, you got your appliances from someone, you know  So like I also think there's just a like as as people were fundamentally like I will say  People were fundamentally like I will give money to someone I know and feel okay about it like I  Don't know. This is pretty like this is now this is anecdotal. I guess no  relationships over

Start time: 3973.54
End time: 4053.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Relationships over billboards. It's what relationships over target. I feel really comfortable with our model tWits model  Because it is about community. It's about a relationship. It's about  Whether you as a last trust what we say about our advertisers and I feel very comfortable about that  I don't know anything about our audience  Except that they're interested in what we're talking about. They're very nice people  We know that like they like you and I did make like I I'm I fully copped up making a huge mistake  By building an organization that's extremely expensive  Had I thought about it I would have been much tighter with the dollar I wouldn't be doing video we do audio only  You know much smaller staff  And frankly if I had done that the the size of the club of the way it is now would have easily supported  You know a couple of people me and an editor  And some bandwidth  Doing audio. Well, I don't think I think the quality what we do wouldn't would have suffered but it might be adequate  You have to kind of match the quality with the support but I'm comfortable with our model  I think there are a lot of influencers. I'm I think salt Hank is comfortable with his model  I think you're right. I think the local bookstore where you know them  They know you and they know what books you like and they say Oh Stacy. We just got a new one

End time: 4113.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's what I that's what I that that or that's the model that I think could be made to work  Again, and again, there's the paradox of scale of the internet, right?  Your newspaper is at scale and it doesn't know you as an individual  Google is a huge scale because of  Network economics it had to be huge to enable small  To enable and I think I think what we see is post Twitter  We thought that Twitter was huge but Twitter was always little little a whole bunch of little tiny communities  And now you can find your community that's big enough on  Mastodon or on blue sky or I don't I'm on threads much anymore, but on threads and and the scale is more human  Now what happens in advertising? I don't know but I think that this the scale of media  necessarily has to change

Transcript:  Do you think there's an issue of people feeling like media isn't personal?  Yeah, that's part of it. Yes, I'm looking my circles and a phrase that's thrown around quite a bit from  Heck even some of my relatives back home is get a quote real job. Those people should get a real job  You know and and I'm like well  People people in journalism they are working and you're telling telling me that they should work for below minimum wage

They're like if I'm not making more than  Joe who's making a hundred million I suck  My private jet isn't good enough.

Transcript:  But you know, I saw this the moral entrepreneurs were out there could say I'm about to finish the manuscript I think for the  Internet book and so I was reading through it again and I had to read through all the Shoshana Zuboff  Surveillance capitalism quotes and she's just way over the top and so is Tristan Harris just way over the top and to them  Advertising is the evil well the  The attention economy does corrupt things. Yes, and it has since since  1900 and magazines it's always done that but again it supports part of our culture and  If it goes away  Do we understand what the consequences that are?  and so I you know if I were a  Philanthropist right now, which I'm certainly not I would be supporting research to think about not new models for business models for news  Which is what I've worked on the last 15 years  but new models for advertising that may be permission based and  Acceptable and still have a role in supporting the culture

Start time: 4393.26
End time: 4422.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think Shoshana Zuboff's issue isn't really anti-advertising  I think it's a photo. It's a realization that the type of surveillance we're under is  Much more massive than it has ever been. It's also  accretive and searchable and then sold and bought which is very different than just saying like I  Accept ads because they're good  I I don't mind ad models  But I do mind that if every single because it is possible for us to track every single thing

Start time: 4423.10

I argue it's not surveillance surveillance is what evil governments do with armies behind them  second  Know the data often is not sold  the data is used for targeting on the ad server and that's part of the myth that she  Pushes here is

Start time: 4444.92
End time: 4468.32

Transcript:  Sold to data brokers and then the government which is a potential surveillance apparatus under your definition  Can get access and his historically and is admitted to buying access data  and so  And I think there's a lot of subtleties here Jeff  I'm not saying all advertising is evil  But I understand their point and I don't think you should belittle it in the way that you're kind of well

Transcript:  I can have my opinion and I think my opinion is who office is  About trying to find the paragraph right now. I have tons of quotes from her. She's just over the top  And I think a way that that and then what I object to is it leads then to regulatory impingement on  other freedoms  and it leads to the kind of of bad regulation that we're seeing as a result and so  She declares that surveillance capitalism feeds on every aspect of humans experience with no exit no voice no loyalty only helplessness  Resignation and psychic numbing which is built on this is all quotes  weaponized virus of moral nihilism program to target human agency and delete resistance and  Creativity from the text of human possibility all part of a cunning fraud designed to render us helpless and passive in the face of the  Implacable forces that are and must always be indifferent to be the merely human.

He's so articulate  It's very and you love listening to him and you'll love listening. So it's very difficult for anybody else  To get in a back with you. Jeff. I have no problem, but with him  It's hard to get in a back and forth  I try to hold my own but I wouldn't force anybody else to do that and I wouldn't so I  Figure if we have Rebecca his co-author and we I've had them I've interviewed them both together on triangulation  So I know they they have a nice back and forth. I figured I could sit back on Sunday  I'm gonna bring a you know, one of those big turkey legs or whatever. I'm gonna bring you some popcorn. Yeah  And and but but definitely here's the guy I think we all agree here's a guy who is really  both  Responded to how we feel about this stuff and it's kind of explained the forces behind it  I think he was much more constructive Zuboff per se. Yes, he is  And that's by the way his new book is how to take it back, you know what to do about it  So I think Zuboff is maybe  Kind of ascribed motivations  She's very negative about the companies and the people behind it and ascribed really kind of evil motivations to them that I don't I  Don't think that that's accurate. I don't think that's true, but I understand that what she's describing we feel and  And those forces are operating. I don't I think they're kind of operating autonomously. It's just what happens  But in any event, I think Cory has definitely clarified her points  I mean her main point is that we're in end-stage capitalism and it's become you know,  Robacious it's because it's eating people alive. It's corrosive. It's corrosive whether it's an income inequality or

Professor Zuboff was saying when the quote when the tech platforms promised a future of connection. They were lying  They said their walled gardens would keep us safe  But those were prison walls the platforms locked us into their systems and made us easy pickings  ripe for extraction Twitter Facebook and other big tech platforms are  Hard to leave by design they hold hostage the people we love the communities that matter to us the audiences and customers  We rely on the impossibility of staying connected to these people after you delete your account has nothing to do with technological  Limitations, it's a business strategy and service to commodifying your personal life and relationships  The book is about  Interoperability how to make how to fix that by making it possible for you to leave and take your friends with you and I
