Joining us now, it's really a very, it's kind of a veritable clue game of people starting with Jeff Jarvis, who's in the library.  What weapon of your choice?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  With a knife or with an ethernet cable.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  With an ethernet cable.  That's good.  I like it.  Jeff Jarvis in the library with an ethernet cable and Gina Trapani, who's in the green room with a bicycle pump.  I don't know.  What are you?  What is your weapon of choice?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Firewire drive.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Firewire drive.  And welcoming back for her second appearance on This Week in Google, Mary Hodder in the kitchen with.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  I don't know.  Persimmon cake.  I should have the knife.  I should have the knife.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  With a silicone spatula.  Yes.  Do you use those new, Mary, besides being a brilliant writer and blogger and talking about all of this stuff that we talk about, including telecom stuff, she's an expert in small devices, is famed baker and cook.  Do you use those silicone?  I do.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  I do.  You know, my favorite silicone thing is the little, it's this little thing kind of shaped like this with these little squiggly things at the end.  And it's for basting meat when you grill.  And they don't melt.  And it's so cool.  It's rubber, but it doesn't melt.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  It's really incredible.  I fully expect in a few years for someone to come out and be like, you know, everyone who's been cooking with this stuff, you're all going to die soon for some reason.  But it's still really great.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm with you.  I have one.  I love those.  I love those.  Napsterization.org slash stories is the place to read Mary's postings, most recently about transparency camp.  You've got to get another post up there.  That's from August.  I know.  Get out of the kitchen.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  I actually have like 10 posts written.  You know, the problem with blogging as you sort of evolve is that you realize the complexity of the issues and what used to just be like a quick blog post that you would dash off in a couple of paragraphs.  Now, when you think about the same issue, it's like, you know, a book and it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's a lot harder to write a blog.  I agree.  You get the easy ones off on Twitter.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And then the blog posts become that much bigger as a result.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The only thing that's left is the is the 2000 word tomes.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  Yeah.  And then it's like a day and a half.  And right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You.  I'm with you.  We're all in the same boat.  We're all suffering this.  I blame Twitter.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, if Matt Howie could do it.  Did you all see Matt Howie's post this week?  No.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Was it really long?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Absolutely incredible.  He announced on Twitter, I guess, a week ago that he was basically had brain tumor, he thought.  Oh, dear.  Last we heard.  So we had to come back and explain everything.  And it looks like, you know, it'll be OK.  He has something in his brain that they hope they can treat with hormones.  But, you know, considering the shape that he's in, he went into incredible and witty  detail of this.  And partly because of Neil Dash started kind of a movement to show him what he'd gone through.  He describes it in the post as saying he was seeing his own funeral with with the tributes.  But it's amazing how you live in public and there is there is Matt saying something in  Twitter because it's what are you doing right now?  Well, I'm in the hospital about to go into an MRI and it just follows through.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You can't then now you have to write the blog.  Is that what happened to you?  You kind of had to write the blog post.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It becomes kind of an obligation to transparency to all your all your friends.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Matt is the one of the founders of a Metafilter and his blog is a whole lot of nothing.  A dot whole lot of nothing dot org.  If you want to read the post.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, there were over 2000 over 2000 tweets tagged.  The tag was Matt Howie Love, where people were saying, you know, why it is that they  looked up to Matt and wishing him well and telling him to get better.  And it was it was an unbelievable thing to think to watch.  And I'm sure that he just had so many people on Metafilter on Twitter, you know, wondering  what happened, what the update was.  And that blog post was unbelievable.  But he said that the tweets made him cry.  He was in the hospital because he felt like he was getting to hear all the things that  people would have said about him at his funeral.  Which just broke my heart.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, thank God he's OK.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, it looks like he will be.  It looks like that they will be.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He went he says he went to the hospital with a bad flu and two hours later, a routine cat  scan on his head found a lump.  That's just you know, it's interesting, though.  This is this is really, I think, a measure of the evolution of these tools that we're  really able to have community around these tools now.  It feels like it's a little more personal than it was when it was just blogs.  Is that me or is that the case?

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  I think I think it's part of the ambient intimacy.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We just update people on little bits of our lives.  I absolutely agree.  Yeah.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  The idea that you're that you can share these pieces that are much more personal.  And I think Twitter for me feels better.  You know, it feels like a better place to do that.  I wouldn't put it on my blog because that's where I talk about, you know, serious issues  or my food blog or whatever.  But the idea that, you know, I could say, you know, yesterday afternoon, I was just  so looking forward to taking a nap, which is so unbelievably boring.  But for anybody who knows me, you know, they know what's going on with me right at that  moment.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  One of the most amazing tales I've seen is Penelope Trunk, who tweeted her miscarriage  in a board meeting of her company.  And she said she was glad because otherwise she was going to have to get an abortion.  So there was much fewer, much hubbub on TV, all kinds of things.  But she just said women have to be able to talk about their lives.  And that includes this.  And she is eloquent in her defense.  She also talks about how she says she has Asperger's syndrome and how she has worked  through that, what that does in her company.  Incredible transparency and the courage that comes in that that's really quite amazing,  even against that kind of attack that you can believe she got.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Are the attacks going to go away?  Are we going to get more comfortable with people telling the truth and being honest  and forthright and transparent?  And maybe that maybe the attacks are just kind of the the the biosphere saying, oh,  that makes us cringy and then getting used to it, maybe and saying, oh, OK, or is it  just going to get worse?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I argue there's a there's a theory of mutually assured humiliation.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Once we have all told our story.  Yeah.  You know, you talk about your prostate.  That's right.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  I don't know.  You know, I on the one hand, you have all the troll activity where people are really  into just baiting, you know, the the I mean, and it can be I mean, people say that Andrew  Keane is a troll, right?  No, I love him.  He he writes, I know I like Andrew too, and he's a friend and he lives near me and blah,  blah, blah.  But I mean, you have that kind of stuff.  You have people who are you know, you have the anonymous folks who are constantly those  are the trolls, the sociology, the Scientology people.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, if you're if you have a byline like Andrew does, that's not trolling.  That may be provocative, although Michael Arntons kind of a troll.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  But the definition of trolling is that you're a troll.  Trolling is that you're you're you know, you're baiting people.  Right.  And and the thing is, is that when Andrew comes out with a book and says, you know,  everything online is crap and that was trolling.  The analog world world was the best.  Yeah.  You know, well, OK, that's a that's a kind of troll.  And then showing up at a bunch of like internet focused conferences, you know, I mean, you're  you're trolling.  It's just doing it in person, you know.  So I don't know.  I don't know. I mean, there's that.  And then there's people who I mean, Gina can probably speak to this as well.  But, you know, I get death threats all, you know, like on a regular basis.  Yeah.  I mean, welcome to being a woman on the Internet.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So Cathy Sierra's Cathy Sierra's horrible experience was not isolated.  You're saying this is common.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  No.  Definitely.  Well, the thing that's different about her thing was that somebody put in a lot of time  and was consistently going after her.  And so it was the over time, this is freaking me out kind of thing.  Right.  That's my standard.  And it was before her incident is OK, so I get these things and I kind of blow them off  because I figure someone's just mad and they say something.  But if they spend a lot of time and are consistently doing something really freaky, OK,  that's where I'm going to go do something and have to take action.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, it's interesting to say that because I've been a public figure on the radio TV  and the Internet for 32 years, never once received a death threat.  Never once.  My daughter does a podcast for two months and gets a death threat.  So maybe it is gender based.  It reflects badly on men, if that's the case.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  Yeah, they were all for men.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think people on the Internet just seem a lot more accessible, a lot more easy to harass,  you know what I mean, versus being on TV or the radio.  Does that make sense?  Like because of the nature of the medium?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think no, no, no, no.  I think every woman on television has had maybe not death threats per se, although some of that,  but a lot of nasty stuff.  Everyone, every woman I've worked with on television has had much more many more problems with stalkers,  creeps, threats of all kinds than I've ever had.  That makes me so sad.  That's so horrible.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There's such value in publicness and then to scare people off of this.  Terrible.  New social world is such a horrible waste that someone can ruin it so easily.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Mary, you're saying you're willing to put up with it?

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  I said I'm willing to put a lot of information about myself out publicly,  but my address is never online.  And there's just certain things that I just won't put out there because I know this is a problem.  You get these things and it's on a semi-regular basis.  Even now, I'm in stealth mode making a new company, right?  And even now, just because I have a blog and I go to conferences and I occasionally speak, it happens.  People get, basically it's mostly done.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And yet I have an open door here.  We publish our address.  People wander in almost every day and say hi.  Maybe I'm crazy, but I think it's gender-based.  I really do and I think that's horrible.  And it's something we've really got to resolve.  This troll problem in general is something we have to solve.  And I would hope that openness and transparency might become so commonplace  that we kind of get over it and start realizing that we're all real people.  I think initially when you experience somebody on the internet,  you don't have a sense of them as a real person.  I know when I read comments, for instance, on my blog, I assume everybody's just like me.  And so I give them perhaps more weight than I should in some cases.  And I think when people experience somebody in a medium,  I think it's true of TV and radio as much as the internet, but let's say the internet.  Initially, in the early days, there wasn't the sense that this is a real person on the other end.  But the more we get a sense that this is a real person, a vulnerable person,  this could be your mother or your sister, don't you think that will help?

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  I think it helps, but the other piece is,  is anybody rallying around and being the community to help?  There was a comic this week that came out, or maybe it was from last Monday's issue of The New Yorker,  which I put up on my Flickr stream, and it was a panel of guys,  and they're saying the topic of this week's panel is why are there no women on this panel?  And so Kalia Hamlin is doing a panel at South by Southwest in the spring with a bunch of guys,  and she's just going to pick a group of guys to talk about what they're doing  and what other guys are doing to deal with some of the issues that women in technology face.  And it's a really interesting take on the problem, because we, the women, like we hate complaining.  We hate whining about the fact that there are certain things that really suck for us.  And I don't want to spend my time on that. I want to be a technologist.  That's what I really do. That's what I spend most of my time on.  So, but I also recognize that, you know, her approach on this panel,  which is to get guys focused on, you know, helping be part of the community  so that you just don't have to be self-defending.  You can actually have a community that looks at the issue and says,  hey, maybe we can do something about X, Y, or Z issue, is a lot better.  But we're not, you know, we may be good having community with Twitter  and sharing our, some of our personal experiences,  but I don't think we're quite there yet where, you know, we say,  okay, it's really important that we do, you know, X things and everybody has to rally around  or it's not going to help. It doesn't just help if the women defend themselves  or the minorities defend themselves or the children defend themselves.  Like the whole community has to do it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, in fact, Kathy, Sierra got a lot of, a lot more heat because of coming forward  that unnecessarily she, I mean, that was terrible.  The way people were, some people responded to her situation was devastating.  I think it's important to talk about this.  I know this isn't, this isn't really about Google, but it is about life in the cloud.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's about life in the cloud.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And I think it's really important to talk about it because I think as people,  I think some of it is people don't realize what it's like.  And so it's important to kind of let the world know that it is kind of nasty out there.  And we need to do something about it because we want to use these tools.  We want to be public. We want to be transparent.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, Danny O'Brien always says that bloggers are, you know, famous enough to have stalkers,  but not famous enough to have bodyguards.  And that's, you know, that's really true.  You know, I don't really talk about it. I've dealt with these kinds of issues for a long time  as I assume most public women on the internet or on TV, radio do.  And my response is just to show up on Twig every week and to put out a new book and to do another blog post  and just, you know, keep, you know, every time I do that, I feel like I'm saying, screw you, you know,  to anyone who's ever, you know, tried to threaten me or shut me up in any way.  Like I take it as a personal, like somebody's trying to shut me up, so I'm just going to keep talking.  But I think it's important to do what Khalia is doing as well.  I get, I don't know, a few years ago, I just got so kind of tired of the like where are the women panels  and conversations that happen at a lot of conferences.  I'm so glad that they're happening, but I just want to like, you know, I don't want to talk about technology.  You know, I don't want to talk about this, you know, as much, probably maybe to a fault.  Maybe I should be talking about it more.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, it is tech. I mean, you know, part of technology is the new social rules that spring up around these new media  and the new ways that we relate to each other.  And I think that we have to talk about those and talk about what goes on so that we can absorb it and use it.  You can't, I think we can't just blithely go along and say, well, it's just like the real world, only virtual, because it isn't.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, it is to the extent the real world has bozos and there are bozos on the Internet as well.  And I think it's important not to assume that everyone is a bozo, that we judge it as the lowest common denominator.  None of us does.  You know, it's Jimmy Wales, when he won an award at the Monaco Media Forum this week, said the greatest lesson in Wikipedia is people are basically good.  And Wikipedia is built on that. Like Google, like the cloud, like most applications, it has to be built also to protect against the one bozo who can ruin the whole party.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yep. Wikipedia is looking for money again. Jimmy has done an interesting thing.  You know, he could make millions and millions every year by just taking a few ads, a few judicious ads on Wikipedia.  And yet to his great credit and the foundation's great credit, they have it.  They've started a new campaign to raise, what is it, seven and a half million that they need to run.  They're actually running deficit. The cost of Wikipedia is nine million a year, I think.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  Wow. Yeah, that's an amazing number.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And it's such a treasure. I want to say a resource, but it's more than a resource.  It's a treasure of the Internet. And it's kind of stunning to think that they, well, I mean, thank goodness people donate.  Wikipedia forever is the new tagline if you want to donate.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Sue Gardner, who's the head of the foundation, said that they actually don't have a lot of trouble as a rule getting the money to run it.  And it takes very little money if you consider the size that it is.  Oh, yeah.  It's this huge resource that we have. If I said this in a previous show, stop me.  I'm of the age when this happens.  But she said at the Aspen Institute that they calculated just the value of the edits that occur on Wikipedia in a year.  And they ascribed a low per hour labor cost to that, barely above minimum wage.  And it still added up to hundreds of millions of dollars of value a year.  That's a non-monetary value that makes Wikipedia Wikipedia and makes it possible to create this incredible resource on what is in that concept, that perspective, very little money.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They say one of the top five visited websites in the world, 35 people is all they employ.  Most of the money goes to, I'm sure, surfers and bandwidth.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, you consider that Craigslist has what now? I think 30 employees.  And though they'll never say it, the reported income of Craigslist is $100 million.  Yeah. I mean, imagine.  And that was part of the process of doing in $10 billion worth of classified ad revenue.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He, by the way, Craig just joined Wikimedia's advice report.  So I don't know if there's some nexus there, but maybe he can help them figure out a way.  Speaking of bozos, Rupert Murdoch. Have we talked? Rupert Murdoch, that's all I have to say.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  You know what? You only have to say his name and everyone who's in Internet land will just laugh.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Or now, because he's talking about cutting off Google. Yeah, crazy.  Cory Dock wrote a brilliant post and then a column for The Guardian when he just said that he was an old man shuffling along.  Michael Wolf said that as of a year ago, the man had never used Google.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He calls Google a plagiarist.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And I have a few other nasty words and talks about cutting it off.  I put up a post on the on my blog with some German stats that a company did that said that they looked at all the German sites and saw that news sites accounted for only five percent.  Well, this way in all the German sites they could track German search queries on Google news sites didn't show up on the first page on 95 percent of them.  So they showed up only on the first page on five percent of them.  The number one slot in a search result news sites had four point one percent of them.  Wikipedia had thirteen point six percent of them.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So they should be complaining. Yeah.  Wikipedia. There's a good idea.  Let's let's let's have Wikipedia off of Google.  Anybody with any now, Jason Calacanis had an interesting point in his newsletter.  He said, but what if Rupert's crazy like a fox?  What if he and all of the other content providers pull their content off of Google?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think we're not going to. But anybody's going to come in and ruin the party.  Number one. Number two, Rupert gets three hundred million dollars from MySpace, which he's trying to negotiate.  He Jason also talked about the New York Times doing this well about dot com, which is owned by the New York Times.  And it's the only bright spot in the entire company.  PNL, it gets 80 percent of its traffic and 50 percent of its revenue from Google.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I guess there you go. You just said they're not going to have some of their notes.  Not happening, Jason. So what's going to happen to Rupert?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, some publishers, I think, might actually do this.  But I think I think that they will. It's if they're fall.  Rupert is the pied piper trying to lead them off the cliff. Come with me, Lemmings.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Come with me. Who needs to find you on the Internet? That's overrated.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  I think the best thing Corey said was that he described him as a mustache twirler.  It's just like so, you know, nightly Murdoch here.  Exactly. But, you know, what's funny about the about that is that I think what he did was was throw out kind of this this argument,  this this stance and try to do a momentum play to see if a bunch of people would follow him because they're not going to do it until next June.  And then there was some announcement later this week that, well, June may slip.  And it's like, you know, I think what they're hoping is that a bunch of people come in behind them and say, OK, we'll we'll go along with it.  We'll all do it together and see what happens. But, you know, I just don't like Jeff.  I mean, I just don't see it. I don't see any of them doing it.  And I see the whole thing in the spring just being quietly like swept under the rug.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think you're exactly right, Mary. It's an attempt to bring others along and negotiate with Google.  What they don't understand in the essential architecture of the link economy.  Sorry, I said it again, is that it's up to the recipient of the link to take the value out of this.  And newspapers don't have nearly enough traffic and nearly enough engagement with the audience.  I saw an editor from a UK newspaper group say we already have enough audience.  How can a newspaper say that? That's because they're not monetizing the traffic they're getting from Google.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We don't want any more. Who needs more readers?  So it's not it's interesting. I just assumed he was his problem was with Google News.  It's with Google search results in general.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's what they're saying. They're trying to act all tough.  It's that Australian macho thing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, man. Well, it just makes you look clueless, Rupert.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  It also kind of reminds me of every time the AT&T CEO or other CEOs of giant telco ISP types go on about how Google should pay them  because they're helping them deliver their search results or whatever it is, whatever piece of Google site that users are going to.  And I mean, if you're in this, you know that the users are paying for their bandwidth.  Google's paying for their bandwidth. It's completely ridiculous.  But it's this sort of stupid legacy way of thinking.  They're trying to impose the cable model on Google and bandwidth.  And it's Rupert Murdoch trying to impose some kind of legacy understanding of the world.  It's just it's like not how it is. And there's just no way this is ever going to work.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Nice try.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I wrote a post last week arguing that the future of news is entrepreneurial, not institutional.  I don't think that the institutions can see the world this new way. I finally give up.  I tried for 15 years personally, and I think that it's too painful to shrink down to the appropriate size for a web business and a member of a network rather than the older of everything.  And I think it's a shame because a lot of people are going to suffer along the way. They already are. But that's the new reality.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I like it. I like it. And I think you're right. I think that that's that's that's that's becoming clearer and clearer.  I don't think you can even deny that at this point.  How's the book doing, Gina? Google the Gina's Google Wave book is online at Gina.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Complete wave guide dot com.  Complete wave guide.  I think there's a little bit of a delay here for some reason.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think there's delay because you just don't want the site to go down again.  I don't know. Should I say it?  Well, there's that. Should I mention it?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  The book is doing great. And actually, the PDF is going to be available this week.  I'm editing doing the final copy edits tonight.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's what I wanted to know. That's exciting.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So that'll be fun. I'm going to do a talk on wave at Web 2.0 Expo this week on Wednesday.  And the book should be available as a PDF until then.  But until then, it will always be available at complete wave guide dot com in full.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And the site is coming along. It's a little slow right now, but it's coming up.  It'll be up any minute now. I'm sure it will.  It's just a matter of time. Completed eight of 11 items.  Okay, I think we've got it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Matt Cutts said this week that they might now put site page speed as a factor in page rank.  Yeah, I'm screwed.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, you know what? It got in. We didn't get all the graphics, but we got the text.  And that's what matters.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's most important.  Yeah.  Man, Twit can take down a site in one fell swoop.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's all it takes. Hey, have you thought about an audio version of this book?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, that's a good question.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'd like to volunteer if you... Somebody said, you know, why don't you read it, Leo?  And then you could have an audio version.  There's probably too many demonstrations of how stuff works and stuff, right?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Click next and then choose from the menu. Yeah, there's a lot of that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Follow along as I explain.  Yeah, maybe. I don't know. A lot of textbooks don't translate well to audio, but there's a lot of pros in this book.  I don't know. I think it'd be kind of fun to make an audio version. Anyway, just mention this.  So what's the deal with page rank? Matt says you got to be fast.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, this is part of this new protocol that I don't understand. So Gina will explain it to me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The SPDY protocol. SPDY or Spidy? Is it SPDY or Spidy? I don't know.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think you say it's SPDY. I think people pronounce it as speedy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It probably is speedy, although I think for some reason it's Spidy because of the spider thing. It's the Spidy sense.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So what is SPDY? SPDY is a new protocol for fetching web pages. I mean, they're saying it's not new.  It's actually based on HTTP, but overrides a couple of HTTP methods to make it a little faster that Google's putting out.  Google's all about being fast, right? With Google Chrome OS and with SPDY and with Wave and with Chrome in general.  But yeah, so SPDY is supposed to make web pages a lot snappier. And it's based on HTTP, but it uses a little magic.  It compresses headers and it allows for multiplex requests. It allows for the web server to prioritize requests.  So I can say, hey, you know what? That background image, not as important, but the text really important.  And like I said, it's based on HTTP, but it is Google only. So someone, I forget what article mentioned that for it really to take hold,  we want the IETF to be in charge of the standard. We really don't want Google in charge of the standard, the way that the protocol in which web pages are delivered.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Would it be something I could add like an Apache module? Do I have to run a different server to make it work? How does it?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's what I imagine. So this is still really young, but it seems like yes, this is something that would have to be built into both the web server and to the browser.  So this is going to be the big challenge to write like they're going to be able to make Chrome understand SPDY requests and get SPDY requests very easily.  But, you know, getting that into Internet Explorer, which doesn't even really support HTML5 yet, might be a challenge.  But it is I imagine I'm not sure, but I imagine that the way it work is that there would just be an Apache module that could that could send, you know, respond to requests via SPDY that way.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So it wouldn't be required. But if you happen to have the kind of upgrade, it'll make you faster if it's SPDY to SPDY.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Is that what you're saying? Yeah, I mean, I mean, there would have to be some graceful degradation, right?  So I imagine that, yeah, your client would make the request and if the server the server and the client will both have to be able to talk to one another in SPDY.  And I imagine that they would be able to to detect that on either end. And if not, they would fall back to HTTP regular straight up HTTP.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Mary, I know you're very interested in the mobile phone platforms. Are you using a droid by any chance?

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  No, but I'm really interested in one. But actually, I have a comment about what Gina just said.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Get away from my droid, Gina. Go ahead, Mary. I'm sorry.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  I was thinking when she was talking about how you, you know, the idea that your site.  So let's say you have a very large site, right? And you have a lot of traffic.  And so what happens is, is that as people hit your site, you know, things can slow down.  Well, you can prioritize certain things and you can also block certain things in terms of bots that are spidering you.  So, you know, if you have a large site, a gazillion things are going to try to spider you, not just Google and ask and being and whoever.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's always 20 bots on my site at any one time.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  Yeah. And actually, a bunch of them can be kind of destructive.  So you do when you once you figure out what certain bots are, you will often block those bots, right?  Because they're they're bad. And so the thing that you would do if you were going to be really sneaky about this is you would say, well, whenever the Google bots show up,  then, you know, prioritize the traffic there, make it load really fast because that'll get us higher in search results.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, that is clever.  Oh, sneaky.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The dark art.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Speedy activate for the Google bots.  But everybody, all the other minions get the regular HTTP.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm looking there. There are 35 people on my site right now and 16 bots.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's crazy.  Yeah, it's crazy.  And yeah, and so many bots just don't respect the robots that text or just aggressive and just suck down pages so quickly.  And the most actually pretty respectful.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, I have there's there's two instances of Google bot and there's like 12 instances of MSN.  Go away.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  And then there are sites that are bad one to pipes.  Yeah, the pipes parser, you know, that pulls XML.  Yeah, yeah.  Go ahead, Mary.  Sorry.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  I was just going to say there are also sites where I think the engineers are just not experienced at at creating spiders that are respectful.  So it's not just the robots TXT, but they actually don't know how to deal with, you know, how many times are you going to ping the an RSS thing?  Or is there some alternative like using the, you know, ping a medic or mash some kind of mash system or whatever?  So, you know, by the same token, I mean, they really should be looking at every site and saying we're not sending 12 bots to one site.  That's just crazy.  You know, that's the kind of stuff that, you know, it's just to me, I say it is inexperienced.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is a WordPress thing called users online.  It's just a little plug in.  But it's nice to know.  I mean, you can see, you know, what you can see what the bots are scanning and so forth.  You know what I've been using, which I love is chart beat.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That thing is like Times Square for websites.  It's like pulsing.  Yeah.  A live heat map and stuff.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, it's really, it's really cool.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm sorry.  We'll stop geeking out.  So, Mary, you haven't got a droid yet.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  So I don't have a droid.  No.  But we are looking at the SDK and, you know, yeah, I know.  I've, I've, I've seen them, but I haven't.  I don't have one.  Although I did actually have a conversation yesterday or maybe Friday with Kevin Marks  about we're scheming about how we can each get one for free.  Yeah, that's the problem.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's pretty expensive when you add up the Verizon, the, you know, access for two years.  It's expensive.  So Leo, what's the verdict?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Far out.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's really much better than even than I thought.  You don't need, you might look at the errors because the keyboard, now I have fat fingers,  but the keyboard is really hard to type on.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I finally went to Verizon store and played that keyboard is disappointing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's pretty disappointing.  And I find I don't really open it up that much because the onscreen keyboard, you know,  I'm used to from an iPhone using the onscreen keyboard.  It's actually a little better than the iPhone keyboard because it's predictive text.  I like the way Android does it much better where it gives you a bar above the keyboard  with what it thinks you might want.  It's very good.  It's much better than the iPhone.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  I love my G2 for exactly that reason.  And I've gotten used to the keyboard now and I don't miss having a physical keyboard.  Yeah, I'm not sure you need this.  So you might look at the Eris, which is thinner, lighter, lighter.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And now right now it's only it doesn't have it has cupcake on it, but it's going to have 2.0.  And cheaper too, I think.  Yeah, 99 bucks.  And I'm told I was told by my Verizon contact that they plan to update to 2.0 soon like this month.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  So I went to the spot Mitzvah a couple of weeks ago in Chicago and these there are all these  young girls who were super excited about any kind of gadget.  And I do have a bunch of phones because we're doing mobile stuff.  So I gave them my G2 and I said, OK, you know, do something.  And and and just the quick, quick, you know, thumbing action of these girls was unbelievable.  I was like, OK, if they can do that, there's no reason to have an actual physical keyboard.  It was not at all.  They were really good and really fast.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm very impressed with the 2.0.  When you put it on a platform that's speedy, I guess the G2 is pretty speedy, but the Android has a really nice processor.  This is totally usable.  The only thing that bugs the heck out of me is there's only three screens.  It's that they need more screens.  I don't understand.  You know, you can decide.  Yeah, it is weird that there's only three.  You can you know, you can get add ons that will allow you to, you know, change the home.  But they're all crappy and they slow it down and they crash and stuff.  So I have tried them.  But but the with between widgets and the icons, I mean, I've filled up my real estate very quickly and I could use a lot more.  But otherwise, it's very good.  There are a few applications on the iPhone that I love that I miss on here, like Mint, a lot of the photo applications.  Camera's a little disappointing.  It's not great.  It's about as good as the iPhone, not much better despite the megapixel count.  But it feels good.  It's a little heavier, about six ounces heavier than the iPhone, but it feels solid.  And I think it's a I mean, I have no problem using it exclusively.  Not at all.  I don't I don't miss my iPhone at all.  Yeah.  Well, OK, I should be honest.  I miss it because I can't play my Audible books on it.  But other than that, speaking of which, I should check and see if we have any commercials.  I've been I've been having so much fun talking about this stuff.  Oh, my gosh.  We've missed all our commercials.  Well, let's start with an audible commercial.  What do you say?  Wait a minute.  No, no, we didn't.  We have a Ford commercial.  Oh, wow.  Yes.  Oh, you'd say, oh, it's funny because I have one of my philosophies in life is you don't  do ads for something you don't use.  Right.  So when Ford said we're going to buy ad time, I had to go out and get a Mustang.  And it's poor you.  And it's fun to watch.  I mean, we just we have there's a whenever the kids walk by, they people have been posing  in front of the Mustangs parked out front.  They've been posing with it.  It's this beautiful candy apple red.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  Anyway, so you're going to do the ad.  Yes.  Do we get to see you driving around in the car?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, but that's next week.  I am going to I decided instead of because normally I do the ads.  I just sit here.  We talk next week.  I'm going to take a camera.  I'm going to pre tape ads so you can see it.  And I'll be driving around.  But the ad is not for the car.  The ad is for the thing that comes in the car that is only available in Ford, Lincoln  and Mercury vehicles.  And it's their it's their hands free Bluetooth system, their audio system.  And actually it works great with the Droid, except because Droid doesn't support audible.  I can't play my audiobooks.  So I have to use the iPhone with my sink.  And that's that's actually what I was going to mention.  I really I get in the car.  And first of all, I can use both phones.  So I have you can have up to 25 phones.  Mary, you'd like that.  You know, 25 phones with the Ford stack of phones.  And you just pick which one you want to make the calls on.  And so I usually make the calls on the Verizon because I get a better connection.  But then I listen to the audio.  It also has a USB connector, which is really nice.  So with a Zune or the iPhone, you just bring the appropriate cable.  You plug it into the USB connector.  It charges in the music plays through it.  In fact, it indexes all the contents of the device works with the Android to indexes  everything that's on there.  And now I can say by name, I can say play this week in Google or I can say play the Beatles.  I can I can the whole point of the sync stuff is the voice recognition.  And it's spectacular.  You can say read me the New York Times front page.  You can say, you know, of course, I could say call Gina Tripani on her cell.  It's very high quality voice recognition.  It really does a great job.  You can even have it read you SMS messages on phones that are equipped to do that.  Apparently, that's a new Bluetooth standard and not all phones yet support it.  But those phones that do, it'll read you your SMS messages.  The whole point being it's not legal in 18 states now to hold a phone while you're driving.  Thank goodness should be illegal everywhere.  It's not legal to actually wait.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  Hold on. Hold on.  I was actually pulled over for holding my phone while I wasn't using it.  And I got a ticket.  It's twenty dollars.  Yeah.  And I'm fighting it because I showed the officer the log that I hadn't been on the phone.  OK, Maria Shriver.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  But here's the deal.  I went I he cited the code in California and I looked it up and it's it's OK to touch your phone.  What it's not OK is to use your phone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So you could be driving along holding it.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  Yeah, that's exactly what I was doing.  Isn't the presumption?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Isn't the presumption though that you're holding it for a reason?

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  No, I picked it up because it started sliding around the car and I was going around a corner and I was two blocks from home and I just didn't want it to fly around the car.  So anyway, in my driveway, I was written a ticket in your driveway.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  And I showed him the log and he didn't care.  And and he was like, look, if you keep arguing with me, I'm going to write you a ticket for running a stop sign.  And I said, did I run a stop sign?  And he said no, but I'll write you a ticket for it.  What?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, you should have had the flip camera going then.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.  Totally sure.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm using my phone to get you lose your job.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I you see on YouTube now you see a lot of video of cop malfeasance.  I think that's a good one.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So, Leo, one more plug for Ford here.  I got a press release from them about a week ago that they with University of Michigan, they're testing during kind of a contest for apps that in car connectivity and social networking.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, that's so cool.  Yeah, they've got a guy, Scott Money, who is their social media guy, and he's very active in promoting this.  In fact, he told me about dial to do.  I don't know if you guys use dial to do.  It's amazing.  It's kind of like Jot was, but it's still free.  And so on the car, I'll say call dial to do and then I can do expenses.  I mean, you can really run your life just driving along and talking to the phone or talking to the Ford Sink.  It's just incredible.  One more thing that we'll move on and that is they are giving away 15 nanos and 15 zoons.  And it's very easy to participate.  You can either read up on online at their website, syncmyridepodcast.com.  Or you just tweet to win.  If you send a tweet, say something like, really enjoying this week's twig.  You can say anything you want, but it'd be nice if you said that.  And use the hashtag pound sync my ride podcast.  You'll be automatically entered into the daily drawing for the nano or the zoom, your choice.  So pound sync my ride podcast.  Tweet that and get in the drawing for the nano or the zoom through December 8th.  And I'm happy to say many of these tweets I'm looking at a mentioned twit or twig or one of the twas.  So give us a little plug when you're doing that.  And we thank Ford very much for their support of this week in Google.  1080p for YouTube.  Boy, I tell you, that's an amazing technological feat.  I don't even know how they're going to do it.  We've tried to send 1080p video and even downloadable 1080p video, nobody can play it back.  Are we excited? No, I guess not. I'll move on.  I'm excited only because it means we can do high def video on YouTube, but I guess nobody else cares one bit.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  So there's other sites too that do high def and I've seen YouTube.  Not 1080p though.  Well, I know. But the point is, is that there is a button that I can push,  but I'm not watching video on my computer from YouTube so that I can watch high def.  Like I didn't come there for that.  What did you go there for?  I came there for crappy video that was some funny weird thing like a police officer being recorded on someone's cell phone.  And who cares if it's high def? It was taken on a cell phone.  Right.  For God sakes. You know, I mean, I just and so I don't I don't care.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I have to say I I always press the HQ button if it's there.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I do too. Yeah, I was going to say I like the quality.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, yeah. And I think there's a certain expectation.  Here's why I'm excited.  It's TV's in trouble.  I mean, if you're if you are now able to watch anything you want anytime at high def on either on your computer or on your screen through the Internet,  it's got to be tougher and tougher for a television network or a cable companies to succeed in this environment.  I mean, 1080p is amazing. I don't know how YouTube is going to do it.  It also to me, it shows that Google feels like they're that you they're committing to YouTube.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They have been saying that that it's doing better and better.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Exactly. They're profitable now.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  Chad has been saying they had their best quarter ever, even in this downturn.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  You don't believe it?  I don't believe it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Why not?

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  I don't buy it.  I think that it's so expensive to host host and play video out.  And while I think that they are making some money with ads, I just I don't buy the the earlier show where we talked about.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Sorry. What was it?  Peer to peer.  They call it Leo.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, it's gone out of my mind.  Peering, it's called.  Peering. Yeah.  I think you lost a video for Google.  Right. The point being that Google probably doesn't pay for its bandwidth anymore.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, and in that sense, you know, maybe they are closer to breaking even.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You don't see a lot of ads.  And I have to say what ads you see are kind of, you know, you close them right away, don't you?

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  Yeah. But I mean, I watch all the TV shows that I watch somehow over my computer.  We use Hulu.  We use Project Runway dot com because we watch that show or lifetime.  We watch, you know, old prisoner videos on because, you know, the new one's going to come out.  We're watching that on Hulu.  I mean, there's I don't know. We get Netflix.  There's Netflix streaming.  There's I don't know.  There's a whole bunch of different ways.  Oh, we buy whole shows, whole seasons of shows on iTunes, you know, and on Amazon.  I mean, we just have all these ways to get video that are legal.  We buy them. We watch the ads.  And actually, you know, all those shows that are being streamed are showing a lot of ads now.  And it's fine. It's not overly intrusive.  It's just, you know, about every 10 minutes into the show, they stop and they show you one ad.  I think Hulu wants to do a paywall.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Isn't Hulu going to do a paywall next year?  They've been threatening that, but that's also part of the News Corp conspiracy.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's Rupert again.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Rupert.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  But the point is, is that, you know, there's there are a lot of ways to watch.  And when I'm doing all that stuff, I definitely watch high def or good quality.  Like, I don't want to watch a whole show that's YouTube quality or some, you know, terrible cell phone quality.  But I, you know, I think that I actually think that TV programs can figure out a way to do this.  They're being far, far smarter and doing experimentation a lot earlier in the process of being disintermediated by the Web versus like print news.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Or the record industry.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  Or the record industry.  I mean, it's just it's it's a huge, huge difference.  And it's all it feels like they're being, you know, very reasonable with me as a user watching this stuff.  I don't feel overwhelmed.  I don't feel like it's obnoxious.  I know they have to make money.  I'm perfectly happy to either pay or watch ads.  I just want to be able to get to the stuff whenever I want to get to it.  And I don't want to know what channel it's on.  And I don't want to know what time it's on because it doesn't matter to me.  I just want to watch the show.  And they're making that they're making that possible.  And I really appreciate it.  So I feel like they have a chance at doing this.  You guys agree?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's the future of TV is things like Hulu online.  Gina.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's certainly where I'm getting more and more of my TV.  Me too.  Yeah, I do.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so, too.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think that the challenge now is what you the word you used earlier, Leo, which is curation.  And and it's hard to find the new stuff and find the good stuff.  There's a new site that just started called Click Something, which is another effort to do this.  I don't know if I can find it in a second here.  And so I think that that's one of the opportunities you have is to is to help recommend things as we're not one size fits all anymore.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We were talking about curation about we have a film crew in here from a website called Eguiders.com.  And that's the whole idea of it.  It's curation of YouTube and other videos by big name people, movie stars, movie producers, net celebrities and that kind of thing.  It's kind of a neat idea.  I think curation is really exciting.  That's what Twitter really is, is curation to some degree.  I found it at Clicker.com.  Clicker.com.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Jim Landzone, who was the CEO of Ask.com.  Right. Very good.  It's his new startup.  Jeff Pulver tried one earlier a little too soon, I think.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But Andrew Barron is doing a kind of a YouTube aggregation play.  This seems like a very popular thing to do right now, but they can't all succeed.  So it's going to be interesting to see who who wins on that.  Mary, you were saying something. I'm sorry.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  I just said that I think the curation piece is really key.  But I get most of my recommendations for this stuff from Twitter.  Twitter is curation.  Four years ago, Dabble, my company, was actually really almost feature for feature what Andrew's doing.  I think it was just way too early.  Right.  But I think that the curation, the recommendation piece is really key.  But I think Twitter actually does a lot of that for me now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You mentioned Andrew's site, Magma, M-A-G-Dot-M-A.  But you're right.  It's a very nice interface.  I think in a way all you need is, yeah, it's a beautiful interface, but it might be heavy.  Really all you need is kind of the stream of text with links in it.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  And you see a few people recommend something, and all of a sudden it's like, oh, Glee, maybe I'll check that TV show out.  That's what I did.  Where can I find that?  That's exactly what I did.  And then I went to Hulu, and because Hulu has links everywhere, and I got it.  And I never would go to any recommender site again to get that particular show, because that's what makes me skeptical about some of the recommender sites for video, is that longer video, once you know about a show, you never need to go there again to find Lost or any of the series.  You just need the first couple of recommendations where somebody says, oh my God, this is amazing.  You've got to watch it.  And then you do.  And that's it.  So I don't know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So maybe a lighter stream like Twitter that is easy to follow, doesn't take a lot of bandwidth to just follow that.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  Well, you know what you can do is actually tunein.com, which is Adam Hertz's new thing.  He was at Tech Narate.  And when I briefly overlapped with him at Tech Narate five years ago, that's when I got to know him.  And he's actually doing something now that I think Tech Narate probably should have done all along, which is so what he's doing is you take you, you throw your Twitter handle into tune in.  They look at all of your contacts and then they synthesize what media is everybody looking at every day.  So you so basically it could have taken you an hour a day to like scan Twitter now and then during the course of the day.  But instead you can cheat and you can go to tunein.com and you're like, here's what my friends are looking at.  And if three people looked at Glee, maybe I'll go look at Glee or whatever, or this New York Times article or whatever it is.  But it's a really great idea.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  If I started entertaining a weekly today, I think it definitely wouldn't be a magazine.  It would probably be Twitter streams.  Yeah. Wow.  Wow.  Oh, man.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's saying something.  Yeah.  We're going to wrap this.  I have to think about that, but we're going to wrap this up because it's because it's pizza night.  We got another show to do and I don't want to keep everybody here.  And but I got to I got to point out Gina's got a mean, cruel sense of humor.  You know what I'm talking about?  Yes.  She booked marked on our feed.  Google Street View catches Dutch firetruck knocking down little old lady Gina.  I am shocked, but it is kind of an amazing use of Street View.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's I mean, it's kind of it's remarkable.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I guess the Google they took the image of the knockdown off.  That's interesting.  You see that this image is no longer available.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, you know, the they so there are screenshots of it and it's you don't actually see the impact.  So it's possible this woman fell off of her bike as the firetruck went by.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  She was just she was she tried to stop.  And yeah, we don't know that they knocked her down.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right. And we don't I mean, hey, the Google Street View truck didn't stop to help her either.  It doesn't seem like it's quite a picture.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I have to say it is.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I mean, I know I have I do have a dark sense of humor.  I'm a New Yorker. Come on.  I had I had to bookmark that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm not saying anything.  I just wanted to point that out.  If you if you want to see all of the things that our crew bookmarks, unfortunately, we never get to all the stories.  We do put it on a friend feed room.  You go to friend feed dot com slash twit dash twig.  You can even comment there if you have something to say.  And it's it's a great resource.  All the stories we've we've we've set aside to do for the show are in there.  It's a great place to go.  But time, this show I could do for hours.  I really could. But we've run out of time.  So we're going to finally finish up as we always do.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  Sorry, Mary. We didn't we didn't even talk about the new the new programming language.  Go, go, go.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Go exclamation mark.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  I hear from from an engineering person that there already is the language called Go.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There is. And this guy who wrote it is pissed.  Oh, no, he's posted. He says, I'm mad.  They should have looked. I wrote Go.  Yeah. And it actually was quite a bit of sympathy.  I read in the in the in the thread, the forum thread where he posted that.  However, Google is kind of a little bit well known.  So I have a feeling this the name is going to stay.  It is the idea of Go is is what?  Gina, what is Go do?  Why do we need another language?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's it's super speedy.  It has lots of the benefits of fast languages like Python and Ruby, but all the kind of strength of C++.  It's like a compiled compiled scripting language or?  Yeah, it's a compiled scripting language, but it compiles apparently like extremely, extremely fast.  The entire language compiles in under 10 seconds.  It's like 120 K lines of code. So I saw.  So, yeah, yeah, I mean, it looks interesting.  I haven't played. I haven't played very much with it yet, but it's not strongly typed like Java or C or C plus or C sharp.  I want to say I always get C sharp and C++ screwed up.  But it's it's yeah, it's pretty pretty nerdy for pretty advanced programmers.  I think I think we'll really only see the benefits.  It's even a little far beyond my my purview as a lowly little web developer.  It looks interesting. And it's just part of their speedy.  It's part of speedy, you know, move. Yeah, speedy delivery.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So so if you use Google code, you currently use Python, right?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Python and Java and Java. Yep.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Will Go become the third language?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's a good that's a good question.  It seems like I mean, if hey, if they're going to, you know, if they want it to actually get adopted and people to use it, then they should they should do that.  You mean on Google App Engine, right?  App Engine is on App Engine. Yeah.  Yeah. It'd be interesting to see.  I'd like to see it get rolled out.  I mean, for people to take it seriously, it takes a long time to get it for a programming language to really gain traction.  So but there hasn't been a new low level system language that's come out in a long time and computers have changed a lot.  And that was kind of their point.  Like, hey, it's time to, you know, for something new to use what we use the resources we have.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So we also didn't mention that, according to Mike Arrington, Chrome OS may come out in its first public beta this week.  This week. That's what Arrington says.  Now, he's been wrong about Google before.  So, you know, take it with a grain of salt.  He's not going to go buy a machine.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Huh? Put it on there. Yeah.  Get your netbooks, kids. I'm all Apple.  So I've got to buy a new machine to put it on there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's interesting because in the normal, the normal barrier to writing a new operating system, there are two.  One is supporting the vast amount of hardware out there.  The other is how you got to get app writers to write apps for it.  You can't just deliver an operating system without applications.  So it's kind of a barrier to entry.  You can't just come along and be another Windows or another Mac OS.  What Google's done is, according to Mike, is they've thrown hundreds of developers on the device manager side and just cranking out device managers.  And actually, if you think about it, they've been in this kind of stealth mode creating applications for it all along.  They started the other direction.  They crowded Google Docs and Gmail and a bunch of Google Voice, a bunch of applications that will run on Google Chrome, perhaps better than they run on other operating systems.  So maybe in a way they have a shot at it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, Chrome is the browser is going to be the main application that has to run on this operating system.  That's all you need.  Yeah. And I mean, it's a Linux build. Right. But it's a Linux build, right?  I mean, presumably other Linux apps will run on Chrome OS out of the box.  Oh, OK. So I understood.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But so is Android. Why do we need? I don't understand why we need Android and Chrome OS.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right. I see what you're saying. I see what you're saying.  So what are they doing?  I think they just want to run a browser on it and everything else is going to be in the cloud.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's basically an extension of Chrome.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. A system level browser.  It's Chrome with device drivers.  Fast as hell. That'll be the goal.  And fast as hell.  Speedy delivery.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All right. I just had to throw those things in because you're right, Mary.  We didn't cover the two big stories of the week.  But now we have. Right. Anything I left out before we get to our tool, our number and our tip?  No. All right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think those are the big ones.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm always afraid. You know, that's one of my great fears now is that we're going to end the show and I go, oh, I forgot that.  Gina Tripani, time for your tip of the week.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Tip of the week. I'm going to rip this off from Jeff, who bookmarked this in our friend feed room.  Really easy to get movie showtime information directly in Google right now.  You put the name of your the movie you want to see and your zip code or city.  And if you click on the showtimes link, you get an in Google list of theaters, where it's playing a map view of how far the theaters are from where you are.  Reviews kind of all in one place.  So you really don't have to go to Fandango or Moviefone or, you know, other other sites for them.  Oh, for them. Oh, for them indeed.  So I just did Pirate Radio 94952.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And now there's a listing of times I can get more theaters.  I can get reviews, trailers. I. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  All in one place. And there's that map view on the on the left side. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Show map view. So, you know, it's interesting about this.  This is in a way this this is kind of a continues that that thesis that you don't need more than a browser.  You don't need apps. You just need the browser.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's the place page with what's going on inside now. Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Give me a browser. Give me Google and I'm ready to go.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  If it's a PC, but not if it's a mobile device or a Mac.  We still don't have Chrome on the. Well, OK. But I mean, like a personal computer.  I don't mean in the sense of. Right. No, no. Chrome.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Chrome OS is for a desktop or a netbook. Right.  Although Android meets it in the middle because they're putting Android on netbooks, too.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  This is a this is a constant argument between me and Kevin Marks about building for mobile around,  you know, wanting to build essentially apps that are just a wrapper for, you know, web pages.  And then having, you know, all the telcos and and their, you know, poor service basically for Internet access,  you know, holding you back.  And you can't have users just sitting around waiting and waiting and waiting for things to load.  So I think this is really true for when you have some kind of  ultimately wired connection or Wi-Fi, you know, regular Internet connection.  But I think anything over a cell network and that may go for little devices as well,  you know, netbooks that might want to have Internet access through a cell carrier versus Wi-Fi.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it gets messy. Yeah. Well, I hope you win that argument, Mary Hodder.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  So, Kevin, he works for a telco. I know. Well, the argument is, is should we do it now or later?  And that's all I just spent a year and a half developing for mobile where we were trying to do this.  And it loaded everything loaded so slowly.  And because I have both AT&T and T-Mobile service on different phones,  I can compare the phone service and the Internet access.  And, you know, it's bizarre.  Like you go somewhere and one works and the other doesn't.  And then you go, you know, 10 miles away and it's the complete opposite.  And it's not just, you know, Internet access, it's phone access.  And so I realized comparing these two phones the last year how absolutely, you know,  this is not a done deal for any kind of mobile thing at all.  And so you have to kind of build an app. Right. That's interesting.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I do like apps. I have to say for now. I do.  I don't like the idea of windowing a web page in an app. I like standalone.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  It can be great if it loads fast. It can be seamless. But it's got a load.  But yeah, guess what? Phone services can provide like quick loading. None of them. Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I guess it's almost the same argument about cloud computing. Really?  Similar problem.  On a little thing. All right. Our number of the week from J.J. Jarvis.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm going to go back to the evil Murdoch empire thing.  And Hitwise says the Wall Street Journal gets 25 percent of its traffic from Google.  Fifteen percent from Google and well, more than that, and 12 percent from Google News.  It gets seven percent from the Drudge report.  And then it goes down to Yahoo and so on.  But there's also these evil aggregators like RealClearPolitics and Drudge also send traffic to Wall Street Journal.  So this is what he's going to cut off.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He's got to cut off Drudge too, doesn't he? In RealClearPolitics, doesn't he?  I mean, if you're going to cut off Google.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Chase Carey, who is the head, the CEO of News Corp, who really does have a mustache to twirl.  He has an old handlebar mustache.  He was questioning the way the Wall Street Journal porous wall works.  If you go to Google and search for something, you can go straight into the Wall Street Journal.  The reason they do that is because they want the ads.  They need the, as Woody Allen would say, they need the eggs.  Sorry, an old reference nobody will get.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They need the eggs. The guy walks into a psychiatrist's office.  Right?  Hit it, Leo.  He says, my wife thinks she's a chicken.  The psychiatrist says, what does he say?  He says, why, so she should stop.  And he says, I would, but she needs, we need the eggs.  I told it wrong, but you get the idea.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  He falls for the high cut.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Something like that.  What would the psychiatrist say? I don't know.  We'll have to reconstruct that joke.  So my tool is really more of a tip.  And in fact, a tip that I probably don't think I would use.  If you use Google's Safe Search, if you've got kids at home  and you don't want them searching Google for little women  and finding little women,  you might want to lock your search settings.  So this is the new Safe Search Lock, which Google introduced this week.  You go to your search settings, and you can see I use moderate filtering.  But if you, because I don't want to see it either, frankly.  But if you want to lock your settings, there's a new setting here  that applies strict filtering to all searches from this computer.  You just lock your Safe Search.  You'll sign in with your Google password,  which is, I can't remember, but it's something like this.  Let's see if that works.  And then my Safe Search is locked across all Google.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  So how is it locked with, it locks to your login.  But how does it lock every search from Google from that machine?  What if you just use a different browser?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, come on. Who would do that?

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  The kids! The kids would do that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And now, by the way, I think this is the best reason to do it.  All your Google searches have big colored balls at the top of them.  I like that.  So you're absolutely right.  It has no utility at all, except it gives you colorful balls at the top of your search.  And that's why that's my tool of the week.  You're absolutely right, Mary. It's completely useless.  I don't even know why they did it.  So Leo, I use open DNS and that blocks everything all the time.  Yes, Mr. Jarvis.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  This guy goes to a psychiatrist and says, Doc, my brother's crazy.  He thinks he's a chicken.  And the doctor says, well, why don't you turn him in?  And the guy says, I would, but we need the eggs.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, let me see if there's an instant rim shot dot com.  There's an iPhone app for that.  I even get my sound effects from the cloud.  Thank you very much.  Instant rim shot dot com, ladies and gentlemen.  There's also instant sad trombone dot com, but that's only if you tell a bad joke.  Mary Hodder, thank you for putting up with us.  We're really glad you came today.  I'm sorry you didn't bring your persimmon cake with you, but that's okay.  We're glad to have you here.  You can find her in napsterization dot org slash stories.  She also has a great cooking blog with lots of wonderful pictures of food that's going to make you very hungry.  Gina Trapani, we thank you for being here as well.  Of course, Gina is the woman in charge at smarterware dot org, founder of Lifehacker, and her new book is online.  You'll be able to buy the PDF this week.  It is at, I always get it backwards, so you better say it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's at complete wave guide dot com.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But it is the complete guide to Google Wave.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes, but the title, yeah, it's a little confusing.  She's German.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  She puts the guide at the end.  That's okay.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Thanks for having me on today and thanks for changing the time to accommodate.  It's nice to be on Twig from Brooklyn this week.  Oh, you're in Brooklyn.  I am.  That's great.  Hence the green room.  The green room is Brooklyn.  The dark green room because it's dark here already.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's nighttime in Brooklyn.  Jeff Jarvis is also a great blogger and a wonderful guy to know and follow on Twitter, but you can find his blog at buzzmachine dot com.  And on Twitter, you are?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis, no space.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis.  Gina is at Gina Trapani.  Yep.  Mary is?

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  Mary Hodder.  At Mary Hodder.  And I'm at Leo Laporte.  We are the most.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We are the most.  We're so boring.  Unoriginal bunch of people.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Predictable.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, it's turning out that that is a good thing.  Poor Merlin Mann is regretting being hot dogs ladies.  No one can find him.  No one knows he exists.  Use your name.  We now learn.  We thank you for joining us.  We'll see you next week for This Week in Google.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Bye.
