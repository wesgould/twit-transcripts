Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google making nice with European publishers and we'll soon talk about Facebook. Be nice with people who have live stations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ah, I hear Matthew Ingram. Great to have you. Formerly of GigaOM and glad that Matthew like many of the other, your colleagues at GigaOM landed at Fortune.  And you're in that group and that's so great. So great. I'm so happy to hear that.  Unfortunately Matthew had all of his stuff stolen in Italy but what the heck? That was the old GigaOM gear. All new Fortune gear.  I needed to upgrade anyway. Yeah. That's nice. Hey what's OM going to be doing? Do you know?  He's invested still. He's doing what he's been doing. Right? Yeah he had kind of left the day to day operations of GigaOM anyway.  Yeah. About a year before. Well if you ever talk to him, we've got to get him on. Let's get him on Jason. That's a great idea.  Love him. I know he's been kind of in mourning a little bit. A little bit. Yeah. Poor guy.  Let us talk about Google, the metaverse, the universe, the Googleverse, the Twitterverse, the Facebookverse. The Faceverse.  The Faceverse. The Faceverse. And anything we want to talk about. This show is a show for foreign buy smart people.  Not so smart in Great Britain. David Cameron, the Prime Minister of Great Britain, just off of his surprising election victory.  People thought it was going to be closer than it was. The Conservatives won a majority and now Cameron is taking advantage of his majority by, I'm curious what you guys think of this, limiting the Queen's speech.  Cameron, a great article by Glenn Greenwald in the Intercept. He calls Cameron's decree Orwellian. Quoting Cameron,  For too long we've been a passively tolerant society, saying to our citizens as, quote,  As long as you obey the law, we'll leave you alone. It's not enough for British citizens merely to obey the law.  They must refrain from believing in or expressing ideas which Her Majesty's government dislikes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, that's, I can't understand how a modern politician in a country like Britain could say those words. I just don't understand what is going through his mind when he says something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the issue is, I mean, I don't think anybody would disagree that if it's terrorist speech, maybe, you know, if it's something, but it's, how do you know? What do you, how do you define that?  Right. That's who defines it. In the UK, they don't have, as we do in the US, a First Amendment.  No. Nor a Section 230. And it's pretty obvious.  Yeah, it really is. The First Amendment says the government shall make no law abridging the right for speech. Now, of course, there is, in the US, even with the First Amendment, there is speech that's prohibited.  But it's pretty clear, you know, you can't shout fire in a crowded theater.  This sounds, this, you literally will not be able to tweet. I don't know what you could say in 140 characters. It would be so damaging to the British democracy.  Facebook postings, tweets, and of course, articles. This bill  will be, is proposed. Does he have to get it approved? I presume so. It's hard to tell. Is it still a democracy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Queen's speech is his agenda to Parliament.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's a whole bunch of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So it'll be an anti-extremist bill to be unveiled in the, I love this, Glenn Greenwald,  to stop those who seek to undermine our British values and instead ensure, quote, we are together as one society, one nation.  Parenthesis says Greenwald. I personally believe this was all more lyrical in its original German.  Well done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you wanted to tweet, you would have to submit to the police in advance.  But who has to do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Extremists.  Oh, I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are you a self-identified extremist?  Well, some say I'm an extremist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you seek to undermine democracy, I mean, you have to kind of read the tea leaf between the lines to even understand what they're talking about.  If you seek to undermine democracy or use hate speech in public places, but you are allowed to provoke hatred.  Super.  It will also include new powers to close premises, including mosques where extremists seek to influence others.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that all in all, hate speech is a dangerous doctrine as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I do too.  We kind of have that though, don't we have limits on what you do?  We do. We do more and more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the classic American example is that we allowed the Nazis to march in Skokie.  And so to protect speech, we protect even noxious speech.  And that's an American belief.  And now on some campuses, it's getting pretty ridiculous.  Well, that speech not only offends me or makes me feel unsafe.  And this is classic works.  Ideas don't hurt people.  Being able to deal with ideals, ideas is exactly what we should be doing in a democracy and an education.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In Canada, we have a sort of half American, half British approach.  Yes, you do.  I mean, so we have hate speech laws and we don't have a sort of any kind of amendment that protects free speech.  But there's a real tension, at least here between wanting to promote free speech,  but still having that kind of British history of some things you just shouldn't say.  So the Harper government, it sounds like, is threatening to charge people with hate speech for promoting boycotts of Israel.  So, you know, you could probably, you know, that would fit just about anything.  I think there would be lots of things that could fall under that broad definition, depending on who you're talking about.  It's kind of shocking.  Who defines it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kind of shocking.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought I'd bring that up.  That just that's just crossed our wires.  Late breaking news.  But there is a whole lot to talk about.  Well, beyond that, and since apparently our last show was more than two hours, two and a half hours long, I think we're going to try to get right to it.  Right to it.  Let's start with Verizon AOL.  That's a big story that broke a couple of days ago.  4.4 billion.  Now, some people say, see, AOL was still worth something.  That's not a whole lot.  No, it's not.  It was more than the New York Times is worth.  But Verizon buys AOL.  It was.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Go ahead, Matthew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  AOL was worth what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know, 300 billion or something.  What was the Time Warner merger?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What was it?  Were they valued?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Plus, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Time Warner AOL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where'd all that go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, actually, that was the opposite direction because AOL bought Time Warner, although for 164 billion dollars.  Yes.  But Time Warner is not still part of AOL, right?  No.  Although that is legendary.  That 2001 merger is the biggest mistake in corporate history.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I should have saved all the tweets to a collection.  The wags of Twitter were in the finest form for this one.  For the AOL Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it was beautiful.  Well, it raises a couple of issues.  And Gadget is part of AOL.  Will they be, now that they're a house organ of the Verizon company, will they get as much freedom as they've had?  If they don't like the phone, can they say it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look at the history of Verizon.  It's not good.  They tried to start a tech site that would say nothing controversial, and they killed it.  Sugar string.  Yeah, thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What was it called?  Sugar string.  And then...  The late, limited sugar string?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They also can't name things well.  It's the worst name ever.  I thought when the company started, when they changed the name of the telephone company, I thought it was a French name.  Verizon.  Because it used to be 9X, which is a good name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The New York, New England telephone exchange or something like that.  So sugar string, they said that you shouldn't write about net neutrality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so someone reported that and they eventually shut it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Verizon says, as you know, we've always said this was a pilot project.  We never said we were serious about sugar string.  So, okay, so they said, well, I guess we can't do it ourselves, but maybe we should buy somebody that can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the sort of short end on this deal, correct me if I'm wrong, Jeff, is that what Verizon really wanted was the ad tech that AOL has developed.  Yeah, the first story said they wanted the content, they wanted the video, and I didn't believe that at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's both ad tech and ad sales.  And Tim Armstrong, don't forget, built the American sales operation for Google.  Tim knows how to do this extremely well.  And he bought ad tech companies.  Tim Armstrong was CEO at AOL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  CEO of AOL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's bought a bunch of companies specializing in ad tech, particularly mobile ad tech and particularly video.  And it feels like that's what Verizon wants.  And the content is just comes along for the ride.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there's speculation and let's make clear it's speculation that others will buy.  Axel Springer has been mentioned a lot.  The German publisher would buy the content businesses of AOL.  Though one wonders why anyone would want them except for Huffington Post.  What's the distinction between mobile and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, so mobile ad network, I understand, is not content, but isn't video content?  But OK, but hold on, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What video does AOL really have?  So go to AOL, go to the video page and tell me what you lust after there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's not AOL.  It's the brands and gadget.  TechCrunch has a video operation.  Yeah, that's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But is that worth $4 billion?  No, it's...  And you can license that stuff.  No, I don't think they wanted the content at all.  HuffPo...  HuffPo, that's another AOL property.  Yes, but the reports have been that they wanted to break off for the last year or so  and that they may break off now.  There's been rumors and denials and so on and so forth.  But I think that if they could find anyone to invest in a management buyout or to buy them, they would.  Here's AOL's video page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's see what we can see.  Yeah, just take a look.  Watch live, Brittany Snow, Skylar Aston, and Kay Cannon on Pitch Perfect 2.  That's obviously an ad.  Arnold Schwarzenegger on how California would survive a zombie attack.  Build is some event, something that they do, right?  Yeah, who does Build?  Well, I don't know because there's Microsoft Build.  That's obviously not what this is.  I don't think...  Here's what everyone's watching.  A week old story about Sarnov convicted, week old.  Maybe that's three weeks old in the Boston Marathon bombing.  Breckenridge off the grid couple appears in court on criminal charges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you go to on.aol.com, that's another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  On.aol.com, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it looks like it's Amtrak video, Sarnov video.  It's probably much of it from the AP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, this looks like news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think Verizon cares about that.  No.  What you're saying, they don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They don't want this is what they're saying.  They care about that.  They'll sell this off.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, Verizon on the Fios end does have some content for, and I'm a Fios customer,  for its effort to do a news channel on channel one to compete with Cablevision's News 12 in my market.  So that matters somewhat to them and the East Coast, but that's minor.  Yes, video matters online, but this is not the video you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But Verizon has a deal with the NFL.  For instance, if you have a Verizon phone, you get exclusive mobile access to NFL games.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and the other thing that's happening is Vice.  But none of that's content.  That's not right.  Exactly.  Vice is making big deals all around the world licensing content and licensing a window to telcos.  So I could see Vice doing a deal, but this AOL video?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I don't see how Engadget or Hoffpo have things that are sort of proprietary enough,  like the NFL, that they could license it or have an exclusive deal with Verizon that would be worth that much money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's some AOL exclusives.  Adam Sandler, Million Dollar Noises, Season One Episode One.  So this is like a show.  Laugh Lessons of Kevin Nealon.  It has ads on it, by the way.  Oops, somehow I got out of this one.  I have never heard of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, of course, these are the two sites.  No one I know has ever quoted AOL or Yahoo.  And yet they supposedly have huge traffic and fire hoses and yada, yada, yada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you know what? I'm starting to believe now.  I just kind of thought, oh, content.  Well, they've got TechCrunch, they've got Engadget, they've got Hoffpo.  But Verizon doesn't want any of that.  No, I think those will all be gone.  They'll be spun off or sold.  Well, and if you're in Engadget and you're limited on what you can review,  you can't say a bad thing about Verizon or Verizon phones, that kind of eliminates the fun of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there was a piece, it was on the rundown, where Engadget said they didn't buy us for editorial.  They're not buying editorial. They're not buying our soul and our voice.  We will still be independent.  Oh, they always say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what CNET said until CBS said you can't give Hopper the best of CES award because they let you skip commercials.  They always say that.  That's what the Wall Street Journal said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tim Armstrong said the editorial is going to remain, no one will have anything to say about it.  And this is a content deal. I just think a lot of that is just gas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think what we all want to know is, frankly, what did Shingy have to say?  And Shingy says it's pretty cool.  It's pretty cool, man.  Made his hair stand on end.  Pretty cool, man.  Pretty cool, man.  That's what a digital prophet would probably say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would just love, I would pay money to be in the meeting, the Verizon executive.  At Verizon, yeah.  Where Shingy shows up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You figure Shingy is probably going to be available soon.  Maybe.  Shingy, for those who don't know, is this guy, David Shing.  They call him Shingy.  He's got quite a style going on, and he's AOL's digital prophet.  It's not really clear what he does.  No, it's not.  He redesigned Tim Armstrong's office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But he did redesign Tim Armstrong's office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yep, yep, yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As an AOL shareholder, I've always wanted to know how much money goes into Shingy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, and someone wondered whether Mike Harrington would be interested in taking TechCrunch back.  And he used an F-word, I believe, in a response.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, he's got his money, and he's living in the Pacific Northwest, and he's very, very happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If he said he wanted it back, I would send him for psychological assessment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  TechCrunch has conferences.  Verizon's not going to want that.  No.  You know, Sarah Lane, who worked here, left to go do tech video for TechCrunch.  And they do have...  She's doing a daily news show for them.  There she is.  So, I mean, I could see maybe there'd be some...  Yeah, I could see there for business stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Tim Armstrong said, I'm not selling TechCrunch, but it's not going to be up to him in the long run.  I think there's going to be a market for TechCrunch.  I think, you know, Wall Street Journal, Fortune, maybe.  Not Forbes.  Bloomberg, Quarters.  Yeah.  What did you say, Matthew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you buying TechCrunch or Engadget or both?  Yeah.  Engadget's valuable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe even HuffPo.  So HuffPo, you said, has been trying to get out of the AOL deal anyway, right?  They also do...  Well, that's the reports. That's the rumors.  They also do video.  They do a live...  They do something like Twitter, didn't they?  Or they were going to do HuffPost Live.  Right now on HuffPost Live, let's just see what's on.  Cocktail Shatter with Josh Zepes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that Scotland...  There's no reason... Everyone says, oh, it would be a disaster.  Scotland's way too small. How could they possibly survive as a country?  That's old news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They did a lot of sort of hangout shows, Google hangout shows, where they would get host...  It's kind of like Twitter, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It tries to be more TV.  There's a real cameraman there and there's teleprompters and...  There's books on the bookshelf.  ...bookers and eight-minute segments.  I've been on it and it's very, very pleasant, very nice.  But yeah, it tries to be... It's more like old TV than it is like Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Just the address.  Huffington Post gets a ton of traffic.  I mean, I think it's... Uniques are in the hundreds of millions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, yeah, but that's not to the video. That's to the stories, right?  And that's because it's kind of like Upworthy.  I mean, it's all link-bait and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think it's... They're hiring more real journalists.  The other thing that's very impressive about Huffington Post...  As I always say, they laughed when Ariana sat down at the keyboard.  But she proved the world wrong.  And now the emphasis... And Jimmy Maven, the CEO...  The emphasis is on making this a worldwide brand.  And at the DLD conference, Huffpo was there because they have a deal with Berda, runs the conference.  And Ariana had her... I don't know how many it was. 21 world editors up there.  And they have Huffpost Canada, Huffpost Spain, Huffpost France, Huffpost Germany.  They've really done a pretty amazing job of creating native language sites around the world and making Huffpost into a global brand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But if you wanted this, wouldn't you buy Vice? Wouldn't that be a better... They've got to be better content.  If you wanted this video, yes, you'd buy Vice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if you wanted a hell of a lot of traffic and content...  The other speculation, raw speculation, I don't think it came from anything.  But just say, would it be interesting if somebody said Facebook, given everything going on with Facebook?  And I don't believe that for a second. I think Facebook and Google cannot own content.  It's channel conflict and it's antitrust bait. They just simply can't.  But I could imagine... So who would buy... Well, this is the interesting part.  A lot of the story after this is what of Marissa now?  Marissa was going to... Armstrong and Meyer were going to merge the two companies, said many rumors over the years.  Who knew who would be on top?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think Tim wanted that more than Marissa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think so too. But Marissa could take these content properties off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't they feel like they're in the same business a little bit?  Oh, yeah.  Like Yahoo and AOL seem like they're exactly the same.  The same old business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Same sides, two sides of the same coin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you can imagine HuffPo being a Yahoo.  Absolutely. So maybe that's what will happen is the content goes to somebody else like Yahoo.  And then the ad network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can also see... The actual Springer rumor comes from...  There are companies elsewhere such as in Germany who would like to enter the US who believe strongly they can't do it on their own.  And they could end up buying something as an entry into the US market.  And HuffPost would not be a bad entry vehicle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As a AOL shareholder, are you happy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess so. I've never been happy because I got... The way this works is like...  It's always been bad.  It's always been bad.  When I was at People magazine, I was given a grant of restricted shares.  And this just shows you don't ever listen to me about stocks.  And so the shares just are given to you one day.  Well, that day when you pay taxes on them based on the value you get then.  I got them at the extreme highest price that's ever been in history in the midst of the Time Warner AOL takeover fight.  Nice.  I'm sorry, Time Warner.  They're holding on until they come back.  Paramount takeover fight.  I still believe that. Oh, it'll get up to $120 again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're going to come back.  Any day now.  Just wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so the whole thing's been unraveled since then.  So yeah, I have AOL, I have Time Inc, I have Time Warner Cable, which now is nowhere with that.  Just because of that, leftovers. I haven't touched it because it's too painful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Folks, don't get stock tips from Jeff Jarvis.  Never.  Never.  Of course, Verizon denies that this is just an ad deal.  They say, no, we're going to spin off, maybe we're going to spin off HuffPost, but we're staying in the content business.  Have they said that out loud?  Tim Armstrong says he's staying in the content business and he's not selling TechCrunch.  But Verizon didn't.  Oh, wait a minute. That's Tim Armstrong. He doesn't get a say in this, does he?  For a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For six months he doesn't.  Verizon said it was all about ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Verizon said it was all about ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they didn't say that in so many words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The principal interest, says Verizon's John Stratton, is around the ad platform.  Very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's interesting here is, so an ad platform, Verizon and other telco, the NFL deal you mentioned,  phone companies think enclosed, fenced in universes, right?  Verizon, you know, Verizon, mobile ads on its own stock, well, this is where the content thing does come in.  Serve ads on what? Where and how? Does it become an ad serving mechanism?  You serve ads on content or on services. Verizon doesn't really have any services, doesn't have any content.  Fine, it could have HuffPost. Big deal.  How much mobile traffic on Verizon phones is there on HuffPost?  And HuffPost's business, it's in their interest to be in the content business.  Verizon and HuffPost, and HuffPost's business, it's in their interest to be on every other platform there is too.  So yeah, I too accepted this idea, in fact said this, that I think it's about ads and ad technology,  and I believe that in mobile, but it's hard for me to understand Verizon's role in the ecosystem,  because Verizon never sees itself as a member of an ecosystem.  Verizon always sees itself as its own tower.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and of course, Verizon's in what used to be a monopoly in a very strong business  that's starting to become less so with Google getting into the wireless business.  And fiber business.  And fiber business. Verizon isn't the must-win that it used to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The funniest part to me is that Verizon can finally maybe serve all those dial-up customers left at AOL.  Are there dial-up customers who still live there?  Lots. That's where their cash-free classroom comes from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A couple million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there a number chat room? Is there a number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm looking. That would be a good number for the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  2.1 million. I don't know what this is. Creamy. Creamy Corden Cobb.  Well, that's an authoritative source if I've ever heard one.  Sorry, Creamy. It says 2.1 million. What's your source, Creamy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's one from, this is from Time Magazine yesterday.  2.2 million dial-up subscribers.  The company's adjusted operating income from the dial-up unit that includes dial-up is down 8% year-over-year for the first quarter.  But $126 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That just blows the mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  2.2, because it's 20 bucks a month.  So that means that there are a lot of people who either can't or don't want to pay for higher-speed internet.  Some of those, according to Time, AOL dial-up customers actually aren't paying for the service.  They're getting their connection for free after threatening to cancel their subscription.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Scott Klein had the best line.  He said, Verizon, another old guy who buys AOL because he wants to connect to the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I heard there were free disks.  Yeah, the Wall Street Journal's immediate reaction was two crumbling empires merging.  Although I no longer trust the Wall Street Journal's immediate reaction because you have to wonder, well, what's Rupert's interest in all this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I actually read a piece, I can't remember who it was now, but their argument was basically looking at Verizon.  This says a lot more about Verizon than it actually does about AOL.  It says Verizon is kind of desperate.  You know, this feels like a desperation move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But when I asked a minute ago, Matthew, how do they use ad technology?  Desperation to what end?  I'm not sure.  Verizon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not like they can offer it to game developers or something.  I don't think that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But then again, I go back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They better not put ads on my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who changed...  A guy named...  Oh, no, I'm sorry, I forgot his name.  Astra.  What's his name?  Shoot.  I mean, what's his name?  Wonderful man who was in charge of the AT&T online service.  He's the guy who turbocharged the growth of the net when he took the clock off.  And it went to $19.95 a month flat rate.  That's what did it.  Flat rate.  Flat rate.  That was to be crucial moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is from Fortune.  Good publication, I hear.  Yeah.  Aaron Griffith.  Last year, the company being AOL, almost a billion dollars from display and search ads on the media properties it owned.  It earned almost as much, $856 million, selling ads for third-party sites.  That's AOL's fastest growing segment.  It grew 39% between 2013 and 2014.  Revenue from in-house media operations during the same period.  Display ads fell 3%.  Search ads grew just 4%.  So AOL is one of those companies that hasn't licked mobile in that respect.  This would help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does this mean everybody's enemy is Google?  Verizon's enemy is Google?  Is this Verizon saying, yeah, we know this phone business is not going to be so good, let's get into a new business?  Yeah.  No, I wonder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's interesting, isn't it?  I can't imagine Verizon saying that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or can you?  If you do honest forecasting and you're in their business, it doesn't look pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, even Google is diversifying, right?  Everybody should be thinking about the future.  Yeah, I mean, part of the threat is this move towards Wi-Fi everywhere.  You know, Verizon's going to face threats from Comcast, Xfinity, which is essentially positioning itself to be a carrier by putting Wi-Fi everywhere.  Google Fi, I don't know how big a threat that is because it's based on carriers.  Mainly a threat to pricing models.  Right. And even then, it's about the same, isn't it?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just a little less imprisonment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Does Verizon want tech news?  Why would they want tech news?  Why would they want video for that, Matt?  It just ties up their network.  I just don't think they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just don't think they do.  And if you look at the entire, AOL doesn't break out, HuffPo or any of those assets, but the media unit in their statements, I think last quarter, that entire unit had operating income of 13 million.  So that's Huffington Post, TechCrunch, Engadget, all those other sites.  13 million.  Jesus, Matthew, I haven't seen that number.  Wow.  It's tiny. It's pennies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What did Giga Home have?  Geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got to figure this is actually, I don't see why this is a good deal for Verizon in any respect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the ad targeting tech is worth something, whether it's worth 4 billion or not.  I don't know.  But I think it is worth something.  What do they do?  How do they use that?  Well, they've got it.  So my understanding is, and this is not my area, but my understanding is that AOL is good at figuring out how to deliver and when to deliver and to whom to deliver video ads.  So that's something that presumably would be worthwhile to Verizon.  It knows a lot about you as a phone user.  It's got your user ID, your device ID.  You know, presumably it's got your location.  So it has information with which it can target ads or videos.  That's my understanding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I interviewed Tim Armstrong with Marissa Meyer at CUNY some years ago.  And Tim's strategy at the time was to say that all the ad money goes to the top sites, media sites.  That's the way the ad business works and still does.  And I'm going to make AOL into one of those.  And that's why I'll have a lot of content.  So I'll have a lot of volume.  And the ad business, Lord knows, is still volume based.  My rallying cry these days is we've got to shift volume based advertising will commodified towards zero.  And we have to shift to value based models, starting with attention, but also other other value based models.  And pure volume is just going to be pure cats.  And it's not you don't make it up on volume.  It's not a good business.  But that's where AOL was headed.  He got more content.  Meanwhile, he's really good at selling ads, really good at that structure and brought as much advertising as he could to it.  But so then he went more into the pure ad business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, if you're going to go into ads, don't do online video ads because Google says only about half of them are ever seen at all.  Get them. These are the worst statistics ever.  Viewability. Viewability.  So that means gigantic issue in media right now.  An ad is only viewable if half or more of its pixels are visible on the screen for at least two seconds.  So what it's saying is that of all the video ads being served, half only half are never not even seen for two seconds.  Seventy six percent were in a background tab and were never on screen at all.  Twenty four percent were scrolled off screen or abandoned in fewer than two seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, what proportion is is just autoplay video ads where you've got a tab open and it just suddenly loads the ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we're we're ripping off advertisers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  An ad plays on a web page and no one sees it. Does it exist?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yours are seen and heard because they're interstitial.  They're interstitial. They're native.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Careful with that word native.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree, but they are they are the good kind. They are they are true to the form.  It's been absolutely corrupted and it's corrupting.  And, you know, I don't like it very much.  But radio advertising, which is basically what you have, has always worked for that reason.  It fits into the form.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, by the way, consider the source. This comes from Google.  And you should know that they didn't look at YouTube ads because YouTube is a video destination site.  So 91 percent of those ads are viewed.  So what they're really saying is if you want to do video ads, put them on our YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, does anybody not click skip this ad?  I always skip it. Yeah, sometimes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I will. I will occasionally get one that either is a compelling enough or be relevant enough.  Right. That I will end up watching it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The onus really is on the on the buyer at buyer.  Because if you make an ad that's competitive, you have four seconds.  If you can make an ad that's good, by the way, I guess that's where the four seconds come from.  That makes it viewed.  If you make an ad compelling enough that you don't hit skip ad, that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's it's both Leo. It's also on the server because it's relevance.  Right. You know, you show me an ad for a new test.  That's true. I'll watch it. Right.  Something I want to buy it because I'm too poor, but I'll watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. I've never watched a video ad except by accident.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow. And, you know, the truth is, come on, haven't you watched a Google ad?  Google ads are compelling.  You've been in that you you've seen the.  Come on.  Oh, grumpy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Come on.  But isn't that why Facebook Auto plays the video now?  And you want. Yes, they want you to see them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, also, but also for Facebook, it's fascinating to me how much more video I watch because, oh, what the heck?  It's already playing. Oh, that's interesting.  And and the auto play, which is so irritating when you go to say for a different reason.  Right. The silent auto play in Facebook.  I find to be a very good experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are those ever ads? Aren't they always content from?  Do they do video ads yet on Facebook? Not yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know that they'll ever do them. But that's what's coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think they don't. I don't think they auto play.  OK. I mean, I don't mind an auto play video if it's a cute.  Right. It's an ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ah, there we go. There we go.  Cup up the ads. You can sell puppies to Matthew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's kind of cool. I just went to my Facebook.  I justine is hosting. Price is right.  Price is right is doing a socially awesome week with social media gurus.  And I justine is hosting this week or today or something.  I just thought I'd pass that along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think there's a huge, you know, whether it's auto play or videos that like the skip ads or people  ads playing in tabs, this is a vast, vast amount of wasted money.  Like the old saying used to be, you know, 50 percent of my ad spend is wasted.  I just don't know which 50. It's probably 90 percent.  It's 90 percent, particularly with video.  Nobody knows who the hell is actually watching them.  I would bet 80 to 90 percent goes on one.  Shillings of dog. Not yours, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's that's that's Leo leaking money right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Everybody in media knows that ads that the measurement systems, all of this stuff is just made up.  And, you know, Neal's relative BS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so you buy the advertisers know that too.  And they buy on relative BS. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, paper ads were BS, too. Right.  Oh, everybody reads the whole newspaper.  But everybody reads every page of every newspaper. Of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. That those display ads may never get seen.  But I guess people read every newspaper.  If it didn't work for people, they wouldn't do it, though. Right.  Or is it just they do it completely unfaith.  Coca-Cola has no idea what would happen if it bought no ads versus buying a lot of ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think they basically have a hunch.  So you run an ad, more people buy Coke. Right.  So it must have worked. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One of the reasons that almost all podcast advertisers are direct response advertisers, because they can measure it.  They they know what we bought ads.  You know, Casper knows we bought ads on Twig.  And they don't pay us for sales.  They just pay us for the impressions. Right.  But they know where the other they're accounting for the value of it.  They say, well, it cost us whatever, ten thousand dollars in ads.  And we got twenty thousand dollars worth of mattress sales.  They're happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they can track a code, you know, that someone uses to come from your site.  Like those things are measurable.  It's the stuff that it's brand advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's one of the reasons podcasts don't get brand advertising, because they don't have the it's all done in faith.  Right. I mean, brand advertising is done on faith, whether it's NBC or Twitter.  But they have more faith that NBC that that tied ad on NBC is working than they do that the tied ad on.  But you got it from Ford. That was brand advertising.  I think our biggest problem really is it's correct me if I'm wrong, because I just made this up.  But agencies that do the ad buying make money based on the amount of dollars spent.  We're too cheap. Right.  It's not it's too much trouble to buy an ad on a podcast or a podcast network because it's such a small buy.  They don't make enough money. They're exactly so stupid.  It's going to go, oh, I'm going to I want to make a million dollar buys because I'll make more money. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's no one is just cheaper to make the buy and add agencies are lazy.  And it's absolutely stupid. The most ad dollars go to the top three or four sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Efficiency is not the measure they use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there's a corollary to the you know, no one ever got fired for buying IBM.  No one ever got fired for putting an ad in The New York Times or buying an ad on some CNN.com. Right.  So everyone does that, regardless of whether it actually works or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's why in some ways we're the secret sauce for the companies that do their Atlantic.  I just had an article that's saying why Squarespace is on every podcast you ever heard.  And we love Squarespace. And I think I'm pretty sure we were the first podcast they ever bought.  And it was a huge success. And that's why Squarespace said these work.  So the companies that discover that this more efficient form works are kind of have a secret ace in the hole.  The problem is it's not it's never going to be gray or one of the big media buyers that discovered us.  Right. It's going to be either an individual advertiser.  Some of our advertisers do their own buys or a small network in many cases devoted to new media advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How many RFPs do you deal with?  Lots. Most of them.  Just to explain to the audience that when an agency puts out for a call for proposal and says this is what we want.  Hey, come sell yourself to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A lot of them come from direct not agencies but directs.  But we are but they're so we will we deal with a number of their like ages.  Some of them are agencies. Some of their ad brokers or ad buyers.  But we deal with them a lot. We turn down more than half out of the box.  In fact, it really annoys people when we say no.  They go, well, I'm not good enough for you. No, they get insulted.  Why do you usually say no?  Because it's not a good fit for our network or I don't want I don't think we should be promoting a product or you know, we we part of the value of our advertising is that we we we you know, it's not just random stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. And that's why it works. That's why it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's unheard of and advertisers don't get it.  It's unheard of for any media company to turn down money. Turn down.  Yeah, it's unheard of. When we say no, we don't we don't want your money.  It's like, but but what's wrong with me?  But it's money. It's money.  But see, it would quickly devolve if I started taking ads for any old damn thing.  It would quickly you would you you audience members are no longer.  It would just be it would be background noise again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like most of the whole value of the ad is you saying, yeah, I have used this and our selectivity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I liked it and it worked. Yeah. And our knowledge of who our audience is and what they might be interested in and so forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I saw the heads of Casper and Harry's at the DLD Congress of both of them advertise on Twitter.  And you know, it's it's they're like oddly in the family celebrities.  Yeah. You know, there's a relationship there.  It does matter. It does work. Your voice reading these matters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We that's the thing that's sometimes frustrating is that we do always hear from every one of our advertisers that we work much, you know,  orders of magnitude better than any other ads they buy.  But it doesn't mean they Ford is a good example.  Doesn't mean that we keep the buy.  We worked really well for Ford. They did.  Now, of course, Ford, because their brand didn't have direct sales numbers, but they did research and we came out.  I've never I mean, I saw the research. I've never seen anything like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they get tired. They get tired.  The shiny thing, you know, just such a small body.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's such as and Ford does its own in-house average.  They have their own in-house agency, so they do the buy.  It's still such a small bias is too much work.  It's like, and they would spend more than a million dollars a year on Twitter.  But it's like that's nothing because they spend five hundred million dollars a year on network ads.  It's just nothing. So it's not it's just not worth the energy.  It's very interesting. I find it fascinating.  I don't I'm sorry. This is all about me.  Not enough about me enough about you.  Let's talk about our new newsstand.  Jeff Jarvis says I for one welcome our new newsstand.  Meanwhile, Matthew Ingram says is Facebook a partner or a competitor for media companies?  Yes, we're talking about this new Facebook program.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even though I slathered about it, I can't even forget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's called instant articles.  The big some big publishers already in partnership.  New York Times, The Guardian, BuzzFeed, National Geographic.  What happens? What is it?  By the way, it's only on the Facebook mobile app.  Right. And only on iOS.  OK, well, I got it right here. Let me see.  What does it look like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just a really well formatted article.  So Facebook works its magic on the article.  And it's in the news feed.  It's in the feed and you can read the whole thing in your feed.  Videos play automatically.  It loads faster.  And you don't have to click to go open.  And I was just looking at my desktop and this so far looks the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly. There's Gina Tripani's link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's only a few of them.  So the New York Times only put one on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, and I can't guarantee I'd see it. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. But if you go to Facebook.com slash.  Instant, I think there's there's a list of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you can't just look in the Facebook app and expect to see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you follow the New York Times, you'll see it.  If you follow the New York Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the New York Times is the first one on the other eight publishers.  It's around the world.  So it includes the Guardian BBC built in Germany, which is owned by Asher Springer,  which was the leader of the war against Google.  Buzzfeed had it today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So let me like let me like the New York Times.  I've liked them.  And this is one of them, right?  Marriage in India. Is that one of them?  No, I would guess.  All right. So maybe if I go back to my home feed now that I like them, will I see it?  Here's Trey Radcliffe.  By the way, Trey had the same thing happen to him that happened to you, Matthew.  His bag was stolen from under a train seat.  No kidding. It's lots of expensive cameras.  He had his entire collection of cameras and like the lenses in there.  Oh, yeah. It was a big loss for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I just had an old laptop and old iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. So I don't see anything yet.  But so now so like the New York Times, like the Guardian, like Buzzfeed, like National Geographic.  And maybe you go to instantarticles.fp.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK. On the web.  No, that's there. Yeah. Well, maybe maybe there.  That's that maybe it'll have a link to something to get a demo of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK. So tell me what you expect.  It's a new way for publishers to look at fast interactive articles.  Well, the thing is, you're not going to click off. That's what's different.  Right. Right.  Quest for a super B interactive and immersive is there are there ads in their autoplay video comes alive as you scroll through the article.  So this is that autoplay stuff that we've using existing production tools and standard markup.  You can publish any type of article. That's good. It makes it easy for the publisher. Right.  And does you pay Facebook for this or what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, there's a rev share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's more than a share. If you sell the ads yourself, you keep 100 percent of the 100 percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If Facebook sells the ad 70 percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And what that means is on an article per article basis, you're even in Facebook sell.  If you choose to Facebook ads, probably because they had a higher value ad.  So you're probably up. You're going to get new distribution of incremental distribution for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you may be up. So really, what you're saying, Jeff, is this is a new medium for publishers to take advantage of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm saying that we have no choice but to deal with this.  We have to go to where the users are.  The idea that we vertically control every piece of a media chain is over and we have to do this.  And we see, I think, a golden opportunity right now between Google and Facebook,  where Google, as we discussed last week, is trying to make nice and signed friendship packs with eight publishers.  I think Facebook probably went to nine just to say, Nanny, I Google.  And but the the Google pact is all kind of we'll develop stuff and we'll give you a bribery fund for innovation  and we'll do some training and some fellowships and that kind of stuff.  Facebook leapfrogs them because it comes out and says, well, actually, we're going to affect your business.  We're going to improve the experience for the users so the users will end up seeing more stories because they don't click off on the stories because it's an awful experience and it takes forever.  Right. When you publish here, you will get new audience.  They will see it in situ. You get your brand.  You get your brand. You get your com score bragging rights and you keep 100 percent of the revenue.  What's not to love? Well, here's the part I don't love.  It doesn't hand over data that enables relationships.  You know, my spiel these days is we've got to have relationships.  We've got to give people greater relevance by knowing them as individuals.  Facebook will still know our users as individuals and we still won't.  Now, I've talked to people across many technology companies who said, well, OK, Jarvis, but if we gave that data or if publishers don't want to use it,  if publishers had that data, they wouldn't know what to do with it.  True. Stipulated, Your Honor. We're idiots about that.  But Facebook and Google could school us in that and help us improve our service and our relevance and our value, which in turn would improve the content we put on these services.  And it's a win for both. So this is an important first step in my view.  Now, the naysayers like Matthew Ingram will tell you in a minute that Facebook is the spider in the fly and come into my web here.  And when you're when you're addicted, I'll pull the rug off underneath you.  And yeah, that could happen. We need a lot more discussions about trust, about about the nature of the deal and especially about Facebook's role now as not just a distributor,  but to some degree a gatekeeper and even an editor of the news that people see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But what is the negative? What is the negative, Matthew?  I mean, it seems to me, I mean, I see the benefit as a publisher.  So, yeah, Jeff says you don't get any information about your viewer.  Big deal. You don't know that much about who buys your newspaper at the newsstand either.  And I get I get eyeballs. I get people sharing my content.  I get some excitement around my content. It's done in a form that's easy for me to do.  So what is the best? And it doesn't cost me anything, right?  I don't have to I don't have to pay Facebook for the privilege.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there's two. So there's two aspects.  And when it comes to the negative aspects of Facebook controlling the news, whose feed and when the news feed, this is not a theoretical thing.  We have examples of when this has occurred.  Zynga is one example hitched its wagon to Facebook, got destroyed effectively because they changed the algorithm.  That's billions of dollars. Not only that, we have an example from the media industry.  The Guardian, the Washington Post created social reading apps that Facebook promoted them so that people could read their articles.  OK, hold on, Matthew. Just wait. Just wait. I'll come back.  I'll come back to that one. All right. We'll put that on the checklist. OK.  Facebook promoted those heavily, right? And it was great.  They got lots of readers. They got lots of people subscribing and downloading these apps or sharing them or whatever.  And then Facebook changed the news feed algorithm.  Those things were hidden more and those readers disappeared.  So and Facebook said, you know, sorry, we changed the algorithm, you know, for other reasons.  That's so the risk. This is what I said in the thing I wrote for Fortune about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not that Facebook. Oh, this is an evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, crap. It's my tricks. I could say what I want to say.  It's that they're going to do it accidentally.  They're going to make decisions that benefit Facebook.  And those decisions are going to impact these publishers who are getting 70, 80 percent of their traffic from Facebook.  And what's one should not rely on Facebook, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But if you're the New York Times, that was Matthew's point on Twitter the other day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I'm not sure that you can really move those dials as easily as you want.  And if suddenly you get a flood of Facebook traffic, what are you going to say? No.  Yes, you need to diversify. Facebook is diversification.  It's diversification from the old model of making people come to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is why it is the actually the spider and the flies.  Not the best analogy, but this is why it's like the scorpion and the frog frog has to get across the river.  Right. Picky, picky, picky, Matthew. Carry the scorpion scorpion stings the frog. Why?  Well, it's in my nature. Facebook is going to do what benefits Facebook.  Of course. Well, now let me answer your point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now let me answer that point you just made about the earlier Guardian Washington Post thing.  And I had similar concerns and I talked to people on Facebook about this.  And their point was that it was a really awful consumer experience.  And I remember that there were two problems with that with that app at the time.  Number one, if you read or if you were a Washington Post user and you read articles without you knowing or asking what you read was shared across your friends.  Stupid. Wrong by Facebook. But that was one.  So people were irritated by that.  Second thing they were irritated by was they were getting spammed by these publications.  There was too much stuff in the feed papers, pretty too much.  And Facebook had too little control over it.  It was a bad user experience.  And I think we all agree about that. It was right.  It was good for publishers.  So it wasn't just one day.  Facebook just said, oh, we don't like this.  Now we'll turn this down.  They said, you know what?  We tried this as Facebook often does and said this didn't work.  But then over time they came back.  They have an experience that I think if I can only see it on my phone in theory, it's a great experience.  It's a great experience.  And that is not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's that's actually part of my point.  So Facebook is going to make decisions based on what it wants for its users.  And some of those decisions may benefit the New York Times.  Nothing is wrong with that.  Some of those decisions may benefit the New York Times.  And some won't.  Some won't.  Here's the risk.  What if Facebook decides it doesn't want to show you news articles about Syria because it's depressing?  Right.  That it won't show you news articles about Syria.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a different question.  But that happens all the time, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It happens all the time.  Plus, yeah.  Well, all right.  But here's the problem.  Facebook has not shown that it cares at all about journalism.  The New York Times presumably cares about journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who said they must?  No, but here's the risk.  If you as a major media enterprise start doing this and you build Facebook, you're just giving Facebook more and more power.  Exactly.  You're in effect undermining your future because you're moving everybody to this Facebook platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but Leo, you're presuming.  Leo, you're a bloody fool to put your stuff on YouTube then.  Then don't do it.  I am.  I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you have to, right?  Well, we put it there.  It's a very small part of our revenue because the way YouTube works doesn't really impact us.  It never would even if YouTube became the dominant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I think there is a very real risk here that Facebook becomes, is already in fact, the source of news for large quantities of people.  So let's talk about that in two ways.  Facebook becomes the place where people get their news.  They stop paying attention to who it comes from.  Right.  How does that benefit news brands that have hitched their wag into Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Matthew, you're also presuming that people are going to still say, I want to come to the news brand.  That idea of having a website and making people come to you, we know from Facebook traffic, is zilch.  How do people discover our stuff?  Because they're recommended.  Where is it recommended?  From Facebook.  We are already there.  Whether you see it on Facebook or see it on our site, it's coming from Facebook, not because it's coming from Facebook, because it comes from people.  Now, the points you raised that I absolutely agree with, I'm going to agree with you now.  I agree with you now.  So give me a chance.  Please do.  The point where I'm going to agree with you, and this was an issue in Perugia, and I discussed this on the show afterwards.  Andy Mitchell from Facebook gave a talk and got asked by George Brock of City University in New York.  I'm sorry, the other city university, the one in London, the second one.  George said to him, you've got to acknowledge your responsibility for exactly what Matthew's talking about, that you're a gatekeeper now to news.  You've got to deal with that.  And Facebook gave the Facebook corporate answer, which is, well, we don't really control what you see.  It's user choice.  The users, it's what the users see.  Now, there is some truth to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's what they tried to argue with that study that came out.  They came out with the filter bubble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me finish agreeing with you.  Please continue agreeing with me.  There's some truth to that in the sense of when Eli Pariser and the filter bubble complained, the truth was Facebook said, we don't show you any conservatives, Eli, because you never look at them.  And so he bears a responsibility.  If I never look at Syria stories, Facebook is not wrong to presume I don't want Syria.  I'm not a Facebook is not a newspaper.  It is a they say straight out our first goal is connect friends and family.  And the news came along for the ride.  No one should depend upon Facebook solely for their news.  And I think we have to look at it a different way, Matthew.  I think we have to look at it and say that this is bonus for us.  The question is, once this is why I push for the data, if I could make myself more relevant to you more often and get more engaging.  And if I could get you to then, yes, come to my site and have a relationship with me or subscribe to my newsletter or do whatever, then I have benefit.  But I think that where we'd also agree is you can't just ignore this in the German magazine Focus.  I'll finish one second.  The writers said that this was, you use the word to a Faustian deal.  And the problem with that is that acts as if Facebook or Google is just going to corrupt us.  The focus writer was talking about the Google deal.  You were talking about Facebook deal.  Well, it's not the people who were there were reaching don't corrupt us.  We don't have much choice, but to figure out good ways to deal with this new business model.  And so to me, the art of this is negotiation.  What are the good business terms, not the emotional?  I don't like this terms.  So now I've shut up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I totally agree that.  That news organizations should use whatever means they can to reach readers, and that includes Facebook and it includes Snapchat and includes Instagram.  I would like to see a bit more of that kind of thing than than tying your business model to Facebook, because all the terms that matter are Facebook's to control all of them.  When people see your content, how people see your content, who's your negotiate, how much they charge for the ads, how much percentage they give you.  Sure, they'll give you 70 percent.  Now, what about a year from now?  What about two years?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  These are this I went to the same discussion with my students in class where they said, I don't like Facebook.  I don't deal with Facebook.  I said, you can't get away.  Yeah, you can end up walking away from the negotiation table.  But the right way to have this discussion is what terms do you want?  What does Facebook have that you want?  What do you have that they want?  What would be mutually beneficial?  And forget the fear factor.  Build that into the business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sometimes scorpions and frogs have to take boats together.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, Matthew, you know, newspapers have to get across the river.  Well, don't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Aren't they struggling?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Aren't traditional media outlets struggling?  Especially to reach the younger audience that the new media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it feels to me like lots of publications, and I'm not naming anyone here, are fixing the entire.  They're hoping that Facebook is kind of the Holy Grail.  Like it is going to solve their problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just like Joe Wall's tablets and native advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Plenty of Holy Grails out there.  All of them suck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But not that they shouldn't do it or work with Facebook.  But I think you've got to be very, very clear-eyed about what Facebook wants versus what you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tell me what are the business terms you would consider good.  That's the way to have this discussion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Facebook is not interested.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I don't think it matters.  I think you brought the right.  The analogy is excellent that you brought up, Jeff, of YouTube.  Because if you are relying on YouTube for your content business, which I'm not.  But if you were, that would be very risky.  And the power of YouTube is such that you don't really have any negotiation power with YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. But here's my point.  You do have, this goes back to the beginning.  There is a small, slight window right now caused by the German publishers I've complained about.  Let's give them credit that Facebook and Google want friends in publishing.  In part because they fear government coming after them.  In part because they're sick of this war.  There is, and because they're leapfrogging each other.  So Google try to be nice.  Facebook is nicer.  Now, what can Google do?  There is a negotiation position here.  So I would argue very, very strongly that the thing to do now is to sit down and say with no emotion.  None of this, oh, I don't like them.  I don't trust them.  What are they going to do?  It's a matter of negotiation.  If you deal in the cable business, you can bet whoever you're dealing with is going to try to screw you every way to Sunday and then sell your corpse.  And you deal with people in that industry.  No, fine.  These people are nicer than cable by far, nicer than Verizon by far.  We have to be able to figure out how to deal with them.  So the answer I would ask you is the same one I asked my students.  Without any of that, tell me what's a good deal with Facebook.  But to me, it's more than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To me, it's more than that.  You cannot deal with the Facebook algorithm.  There is no deal that you can.  Yes, you can.  Yes, you can.  You can ask for some assurance.  Facebook controls that algorithm and they will not promise you anything.  They won't promise you anything.  So Facebook is saying,  Matthew, wait, wait.  Facebook is saying we won't promote.  Facebook is saying we won't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Imagine you sat down with Mark and you got him drunk and Mark said,  OK, Matthew, what do you want?  What are you going to say?  Mark, I know you're never going to get anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff, I understand what you're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why don't you tell me why you keep taking down pages and stories about the Syrian Civil War?  Tell me why.  Tell me why you take down pictures and videos of us.  There's no incentive for Facebook to do that.  There's no window.  Why should we trust you with our content?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me put it as a business term.  The business term would be that if you're the New York Times, you say, listen,  I'm a valued brand and if I walk away from you, that's not going to look good.  So I want you to assure me that end times a day,  if I say something is important to someone who subscribed to me,  we will agree to a number that you will say that I will serve that to my readers  because I believe that's important.  And that is a business term.  It's not about playing with the algorithm.  It's a business term that you can negotiate.  If you can.  If we don't go to the table with any business terms, we will never get anything.  Well, one question.  Hold on, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think having those terms would be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. If you could get Facebook to do it.  We don't know what the terms are.  We don't know if we don't try.  We don't know what the terms are that the New York Times and the National Geographic got.  But I think you're giving a lot more credit to the value of the New York Times  and the National Geographic to Facebook than probably Facebook does.  Listen, we're not going to put our entire...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Facebook will do what it wants with the algorithm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree. I think you're right, Matt.  Facebook will do whatever is required.  And if New York Times stories about important news topics don't get clicked on,  they will be hidden in the newsfeed, period.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I don't think you can negotiate all you want, but it...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and maybe the New York Times shouldn't be...  Maybe that's the wrong thing to negotiate for, by the way.  If I were the New York Times, I wouldn't negotiate for saying show serious stories.  What I would negotiate for is saying that this is a chance to have a relationship with an individual  and give them greater relevance, but I can't do that, Facebook, if you don't give me data.  And then all... Now, can that be corrupting?  I'll give you nothing but cats?  Sure, it could, but that's where I trust the New York Times is not going to do that  because it will hurt their brand.  So there is a negotiation that occurs that says that I will give readers  their greater relevance and value.  What I want back is the assurance from Facebook that there's some long-term on this.  Number one. Number two, after getting the data that we have mutual agreement of how to do it  and how to do it well in privacy.  And number three, that you will not censor me, Facebook,  according to your supposed community standards, as we saw in Perugia.  They're never going to agree to that.  Well, again, Matthew, you don't know until you try to negotiate.  So what you're saying then in the end is that don't even try.  And then why go on Facebook?  What you're really saying is we don't trust them, so don't go there.  And I'm saying that we have to go there.  And if you have to go there, you try to go there in a way you try to negotiate something.  We have a small winner to negotiate, not negotiating as your responsible.  Okay, we got your point, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Matthew, I'm going to give you a chance to say a final word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think I'm not saying you should not put yourself on Facebook.  And I'm not even saying that the New York Times shouldn't experiment with instant articles.  I think what should not happen is you shouldn't expect that Facebook has any interest  in you or your journalism or your business model or whether you live or die.  You are just content.  And so if your content works for them, then they're happy to keep you on board.  I think the risk is that the central factor that determines your success is out of your control.  And that is the algorithm.  Facebook is the one that controls that.  They move the levers.  You have zero control over that and always will.  And I think that's a big risk.  Let me ask a question.  No, no, we're not going to talk any more about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're moving on.  Let me ask one last question.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why is Facebook doing this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Leo, you can just, if you need to go like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think we've heard both sides.  All right, all right, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was asking a legitimate question.  I was, I'm curious, why Matthew thinks Facebook is doing this at all?  What's the benefit to them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think there's a PR benefit that you mentioned.  I think they want to be seen to be partnering with people and not crushing people under their bootie else.  And I think they believe that some of that content users will engage with it.  It's very simple to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Facebook would love to own news, period, right?  How do you get to own news?  Well, the first thing you do is you get the major existing incumbents to give you their content.  Then as you win viewers over, you can slowly push them out of the market and you got news.  Is news something anybody wants to own?  Well, Facebook does.  No, Facebook wants attention, right?  What they want is your attention.  Attention.  They want you to live in Facebook.  And so to the degree that its users want a variety of content in there, they're going to do everything, all the content deals they can to get content in there.  They're going to make it look very sweet.  But the and you can maybe make a great deal right now.  Maybe, maybe you can negotiate a great deal right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It used to be that what people users wanted was Zynga games.  Right.  And then they didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Then when they didn't.  Now Zynga's mistake was Facebook was their only platform.  Right.  So that's an obvious foolish mistake.  And it's a foolish mistake with YouTube, too.  Nevertheless, I think that the risk here is is that Facebook.  I mean, it's clear what Facebook wants.  They want you to live in Facebook.  Period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, it's interesting to get back to Google.  It would be interesting to me.  What if Google tried to do something similar?  What if Google said, you know, we'll host your articles and we'll we'll show them full length and we'll give you a share of the ad revenue.  I'd be interested to see what the reaction would be.  I'm curious your reaction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What would you think about that?  I think it'd be better to have two places doing that than Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google, though, doesn't Google just Google's business model is different.  Facebook wants you to live within Facebook.  Google wants you to live within the Internet.  Right.  That's that's the opportunity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think what I what I will say in a post tomorrow is what I think the way Google can leapfrog here is by saying that if that Facebook thing they gave you.  That's wonderful.  We're going to enable you to do that anyway.  I also should point out that if you're Mark Zuckerberg, you're living in paranoia, fear at all times that at some point your user base billion and a half strong or whatever it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I tire of you.  Yes.  And there isn't really much stickiness to Facebook.  At this point, the only stickiness to Facebook is the network effects where your family and friends are.  Now, if it was the only place you could get news, maybe it would be more.  Isn't isn't more of a network effect.  Isn't isn't Mark's goal at this point to increase stickiness?  For sure.  That's all that's what he needs to do.  That's because if you're if he's going to survive, he has to make it very unpleasant for you to switch to some other network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's all your friends and family.  The switching cost.  Yeah.  Contents on a switching cost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's an interesting point then.  Shouldn't he be doing everything he can to make sure that your friends and family stick around?  Yeah.  I mean, I'm sure that Mark Zuckerberg doesn't go to bed at night content in the success that is Facebook.  I'm sure that every day he's worried and he should be because the Internet ultimately the Internet is is is a pretty frictionless environment.  How are each of you feeling about Facebook these days?  I hate it.  He should be worried about any trust.  Yeah.  Well, he's got a lot of people's being, you know, that's that's the sad thing.  Same thing at Google.  You get really successful in this country.  It's hard to hold on.  It's better to be slightly successful like me.  It's interesting that Facebook is doing lots of stuff.  Don't stick your head up.  Just stay in your gopher hole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Facebook is doing lots of stuff that's just as likely to draw.  I agree.  And he trusts attention to Google, if not more.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's why it's very interesting that they got to deal with Axel Springer through builds.  Well, it's a daring game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And very Mark Zuckerberg didn't get where he is without walking that edge.  Oh, yeah.  And I think that that's smart and fascinating.  And ultimately, Mark's got all the money he'll ever need for, you know, for many, many, many lifetimes.  So it ain't about that anymore.  No, never has been.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I'll be interested to see if this venture, Instant Articles, lasts any longer than the social readers that Washington Post and Guardian came up with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But if you if you look at Facebook and all of its initiatives over the last three years, how many have stuck around?  Very few.  Yeah, lots are gone.  Lots of failures.  Lots of abandonment.  Yeah.  We talk all the time about the things Google's abandoned.  Facebook abandoned stuff right and left.  Oh, yeah.  Constantly.  So, in fact, all of this may be a tempest and teapot because in three months, Instant Articles might just be.  Oh, yeah.  What's next?  Definitely possible.  Mark, clearly, users don't like it.  Right.  Right.  It will.  And that's exactly what Matt's saying.  Right.  As a content creator, you have no say in really the.  Oh, but they're there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's that's a slight difference in nuance there.  If Facebook says.  But Facebook always tries to make the best.  Facebook and Google both try to make the best user experience.  Right.  The Washington Post Guardian thing was not a good user experience.  If this is a good user experience, Facebook will stick by it.  If it's a bad user experience, no matter how good it is for publishers, it won't matter.  So users are paramount in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I will say that the reason why Facebook is in a position to do this and why it's such an appealing job.  Lots of news companies have done a terrible job of producing usable mobile apps, a good user experience.  So Facebook, you know, by comparison, looks fantastic.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're going to take a break.  I think this is a good conversation and I'm glad we actually extended a little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry that I thought it was fun.  I think it's fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, I think it's fascinating.  And and it's what we talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm glad Matthew and I are on at the same time because I knew we would see this from different perspectives.  Yeah, that's good.  Yeah.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's talk mattresses.  Let's lie down in peace.  Let's lie down in peace with Casper.  You spend so much of your time lying on a mattress.  And yet how much time did you spend buying that mattress?  Maybe five, ten minutes in a mattress store.  I know because I did it recently.  Casper's so much better.  This is in a way.  This is a interesting.  They made it a necessity, a virtue out of a necessity.  If you're going to sell mattresses on the Internet, well, you know, people are going to naturally say, well, how do I know if I like it?  So what Casper says is you have 100 days to decide or 100 nights, I guess.  You don't have to lie down in a showroom.  It has nothing to do with whether that mattress is going to work for you.  I want you to order a Casper mattress right now.  You could buy it online.  It's easy to buy.  It comes in a box, which is awesome.  Makes it very easy to get even a king size mattress into a little tiny space.  We got a king size for my son.  Lives on the third floor.  And he loves it.  Loves it.  We'll probably have to get him another one.  I don't know if he's going to be able to get it out of his room.  He's moving this next next semester.  Latex and memory foam come together to give you both the firmness you want and the sink and bounce you need.  Look at this.  Watch this.  Here's an elderly man jumping on that mattress.  And man, does he like it.  He loves it.  You can.  And beauty of this is if you don't like it, you have 100 days to decide.  They'll take it back.  No cost to you.  I love Casper.  You're going to love it, too.  An online retailer of premium mattresses for a fraction of the cost made in the U.S.  500 for a twin, 950 for a king size.  Compare that to the premium mattress in your mattress store.  You'll see it's a good deal.  And we're going to give you $50 off because you're listening to the show at Casper.com slash twig.  C-A-S-P-E-R dot com slash twig.  I love my Casper.  You will, too.  That's an example of an ad.  Sometimes people think we should only do tech ads.  And I guess an image of a man in a car.  I think we should only do tech ads.  And I guess an Internet companies, you know, kind of disintermediating the traditional brick and mortar store.  That's a tech company in a way.  But I just do stuff I like.  Frankly, got products I like.  The National the House of Representatives has passed the USA Freedom Act today.  Minutes ago, 338 to 88.  We'll head to the Senate where, of course, Mitch McConnell hates it because he hates freedom.  So it may not pass the Senate, but it has passed the House.  This, of course, is the bill that would back up the recent court decision about bulk collection of telephone records.  The USA Freedom Act would limit the bulk collection of telephone records and allow companies to challenge gag orders imposed by national security letters.  This was the other side of that coin was if you got a national security letter, you weren't allowed to tell anybody that the data was being collected.  The bill replaces bulk collection with a system that requires actual court orders to search data on a case by case basis.  Gosh, a constitutional law.  Holy cow.  Are these guys nuts?  Great idea.  It's probably one of those needs a super majority in the Senate, which is, of course, going to be impossible.  In fact, in November, they voted on this similar USA Freedom Act that got 58 votes in the Senate, which is too short of the super majority needed.  Open letter to the Senate urging them to pass the USA Freedom Act last year from Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter.  Of course, these are all the companies who get those national security letters and can't tell you.  So we'll watch with interest, right?  It's time to write your Congress Critter, write your senator, especially if you're in Kentucky, write to Mitch McConnell and say, you know what?  We want this.  We want this bill to pass.  We expect it to passed.  We got this thing called the Fourth Amendment.  Ever hear of it?  I'm sorry.  I just got on my horse, but I thought everybody else was on a horse.  I should ride along with you.  Giddy up.  Giddy up.  So I got I forgot I've been wearing the Apple watch.  I maybe I've maybe I don't know.  Maybe I've defected.  I don't know.  You like it?  You know, they're all the same.  Really?  The Apple watch is a little prettier.  I made the mistake of buying the LG Urbane.  It looked good on the page.  And I put it on.  Everybody said, what is that ugly watch?  You get that under a bridge.  Where'd you get that?  Somebody selling it out of his trunk of his car.  Doesn't look so bad.  This is no, but this is the Apple watch.  Of course, it doesn't look bad.  It's seven hundred dollars.  OK, that was seven hundred.  It's stainless steel with a Milanese loop.  Seven hundred schmacker rules.  But they're all about the same.  I mean, really, seriously, they all do about the same thing.  Do you look at your phone less?  No, because a lot of the stuff you want to do is easier on your phone, even though you could do it on the watch.  It's such a teensy weezy.  It's like a postage stamp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I look less when it comes in and I can look at the was.  I don't need that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, you know, I prefer Android and I really like Android Wear.  Especially the new Android Wear on the Urbane.  I really, really like it.  But this watch is less offensive.  So.  Do you have a watch, Matthew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This kind of watch?  No, I have a Timex Ironman that was there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You got ninety five.  I think at Walmart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He is an iron man.  Google has a Apple Watch app, you know, Google News and Weather.  Google rejects 70 percent of the quarter of a million right to be forgotten requests.  70 percent.  If that's a different number from what we've heard in the past.  It didn't seem like it was that it was a majority in the past.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought in the past.  That's a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was a no, no, no, it might have been.  Really?  Anyway, that's good news.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They've received 250,000.  They've received 253,617 requests.  About 500 a day now down from the original 1500 a day.  I don't know if they'll be compelled to say yes.  Oh, initially, Google was refusing just 43 percent.  Ah, OK, there you go.  So and according to the article in the esteemed IBT.  IBT owns Newsweek International Business Times Newsweek.  Yeah.  Both of them have become rags.  Yeah.  Did Newsweek ever retract the story about Bitcoin being created by a guy in Southern California?  I don't believe so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They just waited for people to forget.  Forget.  Oh, man.  That was one of the worst cover stories in recent memory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was their relaunch of their paper version.  And it was wrong, wrong, wrong.  It was a great story.  It was a great story.  I wanted to believe it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was really well written.  It was fascinating.  It fell apart.  It was just totally wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They didn't hire Columbia University to check their veracity as like a Rolling Stone did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, so speaking of which, Brian Williams.  Oh, what's the latest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was he done?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought he was.  Is that not true?  Is that true?  It's getting, you know, if I were Brian, I would say, yeah, yeah, I'm gone.  Don't stop investigating.  Yeah, gotta go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're going through his junior high school transcripts now.  It's just getting worse and worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I guess there's no final.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just listened to Brokaw on Fresh Air on NPR.  And I was pretty shocked that Terry Gross didn't ask him.  Brokaw is now saying, I don't have more to say, but at least ask him so you can hear  him say, I don't want to talk about that.  So Fox News asked him.  I thought they did ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Fox News asked him.  And he told Fox News, he said, Brian's at the point where he is, I gather, trying to  decide how he's going to respond.  Right.  A little late for that.  And now after the probe, it was originally just two or three allegations.  Now there's 10.  Yeah.  So I always liked Brian.  Nice guy.  Told a great story.  Really good.  And you know, really, isn't that what a news anchor's job is to tell?  Isn't that our job?  Tell me, professor of journalism at City University of New York, Jeff Jarvis, isn't journalism  the job of telling a story?  Look, you cannot reproduce the truth.  It should be true, should it not?  Well, it shouldn't be a lie, but there's truth and there's truthiness.  Isn't the job, our job, everybody, is to make sense of a random set of, almost seemingly  random set of facts by telling a story around it that's compelling and kind of makes it  make sense and helps us understand it, because the story is how humans understand things.  And sometimes a cleverly added, crafted non-fact will help the overall factualness.  No?  I don't think we are innocent storytellers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't?  No.  I think that that's the form we took.  If we truly look at how we serve communities with information, I think we're more than  that.  Stories are one of the tools we'll have.  But Brian Williams is special.  When I listened to this Broca thing on Fresh Air, and you're right, Matthew, maybe it was  cut down because it was pledge week, so maybe there was a longer version.  Oh, Jesus.  The version I heard heard nothing.  And Broca's a good guy, but the ego inherent in what he said as an anchor, he talked about  9-11 and he debated about what he should prepare the nation for this or that.  That is hubris.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, amazing.  But reporters, but let me get, this is what I hear in my mind.  A reporter's job is to gather facts and deliver them, period, right?  And explain things.  Less so explain things.  Find experts.  More just to gather facts.  I mean, obviously in the reporter's mind, there has to be some sort of overarching story,  but really it's to gather and deliver facts.  But an anchor maybe is like a meta-reporter whose job it is to interpret the facts and  tell a story so the American people can understand.  No, it's to read.  It's to read and tell a story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think you could argue that Brian Williams, in fact I have argued that Brian Williams  and the entire concept of a celebrity anchor who sits there and kind of interprets the  news is an antiquated, like that worked in the 40s and 50s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, didn't Walter Cronkite, didn't Walter Cronkite after going to Vietnam and assessing  the story end up saying this is a war we cannot win and changed overnight America's opinion  of Vietnam and LBJ?  He certainly helped change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I think a guy like Brian Williams, like he's a pleasant voice and he provides...  He's a talking head.  He's a hairdo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  He's a hairdo with a mouth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To some extent, I thought it was odd that people were expecting him to somehow be a  journalist.  Like that was not my expectation at all.  What's it like in Canada these days, Matthew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you mean?  In terms of the anchors on the national, the national view of anchors, what's it like?  Is it the same as the US?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we like Peter Mansbridge because he's been around for a hundred years and he refused  to go to the US and stayed in Canada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is he like the nightly news anchor on the CBC or something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, he's kind of the eminent squeeze of anchors.  But I mean that whole position to me is kind of farcical in a way.  Yes, of course.  It just makes no sense to have this one guy or even woman who sits there and kind of interprets  the news.  You know, I can do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I don't think Walter Cronkite would have made up a story to underscore his opinion  that Vietnam was unwinnable, right?  I doubt it.  He doesn't seem like that would have happened.  Had it happened, it would have been just as scandalous then as it would be now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I think, Brian, it was all about the delivery and the story and the feeling and conveying  the emotion.  And so it didn't really matter what the specific details were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, he misread.  I think he misread the American public.  He thought that was his job.  I bet if he speaks out on this, that's probably what he should say, which is, I'm sorry, I  thought I was supposed to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really?  That's what I'd say.  I'm betting he's not going to say that.  I don't know.  I misunderstood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought I saw in the memo that I was supposed to make up facts to substantiate my opinion.  Was that not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's the poignant part, though.  I mean, Brian Williams, he said he thought he was a nice guy.  I love Brian.  I met him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think he's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've worked with him.  He's destroyed.  Oh, well.  What's your...  He's got plenty of money in the bank.  Plenty of money.  He was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He could be the host of all sorts of things.  He could be the host of anything.  America's Funniest Home Videos is looking...  He's still very...  I think he's well-liked.  Yeah, he should just...  He just won't post anything, journalists.  He should be...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nobody ever says, hey, Carson Daly, you made that up.  Right.  Nobody ever says, how come...  I mean, yes, he could be a TV host, which is really what he was, and he just didn't  understand.  Right.  Exactly.  He didn't understand.  He'll write a book.  It was a reality show.  It's a reality show.  He was the host of a reality show.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He misunderstood, I think.  So you seriously think that he could be...  He could get hired for a show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Good Lord, Don Imus got rehired.  Marv Albert got rehired.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  America loves to forgive the sinner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just not the news.  He could have a talk show in a second.  Yeah.  But you're $10.  He's talking to five different people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  He could do the Tomorrow Show.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You're right.  Anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is this story in the Wall Street Journal?  How Google's top minds decide what to forget.  That's the right to be forgotten.  Oh, it's more right to be forgotten.  So who is on this panel?  Not personally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They don't decide what to personally forget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what I thought.  Never mind.  I was all excited about the headline.  Larry Page and Elon Musk meeting in...  Yeah, a secret apartment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Secret apartment.  That's fascinating.  On the moon.  That's what we picture happening, right?  We picture them meeting in some secret location,  you know, shaped like a spaceship,  and they're talking about robot armies and stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like a John le Carre novel.  It's like a safe house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll meet you in the secret apartment.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're going to get...  I'm picturing like Tony Stark's lair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is from Ashley Vance's new book on Elon Musk.  Ashley's going to join us on the triangulation  in a couple of weeks to talk about his book.  What a great revelation.  Google even has its own chef on call to prepare food  for people who are allowed to stay in the apartment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to stay in the apartment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to see this apartment.  Like, is it an apartment?  I want to see.  Got to be gorgeous, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, if Elon Musk comes to town to meet with Larry,  they're not going to put him up in the Sheridan.  They're going to have a nice place for him.  Greg Zachary, a venture capitalist and friend of Musk,  was at one of the meetings.  He described it to Ashley Vance saying,  I was there once,  and Elon was talking about building an electric jet plane  that could take off and land vertically.  Larry said the plane should be able to land on ski slopes,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  and Sergey said it needs to be able to dock  at a port in Manhattan, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Then they started talking about building a commuter plane  that was always circling the Earth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, like you'd hop onto it,  and you'd get places incredibly fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Zachary said, I thought everyone was kidding,  but at the end I asked Elon,  are you really going to do that?  And he said, yeah, dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think Elon watches basically Avengers movies  and the Iron Man movies,  and then he just comes up with ideas,  like the jet take off and land,  like it's basically right out of Ultron.  Isn't he our Thomas Edison?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, now it depends on how you feel about Edison.  Because there are those who quite rightly think  that Edison was a poser.  Yeah, that's true.  He was a patent troll.  So who is he?  He stole ideas.  He was right and left.  That's how he got his...  That's how he got started was...  He's our Tesla.  He's our Tesla, Tesla.  Except Tesla was cookie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Tesla was kind of nuts.  You know Elon is a little...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A week ago we were talking about Elon's power wall on Twitter.  It was great.  And Jason Calacanis, who happens to know Tesla...  Tesla, no Musk.  Elon.  I'm sure Jason knows him too.  He owns the first Tesla, number one, 00000001.  And he's building...  Jason is invested in a company that's building a demo,  a two mile demo of the Hyperloop.  Nice.  But he was very bullish on this power wall, he says.  And I think he might be right.  You don't understand.  Elon Musk has just solved global warming.  Like this is that important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you think?  I think it could be.  I think it could be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it could be too.  He made a compelling case for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know I want one.  Elon is a super smart guy, but I think the most important thing about him is  he just comes up with these things and a normal person would say,  well obviously we're not going to launch a rocket  because that's really hard and super expensive.  And we're not going to build a completely new form of transportation  called the Hyperloop.  But Elon is like, well why not?  We can do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It turns out, this was good, Jason understood this better because he'd invested in it,  that really the Hyperloop's biggest benefit is not people, but freight.  Because we spend a huge amount of money and there's a huge global impact  to trans shipping stuff from China to the United States in container ships.  And what he says the real plan is to build an underwater Hyperloop  that ships free.  So what, the freight gets, if something goes wrong, you lost some Apple watches.  No humans die.  So interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well if I think the Hyperloop, I'm fascinated by it  and I fantasize about taking it, going to California in 45 minutes,  but it's got to be a claustrophobic experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think the Hyperloop is a good idea for humans,  not to mention the issues of the acceleration.  You're basically in a pneumatic tomb.  I don't want to do it.  But again, it's a billion dollars for people moving,  and look at our train systems falling apart because nobody takes trains.  So it doesn't seem like a great idea, but as a freight mover...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and that actually compares to,  I was reading something the other day about self-driving trucks.  So there's a prototype.  So the actual, the benefit of self-driving vehicles  might actually be more on the freight side and delivery side  than on the human side.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The apartment is a high-rise in downtown Palo Alto  with views of the mountains surrounding Stanford's campus.  It is during such meetings at Google's secretive apartment...  I've got to talk to Ashley about this...  that Musk, Page, and Bryn began to brainstorm ideas that turned into projects.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's kind of our recreation, I guess, Page told Vance.  It's fun for the three of us to talk about kind of crazy things.  We find stuff that eventually turns out to be real.  We go through hundreds or thousands of possible things  before arriving at the ones that are most promising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that your Wayne's World voice?  Party on!

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Party on, Elon.  Party on, Elon!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the way, the Google, you talk self-driving,  the Google self-driving cars.  1.7, I don't know, is this one of your numbers, Jeff?  I hope not. 1.7 million miles.  But?  Well, 11 accidents, but in every case it was humans that caused the accidents.  The most common accidents are in typical...  it was mostly not on the highways, all on streets,  and mostly like rear endings.  You can't stop somebody from rear-ending you.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Plus, people, you know what? This thing is a magnet from...  Oh my God, look what's there, Brian.  Look, Marge, whoops!

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, according...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I heard the point made that they should have reported this number earlier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but I think it would have been widely misunderstood  because you cannot control people plowing into you.  They were T-boned once, they were rear-ended a bunch of times.  It wasn't their fault.  Although they say, hey, but we're working on ways to avoid places  where accidents are more likely to happen  or be more careful in intersections like that.  But look, they could see 600 feet in front of them, or 600 yards in front of them.  They do not much better.  Here's the stat.  660,000 people at any given moment in the United States,  660,000 people are behind the wheel and not looking at the road.  They're checking their devices.  I don't know where that number...  That's a great number. I don't know where it comes from.  Distraction.gov.  Well, that's got to be real.  That's totally legit.  That's what government is, is distracted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Distraction.gov.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, that should be Congress's site.  I know. I like that. This is my site. This is my new site.  If you're bored, distraction.gov.  10% of all drivers under the age of 20 killed in fatal crashes  reported as distracted at the time of the crash.  At any given day... This is from NOPUS, N-O-P-U-S.  At any given daylight moment across the U.S.,  660,000 drivers are using cell phones  or manipulating electronic devices while driving.  600... This is from a report from  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  Driver electronic use in 2011.  The most recent year we have these by gender.  More females than males.  Considerably more females than males.  That's this one over the black one.  Driver handheld cell phone use by age.  It goes down as you get older.  You're only about 1% of folks over 70 use cell phones  while they're driving.  Although the number doubled in 2011 to 2%.  16 to 24, 7%. It's been as high as 10%.  Drivers holding phones to ears while driving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was there ever a survey where they looked at the amount of accidents  while people were fiddling with the radio?  No, and that's got to be just as high, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or arguing with your husband.  Right. Or thinking or wool gathering.  Or reaching behind to pick up the kid's bottle.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The percentage of drivers visibly manipulating handheld devices  while driving increased significantly.  0.9% in 2010, 1.3% in 2011.  Still not a...  But 1%, that's why you get 660,000 I guess.  Anyway, this is a good bunch of statistics.  NOPUS. What is NOPUS?  Some sort of, I guess...  NOPUS is the National Occupant Protection Use Survey  conducted annually by the National Center for Statistics  and Analysis of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  I guess they actually look.  They like put observers out there and extrapolate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wonder how many there will be when people look at their watches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, now that I can manipulate my watch,  send a heartbeat as I die in a crash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh my God, his heartbeat's died.  Since you know where the problem is when you have to use the watch,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you've got to go like this.  No, Apple Watch doesn't require that much of a jerk.  Doesn't?  No.  Yeah, and I guess...  Yeah, it would be hard to send a heartbeat while you're driving  because it takes two hands.  Hey, I'm thrilled that Ed Felton is now our Deputy US CTO.  That is a stunner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Great news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ed Felton, a Princeton professor who has done a lot of work,  in fact I think walked the line on copy protection, on DRM,  a really smart guy.  He's published more than 100 papers and two books on technology, law, and policy.  A great choice.  Yeah, boy, amazing.  I mean, Ed was kind of one of the outlaws who really was pushing  these research into things like DRM and encryption.  Wow, couldn't be a better choice.  So they got Megan as the CTO, right?  Is Megan Smith CTO?  Well, I can't remember.  Yes.  Right?  Yeah, and Ed Felton, who is the Robert E. Kahn  Professor of Computer Science and Public Affairs at Princeton,  he used to work at the Federal Trade Commission and the DOJ,  so I guess he has some experience in government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm pretty sure that was, someone mentioned that Ed Felton was Aaron Swartz's suggestion as CTO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Couldn't be better.  Really?  I mean, it really couldn't be.  It's good news.  I mean, somebody who really understands what's going on as a place at the table,  I'm very happy about that.  There's some good news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm trying to remember how to use an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You want to do that face?  I'm sitting here with one and I don't see the face.  It looks so ridiculous.  I know. It's so primitive, isn't it?  Wow.  Don't you feel like iPhones are kind of primitive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I was using someone's the other day and it felt like I was using a Barbie phone, you know, from me, from the kids.  I swear to God, I could not fit my phone.  I used a Ken phone.  You have which one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ken phone.  You have the Ken phone.  The what?  Ken phone.  That's very sexist of you.  Trying to add to your joke there.  Oh, sorry, Barbie Ken.  I got it.  Do they have Ken in Canada or is he named Bruce or something?  No, they have Ken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's called Ken.  I'm pretty sure Ken's still around.  Okay.  I've been using the Nexus 6 actually.  How do you like it?  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're getting ready for Google Fi, aren't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, when I first started using it, I thought this is way too big.  Yeah.  Like it's just way too big.  I thought I'm never going to get comfortable with it.  And now if I try to use the old Nexus 4 or an iPhone, I'm like, what are these tiny phones?  Yeah.  Oh, that's what you mean by Barbie phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's kind of like just precious and small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you didn't lose your phone in Italy, did you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I had the phone in my pocket and I had my passport.  Oh, thank goodness you had the passport.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what new computer do you need?  I actually was going to put it in my backpack and forgot.  Oh.  Are you going to get a Chromebook Pixel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm thinking about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know who's got a Chromebook is my mom.  The place that she lives, the retirement home, is doing a trial of Chromebooks.  Really?  So she's trying out.  Yeah.  So they've got Wi-Fi throughout the place and they've given out some Chromebooks.  I'm not sure she's going to use it, but it's a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want to thank one of our viewers for sending me an email.  He's a first trainer.  You know about first.  It's the robotics competition that's done in high schools.  Steve Wozniak is a first coach.  It's a really cool thing.  The championship is something that high school students work all year towards.  And it's just a great way to teach robotics.  It has been up to now using Lego Mindstorms, the NLX chip, as its controller.  The announcement last, I guess it was in March, that they're going to start using Android.  The new platform for first features robot and driver station controls based on a Snapdragon processor,  handheld devices, Android devices.  They're going to be working on a Java platform, of course, because that's how Android works.  So that's really good news because it means there'll be a whole generation of kids who are expert Android programmers.  And the Android devices, you always need a smart device to control these things.  And it makes sense because inexpensive smartphone, in fact, Microsoft announced something similar with its Windows 10 for the Internet of Things,  a platform for not just the Raspberry Pi, but also Windows phones to control the Raspberry Pi and others.  So this is exciting. It's good news, frankly.  And glad we stole it away from the Lego oligopoly.  So you haven't bought a computer yet to replace the stolen one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have not. I just got a Fortune MacBook Pro, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I see. It's got one of those inventory labels on the back. That kind of spoils the fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It sure does. I'm thinking of putting my Iron Man sticker over top of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Good. You don't use Android on first robotics. Well, I think that's the new thing is the idea. That's the new thing.  Somebody in the chat was saying you don't do that. Maybe I misunderstood.  But that's I'm looking at the first press release that says you do. So I think that's authoritative.  I'm going to take a break. And when we come back, we're going to have kind of the back of the book matter tools and tips.  Oh, it feels like Windows Weekly. Yes, I like this back of the book concept.  I like that. Nobody really knows what I'm talking about because nobody has read magazines in years.  Yeah. But you book you remember in the old days, the computer magazines at the back of it would have the fun stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's a page? They had the ads for the 3D or the X-ray specs in the comic books. It was the good stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  One man submarine. Yeah. You know. Yeah. Made out of cardboard.  What was the the little sea people? Yes. Sea monkeys. Yeah. Sea monkeys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to apologize to Matthew. I got all headed up in the discussion. I really enjoyed it.  But I think I got too headed up in interrupting you. And you're nice and kind of idiot. You don't do that.  I just want to make sure that I was for the discussion and I always enjoyed doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's what I imagine, that this is kind of a mirror image of the discussion you have with your students.  And that was probably the fast back and forth early burly kind of thing.  Yeah. So you just got excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do. I do. Which is good. But I just want to salute Matthew.  We love the back and forth.  I want to make sure that we have a group hug, virtual hug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I got a secret apartment at Palo Alto, you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like did you watch the Howard Stern David Letterman kiss?  No. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was there a tongue?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it was Howard tried to kiss Letterman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can only imagine what Letterman.  That would be a frightening video.  You do your number and I will find the video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'll find that. Okay. Let's see. Which number am I going to do?  I'm going to do, well, Sheryl Sandberg, who's back at work amazingly, just announced moments ago that Facebook is going to give us contractors $15 an hour minimum, 15 days off and $4,000 for parental benefits.  Is that good?  They are nice people.  Does that sound pretty good?  Better than being some poor schlub who gets absolutely no benefits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  You know.  Benefits are always good. Here's the late show, ladies and gentlemen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or we could do as a number. Okay, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's the lovely, Howard Stern in a three piece suit.  Listen to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don Rickles is coming on later, right?  Listen to this. My hero.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait a minute. What does Letterman's got a slurpee?  They gave away milkshakes.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dave doesn't know I know this. He invited Don to go to dinner with him after the show. You think I was invited? I wasn't invited.  Terrible. Terrible. But I don't want to go anyway. Believe me.  Howard?  Listen to you two guys.  Once again.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  First of all, I didn't realize it was Carnaby Street night.  What? What did I do? I dressed up for you. Come here. Come here.  Stay away from me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh no, this is where he tries to kiss him?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Come over here.  What are we doing, Howard?  Come here. Is this goodbye? Is this our final time together?  No.  Come here.  No, what are you going to do?  Come over here.  Come here. Come here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, he kisses his hand. He knows. I think he has senses that something unpleasant is about to happen.  Oh, oh, he's trying to kiss him on the mouth. Oh.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Kiss me. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think Letterman is kind of a misanthrope. He's like one of those guys who doesn't like to be touched, right?  Oh.  He's up. He's up. I like that.  He is laughing.  He's laughing, but he's crying on the inside.  Plus, Howard's like seven feet tall or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He looks huge.  He's a scary man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. All right. Thank you, Jeff.  The only other number of the week is that every day of this week is a palindrome.  That's right.  In America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Only in the American way of things.  Only in America.  It's 51315, 51315, which is the same backwards and forwards, and it is all weak.  In America.  In America.  What would it be? Do you do date, month, year in the Canadian Rockies?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what's funny is some people do and some people don't.  It's a little like we're trapped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a Britishism.  Mm-hmm.  I do. After reading Strunk and White, where E.B. White encourages you to write dates in a sensible way where the numbers are separated so there's no confusion.  So I do write my dates, 13 May 2015.  Yeah, that makes sense.  There's a good reason for that because you're separating the numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and day, month, year. I mean, month, day, year makes no sense whatsoever.  Because it doesn't sort right, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, computer geeks always write year, month, day because then everything sorts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The fun thing about filling out online forms is sometimes they will want it like federal things.  Sometimes they want it year, month, day.  I know.  Sometimes they want it month, day, year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and it's very confusing for us Americans when we travel on those custom forms.  You have to read it carefully.  But you know what's odd? I think the American customs forms are also day, month, year, which is maybe because a lot of foreigners come in.  So can I do one more here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I just thanks to Vic Condotra, who linked to the Facebook thing.  Yeah, I just finally got Facebook working on this.  You can see. So there's an article here that he recommends.  Wait a second.  So I have to follow Vic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You got Facebook instant articles on your Android now?  It looks like an iPhone 4.  No, no, no. This is my very old iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, on the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look how small that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just want you to count. Leo, you do a 1-1,000 thing. See how long this story takes to come up.  Okay, ready?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right.  1-1,000, 2-1,000, 3-1,000, 4-5-1,000, 6-1,000, 7-1,000, 8-1,000, 9 seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So on the old phone, it ain't so buttery smooth.  That's the old phone, I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow. Well, I don't know if I could get so if I follow Vic Condotra, he might put he put a link.  Oh, because you have to share it. One of these instant news stories, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess so. I don't know. I tried to hope the New York Times would come up. This is an NBC story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't have to. You can go to Facebook.com slash instant or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we did that, but it didn't.  That didn't have the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here it is. Here's Vic. The trouble with almonds from NBC News.  That came right up.  Okay, but wait a minute. But no, this is the website. Of course that came right up.  That's not instant, I don't think.  I want to see. How do I get the... Is this Facebook? Oh, it is. This is Facebook.  That's it. Oh, it is Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't get that. All right, so mine is too old. That's why I'm not getting it.  I'm going to come up right away.  I got a web. Okay, that's what it is. I got a web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the way, that's kind of interesting because you wouldn't know you're on Facebook here,  except for the like button. This looks like there's even ads, NBC News ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there's certain ad formats and all kinds of things. That is buttery.  That's nothing like what I saw. Thank you.  Oh, it's very buttery.  Oh, that's neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  And the videos autoplay as you scroll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They do. So like there's the video.  You know what? This is actually production wise is very desirable.  Oh, it's great.  Jeff, this is like using medium. You use medium. Are you going to?  Yeah. Yeah.  It's beautiful.  Yeah. Tom Rogers, Almond Grove.  Part of the story of this is that every almond, every almond, not true, not bunch of almonds,  not pound of almonds. Every almond that you eat is something like six gallons of water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what? I think there's been a scourge of almonds.  When I get on the airplane, I miss my peanuts. You never get peanuts anymore.  No, because of peanut allergies.  Almonds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yep. And can't do the tree nuts no more.  I was on a plane, a Virgin America plane where they recalled the peanuts.  What?  They were giving us nuts and they said, Whoa, the pilot came on. I'm sorry.  You have to give back your nuts. There's a kid on here who's allergic.  I was not giving my nuts back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's why you usually get pretzels on lots of flights.  Yeah. This is beautiful, Jeff.  It is beautiful. That's one good looking spider, is it not?  If that spider had a parlor, you would enter it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you can join the conversation with NBC News' Hailey Jackson.  There she is. She's talking to me, me personally.  Hi, Hailey. She's doing a selfie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think this Facebook thing is going to catch on.  In vertical video, formatted for your phone, specifically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to share this. I can share it. I can write a post. I can send it at Messenger.  I can copy the link. I can email. I can tweet it, which is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the sharing menu, I've got to give them credit.  They did add a bunch of things there. It's not just share it with other people on Facebook.  Pinterest and Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think they should have credit for that.  So I'm going to write, just if you follow me, and a lot of people do,  I'm just going to write, here's an example.  An example of what do they call this again?  Instant Articles.  The new instant, I hate this keyboard, news feature from Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Josh Benton, who's a really, really good guy, just asked on Twitter,  would anyone know the technology behind their speed?  Is it prefetching something else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, you know, you saw I loaded it and it came up right away.  It wasn't like...  Yeah, it's pretty fast.  Yeah.  But of course it's prefetching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Does it work on an iPad too?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't believe so.  Oh, it's only on iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what do you guys think about a big, giant, huge Facebook with tons of resources  not doing this on two platforms?  They will. Give them a break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, sure. Yeah, they will.  They will.  This is not going to be only on an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but it's just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, they don't want to roll it out too fast because then you wouldn't get the buttery experience.  We never got paper.  It's one... Yeah, but you didn't miss anything.  It's one way to control how many people use it basically. Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you have any idea whether this was a new version of Facebook that had to come down?  I don't, unfortunately.  Or this was all built in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just don't know. That's a good question.  That was good. That's pretty pretty.  I thought it looked... It's gorgeous.  It looks like butter.  It's like butter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you go to the New York Times on your Facebook app?  I tried it. It didn't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Somebody has to share it with you, which is...  Although I don't know if I'm following Vic or not, but let me just look real quickly  and see if there is... I think they tell you when there's stuff that's been updated recently.  Updates. Recently updated.  Did Facebook get recently updated? No.  Google Sheets, Slides and Docs are getting updated.  Doesn't look like that was a recent update.  So when's the last time Facebook...  Facebook got updated on May 8th.  So that was probably the update.  Let's see if they even say in the West News.  They don't say anything.  Every update of Facebook app includes improvements for speed and reliability.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  They update the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Does it mention butter?  Buttery. Buttery.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Buttery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't mean to add more time here, but I'm glad I got a demo of it.  No, I'm glad you did. That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mr. Matthew Ingram, anything you'd like to share as a pick of the week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't have to.  I can't remember...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did I freeze?  I can offer you one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have I mentioned Google Photos and uploading all my photos?  I know that's not new.  We do love that, don't we though?  The search is great.  So I've got personal search turned on.  So I've tried things like my photos of Caitlin, my daughter, and it pulls them all up.  It's fascinating.  It's a great... just for backup purposes, it's a great solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I got to show you this.  Flickr, as you know, just updated significantly.  That's what made me think of it.  Its capabilities.  And one of the things Flickr does, which is really interesting, is this  automatic tagging feature.  You have to go to your camera roll.  I'm going to do that right now on my Flickr.  And let's see.  There's... so normally the default would be sort by date taken.  But there's... you'll see this tab here that says Magic View.  And look how well this does.  Animal bird.  Here's two birds. Animal cat, animal dog.  This is all done automatically.  Animal other.  Sometimes there's some mistakes, although there is a donkey there.  Architecture.  So imagine uploading all your pictures to Flickr and these are all buildings,  cities, sculpture.  Did a pretty good job of that.  Towers.  Look at that. They're all towers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got to think Google could do that too, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google should do this. Absolutely.  Yeah.  Food, beverage, food, meal, food, vegetable, food, other.  Landscape.  Field. Yes, those are all fields.  Forest. Mountain. Those are all mountains.  Rock. Well, a pyramid isn't a rock, but it's rock-like.  It's rock-colored.  Here's shore. Look at that.  Snow. Sunset.  Pretty impressive.  So you use Flickr and Flickr's free up to I think a terabyte of storage.  I think this is pretty darn impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to say though, I was a big Flickr user and well,  they changed the UI which bothered me, but also their mobile apps,  in my experience, are terrible.  So if I want my phone to automatically upload things, which I do,  I want to upload to Google. I want to upload to Dropbox.  It happens in the background. No problem.  Every time I try to do that with Flickr, it takes forever and then something fails.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, everybody has backup, free backup now. Everybody.  So I just backup everything everywhere.  Here's all black and white photos. This is really pretty sweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've got everything at Google, everything at Dropbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, it's nice to have the backup.  Anyway, I'm glad you mentioned that because I actually wanted to show people that.  I think we showed that on the radio show.  Chris Marquardt told me about it, our photo guy.  Jeff, since you obviously have an extra thing, go ahead, throw it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was just going to say that Tuttle Bear now has an app for Chrome.  Yeah, I saw that.  So what is Tuttle Bear?  Tuttle Bear is a VPN-ish thing.  So you can watch BBC from the US or you, Matthew, can watch US stuff from Canada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tuttle Bear is great.  Hotel.  In violation of every law and no demand.  By David Cameron.  This is exactly why we have no free speech now.  It's because of you.  People use Tuttle Bear during, what was it, FIFA, the World Cup?  I know it was a very popular way to watch curtail online tracking.  It's VPN.  And I don't know, have you used it? I haven't used it.  I've used it. It's great.  So it's fast enough that you could watch video?  Just works really well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. Yes. It's so easy.  You get a decent amount free.  The service is great for the company.  And here's the deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The really good, legitimate use is at an open Wi-Fi access spot.  So put it in Chrome, turn it on, and you go to Starbucks and you can now browse with Impunity.  Exactly.  I think that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tuttle Bear is also Canadian.  He looks Canadian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's a nice guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We have a lot of bears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you have to create a Tuttle Bear account.  Have you ever used Holah?  No, what's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Holah is a Chrome plugin.  It's really nice.  It's really nice. Well done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It knows where kind of it senses that you want to go be illegal right now.  It does it for you.  I want to be illegal right now.  Right? Is that the one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you can say, I want to pretend that I'm from in Britain or I want to pretend I'm in the US.  We don't condone this kind of behavior, but.  I'm just saying if you're the type of person for personal reasons who has to pretend to be from a different country.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe you're a freedom fighter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly.  Doctors without borders, that kind of thing.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're worried that Edie Amin will find out where you live and track you down.  All right, Tunnel Bear and Holah with an H.  I'm tunneling privately to the United States.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  It'll give you a little data to get started.  So don't use this until you need it.  Right?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I've used it when I'm out of the country in a hotel room to get the things I actually do pay for.  Tunneling privately to the United States.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Start bear-owsing.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Here's a little data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Change countries.  Oh, this is how you change countries.  You get a little Tunnel Bear button and you could say US, UK, Canada, Germany, Netherlands.  Wow.  You get a lot of countries to choose from.  That's cool.  250 gigabytes.  So you get as much as 250 to 500 gigabytes a month, I guess.  And then if you want more, you can pay for it.  But yeah, for like an emergency.  That's good.  Thank you, Jeff Jarvis, City University of New York.  BuzzMachine.com.  You're the greatest, man.  Love having you on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It actually, you know, once I got over the sort of the grief of the way that things ended,  it was nice to hear from lots of people who I hadn't considered before.  So it was a little like being around at your own funeral.  It's validating.  Yeah.  No, it was nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Transcript:  Are you going to bring back call for help?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I thought about it briefly and then I thought, you know what?  I don't need to because really that's what we do with the radio show.  The tech guy shows all calls all the time.  So that's unnecessary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's when the first time I was on your show was in the basement of the Omni TV building in Toronto.  Oh, yeah.  Did you come in?  How many years ago was that?  I did.  I came in.  I was at the Globe and Amber MacArthur brought me in.  That must be where we met.
