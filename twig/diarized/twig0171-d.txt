Transcript:  episode 171. Today is November 7th, 2012, and I am not Leo Laporte. Leo is off cruising the world,  so I'm standing in for him. He's not in studio today. And neither is our friend Jeff Jarvis,  who's usually with us. Jeff was also supposed to be traveling the world today, but he's actually  at home in New Jersey, stuck without power and internet connectivity. So our thoughts go out to  Jeff. We hope he gets powered up and connected again soon because we miss him. But we've got a  great panel today. I'm really excited. We have in studio Aaron Newcomb, who is a host of The Source,  Show of the Source and works for Oracle. Hey, Aaron. Hey, good to see you. Good to see you too.  Thanks so much for being in studio today, just in case my Skype goes out. We got someone down the  floor. And we also have with us a friend of mine from here in San Diego, Mitch Wagner, who's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  editor in chief of internetevolution.com. Hey, Mitch. Hi, Gina. How you doing? Good. How are

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  things in your part of San Diego? A little foggy at the moment. Are you getting the fog yet?  No, it's beautiful and sunny here. Good. Good, good, good. Really thrilled you guys are here  today. And thanks to the chat room and to Chad for getting this set up. So I don't know, is everyone  sick of hearing about the election? You know, yesterday was the US presidential or the election  in general here in the United States. And- Wait, why didn't no one tell me this? I know.  It was so difficult to find information about it. But so I don't know if you guys saw this,  but Sergey Brannou, Google posted on his Google Plus page, a call for the candidates to basically  govern as independents to take down the party, the two party system.  He said that he was dreading today's elections. He posted this yesterday, not because of who might  win or lose, but because of the party system and that his vote, he doesn't feel like his  vote counts as much. This is even though I think Brannou personally has donated $30,000 to the DNC  and $5,000 to President Obama's campaign. Did you think that this was weird that Brannou  posted to his Google Plus page after trying to change our election system here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, personally, I was like, woohoo, right on. I mean, I think the real point is that it's really  come down to just a handful of states, right? The so-called battleground states,  which is what he was talking about. And it's like, you know what, if you live in a solid red or a  solid blue state, you may as well do something different because your vote's not going to matter  as much. And he picked on Alaska, I think, for some reason, just maybe because of the population  difference. But he was saying, I think, that his vote counted one 90th as much as an Alaskan vote.  So I thought that was pretty interesting. But I think that his sentiment was right on. I mean,  it would be nice to have more diversity in politics in the United States. So I'm just curious,  too, though, what you guys thought about him in his position as CEO. I mean, should CEOs be talking  about that kind of stuff? Do you think that was kosher or okay to do? Sure, why not? I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it's kind of in line. Google's always been pretty outspoken about their politics. I thought it was  interesting that he chose to do a Google Plus post. I feel like he has so many other things that  he could do, being the position that he's in, to really kind of make this change. What do you think,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mitch? I think as to the issue of whether it's appropriate, he cares deeply about the subject  he wrote about it. I don't think it probably didn't take up much of his time. I think his  perspective is politically naive, though. George Washington couldn't get rid of political parties  in the US. I don't know why he thinks he should be able to. I don't think getting rid of political  parties is necessarily a good thing, although I do agree we need more diversity of them and more  diversity of opinion. And there are also sound reasons why we have this weird,  disproportional voting system. It basically keeps candidates, it forces candidates to  focus on a lot of states and not just stick at the population centers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Well, it was interesting. How did you guys keep track of the election yesterday? Were you  watching cable news? Were you online? Were you on Twitter? Were you on Facebook? Did you have a  preferred channel to get your news and figure out what was going to happen? I was using Twitter and

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  basically all the social networks. Why was it work? Because it was just easier to like switch  back and forth, getting some work done and then, oh yeah, let me see what's going on. Okay, fine.  But then later on in the afternoon, like around dinnertime, we just turned on the TV because  we're eating dinner. It's easy. So we did kind of all of the above.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was looking at Twitter, 538.com on the Times, Huffington Post Map. That said, it all went by  really fast if you're on the West Coast. You're working, you're working, you're working, you know  nothing's really going to happen until 8 p.m. local time. Then like, it seems like two hours

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  later it was all over. Yeah, it's true. It was kind of fast. It was kind of amazing that Obama  basically accepted his victory on Twitter before he did his acceptance speech. And he had one of  the most retweeted tweets of all time beating out Justin Bieber. I think it was like 500,000 retweets.  It was just a pretty simple tweet. He just said four more years and it was a picture of him and  Michelle Obama. I thought that was pretty amazing that this campaign, this election really happened  so much on Twitter. Twitter was going, my tweets.coms were going by so fast I could barely keep up with

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  them. I think one thing that's interesting is I think the news we've seen over the last 10 days  has really vindicated a lot of Twitter's media embedding. I mean you saw so many striking pictures  of the hurricane last week and then that picture of Michelle Obama and Barack Obama hugging each  other was also very striking and moving. And that's just right there in the Twitter stream. You don't  have to link out to it. It's a very small difference but I think it's a powerful one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Twitter stayed up. Yeah. Which was impressive and happy making. But yeah,  all things dear, Anna Story saying Twitter kills the great white fail well  finally. I don't know what they're doing with all their bandwidth today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah right. Do you guys think TV has gotten worse at covering breaking news

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  since social media has come on the scene? Well I know I can tell you I hate it when they get there.  Now we're going to bring on our social media expert. What's Twitter saying? And I think I  was watching ABC and they had Katie Couric on and she was doing the social scene. And it's just like  really I know that. I can see. I've got to, it's right here. I just don't understand why they all  feel like they have to do that. I mean is that really drawing in an audience for them when they  do that? I don't know. It's like why can't people just look at their smartphone or look at their

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  laptop that's in front of them? It's annoying. Where I was going with this is that Twitter seems  to be ideally suited for these little breaking news events which usually tend to have little  bursts of information coming out every few minutes or every hour or so. TV seems obligated to fill the  dead time with blah blah blah blah blah. You know let's go talk to a hurricane victim and find out  how he feels about his house blowing down. Oh he's unhappy. Twitter is better. You know you can keep  it going out of the corner of your eye. If something's happening you can focus in. If  something's not happening you can play a game or do some work. Yeah I completely agree. I mean and

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think we've talked about it before. Certainly Gina, you and Jeff and Leo have on this show is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that Twitter is basically the new news ticker right? It really is. I mean I was watching  ABC last night but I was getting tweets. Hey NBC called this state and then I would switch the  channel to see what they were saying. Hey things are imploding over at Fox News so I switched over  there to see what was going on. So I was actually getting I felt like I was getting information from  Twitter faster than that breaking news sound would happen you know on TV. Be like oh they're calling  Ohio and then it would be like breaking news right on the TV. So it was like a couple of seconds in  advance I felt like I was getting information just watching Twitter more than anything. Twitter  particularly not Facebook as much. I was checking Facebook and I actually didn't spend a whole  lot of time on Google+. Did you guys spend time on Google plus last night during the election?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not really. I did a little bit but it was more just to see what the people I'm following were  saying. It wasn't like to get it wasn't the same thing as Twitter like just to see what's going on.  It was more like oh what I wonder what people are saying like you know I wonder if anybody was stuck  in one of those long lines I heard about or something like that. So it was really more truly  to my sphere of influence or my the people that I follow just to see what their experience was like  more than it was trying to get a measurement of what's going on with the election.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right right well I'm sure that we're all really election weary. I had to talk about it a little  bit since we're the day after here but we can we can dive into some more specific Google news.  The Guardian posted an article earlier in the week kind of a panicked article about how Google is  prepping their Maps app for iOS and it's going to be ready at the end of the year but that there's  doubts about whether or not Apple will approve it at all. Basically saying that you know Apple  might just stonewall them completely and not approve this app and you know a couple other  people responded and said hey you know the default feeling of all iOS developers is that their app  might not get approved and there's no way that Apple is going to block this app. What do you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  guys think about the Google Maps app on iOS? Well they've got to come out with it. I mean the  the iPhone the iPhone Maps app itself the native app doesn't really work very well at all.  Just trying it out locally here it didn't know a couple of really big hotels in the area when I  was poking around at it and as far as Apple blocking it I mean whoever wrote that article  lost sight of the fact that Tim Cook himself in his apology to Apple customers directed them

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to use Google Maps. Right but Apple released this new section in the App Store it's called like  find maps for your iPhone kind of to offset the criticism about Apple Maps and it lists a few  different mapping apps but no mapping apps that actually interact with the Google API.  So this Guardian article was saying you know that why you know why they're clearly not featuring  anything that has to do with Google they're trying to disconnect themselves from Google  but you know we've kind of seen this with YouTube and with Google Voice.  They may be slow to approve the Google Maps app but it seems like that they'll approve it eventually  if Google finishes it. Yeah I agree and as long as they're not interfering with the OS I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that's the big and they're obviously not displaying porn or anything right. So I mean I think that  there's a few things the keys that from what I've heard is are the big ticket things that they look  for. I don't see anything wrong with having the app in the marketplace. The interesting thing for  me is what if this was turned on its head right. This wouldn't be an issue if iPhone maps had been  around for years and years and people were using them in the Google marketplace and the same thing  wouldn't be true like there would be no worry about this right as long as the very basic things are  met in the for the Google Play Store. Right because the Google Play Store doesn't have that  Google Play Store doesn't have pre-approvals you mean. Yeah exactly it's so much more open it's so  much easier to get your app in the marketplace. It would just be really easy to do but because  the way Apple handles their app store no matter what you think about it there I agree that there

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  will be some delays in getting it approved. Yeah and I mean I feel like as an iOS developer you  kind of go into it knowing that you're taking you know by developing for the iOS platform you're  taking the risk that Apple's going to take issue with something in your app or isn't going to  approve it for whatever reason and the reasons sort of change and they're sometimes pretty opaque  but it's you know for Google you know should Google put together put use resources and put  them toward issuing a Google Maps app. I mean I think that they should but it's a big risk and  it sounds like Google and Apple are in constant communication about this kind of thing and you  know Apple blocked Google Voice for a long time and then the FTC launched it in inquiry and then  suddenly it was approved and the Google Search app which has the voice capability similar to Siri  also just got approved. Yeah actually John Gruber wrote a post saying that that was curious timing  it was right after Force Force all left Apple that the voice the Google Voice Search app got  approved and that had been held in the queue for a while so I don't know if there's anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  scandalous going on there. Yeah I mean channeling the missing spirit of Jeff Jarvis here  Google wants Apple wants I'm sorry Google wants signals so how people are using a map  to be able to get the Maps app on the iPhone will then be signals of where people are using  the iPhone that go back to Google when they use the Google Maps app so of course Google is going  to try to get its Maps app on the iPhone. I don't see how they cannot. And then who wants it there

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  but does Apple want to allow it? That's really the question. But don't you think it's in Apple's best

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  interest? I mean they want people to buy their phone right and there's been so much news over  the map kerfuffle. Don't you think that would be a good reason for them to approve it right away  to just kind of quell that? I mean I know they had the apology and stuff but I think this is really  a big deal for consumers when they're look when they hear stories about something that's as  commonplace now at least on the Android platform as as Maps and navigation not working on the iPhone.  Well I'm not going to buy an iPhone then I'm going to buy an Android device so it seems like it's in  their best interest. Now of course that's all speculation but it seems like the the theory here  the logic of this is that it would be in their best interest to allow Google to get their app  on the phone as quickly as possible even though they will be losing signal they still have happy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  consumers. Right right. Go ahead. That is a really interesting line you've raised.  So to be honest, Apple basically decided that controlling this key application was more  important than the short-term loss in customer satisfaction. They felt that every phone to be  successful needs a reliable mapping app and that put them in beholden to Google so they felt like  it was more important to them to be not beholden to Google and put their own app on it. So that  would be an argument against them approving the Google Maps app. However this all happened when  Scott Forstall was running software and Scott Forstall is gone so I wonder if we would see any  different line of thought happening now. Ultimately I think it would be crazy of Apple to reject the  Google Maps app but candidly I think it was crazy of them to replace it in the first place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah I mean it's in their best interest to make that built-in Apple Maps work really well.  Right. I mean it's up to and I think that they launched it thinking that it was going to work  really well and then it didn't. But that whole and I agree that Tim Cook's apologies specifically  directing consumers to go to maps.google.com and Safari and add a shortcut to your home screen.  That's kind of weak sauce. I mean it's not the same as a native app but that felt like okay you  know concession. However if you go to this section of the app store right now find maps your iPhone.  Well I mean Google Maps doesn't exist right now. The official Google Maps app doesn't exist right  now but that Guardian article pointed out that no mapping app that uses the Google Maps APIs are  listed there as of writing of that article anyway. So that's a little surprising to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah yeah it could be that Apple just didn't feel like any of those apps were as great as the other  apps that it put in there. It could just be a coincidence. I don't know. Right I mean I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  when YouTube came off of iOS they also is a similar thing. They created a you know video section of the  app store and didn't include Google's YouTube app. But then you know there were some articles  written about it and then suddenly it appeared. So this you know this might change. You know how  Apple works. It's kind of no explanation just things change.  Never explain I think is their corporate corporate motto. Google went offline for a bit yesterday  for 30 minutes. I actually missed this. I'm not really sure how. I must have been with the baby.  I guess there was a limited outage. It was limited so I might not have been in the one of the users  for about 27 minutes. And the folks at Cloudflare wrote a blog post about what exactly happened.  Aaron I don't know how much networking you do at Oracle. Is this is this in your in your wheelhouse?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is a little bit. I do cover cloud but it's more from a storage perspective. I saw this on  Google Plus as well but I didn't have time to dig into it again. I wasn't affected. So I haven't  seen the news specifically who was affected by this. I mean obviously somebody was affected  because it wasn't or else it wouldn't become a news story. But there was I did see something on  Google Plus this morning about Google going down. I mean it could just could have been a back bone  going down. It could have been something that took down a couple sections of server farms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know that there was a hardware outage at some point around the along the routing that  messed up the routing and was sending packets through Indonesia from California. That shouldn't  have been. And the folks at Cloudflare I guess did some sniffing around on the network and  got in touch with the the routing the company responsible doing the routing and help fix it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it's not a big concern. I mean yes it's an outage. These things shouldn't happen but  but they they they sometimes do. It sounds like human error at some point got involved here.  So you know that is always going to be a problem. But it sounds like they they they recognize the  problem right away and they and they fixed it. I mean 27 minutes or whatever it is 20 minutes worth  of worth of time for this problem. Actually that's that's pretty good to to actually be  able to analyze the problem and determine a resolution and then implement the resolution  to the problem. That's actually pretty quick. So it sounds like they had some things in place.  They were able to flip some switches you know correct a routing table or something and then  that fixed it. So that's that's actually pretty good. Yeah it is pretty good. Google Voice had

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  a similar problem earlier in the week where you'd send an SMS from Google Voice and it looked like  it came from a number that was not your number and it was confusing some folks. I'm also I'm a  pretty heavy Google Voice user. I didn't have this problem. I think it may have had something to do  with some some hardware issues having to do with Sandy. But that got resolved pretty quickly as  well. The Verge did a quick piece on it. It's really not how often things break. It's how  quickly they get fixed right. Right. Because things will break. Yep. I'm continually amazed

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  by how much of the internet still to this day runs on personal relationships among engineers  and handshakes. So true. You know people people run into each other in an engineering conference.  They're just like hey you're a cool guy. I'm a cool guy. Let's network. And that's it. And billions of  dollars rely on this. And I really live in fear of the day that the grownups come into the room and  want more grown up relationships because there'll be lots of lawyers involved and nothing will work

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  as well anymore. It's so true. There was a there was a piece in the Times about it was a shopping  site Next Tag that got demoted and Google search results and they were just having a really hard  time and couldn't you know were losing tons of traffic and losing tons of money. And it turned  out that one engineer knew another engineer at Google and was able to get some clue as to what  was going on. But it's one of those things where it's like you know not everyone has those connections.  It's it really does come down sometimes to just relationships and who knows who.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And yeah. And that Next Tag piece I mean is there anything really new there. It just seems  like these businesses occasionally pop up that have been enjoying a windfall based on great  Google search traffic and then lost it. Right. And then Google feels that they were. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then they feel like they were slighted or that they're at the mercy of Google for you know for  their business. There isn't really much new here. There's actually a quote in here from Matt Cutson  if he jumps on the show later on we can we can ask him about it. But yeah I mean it's that it's  the same story where small businesses are saying hey we're totally at the mercy of this giant  search engine and this giant search engine is favoring their own products. And you know it's  something we talked about on the show a bunch of times. Yeah I mean I think the lesson here is not

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that Google is being somehow unfair. But the lesson is rather if your entire business model  depends on getting Google search results you've got a broken business model. Right. Right. Well

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  but if you know if your website a content site especially and you're depending upon advertising  it's you know page views are getting customer not even if you're depending upon advertising  we are depending on customers to come in and purchase something from your website like your  customers have to find you. I don't know how what else. Well I know that I oftentimes when I'm doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  a search online an Amazon link will pop up not as an ad but as a search result. Sometimes it's an ad  sometimes it's an ad too and I click on it sometimes. But if it's a search result or it  comes up in a in a link from from someplace else you know I mean having that there and it's key to  something specific that I'm interested in actually is a benefit to me. And I can imagine that if  Amazons all of Amazon's stuff suddenly dropped out of the search results that would be a pretty big  impact to their business. So I think there are companies out there that have a legitimate  business model but also rely you know and you can argue how much does Amazon rely on search results  but I think that there are companies out there that do rely on that and that they're big enough  and they're all online. And so any type of outage like that is a pretty big concern for them. And if  if that's the case they've got people working on it and they know how to escalate either within  Google or whatever to be able to fix the algorithms and hopefully fix whatever the problem is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah search search results are clearly very important but does Amazon get those search  results because um does am is Amazon successful because it gets those search results or does it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  get those search results because it is successful? Right a little bit of a chicken in the egg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right and Amazon's a tough example right because Amazon is so big I mean people go to Amazon to  search for things when they want to shop you know because they're just such a well-known name you  know but when you're this you know when you're a small shopping website or a small content website  Mitch and I know about content well we all three of us know about content and getting  traffic to your content you know you're a much much bigger disadvantage. True yeah I mean I've

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  been through it I've been through the mill you know I've seen I've seen I've worked on sites  that got a lot of Google juice and I've worked on sites that didn't get much and I've worked on  sites that did both at different times. I've I've I've I've coasted from not coasted but I've enjoyed  for months and months a lot of Google traffic and then seen it all kind of dry up and not really  know why in the conclusion I came to you can't rely on Google for your business you've got to  connect your customers a lot of other ways and then Google will hopefully follow. Right through

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  connections and and other ways. Yeah yeah. I mean to Google's credit Google does offer a lot of  webmaster tools for kind of troubleshooting and figuring out you know what's going on with my  site are there are there bad and down links and and that kind of thing and this in this case with  Next Tag they or was it Next Tag or it was another it was another site in this near time story.  Turned out that they had kind of duplicate information on pages so the Google bot it looked  as if the site was kind of spamming or planting content that it wasn't actually displaying so it  looked malicious and that's why it got demoted. So they were able to move that content and adjust  it and it showed up again. But I think they were only able to figure that out by talking to someone  at Google because they had someone who had a relationship with someone at Google.  Google.  What else what speaking of Google speaking of promoting your content social social channels.  Nice transition. It took me a second. That's awesome. I need to go a little  little smoother. Leo would have been a little smoother. I'm not complaining. The uh-uh pause  and then the uh-uh so forgive me folks it's my first time hosting. I thought it was great. I thought  it was great. Yeah. Speaking of promoting your content through social channels Mitch you are  pretty active on Google plus and you did a post on Google plus recently. This is a couple days ago  about how you love the community there but you're sort of frustrated by the platform.  How do you think Google's doing with the their their their social play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well I I have read the same articles that everyone else has read and seen the same studies showing  Google plus is a ghost town and then I go on Google plus and I get a lot of activity on all  my posts and always see a lot of interesting things going on. So there are pretty lively  bunch of ghosts over there. I consistently get better engagement there than I do on Twitter  and on Facebook. That said the platform itself just drives me crazy.  You can't get anything into there automatically so I can't just set up an automated feed to  post in my internet evolution stuff and then not have to do that manually anymore.  You can't get anything out of there automatically unless you use crazy third-party  patchwork duct tape and safety pin together tools to get your stuff from Google plus to  Facebook and Twitter. You can't there's just a lot of things you can't do that you're used to  doing on a mature blogging or social media platform. Particularly frustrating to me is  that Google has blogger. Right. So maybe maybe they could do something to sort of join them  together while still keeping them separate for people who want the separation and then people  like me would be happy and everyone would be happy. Moreover I don't feel like I've seen a  major feature upgrade in the group for Google plus in a long long time and I'm kind of wondering if  Google has basically abandoned that sharing portion of it the part that you see when you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  go to plus dot google dot com. Right. Yeah. I mean it does feel like especially the API  issue of like you know the ability to have clients that write to Google plus.  It seems like this is the most obvious thing that that Google plus needs and I keep waiting for  the announcement for that and it just hasn't happened and I actually haven't seen very many  updates to Google plus in a while product wise. It's true. We saw kind of a flurry of them in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  beginning and not so much now. And then there's always all these little kind of tiny little move  the button from one side of the page to the other updates but right nothing like you can do this

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  big thing. Yeah. Last time it seemed like the biggest one was the ability to just to do the  slider thing on your news feed news feed and in your circles you know you could do the slider  thing and then decrease the amount of notifications that you get at the same time  via email and text message and things. I seem like that was the last big one. And we talked about  this this morning actually on Floss Weekly a little bit because we had some folks in the chat room  that was basically saying does anybody still use Google plus. And I'm like yes me. Hello.  Like that's where I live. I live on Google plus. Is that your primary yeah. Yeah.  Platform. That's great. And it's exactly the reason reason that Mitch was saying which  it's interaction. I can interact with people I can have discussions if something comes up  and it's really hot and I want to I want to get feedback I can start a hangout and get live  feedback. Last time I did that I had like 20 people or I wasn't 20 it was whatever the maximum was  joined like almost immediately. Some of them I don't know what they were doing but it was like  they just clicked the button and some of them had no idea what I was talking about. But a couple of  them were you know people that follow me and they're like yeah we want to talk about this  thing that you're doing on Android or whatever it was. So I cannot get that on Facebook. I can't  get it on Twitter. I do push all my stuff out from Google plus. It automatically goes to Twitter  and Facebook. And the one trend I am seeing is that people that are typically on Facebook or  Twitter are now starting to click through a lot more like they're not afraid of it. I guess they're  not concerned about it or whatever the reason was that they weren't clicking through before.  Now they'll come across something they're interested in. They'll actually click through.  They may still leave a comment on Facebook instead of Google plus because they don't have an account  or whatever. But they are at least clicking through to get the information that I'm trying to  put out there. So that seems like a positive trend. But I agree. I hope that when Google  finally does come up with an API an open API that people can actually use. I think that what I said  this morning was this kind of plateau that they've hit. I think you'll see that trend line start to  go up pretty quickly at that point because there'll be more ways to interact with Google plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. And someone brought up in the chat room that Google really hasn't been promoting  Google plus itself as much. They promote hangouts a lot, but not like plus.google.com as your kind  of newsfeed. So Aaron, you write on Google plus and then you push the links to those posts,  the permalinks to those posts to Facebook and Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Exactly. And I basically follow if you've ever seen the easiest way to search for how I do  it is to search for Mike Elgin's the way that he does it because I basically followed what he does  for right now. The one downside is it doesn't post the pictures to Facebook. It doesn't actually  put the pictures in line under the post on Facebook. So that's the one downside. I'm sure  I get a lot more click through rates on Facebook if I had a picture there. But hopefully with the  API that'll change pretty quickly. There's a lack of inline links. Makes me crazy. Sorry, Mitch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep. There's a service called DeliverIt, D-L-V-R dot I-T that I like better than the stuff Mike  Elgin recommends. Mike Elgin's. Yeah. It has its own built in tool to convert your Google plus  stream into an RSS feed and then it'll send stuff all the way out all over the place. It's really

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  a very smooth service. I like it a lot. Yeah, this looks good. It looks like both of you have  more followers on Google plus than you do even on Twitter. I didn't check your Facebook.  I have way more. I have like 10 times more. Yeah. Yeah. Which is pretty interesting for  a newer service. I mean, it could be both of your audiences as well. Yeah. My audience is

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  primarily technical and Google plus is primarily a technical crowd. So. Right. I mean, that's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  thing. It's kind of still like the nerd salon, right? Like I'm not my cousins aren't going to  see anything I see on Google plus, but that's why I like, you know, kind of posting a Facebook,  a link to Google plus. Right. But the limitations that, you know, the one photo, the no inline links  makes me drive me a little crazy. And that's the thing about Google plus. It makes me think like,  well, if I want to write something that I really care about, and then I really want to  annotate with inline links, that kind of thing, I want to do it on my blog and then post

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  a link to it on Google plus. Yep. Which, which is fine. I mean, I think that's perfectly acceptable  for me. It's just always quicker to do it on Google plus because I don't have time to go into  the details, but I think that methodology is actually the way to go, right? Post it on your  blog and then you can push it out to anywhere you want. And if people are interested, they'll click

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  through your blog anyway. Yep. Yep. Chad, what do you think? Should we take a break and do our first,  our first sponsor? That sounds great. Let's. All right, cool. We got a little, little bit for Leo

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  talking to us about stamps.com. Hey twiggers, don't let me interrupt. Well, actually let me  interrupt just briefly to talk a little bit about stamps.com. I don't have to tell you about stamps.com  you know, I'm a big fan. We use stamps.com here at the office. We've got two accounts because we  wanted two of those USB scales. It saves you so much time and money when you're doing a lot of  mailing.

And if you're doing international mail, you'll love stamps.com because it'll fill out all the  forms just as you need. It's great too, if you're doing express or priority mail, because with a  click of a mouse, you can send an email to your recipient letting them know your package has been  shipped.

Now back to Jeff, Gina, and the gang.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, from afar, from the pre-recorded land. Should we move into the change log?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely. Here we go. Let's do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No bugging Leo Salah this week. I got chills there.  The change log is a section of the show where we do a rundown of any product updates, minor updates  to Google products across the web just to get them all into one quick segment. We've got a few this  week. Google releases Chrome 23, the last major browser to finally get Do Not Track support.  Do Not Track is probably the biggest feature in Chrome 23. That's when the browser sends a  special header to websites and says, hey, don't use cross site cookies and don't track my movements  across the site. A couple of other updates to Chrome 23. Makes it easy for you to view and  control any website permissions. If you click on a website's page or lock icon next to the address  in the Chrome address bar, you can say don't show me images, don't accept cookies, et cetera.  Chrome 23 should come out through the over the air update automatically if you're running Chrome.  Google Drive got a share to Google Plus option. In the share link, there was already share to  Facebook and share to Twitter. Now you can share your Google Drive documents to Google Plus as well.  Google's search results page also is getting a tweak. I think this is rolling out to all users  in the coming weeks. This was an experiment they're running. Google's tool belt, which normally runs  down the left side of the screen, is getting collapsed into a horizontal nav across the screen.  When you search for a term, you can narrow the results and filter them using the horizontal  search bar. It's kind of a cleaner, nicer looking, nice look. It looks like Chad is doing a demo for  us right there. There's some really cool options there to narrow your results as well. You can do  it by reading level and by sites with images. Yeah, go to click on that search tools button and  you can see those there. And finally, Google Wallet got a little bit of an upgrade. Google Wallet now  stores your credit cards inside the app. So if you go to a website that accepts Google Wallet  requests, you don't have to type in all your credit card information every single time that's stored  there in Google Wallet so you can purchase more quickly and easily. And I haven't had a chance to  quite set this up yet, but it looks like a lot faster. And you can see a demo on, it looks like  1-800flowers.com to check that out. And that's all I got.  We love those bumpers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like that section, you know, because we don't get to talk about some of the,  there's so much to talk about. And sometimes we don't get a chance to talk about, you know,  little stories like that. So I like that. I love it, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's true. Every Google products just get updates every week. And actually, this was a slow week  with the election and Sandy. But every week, I feel like there's just a little something here and  there. So we got to change a lot together. So let's talk about the Google Nexus. It looks like next  week, the Nexus 10 and the Nexus 4 are going to start shipping. We don't have one in studio,  but the reviews are looking pretty positive. And Aaron, you're actually running Android 4.2.  It's 4.2, which is the new flavor of jelly bean, they're calling it, right?  On your Galaxy Nexus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So what I'm running is just the G apps portion. So that includes the new Gmail, the new gallery,  the new camera, which has photosphere, a new clock, a new keyboard. So it's not the full stack.  The backend is still 4.1.2 or whatever it is. But yeah, I did install the 4.2 apps, which  are still, for me, it's a little bit, I've lost my calendar, for example. So that's an issue.  I might have to go back and work on that. And I get a lot of error messages, but it's pretty  fun to check out the apps anyway. And of course, that's only for advanced developers, but it's  pretty interesting to see some of the features, especially photosphere, which is like a panorama

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  mode on steroids, basically. Yeah, it lets you kind of take 360, not just 360. It's kind of like,  yeah, it's 360 shots, right? And then you can upload them to Google Maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. I've got this working. So I can give you kind of an overview of what it looks like.  Let me start up my camera here. So you can see from the, when I'm ready to take a shot,  this is the normal camera view that you get. And you can see as I move it around, it refocuses.  See, there's one of the error messages. It refocuses automatically. And if I change this  to photosphere mode, I'll be diligent about getting rid of those messages. Okay, now you  can see what it does. If I don't do anything, I can move it around and you can see the little  grid on the bottom that changes as I move the phone. And then to start taking the picture,  I just line up that dot with the middle of the phone. It'll take the first picture.  And then as I move the camera, as I start to move the camera, you'll see another dot appear. And  that means I need to line up with that dot. And I can just keep going like this,  taking as many photos as I want for a panorama shot. Now, the other thing that Google said  during the thing when this came out is that they base this technology off of the street view  technology. So the cameras that they use for street view, for example. So there you can see  all my shots that I've taken. I could go on and take more and more and more if I wanted to.  When I'm done, I just click the done button and I'm ready to take another one. Now in the background,  well, this is going on. What it does, and I'll exit out here, you can see in my notifications,  it's rendering the panorama. So now it's going out and stitching those photos together  for me automatically. And that'll disappear as soon as it's done. And then I can actually  open up the gallery and go in the gallery and I'll show you what this looks like.  I've got a couple of these. I did one earlier just in case. So I'll open that one up. So that's what  it looks like after it's all stitched together. It really looks nice and pretty and beautiful.  Jason Howell did one of these from a better one than this inside the Brickhouse. It looks  really good. If I want to from here, I can either edit the photo or I can go to hit the  photosphere button. This will bring up a street view like experience. And so now if I swipe back  and forth, I can actually see kind of like a IMAX experience, right? Very cool. Yeah,  it's really cool. So IMAX without the nausea. Yeah, or with it if I go too fast.  Yeah, so that's photosphere. I think that's one of the best features of Android 4.2 that I've seen.  The gallery is also new, as you can see. They've streamlined some things. There's my kids and some  things from the Exploratorium. So they've updated that. Also, the other thing they updated was the  clock. It may not seem like a lot, but it's a pretty major upgrade. Let me open that up. So  you can see it looks quite a bit different than the old clock. If you're running stock jelly bean  or ice cream sandwich, it looks quite a bit different. And they've added some things here  like a countdown timer as well as a stopwatch. You can just click it and start it. Which, you  know, people... Yeah, exactly. It's all RobotoText, really easy to read. And so I've been using this  for the past few days and it works pretty well. So those are the two big things that I found.  The Gmail stuff, I really haven't found a use for any of that stuff, the improvements that are  supposed to be there. But those two things, I mean those three things really, the photosphere,  the gallery improvements, and the clock are pretty cool. Also, the keyboard has the swipe feature,  which I can't really demo. But it's a little bit more like swipe, the application on Android.  As you move your finger around, it actually can figure out what you're typing.  Can you disable that if you want? I did, I did actually, because it's not working for me.  It's force closing on me. So I actually disable that. I use the Swift, what is it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the Swift keyboard or? SwiftKey. That's it. Did you get user switching in the install that you've got?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I didn't. There's new things coming out all the time though. Like I just saw yesterday,  they added the new unlock screen that someone was able to port over. So there's new things coming  out. They didn't add the new lock screen cards, or whatever they're calling them. That's another  feature of 4.2. I haven't seen that functionality yet, but I know they're working on it. Is it the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  dream? That's the daydream mode when it's charging? Right, exactly. Yep. So they're adding that stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  all the time, but it's just kind of interesting to run. Like I say, right now it's pretty buggy,  and it's really for developers only or advanced Android users. Right, you flashed a new firmware  and downloaded it for the SDA. Exactly. I flashed some new packages and things. And like I said,  I had to really work on it down to the file level, renaming files and everything to try to get it to  work. So it's not for the dangers. Is there any indication when this will come to the Nexus 7?  Not that I've heard. I haven't heard anything, but because it's a Nexus device, you can bet it's  going to get it before other tablets. Right? Yeah. So that's the beauty of running a Nexus  device is that you get those updates sooner. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I'm hoping the Galaxy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nexus will get the official update. Although I have to say, I'm tempted. I don't know. There  are a few forced closes during your demo there, Aaron. So that kind of put me off a little bit,  but otherwise I'm kind of tempted to flash my phone and try it out. Yeah. I'll be honest with

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  you. I mean, the problems that I'm seeing, I'm running Verizon's version of the Galaxy Nexus,  so it could be that their particular ROM that they load on their devices has some things that  I've seen better luck from people that are running either an AT&T version or one that they bought  off the Google website. It seems to work a little bit better for those folks. Right. Right. I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  we have Matt Cutts on the line. Hey there. How are you doing? Hey, Matt. How are you? Hey, Matt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good. Good to see everybody. Yay. Thanks for joining us. Yeah. Sorry, I'm a little late.  Stupid meetings and work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Working in the way of Twig. Whatever. It's not like you got stuff to do over there, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, I love listening to Twig. Even while I'm working out, I'll be lifting weights,  listening to you and Leo. And so I'm always glad to be on the show. Thanks for having me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Thanks for being on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I listen to Twig when I'm at the park. And after I've been on like this for the next couple of  weeks, I forget that I'm not on anymore and start responding. The other people at the park look at

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  me like, huh? So does anybody else do it where you're listening to, you know, a Twig and like  you and Leo and Jeff are talking about something and I'm jogging and I'm like, somebody bring up  section 230D. Come on. Contributory liability. You know, and then Jeff will do it. I'm like, yeah.  And the people walk with their dogs are like, who is this guy? Why is he talking to himself?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe that's just me. I do it all the time. So that's what I like. That's what I like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. That's awesome. Well, for I'm Twig listeners know who Matt is. He's head of  a web spam team at Google. And actually, Matt, you missed it. I was going to put you on the spot.  We talked about that New York Times article that you had about Next Tag that you actually had a  quote in earlier in the show, but I'll let you off the hook. I mean, it's like we talked about that  article really wasn't anything very new. It's kind of like the, you know, the same conversation  about Google's algorithm and search that we've been having for many episodes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and I think it's a fair point that, you know, Google needs to try to figure out how to  scale user support even more, you know, and it is a really tough problem, but we've come up with  different ways to do it, not just Webmaster videos, but we have Webmaster office hours.  So you can show up on Google Plus and there's people at Google who are like, hey, let's talk  about how to make your website better. And so we're always trying to think about how to make things  work well, but you know, there will always be someone who can't quite talk to a Googler or  doesn't get the information they need. So there's always going to be stories that are like, well,  you know, someone wasn't able to get through to Google, unfortunately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, right. It seems like that's the key is making it so that small businesses will feel like  that, you know, they're getting demoted for reasons that they don't understand is just  giving them a way to get in touch. And Google does provide some really great Webmaster tools  and you have, you make your videos and actually I didn't know about the Hangout. So that's really,  that's really cool. I think that's really the key to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we just passed 500 Webmaster videos. If you search for Webmaster video channel  and we've got 9 million views, which, you know, 9 million people wanting to talk about SEO and  search, I would never have predicted that in a million years, but hey, if people are curious,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  power on, you know, I think it was the piano playing cats that you put in those videos that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  really pushed it up the top. So I did make a video where I pretended to be a dinosaur and people  liked that one enough where I'm going to remake that one later. So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nice. So we were just talking about the Nexus 10 and the Nexus 4 shipping next week and Aaron has  installed the new Jelly Bean on his device. So he was just demoing a photosphere for us.  We don't have a 10 or a 4 on hand to actually try ourselves, but the reviews are looking pretty good.  It's funny, it seemed like the Nexus 10 is getting a lot of the attention, but the Nexus 4 looks like  a really neat phone. I want that wireless charging thing. That's really, really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, you know, for like months at Google, whenever somebody releases a Nexus device,  I'm like, I really want the wireless charging, you know, where I can just put it on my car and  it'll just, I don't have to deal with any wires. And then at some point someone was like, Matt,  shut up. We're actually doing that for the next Nexus phone. And I was like, oh, okay, never mind.  Okay, I'll shut up. But yeah, it's like, why would you ever want to deal with even a micro USB or  a Thunderbolt thing? Just put your phone down. And by the way, you can't do this, but I would  love if you could like get audio out as well. That would be fantastic. You just put your phone  somewhere in your car and it doesn't slip around and you could pipe the audio into your car stereo.  I would love that. But, you know, that maybe future generations, we'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I was going to ask, I was going to ask these guys, I'll recuse you, Matt, from this, but so  the holiday season is coming up and a relative really wants a high power tablet. Are you going  to go Nexus 10, iPad or the Surface? Ooh, silence. Uh oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can I go Nexus 7 or is that not an option? I think Nexus 7 is an option.  Yeah, that's what I was going to say. I'm going to go Nexus 7 on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely. Nexus 7 for me too, especially with the new, the higher storage capacity,  as well as the 3G support. I mean, that was kind of, you know, in the announcements that was kind  of skipped over by a lot of people. But to me, that's a really big deal, especially with,  you know, Nexus 7 becoming more popular. People are more interested in it. And I think that adding  those capabilities, I think is a big win. And I think it only costs like 50 bucks more for that  version, which is outstanding. So unless you really need the bigger tablet, I would say,  you know, Nexus 7 for me, in my opinion, is the way to go. Over the iPad Mini as well? Yep. Oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  definitely. Yep. Mitch, where are you at with the iPad versus Android on tablets?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd say that iOS and Android, in general, iOS and Android are pretty equivalent,  both on tablets and the iPhone. It's really come down to a matter of personal preference  and some niche interests, whether a person would want to buy one versus the other.  For me personally, I mean, I've loved my Nexus 7. I was joined at the hip to the iPad.  For two years, and then the day I got my Nexus 7 was the last day I used my iPad.  It's got stuff on. I'm looking at it right now. It's got stuff piled on top of it on my desk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a serving tray. Pretty much. Oh, Mitch, your lunch is ready. Here you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, really. What David Letterman did when they came out with the original iPad is like,  makes a great salsa cutter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have to say the seven inch format is really, really nice. My mom is actually thinking about  a tablet for Christmas and she uses an iPhone right now because we trickled that down from when  I still had an iPhone. It is a challenge, iPad Mini versus Nexus 7. The Nexus 10, I mean,  the resolution is pretty phenomenal. It sort of depends on whether you're a power user or whether  you just want something you can hold in your hand and carry around with you. If you just want  something simple, Nexus 7 is really nice for that form factor size.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was the most surprising thing for me about the Nexus 10 was the resolution. It was like,  whoa. I mean, the specs on it, if you check them out, they are in compared to even  the Retina display. I have to be careful because sometimes I call it the rectal display.  I'm going to have to visualize that the rest of the day.  It's just that it slipped out by mistake a couple of times and I'm like, no, no,  it's not a bad product really. It's a good display. Anyway, but it's very similar to the  Retina display in terms of quality. I mean, that was the most thing that I was impressed about the  Nexus 10 was the quality of the display. It's really amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had a conversation with a friend on Facebook. It was about phones rather than tablets,  but I think the answer applies. He had what was a high-end Android phone and wanted to know whether  to switch to iPhone. We went back and forth on that for a while and I finally said, look,  if you're happy with Android, go with the current high-end Android. Get a Nexus 4 or whatever the  high-end was back then. If you're really in the mood for a new gadget and want to change and fool  around with some stuff, get an iPhone 5. I think that's a good answer for anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree. I agree. I'm really excited that the Nexus line is now kind of filled out.  I've been kind of saying I've had the Nexus 1, I had the G1, I had the Nexus 1. I've been  kind of talking about on the show about how I love having sort of like the official or the  unofficial official Google phone and how you get updates on them faster. You don't get kind of the  crap where you get from the carriers. I'm excited now that the Nexus line has the three sizes.  I feel like it took a long time. We've been waiting for the Nexus answer to the iPad,  the larger size iPad. Although now with the Nexus 7 and the iPad mini, the attention has really  kind of shifted to that smaller form factor, which is really kind of great. I love my Nexus 7 as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's very seldom that Steve Jobs was just plain wrong. You know, not a matter of opinion,  not I disagree with his philosophy, but wrong, wrong, wrong. And this idea that something this  size is something that human beings can't use because we're incapable of going like that. I  mean, what? What was he thinking? There you go. He also warned Barack Obama that Obama was going  to be a one-term president. So this has not been a good week for Steve Jobs posthumous predictions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's funny. That's right. Well, you know, data won the election. It was like Nate Silver  and the Obama campaign's data crunching. Never underestimate the power of data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. As far as the Nexus 4 is concerned, I do have some reservations there, not from a general  user perspective, because I think people will love it if they get that phone. I don't think it's going  to be a problem for anyone. But you know, the non-removable battery, no micro SD slot.  I don't know. I mean, for me, those are things that are important. I definitely missed the micro SD  slot on my Galaxy Nexus that I have now. But at least there I have 32 gigs with the Verizon  versions, right? And I'm already at like 18 gig. So when I think about going to a new Nexus device  that only has 16 gig, and hopefully that'll be improved somewhere down the line, I have to think,  I'm going to have to cut back on my apps and the data that I have on my phone to go to that device.  And there's no option to do anything else, really. Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was going to say, the whole thing with the removable battery in the SD card, that's very  Apple-like. You get the trade off of size and weight. If you've got a removable battery,  your device is bigger and heavier. On my iPhone, the first thing I get is that Mophie juice pack  thing that you can just slide the iPhone right in and it's an extra battery. Now it is a trade

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  off. It's like a hundred dollars more, but... And a huge amount of bulk, right, that you're adding

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to the phone. And weight. So usually I just keep it in my bag until I need it. Right.  That's not Steve Jobs being wrong or previous phones being wrong. That's just a trade off.  Do you want the removable battery and are you willing to pay for the extra weight all the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and the extra bulk to have it? I don't know if you guys talked about this last time, but did you  guys talk about the Verge video? The video that the Verge did with Matthias? No, we didn't.  It was interesting because he said people don't want to have to fiddle around with SD cards. People  don't want to have to fiddle around with batteries. But at the same time, the battery specs on the  Nexus 4 don't seem that great. So if you're going to put out a product that has a limited amount of  battery life, it would be really nice to at least allow people to buy an extra battery and put it  in there. Because that's what I do with even my Galaxy Nexus now is I have two batteries. I keep  one fully charged and then the other one when it runs out, if it runs out in the middle of the day  and I'm working, I just change out the battery. It's no big deal. I think average users can handle

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that. How often do you do that? Your phone runs out in the middle of the day? It depends on what

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm doing. Right. So if I'm playing a game and the screen's on all the time, then yeah, absolutely.  It does. Or if I take a trip and I'm playing music in the car and also the car is searching  for Starbucks Wi-Fi's all over the place as I'm driving down the highway, then yeah, the battery  does run out in the middle of the day. And I'll have to either find someplace to charge it or  hopefully I've got that extra battery. Like when I'm traveling on a plane, that happens all the time.  I'll wake up in the morning, I'll go to meetings. Then I go to the airport, I get on the plane and  by the time I'm on the plane, the battery dies and I'm like, oh, I got to sit here for two hours with  nothing to do, right? Nope. I've got my extra battery, pull it out, pop it in. I'm good to go.  So anyway, that's kind of a deal breaker for me, at least at this point. We'll see when the device  comes out and more people start talking about it, maybe I'll be swayed. Anecdotally in a different

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  device, but I found with the iPhone 4, the battery would last a full day of heavy use right up till  about dinnertime. And then I would have to sort of nurse it to get it to bedtime. And that was why I  had the Mophie. That's just one person's experience, one device. One thing I've noticed though is,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you know, it seems like Google often will do the features first and then once the features are in  good shape, then it'll optimize the battery life. And so it might be the case that 4.2 is so fresh  out of the oven that I wouldn't be surprised if they, you know, put some effort into saying,  because someone had said the Optimus G had slightly better battery life. And to me,  that sort of indicates, and this is just my personal take, I have no inside knowledge,  that maybe Google is, okay, getting Android with the new features and then they'll think  about optimizing to improve the battery life and make it last a little bit longer.  It is tricky because I like to, you know, I've got a Galaxy Nexus where I added an extra battery  that doubled the size. And so it's, I like to do mine large. But one thing that might work out well  for the Nexus 4 is, you know, if you have those inductive charging pads, you know, if it's in the  car, you just put it down on that and then it's charging while you're driving to work. Or, you  know, at work, you could just put it down right beside you on the desk and then it could be also  charging that way. So that might work out pretty well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. And the chat room is also pointing out that since I have a Verizon version,  the LTE radio is actually draining the battery as well as the Wi-Fi issue. So that's a good point.  Well done, chat room. That could be a difference if you're running the GSM version,  your battery life may, you may get a little bit more out of your battery life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Matt, what's the name of that extra battery finger you've got on the back of your Galaxy Nexus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is a good question. Yeah, I get it from CDO.com. It's S-E-I-D-I-O.com. And it's pretty nice. I  think the size of the battery ends up being 3800 mAh or whatever. And they even have a model that  has NFC built in. And so if you want to use your Google Wallet or whatever and still have a battery  that's twice as big, it totally works. You know, a lot of people care about having a really sleek,  slim phone. I would rather have a phone that's like half a pound, you know, that gives me battery  life for eight days or something like that. So I'm in a weird design space. I just, I never want to  run out of my battery on my phone. So I don't mind it being a little bit bigger and I just slip it in

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  my front pocket there. You should get one of those really big, big as your head 1980s phones, like in  Wall Street, just like fill it with battery and modern electronics and it'll be a conversation

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  piece. You could probably get one and just slip it in there and have a huge battery and then you  can have a little micro USB where you could like power your display from your phone or something

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  like that. That would be awesome to have. I want one of those. My battery lasts for three weeks.  And then you can like go up to people and say, look at this, look at, it's a phone. You know,  I can make a call while I'm walking around. It's not attached by a wire to the wall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is so amazing. I have to carry around 20 pounds of batteries, but hey, it's okay.  I'm willing to sacrifice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Speaking of phones, let's take a quick break and hear from Leo telling us about our next sponsor,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ting. This week in Google, Twig brought to you by Ting. I like that. T-W-I-G brought to you by  T-I-N-G. What is Ting? Oh, Ting is no BS mobile service. Simply put, I mean, come on really.  Most mobile carriers are just a pain in the butt. They got you locked in. They got two-year deals,  early termination fees, not Ting. There's no contracts, no early termination fees at Ting.  It's completely contract free. They don't bundle or add ride-along services. So you know what  you're getting. And here's the beauty part. You could specify how many minutes, how much data,  how many text messages you expect to spend in a month, but if you use less, they refund.  The difference. If you use more, you don't pay a penalty. You just pay at the normal rate. So  there's no overage charges, no penalties. You get credits on unused service. There are no add-on  charges either. Listen to what you get with every Ting phone. Voicemail, caller ID, tethering. That's  right. They don't block it. Hotspot. They don't block that either. Three-way calling, call  forwarding, everything part of their basic set. No add-on charges, no mysterious items on your bill.  You just pay for what you use. No more, no less. And every phone on the Ting network is $6 per  phone. So this is great for a family plan or a business. $6 per phone. Plus then the very  affordable service. It's shared among all the phones. I mean, it couldn't really be, it couldn't  be more simple. They've got a great online account tool to let you know exactly what you've spent  and what you're planning to spend. Great no-hold customer support too at 855TingFDW. TingFTW is  their Twitter account too, I think. Anytime between 8 and 8 Eastern. Real personal. Pick up the phone  and I got to tell you, they got the best support. They also have great help, you know, forums and  documentation at help.ting.com. Really, this is the no BS phone service. Put your money where  your phone is. Show the world that you care, that you want good phone service and Ting will do it.  Go to Ting.com right now. Actually, we got a special page for you. twig.ting.com. You'll save  money and their savings calculator will show you just how much. And if you mention Twig, you'll  also save $50 on your first Ting device when you sign up. Actually, that offer code is applied  automatically if you go to twig.ting.com. I love Ting. I know you will too. We got to support these  guys because they're really kind of changing the idea of what mobile phone service really is all  about. twig.ting.com. Now back to you, Jeff and Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's see. Let's keep talking about Android. 75% of the market share in Q3 followed by 14.9 for iOS  and 4.3 for BlackBerry. Those are really big numbers. But only 2.7% of devices are running  jelly beans. So that's not such a great number. So we got a mixed bag here. On one hand, it's like,  oh, you know, this is Android's taking over. On the other, there's that pesky fragmentation problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess it's good that people upgrade their phones every two years.  At some point, people will upgrade their phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is kind of another reason why I'm excited about sort of the Nexus line getting filled out  and maybe getting more popular is that these updates will come out faster. I know that Google  has been working on getting updates out faster. For what it's worth, I just looked at the stats  for my app, which is TodoText, which has only got about 10,000 users. It's kind of a weekend  project for me. So it's not a huge sample, but a lot of nerds use it. And I've actually got 30%  using Android 4.1, which is much higher than 2.7. So it really depends on what perspective  you're looking at it from. You have a GeekFollower audience then.  I do. I do. Yeah. Everyone gets the new Nexus when it comes out or has an old Nexus. So they

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  get the new stuff. I think everybody's update crazy a little bit. I know I am, but I'm kind  of an advanced user. So I picked up my son's whatever he has, an Optimus V or 5 or whatever  it is. I think it is. I can't remember. But I picked it up last night to do something for him.  And the interface was fine. I didn't miss anything. Of course, it's not an advanced phone.  It's kind of a medium phone, not for advanced users probably or someone that's looking for a  four inch display. But I think it's running 2.3 and that's pretty old right now, but it's  still functioned great. There was no problem. And he certainly doesn't complain to me,  occasionally he'll say this app won't run or that app won't run on my phone. A lot of that's just  because of the specs of the phone itself. But he doesn't really complain about the interface  and missing the features that I have on my Galaxy Nexus that much. So I just wonder how much of it  is us pundits saying, we want our updates and how much of it is the general public who's like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  ah, it works fine. Right. My wife uses a seven year old smartphone. It's like ancient. She's  finally upgrading to my old iPhone 4, I think as much to get me to shut up about it as  for any actual desire to use it. She has lived a full life without having the latest dot release

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  of anything. It is a good point. Like, is it more of a PR problem than an actual regular user  problem? Right. I mean, as technologists, you read about the new release and you want the new  release on your device and it's frustrating when you don't get it. And I think Apple has really  touted that iOS device owners get the new stuff basically right away. And this fragmentation  thing, I mean, it's also frustrating for developers as well, especially when you have new features  that you can only take advantage of on some phones and how many different versions do you  have to support. But it's a good point that maybe this really isn't a regular user problem. Maybe  this is just a tech bubble problem for this fragmentation tech bubble and developer problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, I know your family is a lot of civilians as is mine. I mean, when you go back  home, how many of them are running ancient phones and perfectly happy with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, many, many of them. And it's funny because they'll say, what phone should I get? I want  I'm up for an upgrade. What phone should I get? You know, my for me, you know, the answer for me  is like, we'll get the new Nexus. But then I kind of stop and I'm like, well, you know, the reasons  why I'd want the new Nexus is because I want the new Android. I want the fastest thing.  They're not their reasons. They want something that's reasonably priced and that's going to,  you know, do what they needed for it to do. Check email, browse the web, maybe install a few apps.  And, you know, they're not going to, you know, be in a blind rage about the random NASCAR app  or whatever that they cannot install that I'll be in. You know, it's just two totally different  targets. And it's true. Yeah. Most of my family who are using, you know, a couple generations back  or don't have the latest updates and they're absolutely fine with it. So what do you tell them

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  when they say that? When they want that advice? I get a very, very frustrating response, which is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it depends. And then I just ask them questions about like, well, how do you feel about just a  touchscreen? Do you want a full, you know, do you want a keyboard? Like my mom, she wants actual keys  to press, you know, you know, how do you, have you ever used a Mac? Do you know anything about Mac?  You know, to kind of get, get a feel of how they, how they would do in the Mac environment. You know,  do you use, do they use Gmail? Do they use maps? You know, I kind of ask them what they're looking  for and what they, what they want to use. And basically I tell them to get the mid level,  to look at their plan, look at their contract and go to the Verizon store, the AT&T store or whatever

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and kind of get the midway handset. Good answer. By the way, I saw what it was like to live on the  other side of that chasm when we first moved here. I noticed my next, my neighbors across the street  are these fantastic car buffs. They're always out there restoring these old cars and they've got,  I don't even know what they have there. They're just these classic 50 year old cars. So I said,  Ooh, go over and ask them for a mechanic recommendation. Fantastic. They'll know the  best guy to go to. So we go across the street, we ask them, they guys, they say, well, if you want  body work done, there's this one place like two hours away. And there's this other guy who does  brakes, who's the best and he's like an hour away. And they're coming up with six different  people to repair the car. I'm like, I just want one guy 10 minutes away. I can drive the car and  I come out. It doesn't make funny noises anymore. So I'm a civilian. Yeah, that's what people deal

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  with when they ask us about phones. I have to say, it's, it's funny to think about the upgrading  because I think Chrome is a good model for this. I dare you to tell me what version of Chrome any  of you are running right now, because you don't care, right? You just get an update every six  weeks. And if you're on beta, dev or stable or whatever, it's just like, Oh, maybe I read a  blog post and I realize I have a new a few new features, you know, web RTC or whatever. Great.  But in the in the steady state with the low friction of the web, it's just automatic. And  maybe you you close Chrome and you update it and you start it back up again. But I have stopped  noticing what version of Chrome I'm using. And to me, it's kind of like Android is, is kind of stuck  in this world where there's still friction on getting those upgrades. And in an ideal world,  if there were no friction, you might not even notice you just you just notice your computer

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  getting better, you know, your phone getting better. It's the model for how to do updates.  I think I read someplace somewhere where the Chrome update mechanism was the first thing that  the engineers built before anything else. It would just be this program that would auto update, you  know, silently. I actually I think Chrome is the reason why we don't we don't care about,  you know, browser version numbers anymore. And I think that's a good thing. I don't think  regular people should care about version numbers ever again. Yeah, I wonder. I mean, that was the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  thing with Firefox, right? I mean, every time my Firefox updated, I would get a little new window  that would come up telling me, Oh, now you're running Firefox. It was automatic, which is great.  But it would also come up and say, now you're running Firefox, this version. And I was like,  Oh, OK, what is it? How is it different? I don't know. I don't care. So I never I never see that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  on Chrome. It's a good point, Matt. Well, and it's a huge set of actions that were like Firefox  six. You know, like I remember at Lifehacker, we would cover them and it would be this kind of and  it was a wonderful thing because, you know, Mozilla does great work and it was an open source.  And people get really excited about Firefox and a number. But I think the Chrome way really just  makes a lot more sense. I mean, users shouldn't shouldn't have to care. And it's funny to go to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a bookstore and you're like you look at, you know, I was at the beach recently and somebody  had a sticker on their car that's like, I do Photoshop and they say, I do Photoshop Creative  Suite 2, you know, and now they're up to Creative Suite 5 or 6 or something like that. And it's just  like, don't put your version number of the software on a book anymore. You know, just say,  I will teach you Chrome or I will teach you Office or I will teach you Windows. But well,  Windows, you might have to have a version because they are so big as far as updates.  But I mean, it's just for good reasons, for good reasons, right? You want to have stability and  the companies really care about that. But, you know, it's just hilarious to walk into a library  and they have like a book sale and they're trying to sell you, you know, Office 92, you know,  instructional guides or something like that. And that just doesn't seem like the way it'll be in

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  the future. That's a good plug for online documentation and online books, right? I mean,  because then you can just update it and you have all your archives, you know, there are truly  archives if people do want to go back and get that stuff. But, you know, I like that model. It's too  bad Jeff isn't here to talk about it, but I'm sure he would. I like that model of open books. You  know, here's a book, a manual, I updated it. You get the latest version automatically if you've  bought the book. And if you want to go back and read, you know, older versions, you can do that.  And there's no like paper going back and forth and that whole library thing you talked about  doesn't happen. Maybe someday. I know we're getting close to that. Maybe someday we'll

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  be there for sure. So I'm hanging on to my Windows 98 for Dummies book. I'm going to be able to use

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that one day. It'll be a classic. Yeah, like the 50 year old cars. People will be like, whoa,  what install is that, man? We actually we had one. So around Google, we like to test with lots of  different devices. And somebody wanted to see what something looked like on an original iPad.  And so somebody had a loaner and they're like, whatever you do, don't accept software updates.  This is the only original iPad we have. And it's the only version of this OS. And so  don't update the software, please. You know, that's the only way we can test to see how stuff works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So don't click. Oh, don't tap. Okay, just don't tap. Okay.  Exactly. So speaking of Microsoft, I can tell that all of you guys are going to be  really excited about getting Office on Android. No? Yeah. Microsoft Office for iPhone, iPad and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Android are coming out early 2013. Is it like read only or something? Or maybe just read only

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and light editing? Looking at the verge story here, and it looks like yeah, Office Office Mobile  debut in the form of free apps that allow Android and iOS users to view Microsoft Office  documents on the move. So yes, it does appear to be to be read only in it. And it looks like  it's coming to iOS first. We'll see if Apple approves it before it gets uploaded to the Play Store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, Office Office is the corporate standard. So it's going to be, you know,  if they can get a full version or nearly full version on tablets, that'll be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think Leo brought this up a couple of episodes ago and they were just sort of crickets. That's  why I was joking about us all being excited about it. Sorry, Microsoft.  You're giving Microsoft a tough, tough time today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, you know, at least at least they're doing it right. I mean, they could just they could just  up they could say no, if you want to run Office, and you want to have 100% Office compatibility,  you've got to run Windows and that's it. You know, so I give them kudos for at least doing it right,  because I can use I can use Google Docs for most things most work most even if they're done in  Office formats, I can pretty much open them and read them in Google Docs. But I'm sure there's  there are a few little features that you can't get to work right. So so we'll see. I mean, I give  them I'm not a big Microsoft fan, but I give them kudos for at least embracing the platform and  trying to get it out there on a platform, as we said earlier, that now has 75% market share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it was it's interesting to see how you know, they had Internet Explorer for Macintosh,  and they sort of decided not to do that, right? They sort of backed off. And so you've got Windows  and you've got Office. And it's interesting to see different parts of Microsoft now responding  differently to these sorts of platforms. So you know, it's, it's something you might not have seen  a few years ago. So you know, it is neat to see Microsoft sort of asking themselves, what do we  need to do to be most responsive and help people on a lot of different platforms, and they'll make  a search application that's available on Android, and they'll make a Bing application that's available  on iOS. And I think that's a good thing, because then people have a lot of different choices,  and they can decide what works well for them on any platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely. Have you guys you know, I should have included this in the in the chain log,  but have you guys seen Google now and it has a pedometer built into it now? I haven't actually  seen this card. This is interesting because I use the Fitbit. So I like to keep track of  how far I've walked. It looks like this card only shows up in Google now every, every month.  Last night, possibly because the month of October came to close, Google now this is from  Droid Life, started showing a new card to a number of our readers. The new card is a pedometer that's  been tracking their steps and miles biked, miles biked as well over the last couple of months,  behind the scenes. I say behind the scenes because this is a card that we've yet to see or hear  about. I took a look quickly through Google now settings could not find this feature mentioned.  I haven't seen this either. Have you seen this Aaron? No, I haven't seen it. I was just trying

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  to pull up my cards and I don't have it in there. I did read that article though. I thought it was  pretty interesting. I mean, why not? I mean, that's a I think we're going to see a lot of  these new uses right for for cards coming out over the next over the next year or so. I mean,  that would be something that's really interesting to know. Everyone carries, well, not everyone.  Most people carry their phone around. My wife leaves her behind, her's behind all the time,  but most people carry their phone in their pocket while they're, you know, working,  going from place to place. Why not have a pedometer function built in? And a lot of people  are really interested in that. I mean, like you said, the Fitbit is very popular. So and I think  you can get a similar functionality with Google. I forget what they call it. Google tracks or my

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  tracks. Oh yeah, there's that app on Android that yeah, I think it's my tracks. Yeah, but it doesn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  do it automatically. I mean, you got to start the app and say, okay, I'm walking now and all that  kind of stuff. So I think something that does it automatically is really interesting. And anything  that helps people be more health conscious, I think is great. Yep. Mitch, you're a walker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do you use? And you got a Fitbit, but then you returned it, right?  Do we lose Mitch? We may have. Yeah, briefly one second. Sorry. No, no, that's okay, Chad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nope. So Gina, are you a Fitbit user? Because if so, we need to be Fitbit buddies. I'm a huge

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Fitbit guy. I am, except, you know, I just, I just had a kid a couple of weeks ago. My Fitbit,  my Fitbit steps like took this awful dive. So I'm in this, I'm in this terrible, shameful place  with Fitbit. But yeah, we, we have to be friends because it really motivates me to get the email  at the end of the week about which one of my friends have, have recently kicked my butt in terms

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  of steps. It's kind of funny. I've gotten, I've gotten about three different people at Google  hooked on it. I'm in my secret plan. Don't tell anybody. I don't know why I'm saying this on Twig  is to try to get enough people hooked that we can like get everybody at Google on to Fitbit.  They actually have a perk where they will give you a pedometer for free because it's like a really  great way to just get into shape a little bit more. But there's such a trend toward everything  going into your cell phone, right? You've got a pedometer, you've got your keys, you've got your  wallet, you've got a pen and paper. All of that has sort of, or could eventually migrate into your  wallet or into your phone rather. And the sooner the better, as far as I'm concerned. Yeah, it makes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  a lot of sense, right? It's just one less device. I mean, that's the other thing with the Fitbit now,  especially with the baby is like I get up and down during the night and like remembering to  turn it on and hit start and stop. I mean, of course I'm not going to have my phone, you know,  I don't necessarily grab my phone until I've kind of gotten up and had my tea in the morning, but  still it's a good enough. And this is the thing about the Fitbit I had to sort of accept is that  it wasn't perfectly accurate all the time, but as long as it's consistent, I was fine with that.  And I feel like, you know, with the phone doing that in the background passively without me having  to clip a thing to me or wear a bracelet all the time, that's a good thing. Yeah. I had problems

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  with the Fitbit. I ended up sending it back. It wasn't accurate enough for me at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're a serious walker. You're like, you're an accurate kind of like you did actual tests with

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the Fitbit. Yeah, I was like, I like, I like went on Google maps to find the nearest football field  to me. And then I drove over there and then I got out of the car and I paced it out to see how the  Fitbit was doing. Really, really way, way getting way in deep into OCD territory.  I finally, I finally just shipped it back because it was just so far off.  I think the breaking point was when I left it on my desk for a day and it measured 500 steps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I read your blog post about this. And when you said that, that disturbed me. I was like, uh-oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  wait a second. It was a bad accelerometer or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Could have been just a bum unit. Every once in a while, I think about trying another one just  to see if it'll, if I have better luck. And there's, there's so many different,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got the one with the fuel band, there was the jawbone there for a while. But I have stuck with  the Fitbit, but I'm interested to see what Google now does with that data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Matt was saying, Matt was saying something about wallet. Did you say something about wallet,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Matt? Well, yeah, just the fact that, you know, wallet seems to be going into your phone.  Wallets are pretty handy and Google wallets pretty handy. Why do you ask?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I just was, I was just wondering because there is some news this week about Google  wallet or at least some rumors going on, right? Yes. Go ahead, GD, you take it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Fair to comment, Mr. Matt Cutts. I enjoy reading the external

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  coverage and I know nothing about any of these things. But, you know, it's definitely the sort  of thing where once I read about it, I'm like, wow, that sounds cool. I wonder if that's going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  happen. Can we ask you to show us the contents of your wallet? Do you have anything interesting in

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  there that we could want to talk about? That might not be a good idea right now.  Even my Google wallet might not be the good idea. But, you know,  in general, the philosophy is, you know, Google wallet should make things as easy as possible  to check out online on your phone, wherever you are. And, you know, why on earth do you want an  extra pair of stuff, you know, in your back pocket when you could use something that's more secure  and tied with a password or with your phone or with a pen or something like that? So a lot of  people, I think, sort of saw the first version of Google wallet and concluded, oh, this is what  Google wallet is. But I think Google definitely thinks hard about how to make all kinds of payment  easier and they're going to keep working on that. I think the argument for mobile payments for the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  consumer really is not there yet. Because, you know, carrying a wallet and paying with credit card

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  or cash really isn't tough. It's kind of annoying. I mean, all right, let's be first word problems.  I'm sorry, everybody is suffering from Sandy right now. I'm going to complain about paying.  Yeah, I know. But it's kind of a pain. I mean, no, you get your hand dirty with the cash. You  got to count it out. You got to give the credit card. You get the dirty pen that everybody else  in the restaurant has had. The waitress has to go back and forth. Isn't it so much easier? Just

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  wave your phone. I don't see it that way. I see it like figuring out how to use the wallet. And  especially, especially in the early, especially in the early times when this is going to be adopted,  people aren't going to know how to use it. It's going to be available in some stores and not others.  You'll always be able to use that cash or credit card. I think the way it's going to get adopted  is the merchants will start picking it up first because they'll have advantages in being able to  tie it in for customer tracking and for loyalty programs better. And then at that point,  they'll offer discounts and incentives for consumers to use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it really is about ubiquity, right? And so I think that's one of the reasons if you didn't  pick it up before, we're alluding to the rumors about Google coming out with a physical card  for Google Wallet. But I just wanted to make, before we got too far, I wanted to make sure that  everybody knew what we were talking about. But I think that's why this is happening,  because it is difficult to get, there's a lot of competition in this space. It's pretty difficult  to get new readers into stores once they've made, especially the big stores, like supermarkets. Can  you imagine going in and saying, oh, I know you've gone with this provider, but why not go with this  provider and you can get a few users that come in every day and use their phone.  So I think that it's a difficult sell. And I think that this kind of bridge the gaps,  bridges the gap. Sorry, I've got my plural and singular all messed up there,  between where we're at today and where we could be a couple of years from now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and it's fun to think about how good it could be 10 years from now. You think about  something like Square, and one thing they do pretty well is they try to re-imagine what would  purchasing look like. You wouldn't have to have a card or anything. You could just walk in and say,  hey, I'm Bob, I already ordered this latte, and then you pick it up off the counter and you walk  out. If you're an introvert, you don't have to deal with anybody. One thing that I thought was  also interesting is they announced a mobile version of Google Wallet, because the stat that they give  was that 97% of mobile shoppers often abandon their shopping carts. And if you've tried to  buy something tapping in on the keys of the phone, you know that it's really, really frustrating.  And so, if people want to buy something on their phone, I was walking in to work this morning and  I was buying some chocolate bars on my phone using the Amazon app. But it ought to be that  simple to buy whatever you want, wherever you are, with whatever device you have or don't have,  just sort of make it a lot easier for you. Yeah, Matt, I think you've outlined the path

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to acceptance. I mean, one thing you see consistently with emerging technology is it's  never... At first, it's always crappy at doing what the mainstream technology is good at,  but it can do something else that the mainstream technology can't. And then,  after everybody's got it to do the new thing, then it gets better at doing the mainstream thing.  So, you start out with the kind of mobile payments that you described that you really  can't do now with a credit card and cash. And then, after everybody's gotten used to that and  really wanting that, the last thing that's going to happen is the local pizza place will get it so  you can buy your pizza with the mobile charge card when you walk in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the notion that your waiter can take your card and just swipe it and steal money from you or do  identity theft, there have to be better ways to protect security and your financial data.  It just seems like I would rather trust a company that does a really good job of securing data  rather than trusting 40 mom and pops, many of whom might leave their credit cards unencrypted  without realizing it or expose their database up on the web. So, there's some of those side benefits

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  as well. Yeah, I will say that that was one of the good things that at least I've noticed from  a Google Wallet perspective because I got my phone replaced that had a bad USB port. So,  I had to have it replaced. And when I got the new one and I went into the Google Wallet website,  it said, oh, you haven't logged into Google Wallet with this old device for quite a while.  And there was an option just to disable it. And so, I just clicked disable and it said the next  time somebody tries to log in with Google Wallet, everything will be shut down and it won't work  anymore. And so, that's a pretty good feature to have that because otherwise, it's similar.  Like you got to call a credit card company and you got to have those features. It was just nice  to see that that feature was there, I guess, in the Google Wallet software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. So, we have the mobile upgrade, which you talked about and changed a lot earlier,  where you store a different credit cards in your Google Wallet account so you can pay in the mobile  site. We've got this rumor that Matt can't confirm about a plastic Google Wallet card,  which would work just like a credit card, but would map back to all your other credit cards.  So, imagine you have three credit cards, you add them to this rumored Google Wallet card,  and so now you can use any one of them. That would be convenient. And then there's that,  the other piece, which launched a while back, and in fact, my co-host on the other show I do,  Kevin Purdy, he walked into a Burger King in Buffalo, New York with his Nexus and he  wanted to pay by tapping NFC, pay with Google Wallet at the cashier. And it didn't go so well.  He tapped it and it didn't work. And then he said to the guy, hey, I'm trying to pay this way.  And the teenager behind the counter was like, oh, was that supposed to work?  You know, so it's, you know, this is a kind of slow rough transition, but I like,  it looks as if Google Wallet is trying to come at it from lots of, you know, from a few different  approaches and get folks just kind of used to it. You know, just get kind of get used to the ideas  like, oh, this is, you know, this is an easy way to pay and oh, there's that logo that I know and  I can use it here. I really think that paying with cash or credit card is a pain in the butt.  And I look forward to being able to pay this way electronically. You know, I went into the  Apple store and like scanned an item with my phone and paid through my Apple ID, you know,  right there on the spot. It knew I was in an Apple store because my phone's location. And I just  walked out of the store without having to talk to anyone. And it felt like, oh, this is clearly how

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  this should work. How do they manage shoplifting for a situation like that? Yeah, that's a good

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  question. I mean, I think, I think theoretically, the person that's standing at the door could have  asked to see my phone for the receipt. But they didn't. So yeah, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know either. NFC in itself is a very interesting technology. I was in San Francisco.  And I promise to make this short because I know we're running short on time. But I was in San  Francisco and parking meters now have NFC chips built in. And I guess either the parking meter  I was using didn't work with Google Wallet. I don't know what it was. It wasn't picking anything up.  I must have looked very, very silly standing next to the parking meter, holding my phone like  different positions around the parking meter, like nothing's happening. You know, I'm sure people  were like snickering and laughing at me. But but I was like, you know what, that would work so much  better because I was trying to use an app and I had to punch in all those numbers to tell it which  meter I was next to, which is handy. But wouldn't it be nicer if I could just hold up my phone and  be like, yep, I want to park there. Thank you very much. So I think I think this is going to,  I think this is going to broaden out. I think this is going to get bigger and bigger over the coming  years. You could have told people it was performance art.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's good. It seems like what you often see is, you know, this stuff seems weird or silly or  non-functional right up until the point where where suddenly it takes off all of a sudden,  like for a long time, mobile at Google was half of one software engineer's time because back then it  was WAP or WML wireless markup language. And like, it was such a crappy experience that nobody used  it. And so the usage was zero. And so it really wasn't worth even a single engineer's time.  And then all of a sudden you see some of these trends coming together where it's like, oh,  let's go ahead and invest and get ready for what's going to happen. And I think one of the things  that I've discovered at Google is if you want to know whether a team is going to succeed,  two things to look at are number one, how fast they can iterate because they can experiment and  try things and adapt. And number two, how often they keep rolling things out and looking for  new ways to introduce new functionality. And one thing that gives me a lot of heart is you've seen  so much stuff happening with Google Wallet recently that you can tell there's a dedicated  group of engineers trying to think, okay, how are we going to make payments better,  whether it's on the web or mobile or in the browser or whatever. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  cool. So I think we should take our final break. After we get back from the break,  we'll do our tips, tools and tips, I guess, numbers, whatever you guys want to share the  week when we get back. But Leo's got a message for us from Squarespace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Our tips and tools. I just want to make sure. Are there any other stories that we didn't cover that  you guys want to address before we go? Matt, did you have anything from the Googleplex?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm curious whether you guys did any quarterbacking of the elections and the coverage or any of the  tools or, you know, there was that good story on time that talked about how the Obama campaign  actually did a lot of data crunching. You know, the sorts of things like if I want to reach  women in this age and this demographic, instead of just buying local news ads or 60 minutes,  they would find the demographics that matched the most with very cheap sort of arbitrage-y kind of  ad time. And so they could get the biggest bang for their buck in terms of money. And, you know,  it's amazing to see how much of an impact big data can have on everything, but not just startups,  not just technology, even politics and campaigns and elections.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was a really good story. I absolutely love that. I love that this was such a data-driven  campaign. And they said that basically no decision was made on hunches or because it was what had  been done before. Everything was based in numbers and had hard data behind it and that the campaign  had really gotten their databases together since 2008. This is a very Google-y way to approach it.  Right. I mean, you know, everything being sort of very data-driven. That was a really good piece.  And we'll add that to the show notes.  Aaron, Mitch, you got any stories or should we move straight into our tips and tools?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kind of hilarious, actually. It's the fifth anniversary of Android this week,  fifth anniversary. And there's a story from Engadget in 2007 talking about how Symbian,  Nokia and Microsoft say that Android basically won't go anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, Android is five years old today? This week? That's amazing. Wow. Time flies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Nokia says we don't see this as a threat, which basically is why Nokia isn't doing that  great. Microsoft said, it really sounds like they're getting a whole bunch of people together to  build a phone. And that's something we've been doing for five years and we've already got five  guys using it. So, no, they didn't say that last part. So, I'm still only about 99% convinced it's  not a hoax because this is too much of a perfect story. Well, you should read Apple's comments at  the bottom. I love that part. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Apple says we have a great relationship with  Google and this doesn't change anything. They are certainly an important partner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. And they are certainly an important partner for the iPhone.  That's pretty funny. Oh, time machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep. Yeah, that's weird. Re-examine your assumptions every five years or so just to make sure you

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  are asking the right questions. I mean, it just goes to show with any new technology,  you never know, right? I mean, I think there was not just their competitors, but I think a lot of  pundits and things weren't sure either. I wasn't sure I was rooting for it, but I wasn't sure it  was going to succeed. And boy, it certainly has though. So that's great. Well, and when

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Chrome launched, a lot of people said, well, what do we need with another open source browser? We've  already got one. But it's been a pretty good voice for trying to make sure that the web is open. And  that's kind of nice. But not to say we haven't had our products that have shut off and have not

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  succeeded. We certainly have. Chrome really was one of those blockbuster things. And I remember  in Chrome launch, I'm thinking like, but we have Firefox. Why do we need this? And yeah, Google did  prove us wrong. But yeah, there have been some bodies along the road.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Some spaghetti didn't stick to the wall. Yeah. There was a story that maps was an afterthought  in the iPhone. It was like a day or two before the announcement. They were like, should we put maps  in? Yeah, sure. Why not? What the heck? And now it's become an essential feature of smartphones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yep. And contentious app as well. Yeah. And that was even before navigation, right? I mean,  that was before you could do navigation on the phone. So right. Right. Aaron, what's your last

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  pick for our story today? Got anything? Are we good? No, I think we're good. I mean, there's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  bunch of legal stuff that we could have talked about. I'm not sure that we have time to go into  all that or need to go into all that. And we already mentioned the Twitter thing with the  election, which was really great that they didn't crash. So congratulations to Twitter.  Rest in peace, Failwell. Right. Let's hope so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right. Let's go into our tips of the week. Matt, why don't you kick us off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely. So I have a search of the week. Last night I was watching the election and it was really  funny to see how everybody before the election, a lot of people were dissing Nate Silver and then  right afterwards they're like, oh, he actually nailed every single state. And so I did a tweet  that said, Hey, Nate Silver facts, you know, just like Chuck Norris facts. And it kind of caught on.  So if you do a search on Twitter for hashtag Nate Silver facts, be prepared to lose an hour or so  things like Nate Silver can recite pie backwards. Nate Silver does not breathe air. He just  periodically samples the atmosphere. And one of my favorites, Nate Silver is permanently banned from

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  buying lottery tickets. Nice. I had no idea that you started this, Matt. This is very funny. He did  turn out to be the geek hero of the election, didn't he? He really did. Yeah. I really like the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Obama style poster with math on the bottom. Nate Silver's picture in an Obama style, you know,  but on the bottom it says math instead of hope. Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mitch, what's your what's your tip this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's tool actually, it's we were talking earlier about Microsoft Office, it is the corporate  standard for and if you're a professional writer like I am, one of the features you want to see  with Microsoft Word is version tracking and comments. So you can see what changes have been  made. These have not been available to my knowledge on mobile platforms. I've been really,  really hard to find, but then I found a really nice app called Textmaker Mobile for Android,  costs eight bucks. And you can see when people have made changes to documents and see comments  in documents, most of the people listening to this are probably saying, yeah, yeah, yeah,  who cares? But a few people are going, wait, that's really great. What's that again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nice. Nice.  That's Textmaker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Textmaker Mobile. Yeah, it's eight bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Eight bucks, but worth it. Yeah.  Yeah. Aaron, how about you? Was the was the photo share was your was your Android demo,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  your tool for the week? Yeah, that was the tool for the week. You know, I could come up with another  one though, if you put me on the spot, which is call app. We'll see if chat how quickly Chad can  get that up in the Play Store call app, which is an application that overlays your contacts. It's  like a kind of a replacement for your contacts. And what it does is it goes out and it searches  social media to pull in things like LinkedIn information or Facebook information. I remember  a couple versions ago in Android, there was a Facebook thing that you could link to your  Facebook contacts. And this is kind of like that on steroids. So when someone calls, you'll get a  picture of them, you'll actually see what they've been doing lately, who they work for. Even if  they're not in your contacts, it'll go out and try to search very quickly to get some information.  So by the time you pick up the phone, you kind of know who it is. And, and you know, who they work  for maybe or what your relationship is to them, if any. So it's pretty cool. It's called call app.  And I know that there's other apps out there on the market like this, but I happened to see this  one this week and it seems like a pretty cool app. They've got a lot of features. They've got, you  know, there's a lot of things you can do with it beyond just beyond just contacts. So you can  actually, you know, quickly go to someone's Twitter feed right away from the app, instead of having  to go out of the app to go to, you know, open up Twitter and go to Twitter. You can actually just  go to their Twitter feed right from the app or whatever you want. So of course you do have to  put in your information, your login information for the various sites, whatever you want to connect  with, whether it's Facebook or LinkedIn or Twitter or whatever. But it's a pretty cool app. I posted  about it earlier on Google Plus earlier this week and a few people tried it out. One person reported  that there might be a problem with the photos, your the photo sensor, or proximity sensor on  some phones. So it sounds like there's still maybe a few little bugs and quirks, but it's a pretty  interesting app. So I'd encourage people to go check it out if they want to get more information  about people that they're interacting with on their phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Very cool. Very cool. Yeah, it looks like a really good app. My tip this week is courtesy  of Google operating system. There's a it's a Gmail trick. Actually, there's an experimental labs  feature, which is new to me at launch late last year, but it's new to me called smart labels that  automatically labels email coming in for bulk mail notifications, promotions,  forum updates. And Google operating system was saying that they've got this new smart label called  social updates. So they're like, you know, the email that comes in there, like notifications from  LinkedIn or Facebook or other social sites, it will automatically label if you enable this  experimental labs feature, which you can do in Gmail settings, they'll automatically label these  kind of social updates as such social updates. And then if you click on that label in your Gmail  inbox, you can say automatically archive these. So if you're sick of your email inbox getting just  filled up with social updates, you know, we're front of question, LinkedIn or Facebook or whatever,  you want to have them, you just don't want to see them in your inbox, you can enable this smart,  this this labs feature, which is smart labels. And then you can say send all these that get this label  to to the archive, don't show them to me in the inbox, and I'll reduce a lot of the noise in your  inbox. So thanks for Google operating system for that one. Yeah, very cool. And I think I think  that's it. Thank you so much to all of you for for being on the show today. Matt cuts, who's our  friend, head of the web spam team at Google. Thanks for being with us, Matt. And and Mitch Wagner,  editor in chief of internet evolution.com. Thanks, Mitch, and Aaron Newcomb, sitting in studio,  working at Oracle. I'm the warm body, doing the source.  You're the like the Skype safety net, like if it all went wrong, at least we'd have Aaron.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're still in the studio. That's right. That's right. It was great to be here. And what a great  panel. You guys were great today. So I feel privileged and honored to be on the same panel

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  as you folks. I'm not Leo Laporte. I'm Gina Trapani. As you can tell, it's my first time hosting.  Thank you everyone for bearing with me while I while I did that. And thanks to our awesome  panel for getting together today. It's really good show. Great. Thanks for having me. Tons of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And great job, Gina. You did perfectly well. Yes. I think it's a little more practice,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  but I appreciate you saying that. Thank you. I would have never known this. That was your

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  first time. So great job. Yeah, really smoothly. Thank you.
