Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ant Pruitt's in studio with me. His Clemson Tigers are all set to play for the ACC Championship.  Yes, 12 and 0, baby. Wow, that's even better than the 49ers. Who are the 49ers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You mean University of Charlotte? Yeah, them. Yeah, them. Oh, yeah, them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And is of course also in studio at Twig host for FOP, which stands for  Focus on Photography. That's correct. And HOP, which stands for Hands on Photography. HOP's the  short one. That's correct. Focus the Round Table. That's right. Also with us from the airport.  I love this. Stacey Higginbotham, you're pulling a Jarvis. I am. Although I'm in a really nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  lounge. It does look nice. The Alaska Engate Lounge at Seattle. Phenom. It has a fireplace.  It's kind of like the fancy lounge in Copenhagen. Wow. Very nice. For those of you guys who are

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  lounge literate. Well, and of course, no one is more lounge literate than our own Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I know them all. I have privilege. All the medallions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All the medallions. Professor of Journalism at CUNY. I guess we got to start with the big  change in leadership at Google and Alphabet. I guess Google's not going to change, but Alphabet  is. Larry and Sergey in their annual letter announced yesterday that they're leaving. And  they're going to let Sundar Pichai, who's done such a good job with Google over the last few years,  take over as Alphabet's CEO. I have to say, I loved in the recode, I loved, who was it,  your former colleagues post saying, I don't think it's going to make any difference at all. Larry

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  and Sergey have been so dialed out. Exactly. That's what I was going to say. What's the big  point of this story? I know that they're the top two of Google from the very beginning.  21 years ago. But at the same time, what exactly have they done for the last,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  let's say five years to where- Well, they invested in a lot of stuff that may get killed now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sergey for sure has not been very involved. Larry has been having a good time. Larry has a whole  floor at the Googleplex. In fact, he was named in some of these Andy Rubin stories and some of  the stories about the failure of Google Plus and so forth as being kind of instrumental in some of  this stuff. So I think he has hands on. Is his voice still gone? Is it back? He couldn't speak

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  for a while. Well, no, he did then speak at an I.O. where we were both that he'd come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Remember that crazy talk. It came back to an extent. Yeah. But I just wonder if one of the  reasons we don't hear as much about him is because he's not a public. I think he hated

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  the public guy. Right. So a lot of the operational stuff, you still think they had their fingerprints

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  on it? Sergey, no. I don't think so. Right. I don't think either of them really did. I know  he had a floor and he was probably doing visionary. This was all about the visionary moonshot stuff.  He was really crazy that area. But I think it's been Sundar driving the big ship for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, Google for sure and Ruth Porat, the alphabet CFO has definitely had a hand in

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  making a lean mean company. I also wonder what the relationship is between her and Sundar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a good question. I'd imagine it's I bet they're pretty I would think they'd be pretty  in line because otherwise you wouldn't one of them would be gone by now. Correct me. Good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Correct me if I'm wrong, but Sundar Pichai seems like a get along guy. He seems like a very easy  going guy. I remember the only time I've ever had any dealings with him is when he was still at  in charge of Chrome OS and the first C48 Chrome laptop came out. He and I had a long talk  where I was just saying, why would anybody want this? This is crazy. He was instead of getting mad  and defending it, I thought he was very calm and level headed and gave me some very cogent  arguments about why they thought it was a good idea. Now he's laughing at you. He turned out  he was completely right. So I don't think he seems like the kind of guy who has any edge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's not imperial. I've met Sundar before and he is a delightful. So I've met both him. I've met  Andy. Andy was very standoffish isn't the right word, but if you were not someone he thought he  should talk to, he did not necessarily talk to you. Sundar is a very warm human in person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's my experience as well. I have to point out that Larry and Sergei still have a majority  of stock. They have 85% of the 51%. If Sundar does something they don't like or the board does  something they don't like, they are not ceding that kind of control. I think they own 17% of

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  the actual stock, but they have 85% of the vote. So with that said, is anything going to change then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's kind of I guess the question. That's why I think what's in alphabet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think we'll see the continuing closure of things that aren't working.  But I think it's going to be pretty much business as usual. Maybe a little less hands-on and coddling  of the employees. I think this might be a nice cultural and psychological break for the company.  Didn't they cut back on the number of meetings and that sort of thing?  Yeah, so this could be a change in leadership signifying a change in overall culture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, okay. It also comes at a very uncomfortable time for Google. They're under a microscope from  Congress. They have employees who are unhappy. There are a lot of negatives right now at Google.  I don't know if Larry and Sergei are the type who don't engage in battles like that, but  it doesn't seem like a coincidence that they're leaving. This is Peter Kafka's  piece at Recode. He says, if you don't spend much time thinking about Google, this will sound like  a big deal. On the other hand, it's very hard to say this will be meaningful for Google employees  or anyone in the world who uses Google products because Page hasn't been focused on Google's core  search advertising business for a very long time. He managed a portfolio of what the company calls  other bets. And by the way, I think this is what's going to end up being at risk. Businesses like  Calico and Waymo. And I wonder if once Larry's protection is gone, if it's gone, it may not be  gone, but if it's gone, if Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai might say, well, you know,  would we be a stronger company if we stuck to our knitting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So let's list them here. I think Google has to find out what it's knitting. It's in the middle of  trying to figure out what its knitting is going to be as search, which is totally still relevant,  but is going to become less relevant over time. Now that we embed computing in more places,  if we look at the future of computing, Google and Google is figuring out where it wants to be  in that world is what it needs to do. And I don't think Larry was helping on the other  bets. I think he was looking more at what's fun for him and what's interesting from his perspective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I'd like to get your perspective on. So I just put up a list of the other bets.  I'd be curious just to just do a quick tour of them and see what your thoughts are.  You mentioned X is just the Bell Labs of Google. I think they're going to keep that because it's  fun. Waymo, let's start there. I do think that there's still tops in that field.  There's not a clear business there at all yet. But it's such a tiny, tiny field though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, potentially huge. If all automobiles are self-driving in five or 10 or even 15 years,  that's the next big thing for Google. Here's what Elon Musk has said though,  and I'm not sure he's wrong on this one. He says there's no such thing as a self-driving  company. You have to make the cars and make the software because the data that you get from making  the cars informs the software. It's a virtuous cycle and you can't do one without the other.  Musk is of the opinion, of course he's got a car company, that self-driving vehicles are to come  from car companies, not from companies like Apple and Google. The only reason I remember this is  this also comes up in the context of Apple. Can they really be a software self-drive? Don't  they have to make a car? Is Google going to manufacture a car? Are they going to come along  and partner with a car manufacturer like Ford? They are partnering with car manufacturers. Don't  they have a deal with Chrysler? Yeah, but is that the same thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. I think car companies want to outsource this aspect of their innovation. Google's happy to be  that partner for them. I would not discount the advantage that Google has from its other  machine learning efforts and its ways and other properties. Yes, I think there is definite data  coming in off the car, but they can get that through their existing partnerships.  I second Stacey. I know why Elon is saying that because he's got this giant car company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't think he's out of line saying it. It's a proper competitor thing to say, but I don't think

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  he's proven right about it. Steve Jobs always said that too, if you want to make great hardware,  you've got to make the software. There is something to be said for controlling the entire chain.  I think if Chrysler and Google try something, but it's head to head with Audi, VW Audi,  where they're doing the full stack, they may have a disadvantage. I don't know. You're right.  I wouldn't cut Waymo. They're not going to sell it. You can't. I wouldn't cut it. I think it  still has value. All right. Loon. Yes, cut it. Loon is their high flying internet,  which was originally balloons. I don't know what they're using now, but they actually just did two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They just announced some sort of deal in, I think it was Portugal or Brazil.  Someplace that speaks Portuguese. It was the Amazon actually. Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, Florida. I'm going to tell you, that's not a big revenue generator. I don't know how many  people there are in the Amazon, but I think it's more a price. Well, when you get to Africa,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  yeah, then you got some. You get to parts of India, you can get real scale there and get  people on. So I don't vote. I say, hold on. I say dump it. I say it doesn't really matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's probably not a huge cost. No, you can't do that. If I'm analyzing it, I would say it's  probably not a cost center or a huge cost thing for them. And I mean, all of these are basically,  hey, do you cost more to operate than the future? Like, I also want to see your strategic vision,  Stacey. So you're a root for that. The internet is very important for Google. So based on that,  if it doesn't cost a lot to do Loon and you get some good publicity wins, plus you're learning,  you've got a nice field for bringing internet to hard places. I think it's a good bet. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  how much it costs to do Loon, but according to their results from the last quarter, they spent  more than $1.3 billion a quarter on other bets like Loon and Waymo. That's all the bets. Ant,  what are you voting on Loon? That's $1.3 billion a quarter, more than $5 billion a year. You're  going to be looking hard at these other bets, especially with that Larry Page protection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We have a board meeting going on. I want to hear the vote from Ant.  I say let it go. Yeah, but we're tied. So Karsten, you get to break the tie.  Mr. Vice President. Loon, Loon, Loon, Loon you keep. All right, Wing Aviation. I didn't even know  they had this. This is their drone play, right? Yes. In Canberra, Australia and Helsinki, Finland.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We are missing a critical piece of information, which is how much they spend on these, how much

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  they lose on them. Yeah, this is what I'm like. I think they keep it because it's a good reason  to do research bet and drones are going to be a big deal. I know they're keeping everything right

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  now for me, but so what? All right, gentlemen, you got to write the $1.3 billion check, Stacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just saying I'm on it. I don't think they're going to be the delivery business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's lounge living. She must have money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  McConaughey Power. What is McConaughey Power? I didn't know they had this one either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It attempts to harness renewable energy from wind by using propellers on airborne kites. Oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  this is the kite one. They started this years ago. Okay, keep Loon. Kill this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We didn't vote on Wing. I said keep it. I said get rid of it. It's probably cheap. Keep it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Get rid of it. This is the worst board of directors ever. We have no experience.  The worst board meeting ever. All right, Verily. This is the life science one. Remember,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they kind of had already had a loss with the contact lenses that they had announced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The surgical robots, retina scan technology. I keep this one. You sell this one, Stacy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I sell it because it's not tied into any of the core businesses. Drones are interesting because  mapping, it's data gathering. It is mostly mapping. I think that's important. I think Loon is  important for internet, but Verily I'm not into. Plus, they just bought Fitbit. They got health  data now. I don't even remember Verily. It was the diabetes detecting contact lens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think, do they have an anti-aging effort too? No, there isn't. Is that under Verily? There is a  big anti-aging like, but this was also Larry Page never wanting to die. What's that? What's that?  You got a dog. You got some skin in that game. Yeah, I do. Is it Loon Me by Pampers? Yes.  What? Is that the diaper that senses? Yes. That's a connected diaper. A connected diaper. Does it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  analyze the poop? That's data. No, it just lets you know when the poop is there. By the way,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that is the future. There is poop. Poop analyzing toilets is definitely the future of medicine.  Verbs, surgical. This might not be the one, but they definitely had a Larry doesn't want to die

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  project. Yeah, you can kill that one too. You can't kill it. That's the problem. It's going to live

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  forever. All right. This is a good one. Sidewalk lab. Can't keep it for sure. That's all about

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  their business. They're getting in trouble in Toronto from it. They're getting bad PR. I agree.  I'd kill it. What? Kill it. But this is what you- I'd kill it. No. This fits your criterion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it does with the exception of government is always government businesses are tough  and they're going to always incite controversy with the public and with your employee base.  You don't get a lot of money out of them. Google is historically terrible at making user-friendly  products. Government stuff has to be very user-friendly. Look at IBM's like contracts  business. So I'd sell this sucker in a heartbeat. Whoa. Tough. Ruth is tough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I am harsh. We should get Kevin Rose in here because he was at Google Ventures. He might  still be at Google Ventures and he probably has a better idea of what all this stuff costs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. This is tough without a P and L. I'll be honest. All right. Speaking of which,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Capital G and GV are their ventures. They'll keep those. Deep minds. Deep minds. Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Absolutely. This is AI. Yeah. It's not going anywhere. I think you have to, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's the future. Yeah. Definitely the future. Calico, I think that was the keep Larry alive

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  business, wasn't it? Calico is the anti-aging. Yes. I think you could kill that too. Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  that'll get killed because Larry's not- Finally, I'm really interested in this one,  especially Stacey's View Access. What is that? That's their fiber business. Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that had a big impact. It actually lowered fiber costs in places where it went in,  but Google realized it was horrifyingly expensive. I still think, I think with 5G  and new spectrum facility, I think they should keep it because I think they can actually deliver  broadband in more places for less and compete. And it's such an essential part of all of their  businesses that they should keep it and keep researching ways to do it better. I would have

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  assumed with all of the money Google has, it would be the bigger player to help get rural areas more

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  connected. That's the old days. They already decided not to do that. What is dead can never die.  This died already. A couple of years ago, Google basically stopped putting in fiber. Yeah. I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  the only reason- In with BIOS. BIOS isn't expanded anywhere, but I'm still using it right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They keep it because they have a responsibility to existing customers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they also- That hasn't bothered them otherwise.  Yeah. They built their own infrastructure. And I think they're waiting because the technology  changed in the middle. So in the middle of their deployments, they, one, realized their cheap fiber  plans were not working out. But two, we saw 5G coming on the horizon and microwave. So they  own web pass, remember? So I think what they're doing is probably waiting a hot second or five  years and you're going to see them redeploy with a wireless strategy. That's my hunch. That's my

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  hope too. All right. Well, thank you for this episode of Your Ruth Porat. This, by the way,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  just in from the Google fiber press room, they've decided to stop selling the 100 gigabit and only  sell the gig, I mean, the 100 megabit and only sell the gigabit. So this confirms what you were  saying, Stacey, which is that the lower speed plans are money losers. It's 70 bucks a month  and you'll get a gig. I wonder though, if this is a business, I think they've already kind of  decided not to pursue this. But now they're saying they're all in on a gig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Once you've made the infrastructure investment with fiber-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It just runs itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You just cut, well, it's not a little bit. I mean, the big money is in deployment. And so the big  investments in deployment. So keeping it operational makes sense. You might see them. I mean, would you  see them sell to a municipality? I don't think so. I think that-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This was probably cheap. In fact, it might not even be a money loser. They'd probably make their  money back. You know, the money's already sunk. It was the cost of trenching and putting it all in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But if you think about it this way too, now you have these interesting test markets where if they  come up with some kick-ass service, they could actually deploy something really interesting and  then start pushing the carriers to deploy more. So I think it's kind of like a bird in the hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I like your wireless strategy, Stacey. I like that too. I think that 5G and so on. So the  Alphabet homepage is ridiculous. It doesn't list any of these ventures whatsoever. It's only one  page plus an Investors page. And it still has Larry's letter starting Alphabet.  They're a little behind. You remember the URL?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  XYZ?  ABC.XYZ.  ABC.XYZ. I knew they had a cute top one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Where do we classify Google's domain business? Because that is ridiculously silly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Sounds like Google's.  No, I depend upon it. I love it.  It's googly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I guess really we don't know the answers to these questions. Not only because we don't have the P&L.  That never stops us.  Yeah, I know. We're pundits. We're supposed to make up answers.  I'm still going to talk about it.  More importantly, we don't really know what the new Google, and I'm going to  guess there's going to be kind of a new Google, what its priorities will be. What Sundar Pichai  will take, what direction it'll take Alphabet in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here's my guess. I saw a chart. I forget who put it up. Of diversity of revenue.  Google used to be 98% advertising. Now I think it's down to low 80s.  I think diversification of revenue. Amazon is in much better shape for diversified revenue  across the hosting business and advertising now. Google's awfully dependent upon advertising still.  It owns advertising industry. It's not a bad position to be in. Lord knows.  But I think that that's a risky position.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What makes it risky if they own it and they are pretty much the standard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because I think-  IBM owns bank frames.  I went to a thing a few weeks ago with off the record dinner. It was supposed to be with  five brands there and three pundits like me and the host, a company that serves those brands.  I'll be blunt. There was a nihilism to these guys where they didn't really care about quality.  They didn't really care about news. They didn't really care about the things we thought they  might care about a little bit. Just be nice. They were honest. What they do care about is  they have their direct relationships with their customers. They don't need advertising.  I think advertising as a field is going to decline. That's my answer.  That hurts. Lord knows our business immediately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What do you do if you're a startup or you're a young company? You don't have a relationship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're still going to have advertising, but it's going to be on the decline, is all I'm saying.  A different problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You didn't say, but let's say it's Procter & Gamble, established brand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can actually give you an example from Kimberly Clark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Kimberly Clark. Okay, fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are they Pampers or Lubs? I can't remember which diaper is theirs.  What they've started doing is they've created a diaper delivery, like there used to be one.  I can't think of diapers.com. What they're doing is they found the parents, they sell them stuff  directly, they've cut out the middle man, and they love it. They don't have to advertise to  these people. That's their model, not for everything. You're not going to see everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're in an unusually bad market because everybody grows out of Pampers.  They have to get new customers every few years. How do they get those new customers?  They buy mailing lists? They do deals with hospitals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They do deals with websites. They buy websites for pregnant mothers,  which is a marketing cost, but that's that. A lot of the advertising world, and I'm working on this  with media companies with a group, goes directly to commerce. BuzzFeed is just frigging brilliant  at direct commerce. They're not just doing it for their own products, like their tasty stuff. They're  doing other things for other companies. That's a form of advertising you can argue yes, but  the holy grail is you have a direct relationship. I love Stacey's example  because it's also an annuity business for a few years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Her example is good, but I still, like Mr. Lepore, I think about those smaller companies,  the people that are just getting started, the 10-person team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they'll buy direct marketing links. I actually was talking to a small company.  They are a tiny company building their, how do I say this, Switzerland, I think. They are doing a  smart home thing. They're doing the Google targeted ads and retargeting. Retargeting is  their biggest sale. So they've bought basically lists and they're doing the retargeting. But  that's small. In the advertising world, like a company like Kimberly Clark or Procter & Gamble,  they spend, I mean those are the ones you want, right? You don't want the tiny little startups

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  who are buying for pennies. Well, I'll tell you who does want them,  and they're sitting right there in the house built by them, is the Twit Network.  Because you're Casper and you start on Twit and you build up and then, unfortunately and sadly,  you go to TV and spend a bloody fortune. But look at all those companies that built  direct relationships with consumers, Harry's, which I use, all these.  They all move on from us. They move on, but they start in Central.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Once they start up, they get that relationship. They start with you.  There is, you got to have some way to prime the pump, but I think you're probably right.  Once the pump is primed and flowing, you're probably good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  As I said it in what would Google do, I think, or another book, I can't remember which one,  advertising is failure. You fail a lot, but in an ideal, your customers sell you,  people find you on your own, you don't spend anything on marketing. You need to advertise  when that fails. And that's failing less and less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So if you look at the stock market, the stock price for Google, they took Larry and Sergey's  announcement with absolute aplomb. In fact, I guess it went up.  So here's the price. Well, but this is the five-day price, which had tumbled a little bit  in the midweek. Actually, that's a whole year, but let me go back to the five-day.  It had tumbled a little bit midweek on Monday, for some reason it went down and stayed down  until the announcement and then it jumped up. So the stock market likes it, whatever that means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So here's the question. I think people are being emotional about this and silly,  but having said that, a lot of people don't like him. So what would happen to Facebook stock?  Would it go up without Zuckerberg or would it attack people?  Would people say instead, no, the business dynamics are the same?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Even with that share price changing, are the people still considering the fact that they  owned at, what was it, 85% of the 51%? That's true. That's true, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's stabilizing. I think the stock goes way up if Zuckerberg leaves because you could just pile  all the problems onto the departing back of Mark Zuckerberg and say, he's gone.  It was the same thing when Travis Kalanick was forced out at Uber. It didn't fix it in the long  run probably. They still have problems, but a lot of those issues went away when Travis went away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's another part of this, which is who comes in. I think I'm fascinated by Sundar Pichai and  Satya Nadella are top-notch managers. They're next generation, run the company really well,  top-notch managers. Is Cheryl that? Sandberg?  Yeah. She took over the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I would say Sundar is very much a manager. Satya is kind of a quiet visionary.  I don't know if he's surprised me so much, but he's really moved Microsoft very well through  some really rough. Yeah, you have to give him a lot of credit for the last five years for  he's done it with a vision. I don't think they credit him for recognizing.  What's that vision? Well, he's gone all in on the cloud from  license software. Azure has done an amazing job and he's done it while also holding his  customers' hands. In a sense, he's out competed Amazon in a lot of ways just by being the  enterprise-friendly cloud that Amazon couldn't be and then Google's out there with cool stuff.  But he's also managed to deal with all these legacy products and keeping, let's see, he shut  down Windows Phone. Did he shut down Windows Phone? He died in eight weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So yes, he did. He took the write-off on Nokia Overture. He never liked the Nokia acquisition  and I think, yeah, Windows Phone. Satcha basically moved them from a software company to a cloud  company and that was a huge, huge shift. I think he's still doing it. You look at where

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Microsoft is positioning with IoT and services associated with that. I think he's doing  really well. He's doing it in a way that I think is, unfortunately for him, he's not playing the  visionary CEO role and so he's just getting shit done. Who is this? Sundar Pichai or Satcha Nadella?  Satcha Nadella. Well, he is the visionary CEO. That's exactly what he is.  Well, he is, but he doesn't, he's not like- He's like a credit, she's saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think he's doing it- All he ever does when he stands up on a stage in a Microsoft event is  spout vision. Okay. But it does come to life. I think it's pretty clear he's the visionary  behind Microsoft's shift. He was in charge of Azure when he stepped up. I think that, no,  you got to get, no, I don't think you'd give him operational credit as much as visionary credit.  I think operationally he's very strong though. Maybe, maybe. And I think Sundar Pichai  is much stronger operationally than he is as a visionary.  I agree with you on that. But Google doesn't need a visionary. Google just needs to keep,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think really the bottom line- Google needs a visionary. Google needs a visionary. Its core  business is under serious threat and in the next, I would say 20 years, it's going to be gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes. That's what I'm saying. Yes. It's not gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You guys are actually now saying ads are on the decline. You definitely need to rethink things.  Come on. I wouldn't have assumed ads want to decline, but Google's going to be just fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Think about, so think about how you find information today. You, you like voice search,  50% of their search, I think two years ago they said 50% of their searches were voice search,  which means I'm coming in, I'm asking for information from this entity. I'm no longer  seeing in some cases, web results that people are buying. And yes, they're still doing retargeting  on things like that, but people hate it. Ad blockers. I don't know what percentage of their  business comes from AdWords versus the other one. AdSense. AdSense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Retargeting versus buying stuff on Google. I think Google's doing, I actually am more bullish  on Google's search and ads business long-term than that. I don't know how are customers going to  change how they do. Google has so much data. Look at Amazon. In fact, really there's a lot of,  if Amazon's strong, Google's strong. Google has as much data about us as Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a supply and demand issue. It's a supply and, well, A, Amazon has taken away advertising  from Google. They're a new competitor in the market and they're growing. There's plenty of

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  ways you can make money with data that don't necessarily mean display advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But it's advertising nonetheless. B, I think that it's a supply and demand. In this case,  what I'm arguing is the demand is going to decline and prices are going to decline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. People are not going to want to buy ads the same way. They're going to have the direct  relationship with the customers. Think about things like your smart kitchenware. You're going  to have, I'm going to see ads on my grocery list. And if Google's not providing me my grocery list  and my grocery store is, or maybe it's my refrigerator company, those are people who  are going to net those sales. We're going to see a diffusion of where we're getting our information  and it's unclear who's going to own all those platforms and Google has to stay in the game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And also in a market like that, what you do is you get market share by buying other companies  up and rolling them up. With antitrust, they can't possibly do that. They can't buy App Nexus. Well,  of course, App Nexus just got bought. Or Safeway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So here's the one business I would keep as far as Google, which is anything to do with AI.  I think Google is dominant in AI and has an opportunity to become more dominant in AI.  Whatever replaces advertising is going to depend heavily on data and AI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Where's the value there? Is it in the processing power or is it in the data?  I'm kind of one of those Silicon Valley guys which is just build it and you'll figure out where the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  value is. There's value in it. Especially here's where the value is. You've got a lock on it.  And so you're right, Stacey. Why is the customer relationship valuable? Because you keep it to  yourself. So you know, Kimberly Clark knows everything about Pampers users or loves users,  whichever one it is. But I think that doesn't help the ecosystem. And I think that somebody who knows  stuff across product lines is going to be even more valuable. Because after all, you can only  grow to a certain point with existing customer data, with relationships. Ultimately, you have  to beat the other guy. If you're Pampers, you have to beat loves. You have to steal market share from  the competition. How do you do that if your only data point is your relationship with your existing  customers? I think there's a huge amount of revenue opportunity in AI and data information.  That's why Amazon is betting. So we're going to talk about reinvent in a second, but all Amazon

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  talked about was AI. So before, so yes, but I would also say there's an opportunity that you're  missing. It's not just about stealing market share. It's also about making your own operations more  efficient. So if you can make your operations more efficient, lower your cost of goods sold,  then you can make higher margins on the same product. In your market share, sure, you can go  after that, but you might be okay not going after it. And then if you think about using the same  amount of data to reinvest in your product and make it better, you're still going to then gain

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  market share. I would bet that both Coke and Pepsi are really efficient. I would also bet  that they desperately would like to take away one point of market share from the other guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think so they're not so yes, but they're taking it away in new products. And I think that  they're not taking it away. Well, but you need that data. And you need those customer relationships  to understand where the market is going and build those new products where you're going to gain that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Customer relationships are very valuable. I certainly agree with that. This whole company's  built on the relationship with the know-hows period. But I also think it's somewhat limited.  And I think if you're a global corporation, there are a lot of other data points you really would  like that are external from the things that you just know. It would be a big mistake for a company  to focus inward and say, we're just going to be more efficient, super serve our customers.  At least I can't think of a lot of companies that have done that. And I think Amazon's a really good  example. Why is Amazon a juggernaut? Because they spread. Yeah, they branch out on different bases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which is what I'm saying. That's what Google needs to do. So Amazon uses the data it has to launch  new products and build on those. It doesn't launch new products without the data to support it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they don't buy, by the way, Amazon is notorious for buying very little advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. So the Amazons are the future of the world. And I would also say that-  But you can only do that if you have critical mass. Amazon could do that because they buy companies

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and buy more data and expand into other areas. You have to be pretty big to be Amazon data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, what if, yes, but what if you are Google, you have the ability to be that big and you could  also offer those insights. So instead of selling advertising space, what if you sell insights about  customers back to the companies that need those insights? That's what I'm saying is that there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  huge value in ways we may not fully understand yet beyond advertising and what Google already  knows and what Google is getting. Can I ask another question?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I guess we'll just wait for another 10 years to pass before we see all of this happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because none of this is happening soon. And not anybody on this panel is going  to be the next CEO of Google. So thank God. So let me ask another question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes. I don't want this to happen. And I think it would be stupid if it happened. And I think it's  without reason to happen. But if Google were forced to split up, let me emphasize again,  Senator Warren, I think it's the wrong way to go. And I think it's the wrong way to go.  But if it were, and you're, you're soon to are in charge, which way do you, what do you want to,  what do you give up? You sell off YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay. Because that's the first target. That's good. That's good. Yep. Yep. Yep. I like that.  There's a few. Do you sell Android or do you keep Android?  Sell Android. The problem is you're starting to cut off data. And I mean, the whole reason for  Android, the entire reason for Android is data. So you want to careful. You want to be careful  about what you cut off. And he knows better than we do what, what is most valuable in that regard.  But yeah, I think there's things you got a whole lot of double click. The ad stuff is the ads.  You keep the search search can look search. You're right. Search isn't gonna is going to change.  And I think, you know, voice search, you're right. You don't see those display ads, but  you also do get data from search. Oh God, yes. And if Google continues to be the best place to go  to find something there, I think they'll continue to succeed. And you know, that's one reason you  maybe could get rid of Android because you're still going to get all the searches from Android  going through you and iOS by the way. And they spend billions of dollars a year to get Apple to  do that. So I think I, I, I'm pretty bullish on, on Google and I think it could spin off a lot of  stuff and still have a very long-term viable business. It may not be advertising. I guess  that's their whole problem is we've got to figure out what's next. I don't, I think you were right,  Stacey, when you said it's gotta be something already in their sphere. So self-driving cars are,  I think, a little bit far, far afield. They're not in their lane.  But I do think, I think if you look at the strategy that Google and Amazon pursue, it's  to expand their tendrils into data, to get more and more data about users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the only way to go. Well, Amazon just wants to sell you more stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but again, I think, I think there's a, there's a play with the data that's beyond just  selling you stuff. Maybe it is just selling you more stuff. Amazon's using data to build better

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  services. Amazon, think about it as a services company. So they're not, so yes, they make more  money with AWS than they do selling things, right? I don't know if they make more money. They may,  they're higher profit margins. Okay. It's a pretty good idea.  It's a pretty good one. It's a pretty good business.  And it was Google related. Go you guys. I know, I enjoyed that. So somebody,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Google, you gotta give us more major news every week, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And we'll cover you. All right. Let's, it's interesting that you bought up Satya Nadella  because he is the third era for Microsoft, right? It was Gates, then Balmer, then Nadella.  We are now just entering the third era for the younger Google. It's only 21 years old.  It was, I guess you could say it's kind of the third and a half years. It was first Larry and  Sergey first. Then it was Schmidt. Then it was Larry. And now it's Sundar Pichai. I think we all  agree you couldn't pick a better guy to run Alphabet. Yes. I don't know who else is out there,  but Sundar is the obvious choice. He's a good choice. Yeah. Proven.  All right. Let's take a break. When we come back there, I want to get Stacey's take  on re-invent. Amazon every time earlier today, Mary Jo Foley was saying, I pray that Amazon,  because Microsoft's praying to starting to do the same thing, which is you announced 38 new products  every time you open your mouth. She says, this is getting hard. This is getting tough, but I know  Stacey has her finger on the reinvent pulse. So we'll find out what Amazon announced yesterday.  I'm not buying that keyboard. In fact, I haven't even cracked open my deep racer.  I bought it from the. How do I get invited to this? Re-invent would be a good thing to go to.  That'd be a good one to go to. 60,000 people went this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, re-Mars is the one you want to go to. What's that?  Re-invent's boring. It's cloud. Re-Mars is the very fun AI robotics conference.  Oh, I was hoping it was Mars candy. But they don't invite everybody to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no. 60,000 people at re-invent compared to 30,000 at Microsoft Ignite tells you something.  What am I using right now? Everybody says, Leo, what browser do you use? I use Brave. Brave is a  better browser that protects you. It gives you the best experience. And I want you to try it  because Brave is free. It can coexist with whatever browser you're using on any platform.  I use it on windows. I use it on Mac. I use it on Linux. I use it on Android. I use it on iOS.  You will love Brave. It's a next generation browser built by a team focused on the things  you're focused on. If I ask you, what are you looking for in a browser? Performance? Yes.  Privacy? Yes. They're making a better internet for you with privacy by default.  And you get complete control over who has access to your online activity.  And because you're not downloading a bunch of junk, it's six times faster than competitors.  I always like to go to the Brave settings because when you download Brave, go to brave.com slash  twt to do it. Go right into the settings and start looking at things because you'll start to get a  better idea of what Brave can do for you. For instance, the shields, the default shield settings  for all websites. Block most ads but not Brave private ads. And I'll show you how you can sign  up for those. That's controlled in the Brave reward setting. You don't have to see those.  Blocks cross site trackers. I love this. It's HTTPS everywhere. It automatically upgrades  connections to HTTPS. By the way, these are all things that used to have plugins for. I don't  need to. Because it's based on Chromium, you can use all the Chrome plugins, but really I only need  a couple now like LastPass and privacy.com. You want to block scripts? You don't need no script.  You can. I don't because then nothing works. You can block cookies, of course. Device recognition.  That's kind of interesting. I block all device recognition attempts. Why should anybody know  what I'm on? I also disallow Facebook logons, embedded posts, Twitter embedded tweets, LinkedIn  embedded posts. Those are just ways of gathering information about me. And I'm going to show you  choose the search engine you want. Of course you can use Google. I like Startpage. It's all the  Google. It's kind of like the Brave of search engines. It's all the Google without the tracking.  You also have a Brave wallet. You can use Web Torrents. It supports a Hangouts component to  enable screen sharing in the browser. I'm going to show you a couple more things that I really  like in the additional settings of Brave. This is one I would go right to site settings. And here's  where you could do. You know what I hate? You know what I hate? All those sites that say,  can we give you notifications? I just block all of those requests. And then if I've allowed a few  here, I can add or subtract them, but I don't want to get the requests even. You totally control that.  You can say, sites can't use motion sensors. They can't figure out where you're going. I don't do  that on my desktop, but you might want to do it on your mobile device. You can control autoplay.  You know I don't like the autoplay. Who does? Turned off, baby. I can go on and on and on. This  is a browser that's built for you. It gives you settings in every way you want to control this.  Brave Sync is great because all my bookmarks are automatically copied to everywhere I go.  I just think this is the best browser ever. Because it's based on Chromium, it works exactly the way  you expect it to. It looks just like you expect it to. The only difference is you get unmatched speed  online privacy and a better user experience. And by the way, of course, it's absolutely  free. It's easy to get set up. You can automatically import. It's easy to switch back and forth or just  go straight to Brave. I don't find the need to use any other browser, but you still can.  If you're on a laptop or a phone, it will save you battery life and reduce your data costs.  I just think this is the easiest, best browser. Now one thing, and Jeff talks about this a lot,  that a lot of people are concerned with ad blocking that you're taking away revenue from sites you  like. Nowadays a lot of sites will say, hey, you're blocking ads. Of course, you can disable it if you  want, but there's also a way you can opt into Brave ads. These are privacy respecting ads  and you'll get rewarded with BAT tokens, the basic attention tokens. You can then award them on. You  can pay it forward to content creators. It kind of is the best of both worlds. You improve privacy,  you fix the web, but you can also give publishers their fair share of web revenue. I think that's a  really innovative idea created by Brendan Eich, the guy who created JavaScript, co-founder Mozilla,  Firefox, and Brian Bondi. You get private browsing, built-in tour, so you can get extra privacy.  Private browsing on most other browsers isn't really private. It is on Brave. So my suggestion,  go to brave.com slash twit, B-R-A-V-E dot com slash twit and switch to a better browser. Brave.  Yesterday was about big tech, today is about us. Brave. Please use that special URL. I know you're  smart. You can go to brave.com and download it. But if you go to brave.com slash twit that says,  hey, they saw it on Twig. That's good. We want to let them know. Actually, they have had a huge jump.  I was just looking at the download numbers of Brave browser, partly because they went to the  1.0, the finished version. But I think partly because of us. Their numbers have gone through  the roof. People love. Well, once you use it, you tell other people. People love Brave.  Thank you, Brave, for your support. You know what I would kill if I were Google? I'd kill Stadia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Just stop it now. That's not that's silly. No, let's give it time because maybe Stadia is  the same way Pixel 4 was. Everybody's going to rag on it. And you rag on it for two weeks and  three weeks and then fourth week. Oh, it's great now. So did you turn on the always on 90 hertz

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  refresh? You can do that if you want, but it will hurt battery life. I don't see the need for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You don't need it. Yeah, it doesn't make that much of a difference. That's why you get bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  reviews because it's little things like that where people go, well, you don't have 90 hertz  refresh at all times. And they know, like I can tell. Maybe some people can. No, they don't.  Most people can't. So I'm curious what y'all think about these Google workers. Google fired  four employees, the Thanksgiving four, because they were fired right before Thanksgiving.  Google said because they were accessing data of other employees, they were tracking them.  Employees were scared once they found out this was happening. Some of Google's employees actually  moved their asked to move their location because of it. But these four, Lawrence Berland, Paul  Duke, Rebecca, Rebecca Rivers, and Sophie Walden wrote a post on Medium in which they announced  they're gonna, they're gonna sue for wrongful discharge because they say it has nothing to do  with what Google says. It has everything to do with the fact that they are among the group of people  who want Google to adhere to a higher standard. We spoke up and how do they respond? Google didn't  respond by honoring its values or abiding by the law. It responded like a large corporation  more interested in revenue growth than ensuring worker rights and ethical contact. Google fired  us for engaging and protected labor organizing. That is illegal, of course. And so that's why

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  they're suing. What? I don't know what to think here. I'm sure I'll get roasted for this. But again,  Google is a business. And even if this wasn't Google, if this was your local, I don't know,  corner store that has a staff, they would do the same thing if the same type of issues were  popping up. Getting access to data that they shouldn't have access to and sharing it and so  forth. It's, business is business. And if these folks want to sue Google, have at it. You have  that power and I hope it works out for you. I hope the right stuff comes out of it, whether it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google was right or whether the employees were right. I should point out in their Medium post,  the employees wrote, Google spread rumors we were rule breaking troublemakers who leaked  sensitive information. That is flatly untrue. And in the privacy of our meetings with HR and  Google's internal investigations team, the company acknowledged this. So there's some dispute over  the facts. All right, take it to court. Carson, did you want to say something? Your mic's on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sorry about that. No, I just actually, I had Jeff's mic off. Okay, I was

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  he wants to apologize to Jeff for all to hear. Sorry, Jeff. But now that you've heard this,  we've set the stage. What do you think, Jeff? I was just making a smart ass remark. That's all.  Turn his mic off. Turn his mic off. I think these cases are as hard as trying to get involved in  somebody's family squabble and divorce. Yeah. Right. It's, it's, it could be either way. They  could be in fact, being fired for they were organizing, they could be violating the rules  of the company. And as Anne says, you're a company and you enforce the rules. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The NLRB will presumably have discovery of the ability to say, well, Google, let's see the  evidence that you that they did what you claimed. So I think are they working with an established,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  because the rules around labor organizing are really tough. And you're not allowed to shut down  unionization efforts. Right. But you do have to follow a lot of rules about how to contact your  fellow employees and where to do so. And so usually if you're, because this is not an uncommon tactic  that companies use to shut this sort of thing down. So established unions help people who want to  build unions do this the right way. So they don't run a foul of their companies. So, but I don't know  if, I don't know which union is working with Google or, or with the people trying to establish

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  unions at Google. No one denies that Google hired a law firm that is famous for union busting.  That's from the New York Times. Google has to do that. Yeah. They have to do that. Yeah. It's not  illegal. No one's ever tried to unit unitize twit. I don't. But I have to say I wouldn't, I mean,  I'm an after I wouldn't prevent anybody from unionizing and wanted to unionize. But I mean,  that that's not that's not okay. It seems to be that these four are more concerned about Andy  Rubin's payoff about Google's work with CBP about putting somebody on the AI ethics council  from the anti LGBTQ and anti immigrant think tank about developing drone technology for the  department of defense. All of this, this litany of complaints is in the medium post.  Secret project work with the Chinese government on a search engine. That seems to be their chief  concern. I don't even know if they're trying to unionize. I don't, I don't know exactly what

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  we're seeing. When we protect them for this then. Well, that's so they may call it organizing. No,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  actually, wait a minute. We participated in legally protected labor organizing, fighting to improve  workplace conditions for all Google workers. But we also joined together to hold Google accountable  for the impact on our workplace of its businesses, decisions, policies and practices. So they've

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  muddied the waters by combining those two efforts. Yeah, well, the labor stuff is the only stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they're protected. That's right. Yeah. You know, honestly, this is the problem with hiring smart  people. And it's why I only hire stupid people. What? Oh, they're gonna hit me now. Excuse me.  Now they're gonna organize again. No, really, the problem is for Google that you've got PhDs,  you've got engineers, you've got bloody minded independent individualists. Right. And if they're,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  if they're trying to do one of the issues was contractors, right. So it could be that in trying  to reach out to contractors, because they're not protected, then they would be using company  resources to reach out to people because you couldn't find them otherwise, necessarily, you  can only reach them through Google channels. So that should be actually in their favor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have avoided this story for a couple of weeks has been brewing. And Jeff, I avoid it for the  exact reason you say we just don't know. We just don't know. We just don't know. And

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  but it's interesting that, you know, in media now, there's been a rash of unionizations,  mainly because companies are cutting back and times are tough. I don't know how much of a  difference it's going to make, because there's only so much money in the bank in a lot of these  places. But it's happening all over. The other thing I was at an event two weeks ago, where  it's an unconference, and there was a session on the generation. So it was it was boomers versus  millennials versus Gen Z. And it was two millennials and a Gen Z were up running the  session. And I'm, of course, a boomer sitting there holding up the elementary canal, not quitting my  job. So you know, I can't move anywhere. And there was anger. One of the people there said,  people like me, one of the people there upfront said, well, one of the people in the room,  fellow boomer said, Well, I got this great job. Big place when I was 26. And they got angry. And  I said, I mean, it was all friendly, but it was it was frustration. And I said, I was assistant  city under the Chicago Tribune at 21. And he threw the chair. Still a good humor. I turned to the  guy next to me who was a well known guy. And he said, Yeah, I ran the top news show in New York  when I was 26. And they said, How are we not getting these jobs? How is this not happening?  What are you doing? We were in a growing industry, right? People moved around and there were  openings. And we took them. And that's what happened. And now. No, we're sitting in the  elementary canal, man, because I'm not leaving my job. And maybe I should I'm 65. My sister,  by the way, is five years old. She just retired. I'm feeling pretty jealous. By the way, I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  know how you're feeling Leo, old man. I would love to retire. You can. Yeah, yeah. Not yet.  Not not for a long time. The company is you. One of the reasons we got Anton Mica here is so that  we have some but some people that do the shows and continue what I think we started. And I want

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  to make sure it continues. So I think that's part of what even at Google, I think there's a  generational issue happening about the relationship to companies and other generations and kind of an

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  anger bubbling up there. So I don't know. I don't want to sound hypocritical, but I applaud the  employees for wanting to try to make a difference at their workplace. But at the same time, you have  processes and procedures to try to go through and make sure all of that, you know, is on the up and  up and not just some riots, if you will, against your employer. You know, it's go ahead and try to  make a difference at your workplace. It's it's that's good. That's good for morale. But at the  same time, don't try to destroy the company that's feeding your family either. I don't think they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  necessarily trying to destroy it. I do think they're bringing issues to the fore that are  important. And there's only what there's some famous phrase or quote about polite women never  get anywhere. You know, sometimes you have to maybe not destroy, but maybe you do have to be  a little bit more. Yeah, thank you. I knew you would know. So I would say you accusing me of  spouting cliches, Stacey. No, no, I just you're you're you're a professor. Come on. That's that's  your job to quote pithy phrases to the youngs of the world. But yes. So I don't know, I, I see this  in my daughter and I think there is very much a generational anger, frustration, and I think it's  well founded in a lot of ways. There is there is a lot that is not going to happen. And there's a  lot of despair over where she's going to end up. And I think a lot of people who are young,  they realize they have to start their own thing and do their own thing if they want to get anywhere  faster. And I will say, you know, I went into journalism, I graduated college in 2000. So I  went in knowing that I was entering just as the web was becoming a thing. And I will say,  you weren't going to be a print journalist, or were you? I was I was a magazine journalism major.  I interned at Businessweek. I wrote for the Wall Street Journal. I mean, but you also must have  known that the web was coming. I knew it. But at the same time, I did I didn't accept a job at  Businessweek online when I came out of college, because I wanted to work for a print publication.  And this was the year 2000. Right. And I ended up working for a print trade, rather than Businessweek  online. But the point is, I thought by the time I was 41, which is how old I am now, I would have  this cushy kind of features writer at a magazine. I would have earned it. I would have worked my  butt off. But when I got to fortune four years ago, thinking, huh, I made my cush magazine job,  I was still writing three or four posts a day, editing all my colleagues stuff and getting  shat upon by the magazine staff for not being magazine enough. And it was it was very much an  eye opening experience, because there were there were literally two classes of employees.  And so I mean, I wasn't angry, I just quit. But those are it. I get where they're coming from.  It is frustrating, especially because a lot of the people who are standing in your way don't get  what's how people consume media nowadays. They're very stuck on their old world views.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Okay, that's it. I battle with a little bit of both of those sides. I look at my children and  I look at my my oldest boy in particular, the one that's in the army that I've mentioned before,  and just trying to get through to him that it takes work, it takes work, it takes work,  you're not just going to have things handed to you. I don't care if you're just washing dishes  at your local restaurant. If you want to move up to the fry cook, you need to work for it,  you need to earn that. And I struggled with him and his generation just sort of expecting that,  hey, I deserve this stuff, even though I haven't worked for anything, you need to give me this job  or that job or what have you. And then at the same time, I get it from their perspective,  where they see someone like me that's old ish, I'm not old, that has this particular worldview  that it's sort of out of date, if you will. You're just grown up and he's a grown up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I started twit because I didn't want to work for the man anymore. I started late in life,  I think in my 50s when I started maybe late 40s. But I also had been rejected by mainstream media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They were stuck in a rubber suit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes. Having been stuck in a rubber suit. No, actually that was a triumph. Jeff,  what are you talking about? Triumph at rubber suit. Anyway, yeah, I mean, I don't know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  we can't really comment. Were we going to talk about re-invent?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. You know what, let's do this. I'm going to do the change log and an ad and then we'll do  re-invent and we'll give you a whole segment. How about that, Stacey Higginbotham?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't need a segment. I just wanted to be sure if you promised people re-invent that I would be

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  ready for it. Oh, get ready. Get ready. But first it's the Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  One beat, two beats, three beats, four beats, five beats, six beats. He's paying me back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google change log. He's paying me back for reading the wrong ad. I'm getting my payment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Google Photos has a couple of new features you might be interested in. Manual face tagging.  But with a caveat, this is from Android police. Google's giving users way more control over faces  tagged in their photos. I feel like we've always had control. I see the faces. I name them.  Or not. Yeah. You can't select a face in a photo manually. You still will have to wait  until Google sees a face and then you can tag it. But you can tag it in the photo. That's a bit of  a different functionality. Before you had to just go to people and you'd see a whole bunch of faces  and then you'd say, oh, I know who that one is. You can also, and this is perhaps more important,  manually remove face tagging from a picture. So maybe you don't want to tag Raphael Nadal  or maybe Jeff does, or maybe you don't want to tag somebody you know, but you don't want to  violate their privacy when you share those photos. So that's just a change in how Google's going to  do face recognition in Google Photos. They also are adding, and I don't understand this, maybe you  guys have used it, chat. In-app sharing conversations. This is what I wanted to know about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't understand. This is finally going to be the one that works. The messaging app from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm so excited about this. So. Plus plus plus times plus? Basically, it looks more to me like  a replacement for Instagram or kind of a person to person Instagram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Combining your photos with, I get it. Okay. Google users will be able to share any number of

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  images or videos up to 20,000 per conversation. I'd like to see somebody try to do 20,000 in one.  Challenge accepted. You'll be able to create and add people to new groups so you can create a group.  There'll be a dedicated thread. People's comments will appear as if they're chat comments in that  thread. It's not exactly a messaging client. So it isn't, I don't think we can call it a new  messaging. It sounds like WhatsApp. Yeah, it has. Yes. Maybe that's it. I like it's more private,  right? Because there's no public sharing. You just share it with a group. Although people like Mike  Elgin will probably make that group pretty darn big. Make it public. Right? He'll probably make

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it public somehow. I use Google photo sharing all the time and it's a pain in the butt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. Because you have to share with one double. Sharing albums works really well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  but just sharing a photo, it creates an album with just that photo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes. Now when you do that, like I shared it with Lisa all the time, she hates it. She says,  would you just email me the damn picture? And I think that's why. So now it'll be more like a  message, a conversation, a thread. Let me see if I have it yet. I never really cared for the

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  sharing feature built inside of photos because of the way it organizes your app. I'm seeing create

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  a new share. Maybe I do have it. So there's a new tab. It's very slow. Create a new share, add a  title. Tweet test. Sharing, sharing is caring. Is it going to do an album?  Create an auto. No, you can do that. That's the auto updating album. So then I would add Lisa's  picture and automatically all the, anytime I get a picture with her, she'd get that. I like that  feature or I can select a photo. Select our Christmas card. Okay. Good. Which is beautiful.  Beautiful Christmas card. Where is it? Sharing is caring. Yeah. That's a good name for it.  Okay. Done. Where is it? Yeah, this looks intuitive. Oh, there it is. Okay.  Sharing is caring. And now what? Wow. It's a large, it's a large picture.  You know why there's 26 freaking people in it. Half of them want to unionize.  Now I can share it with Lisa and say, Hey there, cutie.  Whose lap is that you're sitting in? What the yo name she's going to. Yeah. What be your name?  May I, may I quote you? What be yo name? Okay. New phone. Who dis? All right. So now the problem is  Lisa's going to say, why are you sharing the Christmas picture with me? I don't know if this  shared an album or the, or like the now we're going to have a chat group. It doesn't feel like that.  But anyway, that's, so that's what'll change. It won't be an album anymore. It'll be a thread.  I like that. Let's see how it works though. Yeah. And this is a minor one, but if you speak. So this  hasn't been rolled out yet. It's rolling out. It's rolling out. It's in the process of,  yeah, I don't have it. Some people will have it. I don't know if I have it. I don't know what that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  experience was. It seems like I just try to share something. It seems like I have something new there.  I just shared something with you in Google photos. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh, I don't know what to do now. I'm, I'm actually done with this story. Okay. Fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm actually through shut up, Jeff, stop sharing the hit. We're moving on. Um, I'm done. I'm done,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  man. I'm done. Google assistant on Android TV, gain support for Hindi and Vietnamese.  That's good. That's awesome. And then, uh, yeah, if you're Hindi or Vietnamese, and then by the way,  I just bought the new Nvidia shield, uh, Android TV. It always was the best one. The new shield  pro, we have a review of the little tube from Jason on hot and I just got the full size one,  which is actually smaller. In fact, they took out some features. I can't put a micro SD card in it  anymore, which is weird. I guess everything's streaming. You don't download anymore, but it's  nice. It's fast. Um, Android TV lives thanks to Nvidia. It's always been the standard in their  set top boxes. So it's always been the best. If you like Android TV, it's absolutely the best.  Uh, finally it's time. Once again, it's the most wonderful time of the year. Live from the North  Pole. It's Santa's village. This is a Google does this every year. They have a little Santa tracker  and they've added some new features, big makeover, according to Google scroll down from the snowy  scene up top to discover Santa's new toy factory, his greenhouse. And because we're all interested  in fitness these days, the new reindeer gym, there is also a new 3d snowbox. So we visit,  let's go pay a visit to Santa's village. This reminds me of their CES display last year. Yeah.  Yeah. There's a certain, it's all material design. It's all flat and loads very slowly.  Explore, play and learn with Santa's elves all December long. Press the play button.  There's Mr. And Mrs. Google presents. Pulling this big electric switch. The lights come on.  The sleigh is ready. The elves are polishing the reindeer's nose and apparently they want more  money and they're going to unionize. Wait a minute. What the hell is going on? They've taken over  Santa's workshop. They certainly look like discontented elves. Oh, he's mad too. Really?  The reindeer are angry. Holy cow. By the way, we do have a nice little countdown clock, 19 days,  10 hours and 55 minutes until Christmas. Here's an elf reading a manual, something elves never do.  So anyway, there's obviously fun and games for all the family. This is a big change from last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It asked me if I wanted to dance. What the heck was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, do you think kids in 20 years will look back as I do at like, remember the Norelco razor sleigh  that Santa rode in those TV shows? That was awesome. Remember that? It even had the texture

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  in the snow and the blades. Yeah. Her lives singing, it's a holiday jolly. Do you think kids will look

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  back on Google's Santa tracker with the same nostalgia we played? No, absolutely. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, heck, my daughter gets nostalgic for that little dinosaur four game. So, and that's still  around. Oh, all right. Dude, they love that thing. Okay. But it's no Norelco Christmas spot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the best. Yes. Here comes Santa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Worst razors ever. Worst ever. They've got no gotchas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the selling point. They really work. And they come in a travel case. It cuts off little

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  hairs. Gosh, that thing was so bad. I used to want one. Still nostalgic about it. And that's the change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Somebody asked me in the community, who is the voice of the Google change? Like I have no,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  do you know, John? I have no idea. It was a fan creation, right? It was a fan creation because  we had two of the reason we have two of them is because it was like competitive. One of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, there were two different ones. Oh, I did not. Yeah. Oh, okay. Wow.  How old is that? Well, the Norelco ads from 1970. I don't know. Smart ass. I'm a smart ass.  It's your job to be a smart ass. I am by the way, the travel tripod from Peak Design is now shipping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm filling out my questionnaire. I thought it was supposed to ship from the 12th or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  $489. Well, I already paid for it. It carries all your gear. That tripod is awesome. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And did you order one or no? I did not. I did review one though. Oh, you've already seen it.  It is literally the size of this water bottle. When you can, you know, collapse it down, it'll  stick inside of your bag. It is awesome. It is tough. It is awesome. Aluminum or carbon fiber.  It's pricey, but it was outstanding. Yeah. And I got the fans. I get the most expensive carbon fiber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You got the carbon fiber. Yeah. So. You're worth it, Leo. It's nice. You know, I keep, I have a  fantasy that if I get more gear, my pictures will come out. Oh, you're one of those. And it's trying  to slap me on the head. You're one of those. Oh boy. It doesn't, it hasn't. Just saying.  Okay. Our show today brought to you by Captera. Now here's some technology that can make your  business better. A lot of people use, I mean, nowadays every business runs on software,  but the problem is a lot of businesses are running on old, slow, out of date buggy software. Cause,  you know, the boss's cousin's aunt's nephew's friend wrote it while he was in college. He  graduated. He's disappeared. That was 30 years ago. You're still using the software. The whole  business runs on it. It requires windows 95 and internet Explorer one, but Hey, it's all you got.  But is it, is it really, I suggest a visit to Captera, C A P T E double ra.com slash twig.  Captera is the leading free online resource to help you find the best software solution for your  business. Turns out there is modern software for every business. And Captera is the ultimate  directory with 700 categories, everything from digital workplace software to video management  software to the kind of basic line of business software for things like dog groomers and yoga  studios. And so whatever business you're in, Captera has usually like dozens, often, you know,  many, many different apps. You're going to do mind mapping software. Sure. Okay. So you find a  ton of them, right? But you got to narrow it down. They've got filters that are tuned to the category.  So, you know, you can say on premises, you could say in the cloud, you could say how many seats  does it make appointments? If it's dog grooming software, what's the breed narrow it down. Of  course, you probably want to narrow it down also by the number of stars. And then you can even make  a comparison chart. It's four by four side by side and see it just like in the magazines head to  head. But here's the thing that's so cool that no magazine has 1 million plus reviews of the products  from actual users. Captera does such a great job to vet these reviews. So they all come from people  who use that software and it'll give you everything you need to make an informed decision. And by the  way, Captera is free. There's no charge, never will be for this. But if you want to say thank you,  write a review. That's how you get such great, such great stuff. captera.com slash twig. Captera  believes software makes the world a better place because software can help every organization  become a better version of itself. Try it. You got nothing to lose. It's absolutely free.  Please use that special URL captera.com slash twig. So they know you saw it here. Make the right  software decision. With all of those reviews, you can't go wrong captera.com slash twig captera is  software selection simplified. We when is your flight? It's it? Okay, we got to get you out of  here in about 45 minutes, Stacy. So we'll we'll I'm aware of that. We're gonna keep an eye on the

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  clock. Stacey's at the Seattle airport. If I were there, I'd be having a red wine in the hand,  you know, you might fill in this for me. I'm stuck on a podcast. We don't know what's there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can go to the bar. Take us with you. Yes. No, I'm not. I'm not that person.  Oh, are you? I was like, I will show you the lounge because it's beautiful.  This is the middle area. Oh, it is nice. Here's the espresso bar.  Oh, wow. Over that area is where the the fire pit and everything are. Do you have to fly first

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  class to get in there? How do you get in there? I have a lounge pass. Smart person. I spend I spend  a lot of time at the airport. Yeah, it's worth it. You are using what do you what is it lounge buddy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's the company that does that? Oh, no, I just have an Alaska because I'm because you're last.  I got it. I've got Alaska Lounge and American. So nice. So if you're I'm traveling, that's where

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you'll find me. What was it called? Reinvent. And they do this every year. I remember last year,  that's when they announced that deep racer, which was to help programmers learn about that this year,  how reinforcement learning works. Yeah, I have one, but I've never used it. What was their

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  announcement? They're going to add lidar on top. So should you choose to update your deep racer,  you can get lidar coming soon. Yeah. So I mean, I don't know if you guys care so much about this,  but I can put the AWS announcements in context with what Google does. And that would help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That would be great. We care. We care deeply. Deeply. Deeply. OK. So the big the big

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  announcements. So at this show, you usually look for Andy Jassy's keynote. He's the guy in  charge of AWS. And then on Thursday morning, so tomorrow morning, you'll look for Werner's keynote.  Andy Jassy spent a lot of time talking about SageMaker, which is Amazon's AI focus, AI tools.  The coolest tool they actually announced was something called autopilot. And what that does  is it takes all the data you have in your Amazon S3 storage thing and is like, and then it says,  I will build models based on this, which is really hard for people to do. So that was a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  really cool service. They can't build models on my storage. It's totally just garbage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK. Files and stuff. But theoretically, you'd open, you'd upload data sets that had some data

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  sets and they would pick that up. So Amazon spent a lot of time focused on machine learning,  probably because Google's getting a lot of attention for that. Where Amazon is a little  bit different is it's announcing higher level tools. And they made it clear, I think they said  85% of Google's TensorFlow projects are actually running on AWS. So instead of doing their own,  you know, processor for data, although they do have an inference chip and kind of focusing on  an arm chip also, a new arm platform. That's next up. Because I love arm. OK, so their whole  strategy here with data is to go higher level. So a platform is a service kind of level from  Google and make it less abstract, sorry, more abstract, I guess, for people. Why wouldn't you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  use Google's like TPUs if you're going to do TensorFlow? I'm surprised to hear that most  people are using Amazon. Well, that's where the data is. Yeah. OK. So they apply TensorFlow to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the data from Amazon. Yeah. So Amazon boosted SageMaker, which is their machine learning tools.  That's a big, big announcement. Number one. Number two is they announced the Graviton2 processors,  which are really a better, faster arm based processor that should be cheaper  that a lot of people can use. And that was the one of the big ones. Does this compete with TPU?  What is the point of this? So the Graviton2, so these are for basic compute loads. OK. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  not. So basically it's just it's arm servers. And you can cluster up to 60. Yeah. Yeah. Cluster up  to 64 of them. They're low power. Will that mean they're less expensive for us or just for Amazon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Amazon hasn't given pricing. They should be less expensive. They'll also be more energy  efficient to run. And the nice thing about the cloud is a lot of your jobs don't require all of  your processing power, right? You're dividing up that processing power using hypervisors and you're  like, I'll do a little load here and a little load there. And so ARM actually works out well for a  lot of the cloud workloads. So that's the ARM Graviton2 announcement. The other big announcement  is the Amazon Nitro service. And that is what is that? That is their whole new class of services  that they're offering that it's not quite composable infrastructure, but it lets you  allocate the storage and networking capacity you need on demand, which is getting closer to this  holy grail of being able to compose your own infrastructure for your applications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Composing means you kind of piece together as much infrastructure as you need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You piece together your networking, your storage and your compute as it needs for the app. So  think about it this way. We have achieved this app explosion. We used to have general purpose  computing, not sorry, not graphics processors. We used to have general purpose computing.  And that worked for pretty much everything. But now when we get these big workloads in the cloud,  you really want to optimize for them because they're big enough that you can be more efficient if  you optimize for them. And so that's what this is allowing you to do is to even further make more  fine tuned adjustments for optimizing those workloads. So that's that. And then what else

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  do you want to know about? I want to know about the broom ball tournament at the Las Vegas Festival  grounds. I don't know about that. I should tell you, break it. Break it. Amazon launched their

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  quantum computing efforts as well, which will compete again with IBM. Who goes to this? Is  this a developer event? It is. And it's bigger than, yeah, it's both developers, but it's like  Microsoft Ignite is only enterprise class developers, right? They have build for their  other developers. This is anybody who builds anything on AWS. So it's a huge event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Everybody uses AWS. We use AWS. Everybody uses AWS. It's a great infrastructure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Do you also use Google or Microsoft or the competitors? Do people mix and match these

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  things? Oh, yeah. It's very common to see multi-homed clouds, but unfortunately,  there's complexity involved. And sometimes you just say, let's-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You usually run one type of job or one type of workload or app kind of thing in a cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We use it for load balancing for our website. We use AWS. There's other things. Frankly,  our whole, I hope it's okay to say this, but our whole workflow chain is after the fires.  We used to do all our workflow here in the studio. And when the studio was off for three days,  we went, hmm. So Russell's, our brilliant IT guy, has been moving. We don't want to use it  day to day, but we have the capability of using AWS if we're shut down to- We obviously can't shoot  the shows, but the production chain can go up in the cloud. So things like that, it's really nice  for. And the nice thing about AWS is we can have it up there, but it's not on. So it costs us  nothing until we turn it on. It's nice. Contingency. It's nice. What is your  contingency still to shoot in your home if you have to? Yeah, we could do that. But the problem  is exactly that. If we were going to shoot in our house, we would have had to pack up all the assets,  a bunch of computers. We had to put it in a car and ship it over and set it up. It would be,  Russell said, it's about four hours. But by moving it to AWS, we're not using it, again,  we're not using it day to day because it's faster to use it locally, but we will be,  we could if we had to. And that's just a redundancy thing. Jason Howell wants me to buy him this.  So last year they announced the RoboRacer, right? You program to learn a certain kind of  reinforcement learning. This is a gadget called Composer from AI that lets humans in AI write  music together. They call it Deep Composer like Deep Racer. Shall I play? Here's Jonathan Colton  performing. At least they got a good geek performer there. Performing on the AWS stage with  the little AI. Actually, instead of playing that, you think I'll get in trouble? No, Colton would  never sue us. He loves us. I made Colton. It's not him we're worried about. Yeah. He's a human song

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  writer. Thank you. So this song is a cautionary tale. There's a science fiction short story about  collaborating with an artificial intelligence. I wonder if this is a song from Portal  or is it Code Monkey? I wrote a song with a robot in Vegas. Now I'm a brain in a jar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay. Well, let me play it. If you don't know about Jonathan Colton, go to his website and

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  download his music. I think 70 bucks you could download all of it. And I did that a long time  ago. So here's some jazz played by the Deep Composer.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That is the worst. That is terrible. Okay. But it's not as terrible as the pop. Here's pop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the most nightmarish old music I've ever heard. It feels like an AI wrote it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right. Sounds like true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It sounds like a pop song. It sounds like a pop song.  It sounds like a pop song. It sounds like a pop song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the worst old music I've ever heard. It feels like an AI wrote it.  Right. Sounds like Journey.  You just insulted Journey, baby. Sounds like Journey. Oh man. And here's rock Steve Perry  just rolling over in his barometric chamber. That's rock?  Yeah. And then listen, everyone's going to hear a really bad note. There.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. Not good. Now see, again, this all comes back to who's training the AI and how much training  are they doing with this? Because I could see this potentially working out, but this has a long way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is using your favorite technology, Stacey. Generative adversarial networks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gans are notorious. When they go wrong, they go real wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When I first saw it, I thought about-  Gans go wrong. That's our show title, ladies and gentlemen. I just want to say right at that.  Gans go wrong.  Put it in the book. I'm sorry. Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  When I first saw this, it made me think about, what was that? American Gods, the TV show.  Oh, I love that show.  And where the, was it Technology Boy? At least it's not in the book, but the Technology Boy guy,  or whatever. He meets up with the computer guy that makes music. And all I could think about  was Technology Boy whispering in this guy's ears, telling him that music's horrible and fix it.  And this is what came out. It's these horrible samples.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The premise of the show is awesome, which is that the old gods, the Norse gods, even Jesus,  the old gods are being replaced by modern gods.  New gods.  Yours is technology god. He de-reses and re-reses. He's kind of creepy and he's smoking a vape.  Yeah.  Was it toad skins or something he was smoking? Something crazy.  Yeah, he is. Toad skins, yeah.  So it was interesting, and we talked a little bit about this on Windows Weekly earlier,  because Mary Jafoli was also talking about re-invent. It was interesting that they're doing  this ARM Graviton 2. The previous generation was also ARM, but it sounds like ARM in the cloud.  I remember Linus Torvalds said for a long time, Linux isn't going to support ARM well until cloud  services are based on ARM, not Intel, because there's no way to test what we're doing.  Okay.  Yeah.  That's fair.  So this is actually a big deal.  It is.  I guess it won't be faster per core, but you can multiply the cores to 64 cores.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you really don't need, for every workload, you don't need Intel-level performance,  especially when you're in the cloud, because the cloud is designed to  take that underlying performance and put a layer over it. So you don't actually care.  Only the hypervisor cares.  Right.  And that's why, that's actually why everyone was excited about ARM in the cloud. The cloud  actually gave ARM a chance, because most companies aren't going to use the entire Intel workload,  and price performance per watt becomes so much more important in the cloud.  So, and these should be cheaper. And what's exciting, even more exciting, is when you have  clouds coming in and buying the hardware at that level, you've got the chance for real  innovation at the core level that you don't have, like with Intel, only Intel develops x86, right?  There's one other company, I don't know if they're still around, but, well, there's AMD too, sorry.  And AMD is doing some innovation. But with ARM, you're going to see companies  innovate around that core in a way that companies can't with x86. And I think that's really exciting.  And it's also great for the cloud guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mary Jo also saw it more as taking a shot at Azure, Microsoft's cloud, than at Google's cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Azure has ARM processors. They also use FPGAs for different things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  FPGA is their TPU, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And FPGA is a generic field program.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's aimed at the same market that Google's TPU is aimed at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They are using it for machine learning, yes, but they also use it for  search and I think some transactional things too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're partnering with Verizon on 5G with a new wavelength service, cloud computing over 5G.  I just talked to them about that.  Yeah, Microsoft's got AT&T as their partner. You think Verizon's a good choice here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and they're going to add, so we'll see more. These exclusive deals are just to be all like,  fancy. We're going to see them at AT&T over time.  They also have KDDI today, or Amazon has KDDI, Verizon, Vodafone, and somebody else I can't recall.  And this is basically putting Amazon's physical hardware inside metro data centers.  AT&T's partnership with Azure is actually at the RAN, which is at the cell tower network.  This is actually in the citywide data centers, which is not as far out to the edge as you could go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  28 launches at reInvent. And by the way, now Amazon's cloud business has 175  different services that they can offer.  We had 164 last week, so this is a big deal.  They jumped. CodeGuru, which interestingly works with Microsoft's GitHub, is an automated  intelligence code review service. Wow. I mean, there's just a ton of stuff. So  Amazon really feels like they're on the march.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  When in the process of Amazon did they discover  the business of AWS and how big it could be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They launched AWS in 2005. They launched S3. That was their first service, which was really  simple storage. They proposed it. So I actually know the guys who proposed it.  I think it was in 2004. But think about Amazon from day one. And I didn't mean that as a  that's their thing. Their service is business. And so when they decided to build a cloud service,  that was a, I think they recognized the trend because back in 2005, when they were doing this,  the big trend was HP and IBM talking about grid computing and autonomic computing. That's what  they called it. And it was, they called it instantly provisioned computing. So that was  already a trend that was happening, but it still took like a week to get that computing provision.  So when AWS came up and said, you know what, we're going to spin this up right away because  how much of this do you really want to know? Because I could go on about this forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a great story about it in the everything store, the story, the book about Amazon. Andy  Jassy, who's the CEO, says it started at an executive retreat in 2003 at Bezos' house.  They were doing an exercise identifying the company's core competencies. And as they went  through them, they realized, you know what, we're actually pretty good at infrastructure services.  We understand compute and storage and database. What's more, he says they'd become highly skilled  at running reliable, scalable, cost-effective data centers because that's what they had to do for  themselves. It was at that point, Jassy says, without even fully articulating it, they started  to formulate the idea of what AWS could be. And they wondered, is there a business here providing  the infrastructure we had to make for ourselves? Like a happy accident. To other people. In

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  retrospect. Was Werner Vogel's core to this? I don't know. He became close to it, if not

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  immediately. I mean, I remember talking to Werner about it in like 2006 and he was pretty tight up

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  on it. They didn't have exactly an aha moment, according to Jassy, but they started to think  about it as an operating system of sorts for the internet. So it took them three years from that  moment at the retreat. Which is nothing really. Yeah. To roll it out. Yeah, because they, I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that the guys who, Jassy and I'm trying to think of Ben and I feel like it was Chris, did the  original memo. Cause you know how you have to pitch a product with Amazon with one memo. And  I've seen that. But yeah, so, and it's not true. They actually didn't run Amazon stuff on AWS for  a long time. They launched AWS. It wasn't the same thing that was Amazon's backend for a while. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that's a common misconception. Yeah. I mean, here's a picture in computer world of in 2002,  quote, Amazon web service launching, but it really was a service that they offer companies  so that they could incorporate amazon.com on their own sites. So that wasn't real. It was  just embedding Amazon on their sites. It wasn't until 2006 that as you say, S3 and EC2 came out.  So that's what a success story, huh? It reminds me a little bit. I always think about a CompuServe,  which was an on the very early online service created by H&R Block. When one of their people  observed, you know, our computers are real busy during the day around April and it gets pretty  slow the night and the rest of the time. We probably could time. That was what time sharing

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  time share. Like time share that. And that's it still needed maximum capacity at a certain point  of the year. So they couldn't, it wasn't like they really had spare capacity. Yeah. I wonder

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  how they handled that. Like April 15th, the CompuServe get really slow. I don't remember.  I was a big CompuServe user in those days. I don't really remember that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You think? 714351134. I used to remember it. 71351556, 5156. Never used it. You're too young.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Only Jeff and I are old enough to remember CompuServe. And Jeannie, did you use Jeannie? No.  Jeannie was for wusses. Did you use MCI mail? Remember in the early days of email?  You couldn't email everybody. Just other people on MCI. The first internet ad. I sold the first

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  internet ad at advanced publications to MCI. Wow. Whatever. Does MCI exist even? I just remember

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  MCI being for phones. Was he at MCI? Oh, I didn't know that. Oh yeah. Before MCI.com, Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So here's how Facebook decided to handle Thanksgiving.  It created a chat bot called Liambot. That name's already taken. It's a bot that  dissects Apple iPhones for recycling. But okay. So to teach employees what to say if friends or  family ask difficult questions about the company over the holidays. And so there's all these canned  answers. So for instance, if a relative says, well, how does Facebook handle hate speech?  Liam would say Facebook consults with experts on the matter. It's hired more moderators to  police its content. It's working on AI to spot hate speech. Regulation is important for addressing

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  the issue. Do they have like contacts in their eyes? Memorize this. Have you been? It's all

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  coming in the chip in your head. Uncle Leo says it just talks to you. Oh yes. So have you been

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  watching the new Silicon Valley, Jeff? Oh, it's back. No, I haven't. I haven't watched the last  one. First three episodes are really funny. Especially the guy with, have you seen these  products? It's a chair you strap to your hindsight. Oh yeah. You could sit down. We had on the show.  Oh, the exoskeleton thing. Yeah. Yeah. It's just a chair. And there's a character that's  a stir. Perfect. Yeah. But then it kind of starts to lose its way a little bit. And then it gets  better again with Russ Fest. See, that's where I'm at. I haven't watched that one. Yeah. That was a  teaser for me. It's a mixed bag. Kara Swisher has a massive role in one of the episodes. Did you see  the Kara Swisher episode? That was right before the Russ Fest. She can act, it turns out. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I still like Guilford. I don't think it's an act. Guilford is still on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that, I'm trying to remember, somebody's on the, I guess the CEO of Pied Piper's on the  stage. Oh, what's the name? Oh, no, no, no, no. Susan Wojcicki is mentioned. They couldn't apparently  get Susan. So Kara goes, well, thank you, Susan Wojcicki. That was a great presentation. And now,  and they bring on the woman who's the investor in Pied Piper. That's right. Good going Kara.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Speaking of TV, did you see, I put it on the rundown, the kerfuffle over the Peloton

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  dystopian commercial? Yeah. I didn't bother clicking on it. It has been in my Twitter feed,  you know, for- I watched the commercial. Look at that picture. It's dystopian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm a Peloton user, so, you know, and I saw the commercial. It's a little sexist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, remember the cult, are we? Yeah, it's a bit sexist, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because she is a mother and a wife who apparently was gifted a Peloton.  Okay. And shoots selfie videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I'm not even given. Given. Gift is not a verb, damn it.  Gifted? You can't say gift. No, I hate that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Neither is partner. People say it all the time.  Neither is what? Oh, gift.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She is presented. Partnered.  Gifted means you actually are smarter than the average bear. I should have said given. Thank you.  Given. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Sorry. A pedant.  Okay. But you were saying she was given a Peloton.  I'm all- She was presented a Peloton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Presented with a Peloton. Was it by her husband? I don't remember.  It was a gift.  And then she shoots video of her getting leaner, meaner, and sexier,  and how much she loves her Peloton. I mean, I don't- that's kind of what ads are. Ads are

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  by nature that way. Oh, you're in the cult, aren't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I am. What's the difference between that and the people in the gym doing videos showing them

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  on the top? Right. Yeah, and I should point out, as Dr. Morpheus says at the beginning,  she's already thin and fit at the beginning, so she didn't really need-

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  She looks sad and frightened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that- that frame grab, I don't even- I mean, it doesn't stand-  Look at that. Look at that.  That's just a frame grab. He's frightened to death.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Dystopian is that Black Mirror episode where they had to be on the bikes to power the whatever and

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  hoped for their game show appearance. That was creepy, yeah. She's just- I'm  not going to play the audio. That's just how she looks. She's guttered, eyes are knitted.  I don't know. It's not a terrible ad. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Were people upset because the husband gave her a gift or is it she just looks sad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, the husband said, you know, you could use a little weight, honey, was the implication.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's a dumb husband right there. That is what that is. My husband- I had to ask for  my Fitbit in writing twice before I got one. He wanted plausible deniability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  From any accusations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, exactly. All right. First we lose Grumpy Cat, then we lose Keyboard Cat twice. I'm sad to say  Lil Bub has passed away peacefully in her sleep at the age of eight. She was cheerful and full  of love writes her owner Mike Brodavsky lying on our bed with us late Saturday night but  unexpectedly passed away peacefully in her sleep. Lil Bub is gone.  We still have Baby Yoda.  Maybe if they'd given her a Peloton. Yeah, Baby Yoda's-  We still have Baby Yoda though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Baby Yoda.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That will be the next thing, a cat Peloton.  Yeah.  Peloton.  Peloton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Stacey, you're going to have to explain this to me because I'm too dumb to know what this means.  T-Mobile has launched its 5G but it's not millimeter-  Good, I want Stacey to explain this. Thank you.  Yeah. It's 600 megahertz 5G. We won't be able to use it for a couple more days.  And what's weird is I have a phone that has a 600 megahertz antenna, the iPhone 11.  Apparently you have to have a Samsung 5G or a OnePlus 5G to use it.  So four people can use it.  Is that because the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's because of the MIMO, the Massive Multi-MIMO.  So you have to have the right software and the right antenna structure to get the  massive capacity. So this spectrum is going to be a little bit different.  Do you want to know or not? How nerdy should I be, y'all?  Get nerdy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Super nerdy.  Please.  Okay.  Nerdy with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay. So the 600 megahertz spectrum is the same. We've got, I think Verizon and  then AT&T are using 700 megahertz to deliver LTE. So with 5G, the 3GPP standard, so the  cellular standard, the way it gets max capacity, so like that super gigabit capacity,  is because you've got large chunks of spectrum, like 100 megahertz wide chunks of spectrum.  And you just flood all of that and that's where your capacity is coming from.  So when you're on the 34 gigahertz spectrum, that's divided into these 100 megahertz blocks.  Down at the 600 megahertz, 700 megahertz, those spectrum blocks are usually 10 or 20  megahertz wide. So you have fewer lanes of traffic to deliver capacity. And so you may  not see your gigabit speeds. So that's why the spectrum-  Now, what T-Mobile's doing is what you're going to see AT&T do later when they start.  And there's a reason for it. It's because that lower spectrum, the 600 megahertz,  that goes through walls really well, whereas the upper level spectrum doesn't. So you can  be in the open air and get super, super fast capacity, or you can be like have the coverage.  So there's the capacity versus coverage trade-off that's happening. Did that make sense?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay. Awesome.  So is this going to be faster?  I don't know if it'll be fast. I mean, it could be faster than LTE. It really depends on how they-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, T-Mobile's warning people it could be, but it might not be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It probably won't be. I mean, the issue is if you've only got 20 megahertz of spectrum,  you're never going to be able to deliver the super capacity if anyone else is on the network.  So if you're the only person on that network, sure, yeah, you're probably getting faster,  but you're probably not going to get the gigabit speed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The benefit of 600 megahertz because it's a longer bandwidth, it travels better.  It's wavelength.  Yeah, wavelength, I'm sorry. It travels better. So it gets through walls. It works a bit.  Millimeter wave does not because it's in the gigahertz spectrum. And so that's going to just  really bounce off of anything. So 600 megahertz, I guess I would imagine in the final deploy,  you'll see both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're going to see both in the final deployment. But for now in the lower megahertz, again,  is coverage. So you'll have your coverage everywhere, inside, outside, whatever.  And then the fatter wavelength will be speed capacity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If it's not faster, then what's the point?  But is it lower latency? Is there some advantage to it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, so 5G does have lower latency. There's also cost savings to the carrier.  You can still cram more bits in a hertz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm glad it's cheaper for T-Mobile, but what do we get?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's good because...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh yeah, they'll lower the prices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, no, you still...  With 5G, you're going to see a boost in... So all of your cellular data plans, there's something  called Shannon's law, which says you can only cram so many bits per hertz.  So this 5G is more efficient than LTE. So that's slightly more... So it'll be better...  That's better technically for the carriers, but that's also good for you.  And then the latency is millisecond level latency as opposed to single digit millisecond level  latencies in tests.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So should I buy a 5G phone today? I want that McLaren edition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I would wait another year. 2020 feels like a good year to buy a 5G phone.  And we are going to see some battery compromises, I imagine.  It's very complex because everything is going to be software defined,  both on your handset and at the carrier level. So this is going to be a really rough transition,  I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This isn't something where T-Mobile is moving all of its customers there. This is just an additional  option for people that have the type of hardware to be able to pick up that signal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And I imagine you'll be kind of like a little early beta tester too, because they  don't want to put... You don't want everybody on an iPhone. Remember when the iPhone came out and  AT&T's 3G network was just slammed? No one wants to go through that again. So T-Mobile is going to  do this for the eight people who have the compatible phone, see what happens. And it's a smart move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay. They're really the first to roll it out nationwide. There have been small installations  for Verizon and AT&T all over the country, but this is an AT&T who has also misrepresented its  4G as 5G. But isn't this the first nationwide deployment of any 5G technology?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, especially, yes. And the reason why is because they're using their 600 megahertz  spectrum. I can't remember what they cleared if that was their 2G or whatever, but they cleared

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  some spectrum for this. Yeah. And I remember John Ledger, the outbound CEO, saying, oh, good news.  iPhone 11 does 600 megahertz, but apparently it doesn't have the right antennas. So...  Not yet.  It doesn't really matter. Boy, there's a lot more to talk about. I kind of thought it'd be fun,  but we don't have time. We're going to take a break. But I love...  I can just leave.  Don't leave. Stay where you are. We want to get Stacey's pick. But we will talk about other things.  We know how to save some stories for next time. This is true.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She's doing the meeting. No, I think I'm sorry. I think Karsten picked something for me. I was  going to do something different, but now I'm reading this article. We should mention is on her way

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  down here to our studios because tomorrow we're going to do our holiday special with Stacy.  We're going to have Mary Jo Foley, who was here earlier today, and Laurie. For whom you wore a tie.  I like to impress. Dress for the job you want. She dressed pretty nice too. I think there's  something going on. So Karsten sent you a very good article all about your favorite beverage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. And I will say I just had, this is not my pick of the week, but I just had a wonderful  gin. It could be a few hours. In Victoria, it was the Tofino Old Growth Cedar Gin,  and it was delicious. It tasted like the rainforest. No, it was good. My pick of the week is actually  not a smart product. If you were following my Twitter this week and I received mine and I didn't  pack it because it's freaking heavy, but this is the Illuminabi. I spelled it wrong. Help me,  Illuminabi. You're my only door knob. It's an indoor doorknob. It has a motion sensor on it  and a light. When you get close to it, it casts this very beautiful light pattern. This has no  functionality. My editor, when I was writing about it last week, was like, what does it do?  I'm like, it's just pretty, just pretty. It's a light.  It's a fun thing. It glows. It can light up a room a little bit if you want it to,  so you can find the light at the door or something or in the bathroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like this. That's beautiful. If the room fills with smoke and you need to get out quick.  Now, I got to say, the only thing I don't like about this is so high tech, but a knob is the  worst possible design for a doorknob because if your hands are wet or slippery, you can't grasp it.  I like a lever doorknob. Do they make a lever?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They don't because the doorknob has a cap. This is how this casts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can they gift me with a lever?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want a lever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You say lever? Really, Jeff? It's a lever. It's a lever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Anyway, so this is the product. It's $50. It's going to be for a limited time. It's just kind  of an experiment they're doing. I thought it was fun and I bought it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  First pronunciation is lever. Second is lever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'm number one then. How do you pronounce a LumaNabi?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's it.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Clever or lever?  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is your pick of the week, Anthony Pruit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Clemson Life. Clemson Life. I was thinking about this here recently.  Clemson Life?  Clemson Life. Yeah. Because for me, I was having a discussion with the kids about college.  And I've gotten to the point now I can't really push college on them anymore.  Why not? Because there's no guarantee of them.  Yeah. It just doesn't seem like it's a feasible thing, depending on what you want to do.  But when thinking about this, we thought about some friends back home where they have children  that they want them to get the college experience, but they have intellectual disabilities.  And we told them that Clemson Life is an opportunity. And they went and checked it out  and signed up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is how you learn what it would be like to be a student at Clemson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. And they give them a nice educational experience.  Are they honest?  They have more life skills.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Given your experience, is this honest?  It's legit.  They don't mention the drinking parties, the hazing?  I'm not going to go there.  I'm not going to go there.  I remember my son went to CU Boulder.  They sold it as a great academic experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. I heard all about Boulder.  Oh, what a party school that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You wouldn't say Clemson's a party school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Clemson has his issues. I'm not going to deny that.  All colleges have issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff knows this. It's when people go to college, they let their hair down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, see, and that was my discussion with my boys.  You left it there.  No, sorry.  That was part of my discussion with the boys was I would like for them to go to college just  for the experience because when I went, it helped me further develop skills with just being on my own.  Yes. It's a halfway house.  Right. And just learning what I need to do on my own and needing to be responsible  and not necessarily call on mom and dad and stuff like that.  It's a very expensive halfway house.  And but at the same time, I like the fact that Clemson is offering packages up for  intellectual disabled kids and getting them down there.  Oh, that's great.  And that's what Clemson life is all about.  Oh, that's nice.  Is having those kids.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, oh, differently, let's say differently abled.  Differently abled.  Because one of the things that we see, and I have some experience with this,  with a lot of these kids are smart and deserve to go to college,  but they need different kinds of scaffolding to help them get through it.  Right. Different guidance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They have living assistants.  That's, oh, I got to find out more about that.  So they get an apartment just like any other college student.  But again, it's all sort of geared to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's time to say goodbye to Stacey.  Bye, Stacey.  Bye.  Her plane is leaving.  We'll see you in a little bit.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have a great flight.  See you tomorrow.  Two and a half minutes to pee.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Oh, so I didn't realize this is for  so kids who have some learning challenges.  Very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's really nice.  And even we have a guy named David Seville on this part of our football team.  And he's part of Clemson Life.  But he's one of the most popular people in the organization because of his energy  and because of his experience with Clemson Life.  He's been like a great ambassador for the program with letting people know  your kids are going to be here and they're going to be safe.  And they're going to learn life skills from beyond high school and beyond college life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love this idea because everybody deserves a collegiate experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Like I said, I can't push it on my kids far as, hey, you need to go to college to learn ABCD.  But I do like the fact that you can go there to help broaden your adult skills.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think more schools are doing this now.  This is getting more common, which I think is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I argued in what Google do, I argued that you should separate the college into different  experiences.  You separate the growth process of becoming an adult from the educational process.  They don't have to be the same place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's right.  I didn't go to Clemson University.  I went to Wingate University.  And my first memory was closing the door and watching my mother, my then girlfriend,  and my grandmother drive out of the parking lot.  That is a tough moment.  For the very first time.  That's a tough moment.  It got real.  Yeah.  Real quick.  I'm on my own.  So yeah.  That's awesome.  I'd like to advocate that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  When my parents left Claremont, I stopped shaving and grew a beard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was 16 years old when I went to college and my parents dropped me off at the airport in San  Francisco and said, good luck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's your bag.  Here's your ticket.  I hope it all works out.  Got real, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In hindsight, I look at that and go, that was an odd thing to do.  Because I remember the difficulty of dragging my trunk up the steps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was all alone.  Life got real, man.  Yeah.  It got real, real quick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Jesus.  For my daughter, we have a caravan of SUVs to carry this stuff to her room when she was in  college.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's funny.  So of course, when I brought my daughter, our first born to college, her mother and I  and her brother Henry, we all went out to Bard.  We all got a hotel room.  We stayed there for a couple of nights.  She tried to get me to sign a contract that said, after you drop me off at the dorm, you  will leave within 15 minutes.  Wow.  She met it.  Smart cow.  Mom's trying to make the bed and get her out.  Nope, nope.  She turned around, pushed her out the door.  So Jennifer and I were reduced to driving around the campus for the next two days,  looking for her, wondering if she was having a good time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  She was so happy to get rid of us.  My mom's and my grandmother, they came in and they wiped down the room and all of that.  But beyond that, it was like, bye, we'll see you, dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Pendulum swings.  You'll probably move in with the boys for a couple of weeks.  I want to point out that YouTube has an interesting tweet today.  Actually, it was yesterday.  I don't know.  Do you remember the rewind last year with the bus, the Fortnite bus?  People thought it was terrible.  It was weak.  Apparently, YouTube is acknowledging.  So the meme that they posted on Twitter has a picture of a highway sign, 2018 rewind straight  ahead, and then in the off ramp, something different for real.  And then the car below it, YouTube, this is a meme, screech, pulling off.  So apparently they're saying, yeah, we blew it last year.  We figured it out.  Now for something completely different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's been a big Reddit movement to basically sign a pledge not to watch  YouTube rewind for the first 24 hours, at least.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Was PewDiePie, I don't think he was in the rewind last year.  That's a lot of-  That's a part of the problem.  In fact, here's PewDiePie's animated GIF reaction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  It's not so animated.  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What the heck?  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe he's in it this time because that was posted by YouTube as well.  I'm pretty sure I won't watch it.  Yeah.  It just makes me feel old.  I watch it and I don't know anybody in it.  Can't relate.  And I just go, well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  My hard heads will watch it and we'll relate.  They'll know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what you got to do is sit down with them.  In fact, can I come over and borrow your boys?  Anytime.  They could tell me who these people are.  Jeff Jarvis, professor of journalism.  Can I plug something real quick?  Yes.
