Transcript:  It's time for Twig this week in Google. Jeff Jarvis is here. Kevin Marx joins us.  Let's talk about the latest news from Google. He's back, baby. Rich Osterloh. I'm so excited.  He's heading hardware. Google will talk about that. We also will talk about how the internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  is changing politics in a big way. Is it good or is it bad? Well, we have a nice long philosophical  discussion. The kind of thing Twig's famous for. Next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Not really so much Google, but just a disclaimer right up front. That's just the name.  We talk about anything that Jeff Jarvis and I want to talk about. And Kevin Marx is here, too.  And that means guaranteed a wide-ranging, fascinating, intellectually stimulating discussion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hi, Jeff Jarvis. I won't make any political statements today. I'll just wear my hat.  Show my pen and show my buttons and say it's all heads on deck, people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm trying to think. Are you a lieutenant in the in the air? The Hillary Army? The Hillary Army,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I guess he is. Yeah. I wanted a little lapel pin, right? I thought a nice little subtle lapel pin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It wouldn't be too much. The thing is huge. I'm not. Do you like that logo? I guess it's a good logo.  Yeah, it is. It's also an arrow. It's an H with an arrow.  I've been resisting calling her Hillary because I feel like that's demeaning because she's a woman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Would you just call her Clinton? That's confusing. No, she needs more humanizing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Also with us, Kevin Marx, are you registered to vote in the United States? Are you allowed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am indeed registered for the first time in this. How exciting. Are you a citizen or a resident?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm a citizen now. Congratulations. Can you recite the presidency of the United States

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  in order beginning with George Washington? No, I've forgotten all that since I passed the test.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You did have to know that, didn't you? No, not quite. It was actually easier than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it easier? Yeah, right. Is it easier than that? It was easier than having to do that,  but it was a bunch of slight, slightly obscure, odd things. It's like becoming a ham. You don't  have to learn Morse code anymore. It's not quite as weird as the UK one. What do you have to do to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  be a citizen in the UK? Not that I'm only asking for academic purposes. I'm asking for a friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's similar to the American quiz, which is both weird combinations of history and  schimilars and things. The UK one involves entitlement to benefits and odd government  regulations. It's like civics. But kind of. It's tough, though, in both cases that actual citizens

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  born in the country rarely know. Right. That's the other amazing part of it.  Yeah. But I think there should be a higher standard if you want to be part of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The new test is going to say que pasa, and if you understand that, you can't get in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How do you? Oh, so we weren't going to get political. Sorry. We weren't going to get

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  political. The biggest, the longest part of the citizenship ceremony was being told how to vote

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  in five different languages. Good. You know what? There's two things you got, three things you got  to do as a citizen. You got to vote. You got to pay taxes and you have to serve on a jury.  All the rest is up to you. I think. I mean, it'd be nice if you contributed a little bit and stuff,  but you don't have to. That's the beauty. Life, liberty and the pursuit of whatever the hell

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  gets you off. Meanwhile, unless it's changing your gender, but oh, yeah. Meanwhile,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  let's move to Larry Page's Island. Google IO is coming up. That's where Larry Page said we wish  we were on an island. He won't be saying anything this time. I'm sure you're going to be, you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  going to it, right? Jeff? I'm going to it. Yeah. And the timing is such that I think I have to do  the show from down there because it's just, they're always late and there's not enough time to get up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. We're investigating. Well, and this time you're far away. You're in a, you're in Mountain View.  You're all the way down in Google land. Yeah, but they, they've got connectivity there.  He should be able to do that. Well, we're investigating. We're going to, Father Robert  has a house down there. Well, he doesn't, the Pope does, but you can use it. And so we're trying to  figure out how we could do this. It's not just you, by the way, Jason Howell is going to be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In fact, he's staying the whole week. Well, here's the question. Google has all those conference  rooms with the hangout conference thing. Yeah. I'll bet they would be happy to have us use one  of those. And whoever's in Mountain View, we could just sit there like the two or the three of us  with one camera. Yeah. On us. Hey, if anybody's listening to Google and wants to host Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and Robert and Jason, Jason Howell, Robert Balasare and Jeff Jarvis, all three of whom are going to be  at the keynote, we'll do our own coverage here, but I would love to, but that's Wednesday morning.  And then we'll do Windows Weekly. And then after Windows, we'll email the wonderful Maggie Shields.  Ask Maggie. Have you been following the great, it's just great drama over Satoshi Nakamoto,  Craig Wright, claiming- It is amazing. So do you believe him? No.  What's the- No. Oh, not even close. So, oh, it's kind of patently obvious that he all along has been  using the Bitcoin and Satoshi Nakamoto as part of a long con with the Australian tax authorities.  Yes. Oh.  And so, okay. So the question is, you know, could he be Satoshi Nakamoto? Some say he has the  knowledge, others say, you know, the one, the only data point that makes it as all the least bit  believable, setting aside the BBC's declaration that he is, the economist was a little mixed on  it. And of course, almost a year ago, Gizmodo and Wired magazine both said, we think we know  who Satoshi Nakamoto is. He's this Australian entrepreneur and technologist, a physics guy,  physics major named Craig Wright, Dr. Craig Wright. The only data point that made it be  somewhat believable this week was a blog post by the former director of the Bitcoin Foundation,  a man we've had on triangulation, Gavin Andresen, who is, you know, as far as I know, as far as  anybody knows, a man of integrity, who is one of the few people who's actually corresponded with  Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of Bitcoin, that everyone knows all along that has been a pseudonym  for one or more people. We don't even know to the degree that is it more than one person. No one has  ever known Andresen, one of the few people who's ever corresponded with him. And in 2011, when  Satoshi Nakamoto, person or persons, withdrew from the internet, just disappeared, the reins were  handed for Bitcoin to Gavin Andresen. He posted on his blog about three days ago, I believe Craig  Steven Wright is the person who invented Bitcoin. I flew to London to meet Dr. Wright. Part of the  time there was spent on careful cryptographic verification of messages signed with keys only  Satoshi should possess, etc. And that was what really set the world into a tizzy. Really? Gavin  believes it because Gavin, in fact, the response of the Bitcoin Foundation was to remove Gavin's  commit keys for Bitcoin, thinking that he'd been hacked. It can't possibly be Gavin saying that.  If you've been following it on slash r slash Bitcoin on Reddit, you'll see all the back and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  forth over that. So but the but the point here is that, you know, if he is Nakamoto, there's  straightforward cryptography, which he refuses to do. She refused to do so therefore he's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  right. That's seems to me. That's it. Yeah. Great post by Dan Kaminsky, in which he says he talks to  Gavin Andresen emailed him saying what's going on here. There's clear unambiguous cryptographic  evidence of fraud. And Gavin, you're lending credibility to the idea that a public key crypto  the public key operation could or should should or must remain private. And then this is Gavin's  response. Yeah, what the heck I was surprised by the quote proof as anyone and don't yet know  exactly what's going on. It was a mistake to agree to publish my post before I saw his I assumed his  post would simply be a signed message. Anyone could easily verify it wasn't. It was a screen capture  of a bogus bash script. It wasn't even real bash. It had it had a flaw in it wouldn't execute  had a single ampersand instead of a double ampersand and he why publish it as a bat as a  screenshot. It was probably a mistake to even start to play the find the Satoshi game. I do  feel grateful to Satoshi. If I'm lending credibility the idea that a public key operation should remain  private. That's entirely accidental. Of course, he should just publish a signed message or  equivalently move some Bitcoin through the key associated with an early block. Feel free to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  publish or quote this email. In other words, Gavin's backing down even though he doesn't hasn't yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  backed down in his blog. But they there's some talk that he was he was shown him purportedly  doing that but then didn't actually take the signatures. It sounded like a magic trick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. And I think that frankly what happened was that Gavin was conned. Yes. I think we interviewed  a wonderful book by the way, The Confidence Game. The author Maria Conocova writes for the New Yorker.  She's really good and it was a good book. It was about the grift the con and this this fits it to  a tee. This guy made money based on this supposition that he might be Satoshi Nakamoto. In fact, money  that the government, the Australian government wants back and he's fled Australia. The proof was  a lot of hand waving and nothing actual concrete. And these and we don't know exactly what happened  in private but it probably was a basically a magic trick designed to fool Gavin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don, I hope this is the next the new season of Mr. Robotics. It's such a great story. It really is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's I mean, so the thing is, security exploits and magic tricks are kind of a very  similar kind of process. Teller wrote about magic, Teller, Repentant, Teller, that the way  the magic trick works is you do something that's an unreasonable amount of efforts.  Nobody would expect you would have done it. And that's how you make a magic trick work.  And a lot of these security exploits are equivalent kind of thing. You do some reasonable  amount of effort to explore every possible pathway through the code until you find one that  lets you in. And so that I can, there's a, it's cryptography people should be less likely to be  fooled by this stuff, but they can often retreat into the mathematics of it rather than into the  practicalities of it. Most of the time people get hacked. It isn't because the cryptography  was at fault. It's because somebody gave them the key. And I love the post, the tweet from

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  WikiLeaks, which said the only thing this proves is what, how poorly the fact checkers at the BBC

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and the Economist are. Yeah, all, everybody's been just. You know, I think actually most people did

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  not fall for it. The good news is the Economist was dubious or at least said it's not for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's the thing is that the BBC got Gavin in to check it for them. So they trusted him.  They said, okay, this guy took over Bitcoin from Nakamoto. He's, he knows his way around this stuff.  He should be able to check this for us. And he didn't, you know, didn't work properly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and this is going to happen a lot because then, especially with things like crypto and  security, the knowledge required to do this is technically challenging, difficult.  And so you can't, I don't think you expect general purpose reporters to get this right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. But if you say there's a test here, you know, any Bitcoin client can consign with the  key, with your own key, right? It's in there in the, it's in the menu somewhere. It's a straightforward

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  thing to do. And then you can check that. That's a cryptographic based proof that is rigorous.  Yes. And so all he would have to, well, there's a couple of ways he could do it. He could just sign  a message with that key or although that would maybe mean that he just compromised Satoshi's key,  moving a Bitcoin from the Satoshi block. There's a, you know, Nakamoto himself owns a significant  amount of Bitcoin, which hasn't been moved or touched in years. Moving a block from that would  be a lot more, the fact that he hasn't done that is a little suspicious. Well, that was,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that was, this is my, this is my crazy conspiracy theory last night was that this is all a game to  get people to encourage him to move money from that block. Because, you know, one of the  panics about Bitcoin is that if that amount of money starts getting spent, then it will impact  the value of Bitcoin. Because it's too much of it. Right. You know, I wonder where Nakamoto is in all

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  of this. In the past, he said, no, it's not me. Well, no, no, no, not with a traceable account.  Oh, really? Okay. So the news when Newsweek unveiled their Satoshi Nakamoto a couple of years ago,  somebody said that Nakamoto, there was a message from a known Nakamoto account that said, no,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that's not me. But there wasn't provably Nakamoto. It wasn't, it was an email, it was, it was an email  account, but it wasn't signed with the key that's in the chat. That's the thing. That's the beauty,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  by the way, boy, this underscores the value. Now that it's under assault by nations all over the  world, including our own in Brazil. That's the value of strong crypto. Well, to a point, but the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  problem, you know, the other problem is, is that it's a credential thing. Most that, you know,  they, the head of the NSA said that actually we tend to win by stealing credentials rather  than by breaking crypto. And just being able to sign something with Satoshi Nakamoto's key just  means that you have the key. You could have, you could have got it, you could have got it off his

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  machine. You could have, one would hope that somebody like Satoshi Nakamoto would secure his  key. I secure my key. I mean, you'd have to break into my house to get it. Well, but this was, this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  is what this was, you know, I spent a chunk of time spending, and know my passphrase, which is a long,  strong passphrase. Sure. But, you know, I spent a chunk of time in the sort of trying to make sense  of the Bitcoin world a couple of years ago when it was ramping up. And the fascinating question  for me was always going to the meetups and people were saying, this is going to take over currencies,  you take over the universe. It's wonderful. It's provable, blah, blah, blah. And then I just did  that for a bit. Then I say, how do you keep your Bitcoin safe? And they said, Oh, I print them out  on bits of paper and lock them in a safe. Well, that's one way. You don't have to do that.  But the point is that because they are pure bearer tokens, and there's no repudiation,  you can get it stolen. If you have a size amount of bitcoins, they're going to be stolen.  There are other people who have them on little zip drives in safes as well. So it is a problem.  And it's a structural problem with the way that the system is set up. It's trying to solve a problem  that we kind of don't have, and it solves it in a very odd way, a very expensive way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am somewhat pleased, though, that the tech press at least didn't get sucked in by this.  They did before with Wired and Gizmodo both. Maybe we all were chastened by that experience  and now know better. But it was the BBC and The Economist. And I didn't see anybody in the  tech press jump on this one. The other thing that happened was,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I followed it at the beginning, and then I kind of got bored with it. So obviously I didn't stay  in track with it. I don't know why I'm so fascinated by this. I like a good con.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It would make a good movie. So the reason I bring that up is Nick Bilton writing in Vanity Fair blames  the tech press for Theranos. And I'm not sure that's strictly true. As somebody else pointed out,  it was in fact Vanity Fair itself, the New York Times, Tea Magazine, and the Wall Street Journal  that created the Theranos bubble. The tech press, I don't think really ever jumped on that Theranos

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  trainer, did they? Well, they did a bit. I mean, you know, she's a charismatic founder. She talked  at all their conferences. There was a chunk of that going on. But it's not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ah, it was a lot of the Wall Street Journal and Vanity Fair and The Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And somebody else wrote a piece last week that was like, well, it wasn't really Silicon Valley,  because none of the big firms invested in them. And it's like, yeah, really? Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is there anything to it? Is there a shred that just wasn't executed well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's starting to look more and more like... I don't know if Elizabeth Holmes is at fault or not. I  don't think you can decide that yet. But it's starting to look more and more like they never  had anything that worked. That's what I'm asking. Okay. Well, I suspect what they had was something

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that kind of worked. And then when they went to test it in detail, they found problems with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And they hired somebody to get it to work. And he's since past,  he ended up being very frustrated and skeptical of the whole thing. His wife has talked a little bit  about it in the Wall Street Journal, the famous Wall Street Journal piece that kind of turned it  all around. They quoted his wife extensively. And so it sounded like Elizabeth Holmes had an idea,  but it was never an idea that was really viable. Didn't stop them from going ahead and raising  money and getting... Well, here's the other reason I think there's some culpability  inside Theranos. They hired a board of directors not made up of medical experts, but of former  generals and celebrities. People who are completely incapable of judging the science.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was a bit fishy. No, but the thing is, I mean, the basic... I'm being cat invaded here.  Sorry. Thank you, Kat. Put you down. The idea that you can do blood tests on small amounts of blood  is not completely crazy, but you actually have to prove that first before you can actually do that.  And that does involve getting FDA approval, which is going to take a long time and do a bunch of  different stuff. We do it for diabetes testing. That's an established thing for taking a single  finger that sells in the millions. So it wasn't completely insane to say, well, if you can test  for diabetes, for blood sugar with a single drop from your finger, maybe we could test for other  things instead of doing a blood draw. But to actually do that, you have to do a bunch of  science and actually test it. And they raised enough money to do that work and they don't seem

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to have done it. So that's the bit that's dubious. It's like they did it, but they couldn't get it to  work really is what happened. And in any event, they're under investigation now and I hope we'll  find out what's going on. But I felt like it was a little unfair of Nick, who was one of us or was  one of us to write in Vanity Fair saying the secret culprit in the Theranos mess was the tech press.  When in fact, I think it was really much more the general press that was the secret culprit here,  but it was a good story. And so I guess there's something to say about the press often falling

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  for a good story as opposed to digging deeper. Well, also not just the press. I mean, the investors  too. This is Maché's wonderful formulation, which is the business model is investor story time.  What you're actually doing rather than raising money by building a site with lots of users and  selling advertising is that you're selling a very good story to a small number of investors who will  give you a few million dollars per head. And that is like the basis of lots of these companies,  that they can persuade some people to give them money and then it becomes a bandwagon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nick writes, the system here has been molded to effectively prevent reporters from asking tough  questions. This is the same and probably somewhat true the same complaint about beltway journalism,  that if you're going to cover Washington DC, you better go to the national correspondence dinner and  make nice with your sources or they're just going to cut you off and you'll have nothing.  He says it's a game of access and if you don't play it carefully, you may pay sorely. Then he  quotes Jason Calacanis, who says, if you look at most tech publications, they have major conferences  as their revenue. If you hit too hard, you lose keynotes, ticket buyers and support in the tech space.  Is that fair, Jeff? I don't think that's fair. No.  I don't have any conferences.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would say that Kara Swisher is in the pocket of tech. She's not. She's very honest and very tough  and people die to come to her conference and they pay a fortune for it. And she's tough on stage  there. That's Jason being Jason and going after everybody else's conference, but of course, his

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  will be wonderful. That's a good point. He happens to have a conference as well. In fact, that's  his main job. I'm not going to blame the tech press. I don't think that that's their fault.  I think if there's a flaw in the tech press, it's mostly that there's not much enterprise  journalism being done. It's mostly rewrites and opinion. And by the way, of which I'm completely  guilty, we don't do any enterprise journalism here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's the pressure to write lots of short pieces and rewrite each other rather than actually come  up with something new. The better organizations will spend some time doing long form things as

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  well. But it's a challenge. It's expensive. Somebody has to work on a story for a long time,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  months sometimes. It's expensive to have someone rewrite everybody else's press releases and posts  too. If you're employing three people full time to do that, then that's another problem, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that takes us now, as long as we're in that space, to Facebook's... By the way, did your  Facebook change dramatically today on Android? Mine did. Facebook, their interesting story about...  I haven't looked at it today.  Yeah, Facebook hiring journalists. Oh, yes, this.  Okay, Jeff, break it down, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, gee, they hired journalists they should have treated us like princes and princesses.  Instead, they put us in a room and had us do a task that we didn't like doing.  So they're really mean. They don't like journalists. They don't really care about

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  journalism because they were mean to me. Okay, so that's a whiny sounding story. They  weren't invited to beer bashes because they were contract employees and they were all sitting in

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  one conference room. They were there to test one function and do one thing and that was that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought the interesting thing was one guy said, I felt like we were inputs for an... We were giving  the inputs to an artificial intelligence machine that would eventually do this job without any  input from us. That that was... Well, it's no different from Google constantly using humans

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  to quality test the search. Yes, they use humans to check on things. And you could do it on  Mechanical Turk or you could do it in a conference room at Facebook. I have little empathy for this.  It's this belief that journalists are entitled and it's not an indication of a larger view of  what Facebook thinks of journalism. It was a function that they hired people for. This is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a article by Michael Nunez and Gizmodo. Want to know what Facebook really thinks of journalists?  Here's what happened when it hired some and he quotes a team that was brought in to curate the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  trending news section. I did find it amusing that part of their job was to replace the word  Twitter with social media. So I mean basically what they've done is hired people to do what  TechMeme does. That's what it sounds like. Because Gabe started out doing this in an automatic way  and then found that he had to hire people to rewrite the headlines to make the front page  coherent. So then it's probably just... He has an office around the world that does that. It's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  probably just a coincidence that then I fired up Facebook on my Android device this morning and all  of a sudden at the bottom now I have a new thing. I have a new thing. It says newsfeed. Well, I must  be in an A-B test or something. Newsfeed. World and U.S. news with its own very own little banner.  Funny. Health and fitness. Politics. Music. TV and movies. Travel. Is it all... I'm not clear where  these... Yes. And then I can choose... Let me see if I can find the settings for this. Oh, there it is.  I can choose which of these categories I want. And there's a lot of them. I took out home and garden  and sports which were in there originally. Games. Spiritual education. There's a selfies.  Celebrations. Thoughts. This is some... I don't know. It could very well be that I'm just an A-B  tester for something they'll never do. But if you... It says paper. Is that like paper?  This is Facebook's blue app for Android on my phone. And so what's interesting is... I think  these are... You see there you are, Jeff, in the science and tech. These are all from people I  follow. They're categorizing their posts for me. That's a big deal, Leo. That's what I thought.  Now I still have the Newsfeed. But this is... And each of them has its own headline... You know,  header. See, World and U.S. News with a customize button that allows me to decide which stories  within World and U.S. News I want to explore. And then I have some selections here. I can search  more posts from friends and others. That's important. Friends and others of that  interest in your... So while it does look like these are the people I'm following

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  so far, there's no reason to think... Do you follow some news brands that are in there as well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's what I'm wondering. How long before... Yeah, see, okay.  I don't know who Ian Faltz is and Global Nationals Video. So that looks like...  Okay, yeah. See, this is RT. So you know what? There is stuff. These are not... No, I don't. These  are people I don't follow. MSNBC. But these are being shared. These are being shared by other

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  people. But this is all news from other people. That's the issue right there. RT has real news  cooties. Yeah, well, I didn't pick it. And so that it gets put in there. I mean, the same problem  Google News has is that, oh, well, if you call yourself news, you're news. Yeah. Okay. So that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a question. I don't know if it's just people I follow. It doesn't look like it is. Now, I have  to say I immediately went to funny and there was a lot of good funny stuff. So at least I can  get... Go away from the politics in my feed and read the funny stuff. But yeah, so you don't see  that in your Android. Well, hold on. I'm redoing it right now. I hadn't updated it. You don't see  it either? Okay. So maybe it's just a test. It says what's new improvements for reliability and

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  speed. So I don't think my version will have it. We'll see. Well, it always says that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They don't write good release notes. They're very bad on the release notes. Yeah. Yeah, I know I love

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Slack. Let me see what my version number is here. I can tell you. It's installing, installing,  installing. It's just 4.0. What's new improvements for reliability and speed?  Well, 4.0 sounds like a major release. Well, it might've been for all... Facebook's so bad at  this. It might've been 4.0 forever. Let me see if I get a more granular number here somewhere,  if I can look at my settings or something. That's content. This is installing. Jesus.  I wish they would improve the UI. I mean, about 76.0.0.7.67. That's the actual version, not 4.0.  Does anybody else get that in their Android feed? So this... We've heard though for a while that  Facebook wanted to move from the feed of your family and friends' posts to news, right? They  want to be a news journal. Haven't we been hearing that, Jeff? Well, yes and no. I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they've run instant articles. They've done relationships with news companies, but they're  not... I don't think they've ever said that they're going to be a primary... This looks like Flipboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is like Flipboard, right? But it's categorized. Well, also Nuzzle. Or Nuzzle, yeah. So  nobody in the chat room has this. All right. So maybe this is just... I'm just... I'm a beta test,  but this would be interesting, wouldn't it? Yeah. All right. You've verified on Facebook,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  right there? Yeah. That might be why. Well, Jeff's verified. I'm trying to reinstall it again. Oh,  you took it out. No, no, no. I wasn't on auto update for Facebook for some reason. That's what  Jason can't... It's just like I'm not in focus now. Jason Howell does is he doesn't... It's his opinion

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that Facebook kills his battery life. So he uses a Facebook web interface. Well, there you wouldn't  get this. Okay. Just thought I'd raise that issue. That's a newsflash, I'd say. Yeah. I feel like

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Facebook is moving in that way. Well, the bottom line, and we have the discussion all the time when  it comes to YouTube, Facebook, in my view, needs to hire journalists to better understand journalism  and better know what its responsibilities and lack of responsibilities are and limits are and  opportunities are and to translate to the world and all that. But Facebook should not get into the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  content business. Yeah. Well, you know, after the primary last night, there were a number of people  wondering, would Facebook take a stand in the presidential election upcoming? I think everybody  kind of agrees that they could use... They would have some influence, don't you think? Then they'd  be calling some countries to regulate them. Yeah. Google, for instance, is being criticized  because they're going to pump some money into the Republican convention in Cleveland. They're going  to do live streaming for them. And they put several hundred million dollars into the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  conventions four years ago. I say putting in money to cover the conventions and what the networks do,  but putting in money in the way that they profit from would be bad. Yeah. No, not like that. More  like brought to you by. I mean, Google and Facebook and Twitter have been fighting over  association with all the debates. So they work with Fox News and the debate, one or the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, their idea is that we'll do the same for the Democrats. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google also, this is in the right answer, Google also put up $250,000 for the Flint water crisis.  Okay. Research and stuff. And that's a political stance in a sense. Google's going to be the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  official live stream provider of the Republican convention. Is that the same as NBC? No.  That's different. You're the official, the official live stream provider, but they're going to do that  for the Democrats too. I think these, both Facebook and Google really have, could influence the  election. We know this. And, but, but your, it's your opinion that they will be extremely cautious  not to do so. They're going to be very careful. You don't think that Mark Zuckerberg will be

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  tempted? No, but, but, but I'm honestly not trying to get political here. I'm trying to get  hypothetical. You know, what if we came to a moment where it really, really got ugly, that a certain  presidential candidate got just beyond a whole lot of races. I mean, Mark, Mark Zuckerberg is obviously  a very liberal person. No, I don't know that that's true. No, some of this, I don't know. You should  assume that. I think that he has, but of course, who, how do you define conservative and liberal  these days when Donald Trump is going to the left of Hillary Clinton? I know, and some things. On

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  trade and defense and all these things. All the labels are off. I don't know where I am anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's wacky. But I think, I think Mark is also very much a capitalist. However, if you're going to say

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  anything, one thing that Donald Trump has shown is that he has a mastery of the internet and social  media and was able to use it to very much to his advantage, right? Yes. And I think, you know, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  my theory, thinking these days, I'm thinking a lot these days about the idea that we're past the mass  media business model and thus past the notion of mass. And so what we see is tribes reforming,  and those tribes are not made of soil or blood. They're made in new ways and by new affiliations,  new affinities. And those tribes can now find each other and go and do things like tear down

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the Egyptian government or tear down the GOP. You have to read Andrew Sullivan's New York piece,  because that's exactly what he's talking about. And it basically, what new media has done,  what social media has done, what the internet has done is make this a more democratic country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, normally you would hear me saying that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but he says, he's quoting Plato's Republic saying, here's what, here's Socrates says,  tyranny is probably established out of no other regime than democracy. That in fact, once you get  to true democracy, then you are as ripe as you will ever be for tyranny. Yeah, I think that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  true because the problem is that our institutions make other presumptions than we have today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He says the elites protect us from this direct drive democracy. And it is the overthrow of the  elites, in this case, the Republican elites, and the people speaking directly through the primary  process. And it couldn't have happened without the internet. It's why you see Bernie Sanders  so strong too. Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The other thing that's odd here is that everyone's suddenly saying it would be very strange if  Facebook took an editorial line on politics. And yet somehow newspapers and television stations  are able to simultaneously make enormous amounts of money from selling political advertising in  certain regions, and also take both editorial and endorsement lines for candidates as well.  So there's a sort of presumed raw set that's there for traditional media, where you can say,  well, the New York Times will very carefully deliberate and eventually endorse Hillary and  so on. And the economists will actually- And no one will care because they're just a friend.  And the economists will think about it a bit more. And Fox News will do whatever Fox News does.  But the point is, simultaneously, they're also expecting to be making large amounts of their  revenue from selling advertising. And the bizarre thing that Trump has done is he has  danced along the line between that very well, where he creates enough noise that they can  treat it as something to report on, and sell advertising to other people, and he's not buying  the advertising. So he's kind of breaking this sort of presumed American consensus of the way  this works is you're supposed to raise a billion dollars and spend it on TV ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One tiny area in which he's changed everything. Sullivan writes, if late-stage political  democracy has taken two centuries to ripen, the media equivalent took about two decades,  swiftly erasing almost any elite moderation or control of our democratic discourse.  And so much of this was welcome. You celebrated, I did, the people have a voice,  fusty old media institutions grown fat and lazy, deserved a drubbing, the early independent  blogosphere corrected facts, exposed bias, earned scoops, and as the media matured and  as Facebook and Twitter took hold, everyone became a kind of blogger. I want you to read this,  Jeff. I apologize, I didn't read it. Life's kind of out of focus right now. You get that sense?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're a little disoriented? Out of focus. Yeah, blurry, blurry. It's blurry. But your

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  books behind you are in perfect focus, by the way. You see, literature, it's always in focus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What was I saying? Oh, well, the problem is there are institutions. I talked about this before.  There's a great book called The Institutional Revolution that the institutions becomes  obsolete. And when you can measure things that you couldn't measure before, the institutions  you set up to get over those weaknesses. So the institutions we set up with a two-party system.  And even though we're not a mass, the structure forced us into two masses. Half of us are red,  and half of us are blue, and we'll just figure it out. And we'll do it in a civilized way,  and we'll be fine. And you all have to be Republican, you all have to be Democrat at some  point, because that's the only way it's going to work. Unlike parliamentary systems in other  countries, in the UK and Europe. People are rapidly getting upset with that system.  Well, exactly. So it's not that we become more purely democratic, it's that a  pent up anger at the institutions that were there are a problem. The question is,  is the Constitution outmoded in this age? That's a much bigger question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Interesting question. Sullivan writes, Trump intuitively grasped the vanishing authority  of American political and media elites, and he had long fashioned a public persona perfectly attuned  to blast past them. Really, I think, you know, very interesting, interesting article.  We have we have reaped what we have sown, I guess. Or maybe this is just a little blip as we adjust  to this notion of a true democracy, and that everything will come back to normal. I don't,  what role does the Constitution have, really? If the media elites have fallen,  and the political elites have fallen, can the Constitution be far behind?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, can the notion of the nation be far behind? Right.  That's what we're talking about, really, here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, so here's a scenario. So let's say a president decides to ignore Congress and to ignore  the Supreme Court. The only thing to stop him is the military.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And let's say the military refuses to follow the orders of a president.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Then you have a military coup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You bet. Even if they just refuse to, not if they do something on their own, not if they take over,  but they just refuse what they believe is an unlawful law.  That's taking over.  Order away, isn't it? It's deciding what-  That's what we expected in Nuremberg. It's what we expected the military to do.  That's really fascinating.  There's precedent in our own jurisprudence to say that that's what you should be required to do.  Who is the defender of the Constitution? We live in interesting times.  Not doing your job to talk to a Supreme Court nominee.  There is an argument that says that's a constitutional crisis in and of itself.  Right.  Oh, we're going to piss off so many of your viewers, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, I don't think this is a partisan conversation.  I think this is an observation about what is happening in America,  and something very dramatic seems to be happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's key to what we talked about, because it is about the challenges to these institutions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that's it. I think there was a good piece by David Graeber who made a resonant  comparison for me, which was calling back to Britain in the 70s. In effect, there,  that was when there was a big sea change in politics, where we went from the default  left liberal consensus to the default neoliberal market consensus when Thatcher came to power.  A big chunk of that was because the institutions broke down in the UK in the 70s. We had  three-day weeks because there were power cuts, and we could only have power for three days a week,  and the IMF came to bail out the UK. There was this collapse in social order in that sense  that led to people saying, well, we need something different than what we've been doing in politics.  The free market libertarianism that Thatcher latched onto was that new thing.  Graeber's argument is that the 2008 economic collapse and the fallout from that  is that set of presumptions, the neoliberal set of assumptions, collapsing, and we're now in a  state where people are looking for something else. The question is, will we settle on something  that's actually coherent, or will we end up with something that is chaos? That does tie in with  what Sussan Sullivan was saying there. In other news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not, because what we're really seeing is the result of a lot of things, but in one  respect of the internet era, and a disintermediation and a destruction ultimately of a media elite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A political elite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Elites in every respect. Government elite, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's to a great degree, I would say, because of the internet.  We have new elites, and this is where it kind of gets back to the question I asked earlier.  We have new elites. Facebook and Google are the new elites. What do they do? Do they stand back  and abrogate their responsibility? What is their responsibility?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I'm trying to, I needed some reading up on the Frankfurt School, because the argument that  mass media was owned by the elites and is used to tamp down our brains and desires and just to that.  So one could argue, some do argue, I think my friend Emily Bell argues, when we get the  one, we'll finally get our show up soon. Mass media is the opiate of the people.  All of them. Well, religion, but same difference, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well that's what I'm saying. In the absence of religion, now we have mass media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So some would argue that Facebook and Google are the replacements for that. Indeed, the mere name  social media. I argue these days, social media is a misnomer. We in media see the world God-like.  We think that if you do anything that approaches to what we do, then we call that media. But Facebook  is not media. Google is not media. Even though they do some of the functions that we did,  even though they compete with us and sell ads, they are connection machines. They are not content  machines. They don't aspire to be.  But they are mediating. I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're media in that they're mediating. They're not writing, but they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I mean newspapers were created to do exactly the same thing, to sell ads, to do display ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're doing something different, Kevin. They are enabling far, far, far more people to speak  than we ever had possible in the media structure we have. That is true, of course, yes.  And so they're disintermediating media. They're doing the opposite. So that the elite that we  had of a few publishers in towns is what they tore apart. And that's what we resent so much in media.  So they're doing the opposite of that. That's what they live and thrive on is giving everyone  this voice, including trolls, dorks, and idiots on Twitter and, you know, cat lovers on Facebook  or whatever. We're not going to like it. It's not the elite anymore. It's the evidence that  it's not the elite. So I don't think that they're a one-for-one swap. That's all I'm arguing there.  Do they have power? Absolutely. Do we know yet how they're going to do? Do they even know their own power?  No, they don't yet. Do we know how they're going to use it? No, we don't. Do we trust them? Well,  for now, I do. But I'd be a lot more trusting in them if I think they were more self-aware of their power.  But I don't think they're media. You don't think they have ambitions?  I think they recognize the danger of playing out. If they did have ambitions, I think they recognize

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  they were dangerous to their business. Isn't this what Facebook is doing with this curated feed  disintermediating and taking a position of curation, of editing, of old media?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's based, their argument will be, it's based on what you have shown you like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. But the point is that there's a certain disingenuousness to that.  Yes, I agree. There was a thing in NYMAG, the feed is dying, and if you saw that one, I just stuck the link in.  But it's basically saying you're losing the sense that this timeline view that we had  makes sense, but the problem is it doesn't work as you keep following people. It suddenly becomes  too much. And I recognize this problem from years of feed reading and so on, is that  you start out with like, there's not enough here, there's not enough here, I'll add some more, and then  suddenly there's too much, and then you're like, ah, what do I look at? And so yes, they are saying  we need to algorithmically filter your feed for you because you've overloaded yourself by following  too many people. But then they also have... Chronological rights Casey Johnston does not scale well.  Right. But the other bit in there that I liked was the, which of course I can't find now, but  was that you eventually realize that there is not one web out there, there are lots of webs out there,  and you only see this when you leak through into some other world where something else is going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Unless you're part of the mainstream that uses Facebook an hour or more a day.  That's the problem. Facebook is a total consolidation of what was flattened  democratic media has suddenly come right back to where it was.  Isn't Facebook the number one way most people get their news now? I think it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, so this is the passage that I thought, that said this to me, was it says,  social media is a multi-verse of interest pockets, and you'd never know they were  coexisting until you notice a tiny rip in the space-time continuum. A widely shared  Facebook post, a viral tweet, a slideshow of 20 Instagrammers you must follow. You pull it open,  and suddenly you're in a world of Christian women Instagramming their perfectly laid-out  books, spirit-shaming your memes, teens who are extreme fans of Jason Derulo, and that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what Jeff Jarvis has said all along, there's no filter bubble because stuff leaks in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But well, it's not leaks in, but it also, it leaks in in this, you know,  it leaks in poorly designed ways because people haven't thought about that aspect of it very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, that's true. You're absolutely right. It's poorly designed. We're just starting.  But Kevin, the paradox there is everyone's going to complain that when it's well designed,  it's manipulative. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, of course, and they already do. You know, there's this whole like,  I'm being shadow banned on Twitter thing, which is, you know, basically the fundamental perception  problem with power distributed media, which is that everyone has more followers than you.  And the reason everyone has more followers than you is that the people who have more  followers are more visible, so everyone you see has more followers than you.  And so people suddenly say- And when you have more followers,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that becomes at some point, people don't realize this, but at some point it becomes a detriment.  It's more noise and it's more chance for abuse.  Last week I had people saying to me, oh, if only I had my own imposter, you should be honored.  Yes. It comes from, as Leo can well attest, too much attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's like, it's also misunderstanding that's- the fundamental misunderstanding is how these  power distributed things work. And that happens at lots of levels because people model them-  Table one. Poorly.  So table one.  But so the basic thing is that this is the long tail argument. There are power distribution  of things. So there are very popular things and the second most popular thing is half as popular  and the third is the third as popular and so on. And that rough pattern of one over X  plays out across lots of media. Now what happened with the expansion of the web is that  the range you could actually see of that went up a lot. So instead of just being able to see the top  200 people writing articles because they were the ones who were paid by the newspapers, you could see  2 million of them. And so it goes along a lot further. I showed this in the Technorati 10 years ago.  Yes, exactly. Back in the day, yes.  But this holds true for all these things. And as the number of people on board grows even further,  when Facebook gets up to the billions, this same pattern holds. But second order things start  taking effect and the waves that happen in between them start taking effect. But the classic thing  that they do is they do this, you're either famous or you're not. So Twitter has the Verify people  who are famous and are in the top end of the curve and then it has the rest of you who are supposed  to consume and the bottom end of the curve and doesn't have a good mental model for how things  can move between them. But actually, the power law stuff applies at all the levels in between.  So it doesn't just apply to an individual's fame, it applies to a post's fame as well. So somehow you  may make a remark that takes off and gets famous and bursts out, as the guy says, bursts out across  the barriers. And then you have got the person who wrote that has gone through the transition  from these two into these two domains and is now going to be attacked by everyone on Earth for saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Star Wars can't. There was a great story this week about this. Oh, I know. 10 years later.  Yeah. And how miserable he was and how he had to move. Yes, it burst across and it hurt him.  I also, I have to confess, after having Twitter hell last week, I longed for Facebook.  Build a wall around me, Donald. You know, they're much more civil, much more control in my hands.  The wall garden, the flowers are a lot nicer than the ones that the dogs pee on in Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. But you had a squire hell, really, right? I mean, that was the catalyst for it. But no,  so the point is that, yes, because Twitter is busy trying to curate the feed you see  and is not spending the same amount of effort as curating the responses to posts  and understanding how to model those. So they have a...  They'll get there.  They'll get there.  Well, I hope so. I feel like I want to like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Two things. So one, I finally, finally, finally started using Inbox. And now, so I had an exchange  with a Google executive this week. I just met somebody at a conference I was at yesterday.  And she emailed me. And the Inbox response was just the exact right response. But I felt a little  creepy. I figured she's going to know. I just get to Google.  I know. It's too good.  That's what it is, right?  Yes.  And as we discussed on the show last week, you get to the point where it says, oh, I already  responded to her, took care of that, because I knew that's what she wanted. And I'm right all  the time. So it's fine. So the same executive, she's the woman in charge of Google Play,  said that Larry's view is that the web goes from a web of intent to assisting to suggesting.  And a friend of mine, Dave Morgan, said, oh, the next step is persuading.  And so that if the system gets so good and so well...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It doesn't have to do that. It doesn't have to autorespond or persuade.  I mean, you could keep going.  Capability.  Will it just because it can?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no. So the point is...  I'm just saying once it's there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But this is actually the sort of fundamental human condition problem is that we respond well to  stories. And we were talking about this earlier about responding well to the stories of the  startups and so on. We respond well to stories and narratives. And so people get good at  constructing them. And as we sort of spend time iterating over this with large AIs and  journalists in rooms training AIs and so on, we're going to train these machines  to be very good at doing the Trump thing of saying the thing that makes the audience that  he's standing in front of respond well. And part of the reason that the net works for him and works  against him at the same time is that he does that and then you can compare it against audiences,  but he doesn't care. That was the thing that... The politicians have always responded to the room  and told one set of people one thing and one set another. In previous election cycles, this was a  cause for shock and gasping when... We've gotten over that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's an email from Trey Radcliffe to me. I don't want anything just sending you love hugs,  T, which is very sweet. That's Trey. He's a sweetheart. And look at Google's suggestions.  How are you? I miss you. And that's so sweet. I wish I could do all of them  because those are right on. Right. Damn. My fear is that my responses...  And now if I do that, I feel guilty because that was an automated response to a genuinely  heartfelt... Yes.  Unless his message was generated as well. But it is... Isn't that amazing that Google knew that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that was an appropriate response? One of the responses today was I was having  a scheduling problem and it said, how about 1030? I don't know if I saw that.  Was it the right answer? No, it wasn't because I wanted another day.  But it's trying. And if you look at XAI, it was Amy. They're trying to learn how to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And will we embrace our new... Will we say, yeah, go ahead and answer that email for me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I've got one here that says, yes, we've got Homebrew Website Club tonight. And someone's saying,  I'll see you at 630. And they also responses, see you at 430.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's a problem. Okay, it's not perfect. That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google knows.  Time zones are always hard.  Okay, I'll see you at 430. That's pretty funny.  So it's like, well, I can't take that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So my boss says to me, I let her... She says, okay, keep me posted. Thanks. Google's responses.  I will. Thank you. Will do. You bet. What disturbs me is that every single one of those ends with  what we call in the business a banger, an exclamation point. Now, is that because I  use too damn many exclamation points? Or is that Google trying to be over enthusiastic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it depends. It's the trainings that they trained it on, clearly. If they trained it on  you, if they trained it on a large pool of... That's the question. What do they do? I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that how I sound? I've used it to hold back on my responses.  As you should.  I see it and I go, you know, I think I'm just going to go with...  Tempered responses better. See you soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it can save you. Yes.  It's very interesting. Here's some good news. When Google bought Motorola, Rick Osterloh ran the  place and I thought that a great job. Responsible for Moto X. Did just a bang up job of making great  hardware. He was also responsible for Moto Blur, but he apologized to me for that.  And he said we had to. In those days, Android wasn't ready for prime time. We had to put our  own skins on it. Good news. Rick left after Livanova acquired Motorola from Google. He stayed a little  while, but he left Motorola. He is now back at Google building hardware. He's going to  had a new hardware division and I can't think of a better person to do it. I mean, he just  really got it. He did a great job with Motorola and I will love to see what he does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Please, please, please let it include a continuation of the Chromebook Pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think we're going to enter a golden age of hardware from Google. So he's going to be  responsible for Nexus, which is, I think, widely agreed to be among the top Android phones and the  reference platform. He's going to work on Chromecast. Biggest success out of Google's hardware  division is Chromecast and Chromecast Audio. Consumer hardware, including the new Chromebook  laptops and Pixel C device. OnHub, that could use some attention. OnHub hasn't really gone anywhere.  ATAP, which is the Advanced Technology Group, that's the project, among other things, the project  era, which was the modular phone and Google Glass. Man, I am so glad that they brought back

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Rick Osterloh. This is really, really good. So no Nest stuff, no Home stuff, no anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, that's a separate company under Alphabet. This is, you know, I believe, I really believe that  the Chromebook is just about to, just hockey sticks. What do you think of it? So there's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  new HP, we talked about the plug-in machine. Three beautiful, yeah, three beautiful new Chromebooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  HP's looks fabulous. Three? I thought there were two. Well, Acer has the other, those are both  aluminum, and Dell is doing now Chromebooks for Business. All three are what we were begging for,  which is kind of mid-range, $500-ish high-end Chromebooks. Is the HP a touchscreen? It is not.  What's interesting is few of these are touchscreens. In fact, I don't think any of them,  well, no wait, the Acer, no, the Dell has a touchscreen, or can be equipped with a  touchscreen, but neither the Acer nor the Acer. And again, I'm just going to, I'm going to, I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  going to kvetch here, as I always do, no LTE in any of them. I'll pay them monthly. I want it there.  It just goes on wherever I am. It's a beautiful thing. In fact, put in Google Fi into it, and I'm  a really happy kid. Wouldn't that be? Well, you saw that Rick is going to oversee Chromebooks for

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google, and I would bet you that there will be a successor to Pixel that will maybe be better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We'll see. Now, do you think, because you were prescient last week, Leo, when you said that you  couldn't get any repairs on the old Chromebook, and then the $999 Chromebook is no longer for sale,  the more expensive one is, but I wonder if they're just playing out the spot. I wonder if they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  going to announce something to I.O. That would be great. And here's what I also expect at I.O.,  is an Android store on Chromebook, on Chrome OS. And I think that's fascinating. I feel like  here we go. This is going to be a compelling argument, because now you'll be able to,  if you want a word processor, you can add a word processor. You want some better games,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you can add some better games. The issue has always been, in that case, is that the UI of the Android  apps doesn't work on a laptop and doesn't work without touch. It's a window. It's going to be,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  what, a portrait window? And it does need touch, you're right. Although I guess a mouse could

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  duplicate touch in every respect, right? Yeah. I mean, you can run the emulator and click things,  but it's still going to be a little odd. Yeah. It's harder to do pinch. It's not so much, you  know, you can touch and click. You want to do pinch and those kinds of things, that's where

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it gets tricky. Well, I would guess that we'll see, I mean, Google to put touch in the pixel,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and I would guess we'll continue to see touch. Wait, I can't wait until they give us all a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  self-driving car to go home with. Well, I just feel like Chromebook is, you know, Jeff, you were

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  a supporter early on, and I think you're- I'm more than a supporter. I'm an addict. You're 100%.  Yeah, because I got all depressed last week when you said that there was no more support for  the old Chromebooks. I thought, uh-oh, what if they lost favor? And I can't go with a low-end one.  I mean, I have to have a high-end one. And the HP looks very good, and that gives me some comfort,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but I love the pixel. It's a core, look at 3K display, core M, 16 gigs of RAM,  USB-C, which is going to be gangbusters. I think we're going to see a USB-C universe in another year  or two. And USB-C to charge? Yeah. But USB-C has so much more capability, including, and HP's doing  this, the ability to drive big monitors direct. Oh. Uh-huh. Oh. Uh-huh. With two full HD displays,  if you want. And gigabit ethernet using an HP dock. So, uh, starting with a 4 gig version,  started $499. If you want to get the core M, 7, 16 gigs of RAM, $1,029. So this is the mid to high.  That's pixel range. We're mid to high now. But it's aluminum. It's, by the way, prettier than  the pixel. The pixel is kind of a clunker. This really looks like an ultrabook. It is an ultrabook.  In fact, it's basically HP's ultrabook with the Chrome OS. And it's coming out later this month?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. I wonder whether they're going to get Best Buy shelf space or not.  Because the little, you go to Best Buy now, right? Mondo, huge Samsung display,  unbelievably huge Microsoft display, and this little tiny table with Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but remember, Chromebook is now the number one seller in schools. 21% of all new computers

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  last year in schools were Chromebooks. And, you know, you've often recommended it as a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  grandma machine. Yeah. On the radio show now, I just, what I say, and I think this is really true,  is, you know, 10 years ago, you had to buy Windows or Mac, a full, a full general PC  with all that entailed, the cost, the complexity, the security issues. But that's all you had. That  was the choice. That was all you had to choose from. And we still, there's a little inertia for  these full service, full purpose operating systems that shouldn't be, most people just surf the web  and get email. And a Chrome, Chrome OS is exactly right for the vast majority of PC users. They're  over buying, they're buying much more complexity than they need. And as a result, I mean, I get  calls all the time from people's, you know, my start menu has disappeared on Windows 10. What do  I do? And it's like, you're screwed. And if they had a Chromebook, I'd say power wash, and you're  done. Five minutes max. Yeah. I hope adding Android doesn't add to the complexity and make it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I had a weird experience a couple of weeks ago, which was the Android update came in for my  phone and bricked it. And that was a, that was a, that was a six. That was a six, Kevin, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes. It happened to. Wow. Yeah. That happened to a lot of people. The 6P?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Six. Six. Oh, the Nexus six. Oh, get rid of that thing. That's two years old. Oh,  come on, pick up one of your spares. By the way, you should, I'll be glad to give you one.  That's by the way, another thing that's a very unfortunate trend is people are starting,  companies are starting to treat two years as the normal lifespan for a smartphone, which is so  wrong. But for security reasons and hardware reasons, they're not, I mean, it's just a big

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  mistake. So what happened, Kevin, did you, did you get in the dev for the new OS? What I had to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  was, yeah, I had to, the problem is it's, it's now locked. It was locked. So I couldn't re-install it.  I couldn't even reinstall that operating system, but I could install the, the alpha of, of, of N.  So I'm now running Android N on it, which is interesting. Actually, it is not bad. I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm running one of my 6P and my Pixel C. They made the notifications much less readable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I really don't like that. Yeah. They balled them all up together, but I kind of like that balled up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I like the notifications much better. They're more, they're more informative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they're, the type is smaller and grayer and they've got like huge margins around them.  Yeah. Yeah. I know what you're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Age.  Yeah, I think that that's a, that's the kind of cosmetic thing though.  Age and typographical fuzziness.  For sure. No, no, no, that's, that's the kind of thing you see in an early release.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. No, I think, I hope they'll fix that. But no, I mean, there's, you know, I've got a long  rant, which I should actually write up at some point about Google gradually making every bit of  text on the system grayer and grayer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So damn young engineers, gosh darn it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, no, it's the designers in the, in the perfectly lit rooms with the big screens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And young eyes. Yeah.  You can see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the latest thing is the phones now like dim the screen as well. So the new iPhone makes it  the color of whatever lighting you're in. And they, and they will, so they, they, they turn it  orange at night and so on. So it's like, so first we took the contrast down and now we're going to  actually make it even more illegible just when your eyes are really tired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're trying to tell you, put the phone down and go to bed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go to bed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's Ariana Huffington getting after you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh yeah. She's, she's, she's, she's the queen of good sleep. Now. She's like the expert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's all she is. I wrote a piece about six weeks ago, which I said, please Ariana, we don't need

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  another Oprah. We need the old political Ariana back. Bring her back now. If more than ever,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  ever now more than ever. So I saw Helio. So I, I, I did a panel today at the wonderful DLD conference.  Oh, neat. And, uh, on the panel was Gabe from Casper. Oh, nice. So I said as a matter of one  of our sponsors disclosure and, uh, uh, gratitude, I said, right. The loyal sponsor. He said that the  twit users are the most engaged and, and passionate and loyal and they just, they're,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  they're amazing. You know, it's so funny cause we hear that for every single advertiser says that,  but a lot of them don't want to say that cause they're afraid we're going to like charge them  more. So I mean, those who will, who will say anything will always say that every single sponsor.  I mean, that's what, and that's why people come back year after year. Um, but so it doesn't  surprise me. And that, and it's no credit to me. That's a credit to you. The people who listen to  these shows, the twit army is quite amazing. And yeah, you deserve a cut. Your cut is you get all  this for free. That's the, that's the cut is that the sponsors pay for it so that we can, we can  give it to you for free. He was so happy with the commercial you made. Oh, nice. That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, putting on your pajamas, that is going the extra. Not necessarily. I think putting on

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  your pajamas is kind of taking it easy. That's, that's more of a kind of a slack thing. That's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  more of a, um, feed up and playboy thing. You have to, you have to, you have to, you have to, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google has released a trips app. I haven't seen it yet. I guess it's in beta. I really want to

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  see it. It's only, they're only testing it in the community. It should be so afraid.  Trip. It should be so afraid. I love the way on, on, I love the clustering of travel stuff on,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  on inbox. Yeah, that's a start. It was new to me. It's, it's great. This looks like a better  trip at basically, right. And because Google owns ITA, it could really be a better trip. They have  a lot of information already, um, that they can tie into this. So look for Google trips. The APK  mirror does have it, but I don't recommend installing stuff that way. Um, all about Android  viewers. You can do that, but not, not us. Uh, let's see. Did you read the founders letter?  Oh, you got it. Did you put it on there, Jason, from the, uh, APK crossload? Oh man,  Jason's an early adopter. Jason's the band. Jason, not how Clantus are producers. Yeah,  Clantus. Oh, it's pretty, it's pretty, pretty trip to Sonoma. And then you can download,  look, there's a switch to download San Francisco. I presume that's the map. So you have it on. Oh,  man. Let's add a trip search destination, new trip for my location. Nice. I'm tempted. I'm tempted  to get this, but I'll wait. I'll be a good boy. I'll be a good boy. I wish I could side load the  new Facebook. Yeah, I'm sure. I guess I must, it must be a, I must be in a soak test of some kind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So yeah, that's the thing is that that will be a percent turn on thing. Yeah. That's part of the  reason their release notes are so vague is because everyone's an experiment. Yeah. They're known to

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  do that. Right. Yeah. Yeah. I'm surprised they don't identify everybody in media and cut them

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  out of us. Um, well, we'll keep you up with all Leo's phones will be hard. They don't know.  Leo lauders his phone once a week. It's a burner phone. They have no idea who this phone belongs to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they might, I don't know how they would know. How would you know that? They know  your account. They probably do. Do you have the new, do anybody have the new Google keyboard?  Is that widely? Uh, cause I've been reading about that. I use, I still use Swift key. I should

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  probably, I use 50. So I wouldn't know if I got the new, yeah, me too. I like the same damn keyboard

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  since, you know, sixth grade. I can't, no, no, no, on the phone, man, on the phone. I know that,  I know that, but I just, it's just, I just, I don't like keyboard changes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  On the phone, man. All right, let's take a break. Dude, come back with more Google Chrome. Now the  most popular web browser in the world. Google plays now labeling which apps contain ads. Thank  you. I'm going to try and get this Google keyboard while we're talking about headspace.  You know, it's, we live in a stressful world. It was up late last night, worrying, worrying,  worrying, worrying. And, uh, that means I didn't get a great night's sleep. And that means,  I was a little cranky in the morning. And that means I probably snapped at least a little more  than I should have. That's when I fired up headspace and calmed down. Look, our minds  are the enemy within. They can weigh us down with fear, with anger, with stress, anxiety,  to the point where it's difficult to sleep, difficult to get through the day. But you do  not have to live this way. Train your mind. There's an app you can put on the phone called  Headspace. And I love it from this great guy, Andy Puttycomb. Andy was a monk for 10 years.  And, uh, you know, like a Buddhist monk and so learned meditation and all that.  And now his mission is to kind of, uh, in a very normal non-mystical way, bring the benefits of  meditation to everybody. His Ted talk about meditation has five and a half million views.  And he's the leader in the meditations on Headspace. And I hear Andy's voice. And I  just immediately, you're really conditioned because he's so cute and sweet. And he just says,  now it's time to relax a little bit and just be a little like a gym membership. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  See, he's just using proven meditation and mindfulness techniques. How to train your mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's not fussy and he's not, you know, there's not a lot of, a lot of kind of,  it's like a friend in your head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The best place to start is with take. I kind of have a crush on Andy. I'll be honest with you,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but he's made my life so much better. Now we all know meditation  is an ancient, ancient tradition, but maybe you didn't know that there are literally thousands  of scientific studies that show it really works. It will help you improve focus. It'll,  it will help your relationship harmony. It will decrease anxiety and stress.  My physician told me, he said, you don't want to get a heart attack. Okay. You need to modify  your diet. You need to exercise and you need to reduce stress. You need to find some techniques  to reduce stress in your life. You know that Jeff, you had a very stressful week last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So much so that I could have used this because I literally was getting,  I was getting palpitations, relations. Yeah. And I have to,  it's got a big difference in my life. I have to, I have to,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not going to make medical claims, but I gotta say it's just breathing 10 minutes a day.  First 10 sessions are free. If you meditate for several days in a row, you're going to get up some  bonus gifts. It's unlimited access with the subscription to heads, the head space collection,  including, I love this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do they also have a hit squad for trolls?

That's why you sit in your garden. Isn't it,  Kevin? You just want this right here with the birds and the cat and the poodles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so. Well, somebody on Twitter asked how come there are always oranges on that tree?  And I think we're going to find out it's a fake tree. No, no, this is how oranges work. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  those fruits are only about such a Kevin Mark statement. That's how oranges work.  It's like apples. They're in season for like, you know, three weeks. Soft fruit like peaches  the last two days, if you're lucky. Whereas citrus fruits, basically, they just stay on the tree as  long as you want to keep them there. They get thicker and thicker. I mean, if you're if you're  growing them commercially, then you harvest them at a certain point. So they're all the same size  and same ripeness. But basically, they come in the end of the year, they come in sort of December ish.  And I just don't bother picking them. And they just get bigger and bigger. And then the new ones  come in the next time around. So the big orange ones are from last year, and then the little tiny  green ones that are coming in for next year. But it means that they the pith gets thicker,  but they and they get a little bit sweeter and but they're good. The lemons are even better that  way. The lemons that stay on the tree get get really delicious over time. So my mouth is watering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you may remember, I think we even reported on it that Sandy Gould, who is the HR chief

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  at Yahoo decided to leave last month, or actually in March, he wrote an email saying he was time to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  take a break and decide on this next adventure. So there's some debate over why he's back.  According to his tumblr, he had a dream. He had a dream. Or she I'm sorry, had a dream.  No, he I'm sorry. I'm Sandy. It's ambiguous. He had a dream that he was talking to Mercer Meyer  and discussing his new role while reviewing offers. So Sandy says next morning, I called  Brian and said, you're gonna think I'm crazy. Now, that might have been his dream, or could be the  fact that Yahoo offered him many millions of dollars not to leave. And that was a dream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was at it where he was going. Where do you think it was going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no one says just, you know, according to Kara Swisher, who read the email, the internal  email, of course, just time to take a break and decide my next adventure. Apparently, Melissa  Marissa did come to him not in a dream and make a multi million dollar offer to keep him. And  well, actually, you know, you're maybe you're right, Jeff, because according to sources,  this is Business Insider. Meyer made the counter after after finding out Gould was leaving to join  a company she resents. Wonder who she resents. Well, anyway, if you're gonna if you're gonna go  to a company, Marissa Meyer resents is probably for a big offer. And Yahoo had a bigger offer  instead. And now Sandy is staying as head of I hate this title, head of culture, coaching and  communication. I want them to spell it culture culture. It's a culture head until Marissa leaves  in about two weeks for with her $55 million severance package. Well, that's what I was

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  thinking. It's like he's starting to have a really big job laying off all the people that are going  to get laid off when the company's bought, right? That's what his job will be laying people off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was that was the great joke about getting Carl If you're in arena as Vice President Ted  is that when we had to lay off everybody, she has experience. I love Robert Ballester's tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Last night, he tweeted Carly Fugina is the first candidate to drop out of the election after the  primary twice in once in one primary season. And, and we thought that the that the compact HP merger  was bad. Very good. I didn't say it quite right. But Robert had a much, much more  crap well crafted joke. But that was good. Anyway, so much like watching Silicon Valley,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  which was Oh, I love this. This week was basically PTSD for lots of friends of mine. They were like,  I couldn't watch it anymore. Which part? The part where they bring in the new CEO,  it's getting a little real, isn't it? Everything, everything changes. We got ourselves to enterprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you know what I had the same making goes away. I've never been through that. Well, I guess  I've sort of been through that. I had the same reaction. I thought this isn't funny. This is  horrible. It's like, oh, oh, yeah. Oh, and Steven Tobolowski, who is such a good actor and really

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  does a great job is perfect. He is so good. What you see, I haven't even watched the show yet. But  did you see that PETA has complained about the horse scene? Okay, so okay, why were they  complaining? Those were happy horses. Oh, they were arguing that it was forced rape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, PETA. First of all, I don't I very much I'm almost certain that that was a green screen.  And that was a video they acquired. By the way, YouTube is full of those videos. There's a story  about it. Hold on. Yeah. Isn't isn't YouTube hasn't YouTube become a resource for watching  for one of a better phrase horse fornication?  Because that's what it was. Okay. And it was very graphic. It was like a porn movie for horses.  And Steven Tobolowski standing there watching. And then I should really should warn people. I mean,  it is you know, it's HBO, you know, you know, you're gonna see some but it was I wanted to

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  cover my eyes. So like judge told the Hollywood Reporter, there was no CG we captured that moment

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  what that they actually shot new footage. There's no way he's lying because how do you time that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they staged it they staged it. So if you actually watch the scene, there's a little bit  where they're standing in front of it. Then Richard says, this is too much. They cut away.  Okay, and then they have the long conversation, they go back. So okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it felt like there were lines in front of it. Like I thought, how did they time that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. But that's that was that's just because Tobolowski is very good. And they were they were  probably able to get into a guy to do a line. Well, one horse is nevermind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So what were the next? Well, we had to do a lot of horse research. We kind of had our hopes dash  at one point because someone was saying, Oh, no, it's all done artificially. They would never do  that. But then we looked into it further and found out that most species of thoroughbreds will only  inseminate naturally. Wow, just look for a place where it was actually going to happen. Oh my god.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. That is dedicate that is an unusual amount of dedication.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you really had a vision, didn't he? The first place they went to if they'd gotten there 15  minutes later, they would have been arrested because it was it was rated as a farm. Oh, boy.  So maybe Peter has some merit, says Hollywood Reporter. How long did it take to get the  money shot? Oh, less than a minute. That's the only thing that's fake as well. The horses actually go  very quickly. Yeah. So we had to repeat the footage. So, okay, thank you. All together,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the horse just finishes really fast. Yeah, no, that. Okay. So so maybe it's not a green screen,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  but it's simulated. Okay. Well, no, they really did it. It's just they did it longer.  It's just one shot. Looped it. I love it. So then Peter.  Where is it here? Well,  there are. I don't want to see it. I'm not going to watch. Peter calls it a ranged rape. Of course,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  this is what horse farms do. What do you mean a ranged rape? They're breeding animals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. Okay. And I got a lot going to go there. Bears are tethered together during the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  process. All right. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. I'm sorry, we shouldn't breed horses.  It's not like they're breeding to eat them. Right. Or wear them or wear them.  I'm not an animal lover. I like being high on the food chain.  YouTube is apparently about to launch YouTube unplugged, which will be a cord cutting service  about maybe not about to launch Bloomberg says 2017. This is the Holy Grail. Apple's been trying  to do this for years, make deals with networks and content creators to do a cable cutting service.  Apparently Google's been plotting this for several years as well. As well as in Hulu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Add them now or Hulu is doing. They've had a variant of this with fiber. Remember they've  built this out in three markets. But that's as a cable basically as a cable. Yes. But the point is  that's where they've previously they've opened the conversation and assumed they could just plug it,  you know, just just be the box that sits in front of it and everybody cut them all because they  want to do deals. So now they're going back and doing deals. Well, you know, everybody in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and this is the Holy Grail for Amazon to Apple and Amazon and everybody wants to do this dish.  Sony sling has kind of done this dishes as sling is with dish with their sling TV services.  But it's kind of limited content. The real question is can you get  the networks you see it promise the real here's the real problem NBC is owned by Comcast.  That's the problem in a nutshell. Comcast doesn't want to see this. They want you to use their

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  service. But it's you know, the dominoes are going to fall CBS is all behind it. Les Moonves says

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

They've got YouTube read for the music stuff, which is which is bundled with Google Play  Music, which means that you get music videos without free and free, which is nice. They've got  already got the ability to pay for things on YouTube, you can buy movies and full length  movies and things. And some TV shows, I think. And that's sort of that's coupled in with the  Google Play Store on Android as well. That those do transfer, I think. So right, you use them all  the ideas, Jeff. Right. So they've already got big chunks of the contractual stuff in place. The  question is, can they do a subscription version of you get you get certain stuff that competes  directly with with with Netflix and Amazon, which you call it Amazon Prime? Yep. Well, that's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a lot of these people say this kind of Spotify works to see podcasts as disposable entertainment  like you're like music like you're listening. And oh, maybe today you'd like to listen to some spoken  word. So how about this? But there's no you know, you'd have to search for it to go back and listen  you know, every week.

And if you search for twig or twit, if you're if you have Google  Play music, you'll see all of our shows there. But you're right. There's no like magic way to  subscribe. I guess.

Transcript:  I would say if I search for twig, I find podcasts. I'm searching for twig. Yeah, you know what? I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  getting the same thing on the web. Is podcast showing up on the left panel for you, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm doing on the phone. But if I search for twig. No, if you if you see podcasts. Okay. So

Transcript:  search for twig. Ah, OK. Oh, there's the subscribe button. OK, I'll take it back.  And you know what? I'm still not getting it. OK, I was just a project myself. This was this was

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  something we actually were working on for months with them and were NDA'd on. I think we were one

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  of the first networks they approached to just try out, you know, see how it worked. What about

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  your and then they don't complain to you about advertising or anything like that. Oh, no, no,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  so do you have to do is submit specially or is there a just. Yeah, it's very much like iTunes,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  where you submit this RSS feed and they send you an email confirming and you click the link

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and then you're in. And that's that's that's public now. I should go and submit some. I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's what that's exactly what iTunes does as well. Yeah, they don't they don't they maybe

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  they aggregate independently, but I don't think so. I think that they you have to submit it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, it's interesting. Yes. So if I click subscribe, I get I get this subscribe to this week in Google  and this three checkboxes auto download the latest three notifications and playback order

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I will try that out. Scanning through here. You know, see what else there is. What's app?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was funny. Seventy two hour blackout again overturned in hours. It was fighting it.  And Facebook doesn't like it. A Facebook executive went to jail in Brazil briefly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they put you in a suit suit is the new orange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Amazon first quarter sales up 28 percent to twenty nine point one billion revenue is all you should  ever look at Amazon because they have a little knob in Jeff Bezos office about that turns profit  up and down. Twitter is stock wise yesterday at an all time low thirteen dollars and ninety nine  cents a share. Twitter shares have plunged thirty nine percent this year and they're down sixty six  percent from the IPO. And yet it's still one of the most important institutions of the new millennium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What would you do with Twitter as a business? I don't know. Twitter and Yahoo. What would you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Yahoo is going to be sold to Verizon or somebody, right? That's the yeah. Yeah. What would  you do with Twitter as a business? So Yahoo's done Twitter. I feel like there's so much. Why do they  need to do anything? Stock price is the only thing that matters, right? Because they're making money,  right? They're not running out of money or anything. Yeah. I saw this in a panel. I saw

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  somebody in a panel say, yeah, this is so so only can making two billion dollars be considered  failure. And so in the market, only to the stock market, only to the stock market. Yeah. So that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  pretty good compared to any media company. Yep. Roe v buys TiVo one point one billion. I didn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  realize that TiVo had Tom Rogers was a was a very smart CEO who brought it out of nothing and made  it into a real company and real products. But I didn't realize it was starting to fade a bit,  I guess, because there's enough competitive technology elsewhere. Yeah, you know, it's still

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the best technology, but it's very pricey. You can rent the cable company DVR as bad as it is  for a few bucks a month. You got to buy a TiVo and then you have to pay a monthly fee for the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  subscription. I wonder if it held out a little longer. You know, if the FCC does win at  deregulating cable boxes and letting us all pick our own cable boxes, then being able to pick the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  TiVo without having to do the service. Oh, and that's another that's another hurdle. You have  to go to your cable company and pry a cable card out of them. Oh, yeah, which is so yeah, I'm not  surprised TiVo is not doesn't have huge market share. It's a shame because it really is the best.  So did either of you go to what is it further forward or for further further future?  Further. Oh, yes, after all, I'm a member of the 1%. The so Burning Man was just getting just  jammed the hoy-poy. So the top 1% of the burners started their own. They're both so obnoxious.  It's like like Ted on dust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  vest, although he didn't. But you got to see the top hat to this somewhere. There's a picture of

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know if you can find it easily. There's a picture of Loic with Eric,  both with their headdresses on. Yeah, there's there's that there's the top hat. And when asked,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  what did you you know, what did they ask him? Did you where did you get that? Did somebody  give that to you? He said, No, no, it's mine. As if he made the mirror vest and top hat. I doubt it.  Yeah, okay. I don't know. It's fun to mock. I can see him with a glue gun. Yeah. Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it's fun to mock. And that's the whole point is it is mockery. Yes. Yeah. Oh, it is. Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  yes. He's got a new conference called leaders le ad. E dot rs or something like that. Yeah,

Here's here I am on the top of the mountain in my  hang glider. Oh, I know. Just as a normal day. It's just it's just hilarious. One must follow

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the week on Instagram and Facebook to really enjoy. It's amazing. I love the glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  music. Yeah, I don't I mean, can I just be honest, I think I think I've not been to Burning Man,  but it's my strong impression that Burning Man is mostly about drugs and sex  and art cars. He's in music. Is there music at Burning Man?  Is it really? Have you been there's a dance? I haven't been there. Yeah. I don't know. I  don't think it's a music festival. It's an art festival. Yeah. In the middle of the most God  forsaken place is like dance music and yeah, oh yeah, yeah, there's dancing and and some  sex and then there's some drugs and then there's some more dancing and some more sex and then  there's some art and there's some more sex and some dancing and some drugs.  I used to go to Burning Man when it was just a little bonfire out at Ocean Beach. I don't know  what these young people are up to. I don't know what this is. Ray Publica had a mobile sauna.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you put that in? So this is a this is a conference I went to a Berlin this blogger  conference that I love and I did the sauna jokes there. In fact, then challenged people to meet me  in the sauna next door and some did and so there was a hotel next door. So this year they had a  portable sauna at the Republican Conference making me really mad that I'm not there.  Really a portable sauna. Yeah, yeah. Mobile sauna. Does that seem like a good idea?  So if you look at my Twitter feed a couple guys sent me a picture of themselves. I think they were  the guys I was in the sauna with five years ago from inside the sauna. I don't want to get in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  sauna with a bunch of bloggers. We're already sweaty. Yeah, yeah. I'm posting right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  think it's time to wrap this up. As fun as this is. I think I think I think looking at the length of

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the show scared you. It did. I think I don't want to do three hour shows. We're headed that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No you know the right you know the real problem is I for a I don't want to edit  and B I really like talking to you guys and it's really fun and I just feel like these shows aren't  really shows. They're just a chance for me to get together and talk to people I like and I coerce  them into being here for a while and so why would I cut it short. It's too much fun and you know  nobody ever really says could you make sure to podcast they just turn them off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay that's enough. I'm done. Well it was fun.

It should be as long as it needs to be is the exactly what it is. Last week you know it's  I'm learning you know I've only done two so far but it's amazing being you Leo and I don't I don't  even pretend to be you but to deal with the pressures and the difficulties that you deal with  of trying to think of the timing and this and that and you know it's it's it's it's I  you know it's second nature to you but it's nerve-wracking. It's hard work.  That's why you're so tired. That's why you're not going to cast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See I'm just we're just talking we're just having fun. Yeah we're talking with friends about stuff  important stuff there's Burning Man out in the desert. So the the the

Transcript:  grove I don't I think Leo you want to do you ought to figure out your own festival to do for the twit

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  army that'd be fun yeah yeah well what would that entail no but then I'd be beholden to them and I'd  be part then I'd have to wouldn't be able to cover things freely because I'd have to keep my  conference going and blah I want to do a little version of Burning Man that I call hot tub tech  machine and and it's me and our guests in a hot tub that's all TMI follows no you could wear a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  said I should call my hot tub a show boiling man thank you one burmill indywebcamp.com i-n-d-i-e  for all the information here and this is about what keeping the web independent yes so there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it's a combination of events there's an ongoing chat room a wiki full of staff and tech specs and  so on so homebrew website club is every two weeks in a bunch of cities there's one tonight in san  francisco los angeles and portland though you've missed the ones that have happened already in  bryton and yurtberg in sweden and then screwing it a bit further there's indywebcamp which is  the two-day weekend long thing which is an unconference it's it's basically one day of  conversation and one day of hacking and with demos for any pd end and there's one coming up  in dusseldorf this weekend and then there's the indy web summit in portland in a just under a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  month june the fourth now i see that bruce sterling wrote about your principles way back when in

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  2013 is he is he an indy web camp supporter um i think people connect to the ideas i'm not sure  if he's if he's used it directly we put a lot of independent creators like the idea of owning  their own site it's part of the part of the value of i think so what we're trying to do and then the  other two things that um spin out of that are standards that we've been working on are working  their way through the w3c at the moment and those are web mention of micro pub so micro pub is the  abstraction for letting you post to your site from elsewhere  and that is currently a working draft at w3c is actually published today i think  and we're trying to get that the basic premise is is straightforward you authenticate and then  you write your post and then it posts your site but you can do that from anywhere so that lets  us build tools that let us have commenting between sites or um response responses or other tools that  will um read your post from somewhere else and bring them back in so there's one tools that will  um if you post something on instagram it'll then create a post on your own site for it so it's a  building block we use to let you post to your own site from elsewhere and it's and then we have also  got abstracted variations of that the rap um existing sites and silos there's a thing called  silo pub that lets you use micro pub with facebook and tumblr and blogger and so on as well so that's  so that's micro pub that lets you use a this this very simple generic posting um api  but of course a bunch of insights and then web mention is the other standard that's um going  through w3c at the moment and this is for i've said something about you on my site and so in that  case i if you have web page and set up i send to your endpoint this post on my site linked to this  post on your site and then you can interpret that to understand whether i was doing a reply or a  like or an rsp or or whatever um and so that's the that again that spec is going through with  pc at the moment and the that um it's it's it's a good time to look at them because we've got  reasonable informations of both of them um but if there's if as we're trying to get this w3c group  shut down by september this is a good time to have a look at um the state of these these these  standards and see if we can get them finished so if you work in any of this stuff um do look at  these see if you can plug them into the systems you're building because we've already got we'll  be building this stuff for probably nearly five years now um and it's mostly been building small  protocols that interoperate between our own sites but we think we've got them in a state now and  we've got enough implementations that they make sense to deliver standards what blog software do  you use kevin you use known or with no i use a mixture of different things i use known i use  a static site of my own at kevin marks.com that i just post html to by hand

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but does it support all the micro pub stuff um it's it doesn't support micro

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  power but it supports web mention i use a service um that um lets you use web mention with a static  site it basically has a web mention endpoint which can be off site and then i have javascript that  injects the responses in my site so if you go to kevin marks.com and scroll down to the bottom  you'll see a bunch of replies and things that have been brought back into my my site from that  um and then um but i don't have micro pub working for that yet so that would that could be something  i should probably build um but part of it is that the posts i put on my own site um i'm often talking  about html and things so that so they tend to be a little bit handmade um whereas the the stuff that  i share on other sites um don't do that so much so like so like the svg spark lines one for example  that one is the talking about how to construct something svg so it has a bunch of code in it and  then embedded svg and things like that and this stuff doesn't always translate well to  trying to post on facebook or um medium or something like that i use with no but i i wonder if ben and

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  erin uh ours how how how hard are they working on that is that still a big thing for them or um

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  they're still they're still working on it but the yeah the challenge is um it's still working  so oversource project it's got a bunch of contributors but i think they're they're doing  other things as well they've been doing consulting too yeah because it stuff doesn't work quite  on it a little bit well it works quite well but the the challenge they've got is getting people  to pay for it i pay for it and it's because they're like any of these things it's a it's a  project that you that you host stuff on right um and they can get a certain number of people  paying for it but making sustainable businesses harder yeah yeah but it's i i use with known  yeah you self-hosted no i i hosted with them i said with them oh you did yeah might as well why  not yeah yeah um well also it means that that i'm testing the the hosted version for them as well  which is which can be good but um it's within it does implement all these indie web standards  um and so if you want to play with this stuff it's it's one of the easiest ways to do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and that must be me because i can never get the um the sharing out like i'll click facebook and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  twitter and it never goes out anywhere oh yeah you may need to re-authenticate facebook you have  to re-authenticate every couple of months yeah i know that yeah yeah and then i don't know yeah  but i've got i've got that working like i have to go back and play with it web hooks doesn't work

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  for me a lot of the a lot of the infrastructure seems not to be working it's a simple good nice  simple blog and it works well but it doesn't uh i want that i want it to be you know it's a posse

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  for me right yeah no the yeah a lot of the value is in the posting and connecting these things

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  together so yeah i'll mess with it some more i like it i'll pay for it i renewed it excellent uh  yeah yeah uh ladies and gentlemen maybe jeff jarvis would like to share a number with us  so i guess we're going to go back into a political moment not horse copulation again oh good we're
