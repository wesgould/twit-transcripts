Smarterwear.org is the blog and we'll talk about, it's not a new job, but full time at  the job, which is exciting.  Good to have you here, Gina.  Also with us, the pink and lovely, freshly bathed, Jeff Jarvis.  Oh man.  But he's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gina has a new hair, do I have new skin?  We'll fix that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's scary, my glasses are green.  We'll fix it in post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We can make that better.  Jeez.  Well, the funny thing is, if I said it for the wall being a crew, then you are pink.  It's true the wall, pay attention to me.  Okay, all right, yeah, really.  Let's let the wall color...  I can't, there's nothing I can do with you.  I can get black and white or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nothing I can do with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're just hopeless, Jeff.  You're hopeless.  Oh.  Is this a monitor?  What color would you like to be, Jeff?  The peanut gallery's giving me...  Now he's blue.  It's not easy.  Unfortunately, there's no flesh color in there.  There's no flesh tones.  It's not either pink or blue.  You look like a Smurf.  There.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey.  Don't touch it.  Don't touch it.  Human.  Human card.  There's a human on the other side.  I pushed a button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Good to have you, Jeff.  Fuzzmachine.com.  Oh look, there he is.  Matt Cutts in the lower left corner to block.  Matt is actually an official Googler.  He's in charge of blocking web spam on the Google search results.  What a smooth transition, Leo.  You're the professional broadcaster.  And Matt is at mattcutts.com.  If you want to read his blog.  Actually, Google just blogged about the story of the week.  We had a lot of fun with it on Twitter.  The New York Times story that came out on Sunday about the guy who is really gaming Google  by generating negative customer response.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He said he was, but is it true, to start off with Matt, that it doesn't matter how you spell it,  it doesn't matter how you spell the name as long as you spell the name, gets you page rank?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let me just recap the story a little bit.  It's one of the best newspaper stories I've read in a long time.  In fact, this was one of the things we talked about on Twitter on Sunday.  Dwight Silverman who writes for the Houston Chronicle said, you get one of these every five years  where you just go, this is going to be such a great story.  The reporter goes to the guy's house in Brooklyn.  He's got this Brooklyn accent.  He says, I don't care what they think.  He flips off his customers and he yells at them and he calls them names.  He threatens to come to their house.  He sells designer eyewear.  Well, sells isn't probably the right word.  He has a website purporting to sell designer eyewear.  In fact, it seems a lot of times you get something you didn't expect, you get overcharged.  He says, I don't care because people go to get satisfaction.  They complain about me and my Google juice goes up.  We talk about a particular one of his customers who bought her frames from him  because he was the number one result when she entered in the frame name.  Now, early on Google said, well, yeah, but if you enter in the name of the company,  we're not going to name the company.  What should we use, Gina, as a euphemism for this company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ego, my eyes is probably a good...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a bad Jackson Brown pun is what it is.  Really bad.  But anyway, so apparently all the vituperation on get satisfaction is just more links  and get satisfaction is a highly rated blog.  So it just gets more links back to his website.  And apparently Google interprets that as interesting and ranks him highly.  So there's in a nutshell is the story from the New York Times and it was a great read  and it's well worth reading.  Now Google just posted a response today on the blog.  Matt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can walk you through it. Yeah.  You know, it's really funny because the first thing we did in that blog post is we wanted to  sort of pop the misconception that it was all these complaints that were giving them a lot of benefit  in the Google rankings because that's not really what was happening.  In fact, get satisfaction, Thor, the guy that you might know from get satisfaction,  did a blog post and we had linked to that.  And he said we used the no follow attribute hyperlinks.  So they were slow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you use in the link after the after the URL, if you use REL equals no follow,  Google takes that as an indication not to use that in its indexing or its ranking.  We drop the link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we don't use it in page rank.  We don't trust the anchor text.  So it's a perfect way.  It's actually almost five years old now.  It's a very general mechanism to say, you know what, I don't endorse this link.  And it turns out almost all of the consumer complaint sites either didn't link to the site  or only use the text name or use REL no follow.  The ironic part is some of the most reputable links coming to the site were coming from Bloomberg and  wait for it, the New York Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, he even says the guy who owns the company even says at the end, it's a great end to the he says,  hey, it's OK if you write them out.  I mean, just make sure you include my URLs and names in the article.  Say anything you want.  So really all the attention he got from the press is what helped him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, he was he was doing relatively well even before that.  You know, his pet theory was that he was getting a lot of negative mentions.  If he was doing well in the last month or two, it might be because Bloomberg wrote an article that mentioned  that company was getting sued.  And in the process, they linked to him.  Now, one of the easy things you would think is, oh, well, just look for people who are really angry.  The sentiment analysis.  And it turns out that wouldn't have worked at all because the Bloomberg article was completely neutral.  It just said, yeah, this company is suing this other company.  So it was really more, you know, a few fashion blogs, a few mainstream news sources.  It really wasn't the sort of hate from consumers that was giving it a lot of Google ranking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, Jeff, you wrote in your blog, Buzz Machine dot com, kind of taking off the title of your book.  What should Google do about this?  What should Google?  How should Google respond to this?  Now, of course, this might change knowing now that it wasn't coming from Get Satisfaction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. But there were a lot of people who said, who blamed Google for this.  And the first point, I think, is that we do live in a world of caveat emptor.  And it is up to the consumer to figure out what's what.  So that, you know, when I had my Dell problems, I kicked myself at the time for not searching on Dell sucks.  And so I learned a big lesson there.  And whenever I buy something from a new vendor online, I check it.  And if you go to if you saw searched for the vendor's name, you go my eyes and we'll say you saw as as Matt had pointed out in Twitter,  lots and lots and lots of negative stuff, you would have known to stay away from this guy if you just searched for the vendor's name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But isn't really the fault of a consumer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it is caveat emptor. Sure, it is.  Is it Google's job to ferret out every bad guy on Earth?  Matt has enough time trying to play whack a mole with just the Spamsters to also try to ferret out everybody who might be bad.  That's not Google's job. It's an unscalable task.  We don't necessarily want Google to do it because somebody else's bad store or somebody's good store.  You know, it just doesn't work at all.  And so then the next question is, as Matt said, do you look at sentiment analysis?  I mean, apart from this question of the Bloomberg story, as somebody said in Twitter when this discussion was going underway.  Well, if they use sentiment analysis, they'd see a lot of negative links to Barack Obama.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What does that mean? Right. What do you do with vaccines?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bloomberg and the New York Times have used the realm of follow attribute.  I mean, if they're trying to be reporting a neutral story about one company suing another, I mean, I know that this is probably you know, this is never going to happen.  But I mean, if I'm making a recommendation on my site, then I'm not going to use the no follow.  But if Bloomberg is just writing this neutral story, I mean, would that have helped?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Doesn't that just build in sentiment analysis, though?  I mean, don't you want in most cases not to use real no follow?  Don't we want links? Yeah, you do want links.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the Web is very good at having links.  I don't think that Bloomberg should necessarily have been responsible.  We just wanted to sort of dispel the misconception that it was all people complaining on the consumer sites that was causing it.  But what was kind of interesting is, you know, to Jeff's point, if you just allow people who say, oh, this is bad to hurt someone, then you can seriously impact their rankings.  Then you have to worry about, you know, people who don't like vaccines, people who don't like either Barack Obama or Sarah Palin.  And that sort of stuff could really have unintended consequences.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google does not want to get in that business by any means.  No. And that's what's called sentiment analysis.  And that's not what does Google do any sentiment analysis?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We do. Actually, we we we have a link in the blog post where we do sentiment analysis for news and for blogs.  And there could be a place for that.  But the main thing we wanted to get across is that just that alone wouldn't have done the job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And in fact, let me ask you something, because on Sunday I did a search for this.  I tried to duplicate the search that the protagonist in the story, the woman who got ripped off by this company, did and was not able to get a link to this company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I listed it. I was lucky enough to have a front row seat.  And what happened is the algorithmic change and we made an algorithmic change.  It affected several hundred sites, not just this one site went live late last night.  So if you weren't seeing it Sunday night, then that was something different.  Maybe the site was down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So there is there has been a change since then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, is that routine?  Does Google do that a lot?  Well, we do roll out over 400 changes a year.  So we do average about one change or a little more than one change per day to be able to get feedback.  And within a couple of business days, come up with some new algorithm that would improve the search results for that kind of experience.  That is pretty quick.  But, you know, we read through the article and we were just as horrified as everybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a fun weekend for you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's amazing. More than one change per day is unbelievable.  I mean, what is as an engineer, I'm just like, what are there?  What does the regression test look like?  I mean, when you change the algorithm, you want to avoid like unintended consequences, changing other kinds of searches.  You must have it must be an insane test suite that you run before you roll out.  How does that work?  Is it sort of continual testing that just runs constantly as the changes roll out and tweaking?  Or I'd love to know.  Probably we could dedicate a whole show to Google's algorithm testing and deploy a system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Well, and we do have continuous testing.  So if something really happens to drop one important site or a high impact site, we sort of get pages about that.  But whenever you want to roll out a new change, essentially, we also, for example, for this change,  we ran something like a couple hundred thousand queries to see how big of an impact that one small change would have.  So even though the algorithm only affected maybe a few hundred sites,  we ran several hundred thousand queries to sort of make sure that the impact was relatively limited in scope.  And then we also have a manual team who sort of picks on the individual sites that might be affected and sort of confers and says, yes, this is a bad experience.  So, for example, I was lucky enough to sort of see some of the testing.  There was another merchant who, if you search for Dead Kennedy's trucker hat, you know, these really specific queries, they don't you know,  you think you're ordering from them, but when you place the order, they would actually go and try to find the product on the web and order it at that point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So they were they were writing pages with a bunch of bizarre queries in them, hoping to catch your spider.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's definitely the case that if you have a really specific what we call a long tail query, it's a little easier to rank for that.  So one phrase that was mentioned was discount Lafont glasses.  Right. It turns out if you do an exact phrase search for that using double quotes, that only happens on the web like 15 times like Bing finds it maybe six times.  So if you if you have those words on your page, it's not that hard to rank for that page for that phrase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Although I have to say Google predict when I did it went right to it, even suggested eyeglasses, eyewear and eyeglass frames as a completion for discount Lafont.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pretty impressive. So Matt, explain the other part of this just philosophically that you know, and Gina and Leo know, but I think the people don't quite understand is the issue of manually intervening  and how if you went, OK, OK, this guy's bad, so fine, we'll get rid of him.  And how not only does that not scale, but it's just not the way it kind of violates the law here that the algorithm is then no longer the same to all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. That's a that's a great point in that while it is the case that we do reserve the right to take manual action in very limited circumstances, if it's web spam, that's my team.  If we have a court order, if there's something security related like viruses or malware, really, you know, the idea of taking manual action, you have to realize that's not always scalable.  It might not work in other languages, for example.  So so what we try to do is to a first approximation, we try to find the algorithms that are going to work well.  And I can give you a quick story to sort of, you know, demonstrate that two years ago, the pendulum was swinging the other way.  There was a guy who wrote a story that a kid had borrowed his dad's credit card number and had hired two hookers.  But but the hookers were supposed to be playing Xbox with him.  And so it was my son. Yeah.  He was, you know, let's play Xbox together.  I want to play Xbox with hookers. That sounds fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Connect. Doesn't that sound fun?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's great.  Yeah, that's great.  That's a good idea, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've just invented a new form of porn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. So it's like the hoax could not have been better constructed to get links.  And in fact, I think Fox News picked up that particular hoax.  After it had gotten traction, the guy came out and said, yeah, by the way, I totally made that up.  So so then people are saying, well, it's not fair.  You know, people are allowing these guys to basically lie, you know, hoax marketing.  And so I basically did a blog post two years ago that said, look, if someone's doing a link scheme, we do reserve the right to take action on it.  And that can include, you know, limited situations where someone's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, he's he's frozen. Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, mid-sentence. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What do you think he was going to say? Let's have a game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll complete Matt's phrase. I love he has the hand movement going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like really. And I really like Bing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You lose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Poor Matt. Poor Matt.  He's on his wife's Mac and it's probably on Wi-Fi.  We're actually, why don't we while I'm getting it back, why don't we take a break?  I love this subject. And then you're right, Gina, we could go on forever.  And this is, I guess, what Matt does really a lot of what he does day in, day out is, hey, welcome back, Matt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry about that. It also relates to the EU thing, which we should talk about, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. So I was just saying, this is probably a lot of what you do on a day to day basis, Matt, is this kind of looking for these kinds of flaws?  I mean, I wouldn't call that link bait that spam precisely. Or would you? Would Google call that spam?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's where the pendulum sort of went all the way to one extent, because as soon as we said we were willing to take action in that very specific circumstance,  the people started shouting about the other direction saying Google shouldn't be the truth police.  And that's totally true. We don't want to be in the position of saying this is correct or this is not correct. We really just want to reflect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, he's gone again. Jeff, what you say in your blog post is that as Google, Facebook, Twitter and other private players come to be the law of the land on the Internet,  and that's what the real issue is here. This is the responsibility that they carry.  They need to start acting like public players with and you want to say, let you say, let's make it explicit with constitutions, bills of rights, the means of enforcement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because as Larry Lessig says, code is law. And we're seeing that to be the case here. And I don't want the government really to do it, but they've got to do it based on principles of some form or another.  And, you know, I've argued for the bill of rights. But I think if you're if you're Google, they've they've gotten into into hot water of sorts.  When when a company there was there was a company, for example, that was downgraded as a spammer and they came in and said, no, we're a business directory.  Right. And frankly, if you would I looked at it, we'd say, yeah, it's kind of like spam. But Google said, yeah, it's spam.  Well, then they took him to court and that's kind of the basis of what's happening with Google in the EU.  The EU was just announced a few two days ago that they're going to investigate Google for antitrust with these kinds of cases.  Well, the problem here is that what Google does have the manual adjudication to say you're a spammer, you're you're you're not legitimate site.  And and so when they do that, they have it's the one case where they kind of do operate in monopoly power.  And my argument is that what they should have is a different adjudication structure. They should have a jury of peers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, I agree. I think that's what's missing is some some form of what we've talked about before.  Google needs an ombudsman, but some form of third party adjudication, I think, would be government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Eric Spitz says government, you know, a government going to run Google better than Google does.  No, but I think that that it's in the question here is to look at where the interests are aligned.  Let's say you had 12 business people who run businesses and use Google to do so.  It's in their interest to have Google send to legitimate businesses like them.  It's in the customer's interest to have this happen. And it's in Google's interest.  The only one who's now aligned from that is the scum bucket who is spamming.  Right. And so the question of is this spam or is it not? Is it illegitimate or is it not?  Now rests solely in Google's hands, either through algorithm or judgment.  And that's what gets Google in trouble now with its huge market share given to it by European consumers.  Let's be quick to say. And so the EU comes in and says, oh, no monopoly.  Well, it's not the irony of the EU going after Google is Google set the rules for ethical search results.  Before Google was overture and overtures sold placement.  Yeah. Right. So Google came along and cleaned that up.  Right. And now the EU is coming in saying, well, you dare to point to, you know, your own stuff like YouTube.  Well, Danny Sullivan did a really good, really smart ass post.  I hope I didn't get the dump button for that, in which he said, you know, I searched for cars on Google.  It didn't send me to Bing's car page. How dare they? Right. It sent me straight to cars. Right.  And so Google's in an unfortunate position with a lot of this.  And I think it has to figure out how to stand on principle.  It's algorithms in its view. I think Matt will correct me here are its principle.  But in cases of manual adjudication, it needs to have somebody to hide behind.  And it needs to have more transparency not about the algorithm, but about these kinds of rules and how this operates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In the best of all worlds, Google wouldn't be in the content business.  And then you would avoid this conflict of interest entirely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If it were just. They don't want to be in the content business. I don't want them in the content business.  But YouTube is the content business. Well, that is. Yes.  Well, wait a second. Is it or isn't it? YouTube is another platform for content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google is not a producer of content there. Yeah. But OK. But if well, yeah, it's difficult.  I mean, it's really what is the business of Google? And if you wanted it to be pure, it would have to be search, not ads.  Well, no, but Google is more than search. Google points back at an ad page of its own, then it's making revenue off a search result.  Then that then that's that's where you get this conflict of interest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but hold on a second there. So so by that logic, then, Leo, then the New York Times should never point to another New York Times story.  It should only point to Washington Post and Wall Street Journal stories. Good point.  Of course you point to your own stuff. Right. I sat in meetings with Jerry Yang way back in the premature days when when he was still there and you could.  And, you know, they they bragged at Yahoo about how we have this fire hose. We can point to our stuff.  You know, also the same thing. So hello, EU. What's so wrong with going ahead and pointing to your own stuff when you build an asset?  Everybody does that. Right. And I know I come off like Google fanboy and Matt can sit there quietly and say, oh, good.  Jarvis is the one defending people. I don't have to. It's just the truth of life.  It's there's this in Europe, especially now there's this anti-Google ism that strikes me as anti-American ism and in some stripes, anti-capitalism.  And so you see stories like the New York Times story. It gets everybody riled up to say, aha, Google caused this problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it didn't. Well, I thought the story was interesting that they also talked about MasterCard and eBay.  And this guy was clearly someone who sees how close he can get to the edge right up to the threshold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So yeah, and the story actually the woman calls her credit card company disputes it.  The company puts the pay them in on hold. And then apparently somebody from the company called the credit card company say, no, no, this is the customer.  And I want to pay that bill. This guy was a piece of work. Really. It is the best. It's one of the most Pulitzer Prize for sure.  It's a great story. I just love it. But and you make the point, I think, Jeff, very well.  Perhaps the reporter would have done better to to call Matt cuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and I think that's a problem that Google frankly had because I'm very serious about that is that Matt, what this forget about defending Google.  There were questions that we're talking about right now about what does this mean? What's the next step?  How can you stop this that a good reporter would go to?  And the reporter whined in the story that they talked to a Google spokesperson who did the phone call was supposed to send an email and didn't.  I hate it when reporters complain about about PR people not being nice to them.  But the mistake there was that I think that the better story would have been if Matt had been able to talk to the reporter and just talk through these issues, these what ifs.  Well, if we did manually go in, what happens if we did look at sentiment?  What happens because it's a better, fuller story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And that's why we wanted to wait a while to get the blog post out. Yeah, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's supposed to really address the issues that you know, that the sentiment analysis point analysis point was very good.  It really just a lot of issues. But in the end, the post didn't it didn't say what the changes that Google made.  Right. Because Google does have to protect that information to make it less able to be gamed in the end.  And it took it took a couple of days for the post to come out as well.  So, yeah, the story would have been much better if the reporter had followed up a little more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know if the story would have been better, but it would have been more accurate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It would have been more accurate. It would have been more accurate.  I mean, if the fact that the reporter wasn't able to see that the Times had linked this company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and you know, if you view source, you'll see rel equals no follow.  He didn't have enough technical sophistication to even do that.  Although I confess, I repeated his story without checking myself.  So that's probably the first thing we should all have done is and then then it's apparent there's no link juice at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, the no follow issue in terms of, you know, the responsibility on news organizations to if you're truly going to be neutral when you mention something versus wanting someone to read it.  Interesting, interesting question.  I mean, we get to the point where news organizations are tech savvy enough to know what no follow means.  Like this is a neutral link and this is a link we're recommending.  I don't know. We're getting down to nitty gritty, but it's an interesting question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm trying to remember. I think Twitter started implementing rel no follow globally.  And I think that that's a bad idea because they still do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Matt, do you know they do certainly on their website and if you're a beginning website and you're not ready for the spammer influx and you have a lot of people that can be a very reasonable thing to do.  What I would love to see people do is be a little more nuanced.  For example, I just crossed 10,000 tweets, you know, and so the odds that I'm going to do some spam tweets are pretty low.  Maybe let you out of jail, for instance.  Yeah, once you've been around for a while or you have someone else who's trusted vouch for you or any other metric that you have, you know, you Wikipedia.  Maybe you edit and you didn't get reverted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You could remove those because rel no follow really neuters the web and neuters the ability to generate links.  In fact, it hurts Google's ability to generate valuable play page rank.  I mean, a link from Twitter from a highly regarded person on Twitter should be valuable.  It should add to the Google juice.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely. And Twitter is has its own internal algorithm for user authority.  And I think that that should come into play.  I mean, it neuters the web if everyone uses no follow.  But if we use it smartly and people understand the difference between a neutral link and I want you to click on this link, it would stop spamming.  It would help.  It would help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry, wouldn't it help reduce the ROI?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Sorry, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wouldn't that be helped if the tools enabled you to put in two kinds of links?  We've had this discussion before about positive or negative.  Maybe it's recommended or neutral is is a decent way to go that people can you know, there's a little link tool on your blog tool, right?  There's a little link button your blog tool.  And similarly, you put a link into Twitter and then shorten it.  Maybe you have to shortening options.  Right.  Bitly bit.  No, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  click me.  Don't be right.  But, you know, that that kind of nuance at this point in time is probably just the usability wise is what a lot of work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Bear in mind that it took about five years before we introduced no follow because for the most part when people link to something, it's because they do endorse it or they do like it or they want people to see it.  So, you know, it took a few years before we really even saw a need to say, hey, there are some links where maybe if you run WordPress, you might want to put no follow on commenters until you trust them or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's the other thing here is in Europe, at least in the UK, as I understand it, you can be held responsible for that to which you link in a court of law.  Wow.  And it would be really nice if you could have a form of link that says I am definitely not endorsing this, but in the interest of free speech, I'm showing you where the bozo is, which is part of what we need to be able to do on the web, too, is otherwise it does turn into an echo chamber.  If all I can do is link to those things that I think are good and worthwhile and I recommend it becomes a very boring place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis, Gina Trapani, Matt Cutstrom, Google, talking about Google in the cloud from Kevin Marks, a link about the boring couple.  They both won and lost in court today, and we'll talk about that in just a little bit.  But first, I'd like to talk a little bit about Ford and Ford sync the amazing technology that's in many Ford motor cars and Lincoln and Mercury vehicles as well.  It's just fantastic. It's hands free calling turn by turn directions.  You get full GPS even without the GPS screen.  It'll walk you through. In fact, the turn by turn so smart it knows where you're going.  It watches traffic alerts and it'll reroute you around traffic problems automatically.  911 assist and and of course, complete control of your audio system, including things like play this week in Google number 71 and boom plays for you.  I just love it.  These Ford sync vehicles come with a USB port so you can connect your iPod or your zoom or your phone.  They come with with just the most amazing voice recognition software.  And in fact, with some phones, including my Android phones and the Windows Phone 7 phones, it'll even read you text messages as they come in.  You want to give it a try. Go to your local Ford, Lincoln or Mercury dealer and test drive the Ford sync.  It is fantastic. And I'll tell you, I wouldn't consider a car that didn't have it from now on.  That's it. And here's a new program from Ford.  We're kind of excited about it's the 2012 Ford Focus Global Test Drive.  Here comes the new focus early 2011.  The 2012 Ford Focus is going to come out three model lineup, the five door hatchback, the four door sedan, the five door wagon.  I saw it at blog world. It is so beautiful. So slick.  This is the new world car from Ford and it includes just like the latest parking technologies like the active park assist like on the flex where it parks itself.  The rear view camera. So I mean, I got that in the Mustang. I can't I don't know how people live with that.  I get in the car without a rear view camera. How do you back up here?  What do you what am I doing? It's scary.  The new fuel efficient engines completely updated, including a torque vector control system, which hugs the curves.  The new my Ford touch, which is sync plus.  It's got the eight inch screen on the cons on the center console and then the two screens behind the steering wheel.  I can go on and on. You could drive. You could be one of the first to test drive the new 2012 Ford Focus in Madrid at Spain's National Institute for Aerospace Technology.  Yes, it's a contest. Go to twit Ford focus dot com.  I'll take you to the Facebook page where you can make a video up to two minutes in length saying two things.  Why you should be one of the first to test drive the Ford Focus and where you'd like the ten thousand dollars to go.  What charity you'd like the ten thousand dollars to go to.  Ford's going to give away half a million dollars in all.  Take many a couple of you and a friend and I guess there'll be many winners to Madrid to test drive the Ford Focus.  And this is the thing I like best. This contest is open to our audience members everywhere in the world.  You're all invited to participate. Go to twit Ford focus dot com.  Tell us what charitable cause you'd like to support and then why you should be on your way to Madrid early next year to test the 2012 Ford Focus.  The global test drive is on twit Ford focus dot com.  We thank Ford so much for their support of this week in Google.  Thank you, Kevin Marks, for this link. I just like the story.  The boring couple beats Google in court and is awarded a dollar.  One dollar. So you know about this, Jeff, right?  This is a couple that sued Google because a street view car drove down their private road and took a picture of their house.  They weren't even German.  The the most of the charges was included. Negligence were thrown out last year.  But boring versus Google continued in court on one last charge trespassing.  Now the case is over.  The judge ruled that Google was indeed guilty of count to trespass and awarded the boring couple one dollar in penalties.  The the boring's tried to appeal this to the Supreme Court.  The court turned down the appeal.  So Google spokesperson says we are pleased this lawsuit has finally ended with the plaintiff's acknowledgement that they are entitled to only one buck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now we know what a Google Street View picture of your house is worth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just love that story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I don't live in San Francisco, but I saw a Google Street View car in San Diego and I was like so excited about it.  Did you moon him?  I did. I did. It was parked and the camera was kind of covered.  So and I felt like a little bit of a stalker walking up to it and checking it out.  But you know, they're very pretty clearly this one I saw anyway was really colorful and had the Google logo on it was very clear what it was.  I was out of my mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is what we want to lobby for.  Matt, if you want to carry this back to the to the main office, we want just we want them to release the schedule for the street view card like the day before so that we can line up and perform performance art as the car goes by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I think I'll pass the suggestion.  Certainly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just imagine how much more interesting Street View would be if people know ahead of time.  And if somebody's shy, they can, you know, hide less lawsuits about privacy.  Exactly. Just tell us you're coming.  Like we told you, you know, by the way, that everybody's going to be mooning it and dancing and there'll be all sorts of great performance art going on out there.  Somebody told me that New York City, there is a tour that does this where that you drive around in these stadium seat buses facing the side and they have performance performers like improv performers waiting for the bus to arrive.  They do a little show and then it goes on and they have speakers on the bus that encourage bystanders to participate in the performance art as the bus is driving around.  That's a new one on me.  I've never heard of it, but I'd love to do it.  I think myth.  No, my sister is told me about it.  She wouldn't lie.  We want the Petaluma route because I'll fly to Petaluma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll twiggle twiggle put on some performance art.  That's happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Remember, they had a marching band in the and the street view car went through the marching band.  So Google must do that sometimes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think there's at least one picture in front of the Googleplex where they said show up on this date and like one guy held up his will you marry me sign and all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They probably broken up and that's there forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, that's a good point.  No, don't say that.  That's so unromantic.  Jeff, you sound like an old married man.  New Yorker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, in well that I am in Germany now that the next fight is neighbors have found that their homes got pixelated when they didn't want it.  Oh, no, you blew me.  You blow.  There are fights about that.  They want to be on their pixel.  How dare you blur my windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not to blow me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the originals, the originals are word.  So there's no original to go back to.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I just imagine this army of Google interns like these earnest young people who are dying to like climb the ranks within Google having to like call, you know, a color in these houses and then uncolor them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I got a number of emails from Germans, Jeff, who said, Please do not call us German.  Germany.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We do not like that.  Oh, but this is so good.  Maybe you'll be allowed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  All right.  Let's talk a little bit about net neutrality.  This one is a more much more complicated than it seems on the face of it.  And there was a very good discussion yesterday on Tom Merritt's tech news today from network provider about this Comcast versus level three thing.  And I mean, I'm so anxious and so glad and happy to berate Comcast for any reason at all.  And certainly there is some fault there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But but apparently there's a no follow here.  Yeah.  Cue the no follow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You really close no follow.  We need an audio no follow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Your audio no follow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But just use a different voice.  When you talk like this, you don't want to follow it.  When you talk like this.  Not a recommendation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, Matt, can you work on that too?  As long as we got a shopping list for you, Matt.  And another thing, voice recognition.  Yeah.  Apparently level three, which got the Netflix.  Let me give you the story from the beginning.  Level three carries Netflix streaming.  They got they did a deal and they got it away from Akamai who used to do the Netflix streaming.  That's a lot of bandwidth.  We know now it's a huge percentage of prime time bandwidth.  And Comcast has said, dudes, you're you're free riding on our network and we want to charge you level three.  Level three wrote a blog post saying, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is not neutrality.  You're a toll road on the Internet.  Blah, blah, blah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But they gave in.  They said, what are we going to do?  You know, we don't want Netflix to be mad at us.  Of course, the real problem in my mind is if there were any competition in the Internet service world, if there were a choice for most people besides Comcast, if I were level three, I'd say, OK, fine, Comcast.  Go ahead.  Block us.  See how your customers feel about that.  But there isn't.  And so a lot of customers, just as the same thing happened with cable vision and television, are stuck.  Well, now Comcast is more complicated than that.  In fact, level three kind of plays some games so that instead of spreading the traffic to, you know, Akamai used to bring it right to our various head ends.  Level three is coming in at one head end and burdening our network, getting it from that head end to all the other head ends.  That's not how it was supposed to be.  We are reasonably charging.  Does anybody want to weigh in on this one or should we just say it's not?  Let me ask a question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As a New Yorker, let me answer a question with a question.  Yes.  In the discussion about the FCC, which we'll get to in a second too, I know I saw one reference to saying that, well, you should pay more for more bits.  But that's not the issue here.  It's just a matter of how many bits.  It's a matter of the quality of the delivery.  Well, let me put it this way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I pay Comcast for Internet access and that includes the whole freaking Internet.  That includes Netflix.  Does it seem fair that Comcast could then go to Google or Netflix or anybody else and say, yeah, if you want our customers, you're going to have to pay us a little extra money here?  That does seem like that's what Net Neutrality is all about is that you shouldn't be able to have a toll road.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But what I'm asking, Leo, is that there's two different things here, I think.  One is basically quantity and the other one is speed.  No?  No, it's purely quantity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is purely quantity.  It's purely quantity.  It's the issue, as I understand it, the issue is according to Comcast, the way Akamai did it, they would deliver those bits right to the head ends of Comcast.  So it didn't burden the Comcast network the way Level 3 is doing it.  And they're saying to kind of a handoff at one point saying you get it to your customers.  I think this is very complicated.  I think there is more to it than meets the eye.  As I said, I'm very happy to blame Comcast.  But maybe there is more.  And apparently, I'm told that if you really want to know more about this, you read the NANOG mailing list, North America Network Operators Group.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That sounds like a good read.  It's on my must read list.  That sounds like a beach read.  Sorry, I didn't mean to be serious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Actually, it probably is a really good read because these guys are fascinating, really smart.  I know some NANOG members.  But I don't know.  You're right.  I confess I haven't had the fortitude to sit down and read the mailing list.  But there's more than meets the eye here.  And some say really Level 3 is pulling some shenanigans.  I don't know who's at fault here.  I guess the best I could say is this does raise the issue of network neutrality.  And this really is the first time we've heard of a company, a big Internet service provider, and Comcast is the biggest saying, I mean, what if they went to Google?  And said, Hey, you want our customers to make Google searches?  You're going to have to pay for that.  That's the issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There'll likely be YouTube, right?  Yeah, that absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't it?  Well, I go back to when Excite at Home came out.  I think we talked about this once on the show, 20 or 30 shows ago.  When Excite at Home came out, they were saying, this was the original net neutrality problem.  They said if you, if you, you know, dead end right into us, we'll allow you to do that.  We'll charge you for the privilege.  It was the exact opposite of this case.  It was saying that if you want, it would be like saying to Akamai, we'll charge you for the privilege of making a direct connection into our head ends.  And as a result, your stuff will be delivered at quality.  Right.  And so Akamai, in a sense to Comcast did them the favor, it would appear, of creating these direct connections.  And then when Level 3 doesn't and acts like just any other network customer, it's kind of like Akamai made them look bad.  But why should Level 3's bits be discriminated against versus my bits?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe this is just too complicated for us to discuss, but I think it's something, it's a big issue.  It is.  It's, I think a lot of this would go away and I don't think you'd need a net neutrality regulation if there were true competition among Internet service providers.  But very few of us have more than one or two choices.  And if both of them are being rapacious, we don't have much choice.  So the Federal Communications Commission is set to vote on net neutrality rules this month, December.  On Wednesday, the FCC staff circulated an agenda for December 21st, saying that they would vote on that day on an order that adopts,  quote, basic rules of the road to preserve the open Internet as a platform for innovation, investment, competition and free expression.  That sounds optimistic.  I like the phrase.  Yeah, me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's on Solstice.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's hope the hippies rule.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are, according to this article on CNET, two major areas of contention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Broadband providers want to ensure the language used in the rules would not prohibit them from managing their networks.  That's code for things like the Internet.  Using Sandvine to make sure that not too many bits from BitTorrent were spread over the network.  But it does seem reasonable that they have to manage their networks.  And we were demanding more and more bandwidth on over their pipes.  Or they would like to make sure that they continue to have the right to charge different prices for different levels of service.  And I'm with you on this, Jeff.  If you're saying I want more bandwidth, I'm with you on this.  And I'm with you on this, Jeff.  If you're saying I want more bandwidth, more speed, you should be able to, I mean, they should be able to say, well, for the highest bandwidth, you pay the highest price.  I don't think anybody has a problem with that, right?  As long as at every tier, all the bits are treated equally.  Exactly.  That Bing doesn't somehow get a better deal than Google or vice versa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Paying less for dial-up, you pay more for broadband.  Yeah.  That's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's always been that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Secondly, the second bone of contention is from wireless service providers.  And this is that famous Google Verizon pact who want wireless networks to be exempt from any net neutrality regulations.  And, of course, Google and Verizon issued a joint statement saying that they, Google said, yes, that's a good idea.  That land networks are one thing, but these wireless networks are another, and they should be exempt.  Oh.  Well, maybe if you put a term on it, I could see exempt for the next year or two years, I could see, because they're nascent and they...  Then they say, do I bother?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just think the idea that wired and wireless are at all different is... and alluvian.  It's ridiculous.  Now, the only thing that might happen, here's the problem.  The competition we are going to get to the wire to our door...  Is going to be wireless.  Wireless is through things like white spaces that Google has fought for.  And now, if all of that future competition... you just said the solution is competition.  But the competition is regulated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. There's no competition because the FCC did set it up that way.  Right. That's what's so scary about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The only way to get competition is through wireless, and you're making wireless hampered against wired, then we might as well not have the competition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it seems like one thing that everybody could agree on is...  If there were more wireless spectrum, that would be really nice.  So, the FCC is doing a lot of stuff about white spaces and some of these things that used to be taken up with analog television channels.  They don't need that much room when they switch to digital.  And, you know, wow, there's so much interesting stuff going on with wireless and phones.  And the more you can have that ability to try new things, I think the better everybody will be off.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Julius Genachowski, the chairman of the FCC, did discuss a compromise, which I might be able to get behind, similar to what Henry Waxman proposed earlier this year,  which would bar Internet service providers from discriminating against rival Internet traffic.  I don't know how key rival is.  And includes some limited net neutrality protections on wireless.  Maybe that's a good compromise. Maybe not, you know, not completely free reign on wireless, but some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's where I'm starting to go.  And this is very much unlike me because I'm not anti-government, but I'm not libertarian, I'm Democrat, but I sometimes sound like it.  But in this case, I'm starting to wonder whether the Internet is such a utility and so important strategically that it to follow the analogy of the interstate,  the government will pay private people to build it, but because we paid to build it, it's open and it's ours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I kind of, you know, it's so funny because that's exactly what I thought.  It's like the interstate highway system. It shouldn't be owned by anyone. It should.  It's a national resource. If there's all sorts of economic considerations that it's, you know, it's in the national interest that it be open, free, affordable.  We pay way more for bandwidth. We're 22nd or 23rd in availability and cost of bandwidth in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So all this hoo-ha about supporting their investment in our bandwidth. Well, they're not investing.  Look at trying to use your AT&T phone. Look at what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Essentially what they're trying to do is to maximize the profit from the copper that they put in because they don't want, you know,  they want to get all the money out of that before they upgrade to fiber or whatever is next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And back in the day when I knew this stuff, I knew the cable companies, it's been quite a while, it's been a few years,  but when I was involved in this cable companies were getting a gross margin of 45% on their delivery of bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll just put a standing offer in. I will buy fiber from anyone who will send it to my house.  Me too.  I can't get it, you know.  You can't get it.  And that's pretty frustrating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, Verizon stopped. I mean, I think Fios is done right now. They've gone everywhere they're going to go.  Now LTE goes live and I'm going to talk about that in just a second. So don't go anywhere. This is wireless.  And you're right, Jeff, this may be the future for high speed internet.  Before we talk about that, I want to talk about getting rid of those old gadgets with Gazelle.  Don't sell it. Gazelle it.  Gazelle is a really fun, good service.  And every time I talk about it, I get tweets and emails from people who've tried it, were maybe perhaps a little skeptical.  I was the first time I heard about Gazelle. I said, well, let me get a box together and see.  Here's what happens. You go to gazelle.com, G-A-Z-E-L-L-E dot com.  There's a form there that you say you fill in and say, this is what I've got.  These are my gadgets.  And and they'll tell you, you know, you tell them what quality it is, whether you got the cords, the cables and all of that stuff.  And then they tell you what it what they'll pay you for it.  Then you get a box, you put it all in a box, they send you the mailing label so you don't pay for the shipping.  And all of a sudden, lo and behold, you get a check about a week later or you can get a I think they have PayPal cards, Amazon cards.  You have a variety of stuff. Oh, look, redesigned page.  That's the old one. This is the new one.  Oh, neat. Cash for your gadgets.  Here's all the categories. Blu-ray players, calculators.  How many calculators you have lying around the house? Camcorders, camera lenses, cell phones.  Oh, boy. Oh, baby. I got a drawer full.  Desktops, digital cameras, e-readers, PDAs, hard drives, GPS devices, gaming consoles, home audio.  You fill in the form. See, I see them.  I try a Bose. Let's see.  Bose Wave radio. Time to get rid of that.  You tell it the condition. No, it works.  No noticeable flaws. Perfect.  You just fill out this form. See, I've got all the original stuff.  Yeah, sure. Sure. Original box.  No, I don't have that. Come on. Let's get real.  Threw that out. And they say it's worth 88 bucks.  So you add that to the box.  Then you say and you can sell them. Send a box full of crap.  And then they will send you a check.  In fact, I'm going to give you a little hint here.  If you use the offer code twig, they'll give you a five percent bonus on checkouts.  They give you a little extra just to let us give us a little little bang for our buck.  They also do recycling. If there's no value to your gadget.  My God knows I have a few.  They will they will absolutely recycle it in a environmentally friendly way.  Green recycling.  They they have charity pages, too, for your for your forget having a bake sale.  Have a gadget sale. G A Z E L L E Gazelle dot com.  Don't sell it. Gazelle it.  Use the offer code twig for an additional five percent.  We thank them so much for their support of this week in Google.  Here comes LTE. Verizon had a press conference today.  LTE, which stands for long term evolution.  Boys, they're a terrible acronym.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What the hell is it? It's 4G. It's 4. Yeah, it's 4G.  It's 4G. Well, you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's interesting because the definition of 4G technically is actually much higher speed than anybody in the U.S.  is offering technically.  That figures. But we call it 4G because it's faster than 3G.  It's like 3.9G. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  3.9G. So LTE, which I mean, in theory, I think what they're saying, I can't remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I looked it up once. What 4G is. If you look on Wikipedia, I think they're saying like 10 megabits is nowhere near that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So when that actually happens, it'll be like, no, this is the real 4G.  That was just that was really what they call it. They'll call it fourth dimension.  It'll be 4G. 4G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes. Superior 4G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  LTE will be available in 38 markets, 60 airports on December 5th.  Wait a minute. That's that's that's that's like Saturday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Four days from now. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Whoo. Matt's happy. Yeah.  They're going to offer two different USB modems from Verizon.  I don't know what the costs are going to be. My five. My five.  Presumably it will be available in the Bay Area.  I'm sure Manhattan's on the list. Let me look. 38 cities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have to be in a second tier city. Is San Diego second tier?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let me let me let me back to New York. Let me go.  Let me go to the. Hey, Gina. Yeah.  You know, they got this bus that drives around.  There is a Verizon LTE site. I'm just trying to find it.  The LTE. BZW.com slash LTE slash overview dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  HTML. Here it is. The LTE Information Center.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But where is the list of cities?  Doesn't have. Where is the list of cities?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can follow it on Twitter. You can listen. I don't want to follow you on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I want the list. Get more information here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I saw that they do have San Francisco and San Jose, and that's as much as I read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's all. You stopped there, didn't you?  You stopped right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wait a minute. Look, here's a button that says test men and women.  I wonder what that is. What does that mean? I don't know, but.  I'm glad they have a button that says that.  I will continue to research. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I will continue to research.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right. We're going to let Gina find out where LTE is.  But that's what you know what happened is that Sprint was taking all the air out of the room with their fake 4G, which is really why Max.  And Verizon said, we can't let them, those sons of guns, we can't let them continue to own the 4G.  In fact, Sprint and Verizon were fighting over whether it is even 4G.  So they're going to have them. Let me see if the gadget has a review of the LG VL 600 modem.  And the company today's announcement.  It's rather large. It sure is. It's huge. It's a USB dongle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Comes with an extra. See, that's that's what that's what gets me mad.  I only the only thing I want is is my five. Yeah.  The dongles ridiculous. There's no reason to have a dongle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So now remember that there is no one using 4G or the LTE 4G right now.  But is in gadget testing it said they got consistent speeds of seven megabits down one megabit up.  That's better than a lot of people's home service. Overall speeds held steady.  Remember, nobody's using it except you at five to six megabits down one a megabit up.  That's faster than why Max.  I have to say I was very unimpressed, underwhelmed with why Max in Las Vegas when we used it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's clear. Is that clear? That's clear. Yeah.  I got a test one from them which I'm about to send back.  And yeah, it got me good bandwidth here like like seven eight.  But then people said, oh, wait, in any market where it's being used, you don't get much.  That's the problem is that it's shared bandwidth.  The other problem is it had software on the machine and what demanded upgrades.  I hate that. When I wasn't online and all this McGill.  My file is just the only way to go. Yeah, I agree with you.  That's why the way why I got. What did you get?  I got one. I got one. Oh, you got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Samsung. He's playing Angry Birds on the Samsung Galaxy Tab.  So well, the beautiful thing about it is it in fact is you got a big he has big hips.  So it goes right in his hip pockets. Hey, hey, hey, small hips.  You know, it's it makes me wish I were blazers still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's all that's why they become like photographers jacket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I think more and more people are going to pick up blazers so they can wear they can carry around their big, big ass gadgets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, seriously. I got to carry a freaking purse purse.  That's the worst purse. I don't want to first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So how do you like it, Jeff? I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it has a lot of the same problems that the iPad has to me.  So I'm not I'm not, you know, for all those people say, great screen, though.  Great. It's got a good screen. It doesn't have the USB. I want it's not a phone, which is stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I get that. But me too. It's like if I'm going to carry that around, I want it at least to be a phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course, it is ridiculous. Yeah.  Well, I don't know. That looks kind of good.  I got a big hand and a big head, too, by the way.  But the fact that it fits in the pocket is great. I had a senior moment at my office yesterday.  I'm looking all around. Oh, my God. I've lost it already. I'm going with the best was in my pocket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  At least it wasn't on your head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm very impressed by it. I like it.  The reason I got it was it also has the it's the access point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You did not get it has a yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did not get well. I went you know, here's I went and bought bought it with with no plan.  It's a mistake. I can't get geography. I can't get everything else.  You need to plan on a separate my five. So screw it. I went back and I got the my I got the plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I have to say I love that Android can still do the Wi-Fi hotspot and the USB tethering because I went to Tennessee to see my grandfather last week.  He turned 99 right before Thanksgiving and they you know, there's no Wi-Fi to be had in his house.  So I fired up my Android device and I had a little USB straw.  It is sort of just get the net through and so I could keep track of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Pretty darn sweet. Yeah. So did you get the Verizon, Jeff?  No, I got the T-Mobile. T-Mobile. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you do the tethering. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think I think the sprint does tethering to pretty sure cost more.  Oh, but you pay 20 bucks a month. That's right. Yeah. Yeah, this is included.  All right. So we got one more story and I'm going to put Matt on the spot. Groupon. Groupon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know nothing. I know nothing. Groupon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The rumor is and this is now all things D talking.  This is the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, all saying Google and hot and heavy conversations with Groupon, which is the group buying site to buy it for an unbelievable five point three to six billion dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And the obvious joke. What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did they get a discount to make them their friends to buy Groupon clones?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right, Gina, do you use Groupon? Are you a Groupon groupie?  I've seen ads for it. I see it ads for it a lot, but I know I haven't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I haven't used it, but some folks are really into it.  And I mean, it kind of makes sense, right? Facebook deals.  You know, it's similar to that, right? From what I understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, what's interesting is it's very much like the beacon thing, because if you link it to Facebook, it does all the stuff Beacon wanted to do.  But Facebook got in trouble with, you know, your friend.  It's just what you bought. Gina just bought got an amazing deal on the 18-hole golf game.  That's what they're offering me right now.  Twenty seven dollars for 18 holes of golf, including cart rental supply of warm up range balls and take home souvenir at the fabulous Healdsburg Golf Club at Tayman Park.  A $57 value. So every day you get one of these.  Yeah, you get one and there and for me, they're all crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't want any. I agree with you.  But 57 people in my area bought this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, but it's only 57 people that Matt, I know we've given you other tasks today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can I give you one more here, even if you don't know nothing about this?  Of course, and say, don't do it.  Stop, stop.  It's it's I know a small little podcast network you could buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Small little podcast network you could buy for one billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hear they have really good production values.  Fantastic. Fantastic hosts.  Good conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They've got a revenue model.  Actually, Groupon's doing all right, according to according to according to Wall Street, 500 million a year in revenue.  So, Jeff, come on, this is a good buy and growing fast.  In fact, here's hey, I'll give you.  OK, I won't say I won't I won't say anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google's MySpace.  Yeah, this will be Google's MySpace.  Because the problem, I think, is that, you know, it's a it's a fad right now.  And Google looks at it as we don't do that.  It has three thousand one of Fred Wilson's partners had a very good post about this.  Google is a technology company that has huge sales per person.  Groupon is a person company. It's a sales company.  They have three thousand salespeople owning the sales force at hyperlocal will not scale.  I repeat, it will not scale.  The problem to solve here is how you scale selling to millions of businesses.  Now, Google has done that to an extent.  And to me, Facebook just won this by making the deals free and then making everybody an upsell customer.  And so they identify who's the best prospect and they can sell in new ways.  And so I think Facebook's way ahead on this model.  They can put Groupon in functionality and in a flash.  There's no barrier to entry here.  It's a very low revenue per employee company.  It's yeah, fine.  So it gets through sheer force of will.  It gets 50 million dollars a month.  That's fine.  That's a nice company.  But it ain't worth five billion dollars.  That please tell them my stock money.  No, I will pass the remarks on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Max is going to run in.  No, that's going to run and say, guys, stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've got some new information about the eyeglass place.  So we got to listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Don't you think, Jeff, that perhaps somebody's thought about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Rupert, Rupert, you got to buy this thing.  We saw all the kids are using it.  It's called your space or my space or something like that.  Oh, hi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I will make look at this total total dollars saved by Groupon users.  Seven hundred eighty nine million total Groupon's bought eighteen point three million.  I don't want to do your number.  Does your number of the week have anything to do with Groupon?  Well, then I'll give you I'll give you a number.  It's two years old.  The company is two years old.  If they do, in fact, sell for six billion dollars, they will have increased their value.  Twenty million dollars a day since the day they were founded.  It's absurd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a friggin bubble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was thinking of starting a similar business.  But literally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  So my group, I subscribe to Groupon in North Jersey.  My I can save it's crap.  I agree.  Four percent off laser hair removal and Pearl River.  I don't even know where Pearl River is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, I agree.  I'm in the Napa Sonoma area and it is and you only get one of these a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is it off a mani pedi in Hoboken.  I got that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, I got that yesterday.  It wasn't in Hoboken, but I got the same thing.  Half off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I get 52 percent off ice skating.  I ice skate.  I follow my ass and break it.  It's crap.  They're selling a bunch of crap.  I get 55 percent off.  It was a revolution in New Jersey monthly.  An absolute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's a junk.  It is a little down market.  I got to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I have to admit I haven't used Groupon myself, but maybe there's some some benefit to the fact that people get exposed to things they wouldn't normally get exposed to.  Like I don't know about you, but I hit the same six or seven restaurants, you know, and so maybe if it gets you exposed to a new restaurant or a new experience or a new business that that could be what a lot of people enjoy about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was giving a give Matt a bonus for trying to carry the water there.  We're very nicely done, Matt.  I was very, very calm and easy and rational.  But now, no, I'm not going to give it to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What about what about the it's it's Angry Birds Day, December 11th.  You're going to celebrate Angry Birds Day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I came so close to buying one of the little Angry Birds plush toys.  Did you?  I knew that I have a problem.  Yeah, because, you know, stuffed animals.  It's been a few years.  Angry Bird plush toys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I need that stuffed red bird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I need it.  And I want to throw it at people in my life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How about the guy who Googles himself and finds out he's a murder suspect?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A standout student here at the University of Florida.  My initial reaction was pure shock.  And after that, it was just me being upset.  Zachary Garcia is a freshman from Hollywood, Florida, who stumbled upon the mistake late Saturday night.  He was Googling his name when he came across the news stories.  He called home, woke up his mother and said he feared getting kicked out of school, losing his two jobs or worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By the way, case of mistaken identity, it wasn't him.  So, you know, he feels much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But this is the funniest quote I'd ever seen where he basically said, I make sub sandwiches for people.  The worst I could ever do is make a bad sub.  I've never murdered anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Android is for men.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hey, hey, hey, hey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK, I'll leave that alone.  I got to remember to scroll down to the bottom here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought that was down there.  Darn it. I should have seen.  Now it's my fault that I didn't I didn't mark it above.  That's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll save that for you.  The iPhone is from Mars.  The the iPhone's from Zenith, Venus, not Zenith.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You steal my punch line too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's obvious.  I didn't steal it.  It's just obvious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know it is.  It's all I do is obvious punch line.  Obvious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Android, I mean, will get will be the first.  This is actually very telling.  Angry Birds, which really was an iPhone app than an iPad app, finally came to Android, is not on Windows Phone 7.  Now Rovio announces that the Angry Birds expansion pack for the season will be Android only.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Woohoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Angry Birds, you love it, but you don't try to play it on an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's a conspiracy against Google because it's going to make every Android user just waste parts of the economy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have the Halloween one.  I want to play the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they are charging for seasons though.  The season's not on.  It's not just ad support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a good question because the Angry Birds on Android is ad support, which is an interesting experiment.  What did we say last week?  Seven million downloads.  They got to be making money on it.  So it's an advent calendar really for Android.  Android didn't get the Halloween edition.  So 25 levels for the 25 days of Christmas of holiday snow fun.  Oh, wait a minute.  It will also include the Halloween expansion.  And it's all free.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Huh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait, and this isn't available for the iPhone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By the way, Jeff, isn't it isn't the Samsung tab a great Angry Birds platform?  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's wonderful.  You guys are killing me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You guys are killing me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What do we do on Angry Birds Day?  I actually have to look here.  I haven't played Angry Birds in ages.  I don't even know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Seriously, we need to pelt one another with with stuffed Angry Birds.  I think that's that's the most appropriate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Look, Angry Birds meetups around the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a fun one.  OK, OK, I'm going to take a break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're going to come back with our tip, our number and our tool of the week.  What are you doing, Jeff?  What is he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm making Gina jealous.  Jealous, angry birds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm waiting for pure Google tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Come on, you're killing me.  Yeah.  What about gingerbread?  You got the statue, Matt.  What about gingerbread?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, the great thing about working at Google is you get to try out some some stuff.  So, you know, come work at Google and you can dog food, you know, wonderful new products.  Honeycomb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which means that Matt is running gingerbread.  Damn it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Gingerbread. He's probably running honeycomb.  Honeycomb, maybe.  He's probably running honeycomb on his tablet.  He's probably running Chrome OS on his netbook.  Now we now I keep hearing conflicting stuff now.  They're saying, yes, it will be this year.  They better hurry.  They got one month left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder what the Google Christmas present to employees is going to be, perhaps a netbook.  Do you get a gift every year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is that how that works?  Historically, they have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But, you know, I try not to get in the mode or the mindset where it's like Google owes me something.  You know, if I don't enjoy it, that's that's that's a problem.  But I do enjoy it very much.  So that's why I keep coming to Google every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's funny because my employees, they say, what are you giving us?  So what are you giving us?  How do you know?  I'm a fan.  Oh, sorry.  Well, if you know, I guess everybody probably knows.  Apparently, they're going to update the Netflix app on the Google TV, which is good because it has kind of an old and funky.  And I have to say, can I have a confession?  Yesterday, I come home.  Henry says, I can't the TV's not working.  I said, yes, it is.  He said, no, it's black.  I said, oh, let me see.  Oh, yeah.  The the Google TV has it.  I talked about this a couple of weeks ago.  It pops up an error that says the time is wrong.  Then it turns on the screen saver.  And unless you know to hit the keyboard on the Google TV to wake it up, you don't see anything on your TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a bug that I can file.  Yeah, would you please?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Too late.  I already I've removed it from the chain.  I actually said it's very easy, though, because it's a pass through.  So I just, you know, and I'm done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and it is it's definitely, you know, the analogy with the G1 and how much better it got.  It's the G1.  It's the G1.  You know, it's and you actually can see them iterating and, you know, how fast they're making changes to improve it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I think this is one one one measure of it is that they're finally putting the the the, you know, the full real Netflix on it.  You know, the one with the where you could pick from the, you know, instead of that old version.  So that's that's an improvement.  I can't wait. I can't wait.  And I'm not going to throw out the Google TV.  I'm not going to return the Google TV.  I have hopes. I have high hopes.  And I will I will just like my G1, which is in a drawer right here someday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I will flash the firmware and it will magically appear before we go on with the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just want to mention quickly the General Electric Eco-Magination Challenge, which is rapidly coming to a close.  It was a great this is a great idea.  GE put together two hundred million dollars to invest in new ideas for improving the way energy is produced, transferred and consumed.  If you go to Eco-Magination dot com slash challenge, you can see the winners three different categories.  The first is renewables.  GE wants to encourage better ways to integrate renewable energy right into the power grid.  Energy from wind, water, sun.  The second investment category grid efficiency to convert the smart grid.  The smart grid is even now out of date.  They want that they're going for digital energy.  And finally, eco homes and buildings, which is which is fairly important if you think about it.  You know, it's not merely better ways to generate, but also ways to conserve.  So two hundred million dollars.  And if you go to Eco-Magination, ECO MAG IN ATION slash dot com slash challenge right now,  you'll see some of the winners in the Eco-Magination challenge.  Oops, there it is.  And I'm just it's just really a great a great thing.  GE has supported our green tech today show, which is still going on in a great show.  You can catch it on iTunes if you missed earlier episodes or go to twit dot tv slash GTT and then go to Eco-Magination dot com and meet the winners and their great ideas.  Thank you, GE, for putting together such a great program and putting together so much money.  Two hundred million dollars towards this good cause.  Eco-Magination dot com slash challenge.  We thank GE for their support of this show and green tech today.  Time for Gina's tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Airsync.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm doing it. I'm doing it. Airsync.  So if you've got an Android phone and you use Double Twist, which is the free kind of iTunes for Android software, Double Twist dot com,  there's a brand new feature called Airsync, which will let you wirelessly sync your playlists, videos and photos to your Android device over Wi-Fi.  So, you know, I'm trained now with Android.  Everything's I never have to connect my Android phone to my computer, right?  All my contacts on my mail, everything gets, you know, it's just there on the phone, which is the best part about Android.  The only time you really did have to connect the phones for computers to sync, you know, to sync media.  And now with Double Twist with Airsync, you can do it wirelessly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is it over? It's over Wi-Fi. You both have to be on the same network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's over Wi-Fi. So you have to install the Double Twist software on your desktop, which I already had because I was using it.  And then you install, you have to get the update for the Double Twist app on your Android device.  And it just says set up Airsync. If the two devices are on the same network, Wi-Fi network, it syncs your playlists, videos and photos.  It's awesome. So great.  When you want to refresh your workout playlist or, you know, get more songs on the go, you don't have to break out that USB cable, which is so, so good.  Much better.  Yay, Airsync.  Yay, Airsync. And it works really well. I set it up literally during the time that we were setting up Twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, neat. But that's like an hour and a half, but still impressive.  Thank you, Gina. Our number of the week for Mr. Jay Jarvis.  Thank you for generously not stepping on it. I didn't see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have no idea what it was.  Very annoying. No, you don't. I know you don't. And the line that you weren't going to say was that iPhones are from Mars and Android from Venus.  Or the other way around, actually.  Is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, because men use Android.  Oh, right. Oh, geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead, take my number.  Get back in your cave. I don't know what the number is.  So men are 32.6% of men want an Android versus 28% want an iPhone. For women, it's the reverse.  Well, that's obvious.  39% want an iPhone and 22.8% want an iPhone and 22.8% want an Android. Not that there's anything wrong with that.  The iPhone is for girly men.  That's obviously the conclusion.  Yeah, it's for girly men. You are girly men.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You have an iPhone. Oh, I hope you enjoy it. Do you have a beautiful bamboo case for it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But when size matters, my iPhone is bigger than your iPhone.  That's a good point. You got a giant one there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, just a point about this. I really it's all about the marketing, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The iPhone commercials are like one woman showing off boots that she just, you know, bought to her girlfriend or a friend.  I hate those droid commercials. I hate them.  I know, I know.  But that Google has no control over that because that's Motorola and Verizon has nothing to do with Google.  But it also certainly shows that the pad brand didn't matter at all.  Right. Yeah, because they don't do anything for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would say that the women were more interested in the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, interesting.  That's the thing about brands, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Any company's brands, people just suffer over them and suffer over them and suffer over them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't matter, does it?  I didn't know how to pronounce Verizon for two years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And at some point it doesn't matter.  Right.  It's the brand.  It gets in your head.  Yeah.  My tip is actually for Mac users, I think it's the same thing.  I think it's the same thing.  I think it's the same thing.  I think it's the same thing.  I think it's the same thing.  I think it's the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It gets in your head.  Yeah.  My tip is actually for Mac users who use Gmail.  It is a new Mac email client that's designed for Gmail.  Although they say that eventually it will support other IMAP servers.  But it is a very elegant way to...  I've actually replaced Apple Mail now because all of my mail is on Gmail.  It's called Sparrow and it's currently in beta so it's free.  Beta 6 just came out.  Sparrowmailapp.com.  And actually let me bring it back.  For one thing, it really works well on the air.  You can hide the dock icon and just have a menu icon.  It's very clean.  If I open the display, you can see it kind of looks more like a traditional mail.  It does support labels.  So I can see all my Gmail labels in here.  It does a great job.  I have multiple Gmail accounts.  Here's my regular Gmail account.  Here's my Google Apps Gmail account.  Very simple to respond back.  Does it support Priority yet?  Well, Gina, is Priority a label?  It should if it's a label, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a reserved label.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let me see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's important or something like that.  It's important, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let me see if I see...  No, see I...  Profile message.  No, I don't see it.  So I guess...  But I'm sure this is in rapid upgrade mode.  It doesn't do one thing that I really like, which is the ability to use PGPRS MIME to sign mail.  I do like to sign all my mail.  But it does support archiving.  It does support deleting as well.  It is just a very quick and elegant way of doing your email if you're a Gmail user.  And you know, you've got stars.  You've got sent mail.  You've got all the labels here.  I've got drafts and my trashcan.  And just when you close the preview window, it's just a little thing sitting right there.  Really nice in the MacBook Air where it doesn't take up a lot of room.  That's called Sparrow.  It is free right now.  I imagine they're going to charge for it down the road.  But the beta is free.  Sparrowmailapp.com.  Mac users only, but I know a lot of Gmail users use Macs as well.  Hey, that's it for this week in Google.  Matt, so much fun to have you on.  Anytime you want to come by.  We'd love having you.  Yep.  It was a true pleasure.  Thanks for having me on.  Matt.  Matt.  Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The man who improves the Internet every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, we can thank Matt for his good work at Google keeping spam results out of our search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, luckily I have a huge team that helps.  All right.  Not all you?  No, no.  I don't speak enough languages for one thing.  Well, that's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Matt, I do have a serious question.  I do have a serious question.  Because I say all the time that I would think that you would be the most unpleasant guy  in the worst mood on earth dealing with the scum of life.  Why are you one of the nicest people I know?  How do you do that in your head?  I'm serious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How do you do that?  He's so sunny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know.  Well, I have gotten a little more of a thick skin over the years.  People can call me a lot of stuff and I'm like, oh, that's not the worst thing I've  been called.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That always helps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do spammers actually call you?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've got, you know, people.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, they get frustrated.  You know, the occasional death threats, stuff like that.  But it's pretty rare.  Do they have Russian or Nigerian accents?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it varies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It varies.  Jeff Jarvis is at buzzmachine.com.  That's his blog.  His book is What Would Google Do?  Soon to be public parts, Any Day Now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Smarterware.org.  I would like to have Merge.  Smarterware.org.  And you're putting, you're going full time at Think Tank now.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, I've been full time leading Think Up development for a while now.  But yeah, I'm kind of cutting down on some of my freelance stuff.  And I'm going to go kind of dive into coding more, which I'm really excited about.  But I will be working.  We're doing a new edition of the Lifehacker book.  So I am going to be working with Adam Pash on that one next year, which will be fun.  And also one thing that we didn't mention today, there's an official Google reader app out for Android.  So search for reader on the market.  Oh, I should have mentioned that is my tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have to download that right away.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm getting my nice big thing where I'm going to play.  That's made for Google reader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Made for Google reader, isn't it?  What were you saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, you can use the volume knob to go scroll through screen through items.  See, Apple wouldn't let you do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, you get knocked out of the market for this for that.  Think Up is the place to go to learn more about Think Up.  Think Up app dot com, I should say.  And you can now download it and put it on your web server.  If you've got PHP in my SQL.  Very cool. Thank you, Gina. Thank you, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gina, Gina, Gina, hold on one question.  Quick, quick, quick. I don't find it.  What do I search for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Reader.  Just reader.  Just reader. Okay, thank you.  Sure.

Transcript:  Now you can say goodbye, Leo.  Thank you, everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

We'll put you in charge.  Or maybe, I don't know, maybe Tom Merritt will sit here in the studio just to keep you company.  It's egalitarian, this show.  It is. There really isn't a host.  Thanks, everybody. We'll see you next time on This Week in Google. Bye-bye.
