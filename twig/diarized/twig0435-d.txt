Everything going on in the world around us.  Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft.  Not so much Microsoft.  Apple, not so much Apple.  Jeff Jarvis is here, professor of journalism at the City University of New York,  blogger at BuzzMachine.com, author of so many great books, including  What Would Google Do?  You Know What I'm Doing? Public Parts.  You're poking me.  I'm poking.  Poking's back. Is the poke back?  Oh, say it ain't so.  Oh, Lord.  We'll talk about that in a second, because I got to introduce our  other partner here is a partner in crime, as it were, Stacey Higginbotham.  She's the host of Stacey on IOT,  a great podcast with Kevin Toffle and the Stacey on IOT  a newsletter.  And you can find all her work at Stacey on IOT.com.  Hello, Stacey. Boy, you look festive today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I think I put lipstick on. Woo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but I think the lace, you know, you're kind of in a white room.  And I just thought there's an elegance.  There's this. Yes.  She's got elegance.  Oh, she I'm now singing songs from Hello Dolly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was going to say that means I can't talk about queso.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You ain't got no queso.  No queso.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Tomorrow is the day.  You know, I haven't talked a whole lot about net neutrality.  I've seen protests on the net.  Reddit, when you go to Reddit, has a big thing.  And a few other sites put up a  don't forget to call your Congress critter and all that.  I feel like it's over because there's no way no matter what we do.  We already got a more than a million comments in favor of net neutrality.  And the FCC just goes, yeah, right. Never mind.  Who cares what you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why not only do we have all these comments in favor of keeping net neutrality,  we also have evidence of fraud that they're like, eh, we don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We don't care. They they literally don't care.  And incidentally, just to add insult to injury,  because remember, one of the things the FCC will do probably tomorrow  is hand over all enforcement of net neutrality, a job that really should be its job.  Federal Communications Commission to the Federal Trade Commission.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then the FTC says, what? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Federal Trade Commissioner Terrell McSweeney has repeatedly warned  that her organization is not able to do the job.  She actually wrote an article and says, quote,  The FTC does not have specialized expertise in telecommunications.  Well, duh.  We don't have engineers of technical experience in data network management practices.  We don't even have jurisdiction over common carriers.  These are very real and significant limits to the effectiveness of our tools,  ensuring that networks are open and free of harmful discrimination.  Which would explain to me exactly why Agipi wants to give it to the FTC.  There will be no enforcement. Right.  You know, the thing about this is that.  Go ahead, go ahead, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was going to say it'll be purely deceptive trade  plus a little bit practices,  anticompetitive, and those things are hard to prove.  And even under net neutrality, there was a  a method for carrier people to call that in and fight that.  And it takes a long time.  This is just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, it's frustrating.  Canada has has gotten into the act.  Apparently, a Canadian government official said that net neutrality  has become an issue in the NAFTA negotiations or it isn't really the NAFTA  negotiations, but negotiations over the replacement for the North  America trade agreement.  The Trump negotiations.  Canada's lead NAFTA negotiator, Steve Verhoel, said to a parliamentary  committee this week, we're including provisions like online consumer protection  to ensure that it's provided for and that we also have provisions  to provide personal information protection, which we feel is essential  in this kind of trade, along with our position that we want to protect  net neutrality when it comes to digital trade.  He says the US negotiating team is focused on trying to get Canada  to accept our version of intermediary protections online, where ISPs  and third parties like Facebook cannot be held legally responsible  for the behavior of their customers.  But Canadians prefer to leave the issue to the courts and out of a trade agreement,  he he says, Verhoel says, US negotiating team has not reacted  positively to the Canadian pushback on net neutrality.  Let me say a couple of things, if I may.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, man. One University of Maryland poll out, I think yesterday  said that 83 percent of Americans are in favor of keeping net neutrality.  So this is by no means a political decision, just like the tax bill,  I would argue, but especially here, the people don't want the 79 percent  of Republicans want to keep net neutrality.  This is an oligopoly.  This is big companies ruling the country.  And I'm sounding like I'm, you know, Bernie. I'm not.  I'm a middle of the road guy in so many ways.  But this this is an indication of of undemocratic governance.  Point one point to Ajit Pai is saying he has absolutely zero.  He's not consistent in any way in his philosophy.  Philosophy doesn't have any philosophy.  So just like on the one hand, he's saying they're saying  the government is saying no  CNN merger, but go ahead, tribune by trunk.  In this case, Ajit Pai is saying the phone companies and the ISP  should be able to do whatever they want, whatever the heck they want.  That's fine.  However, then he turns around the next breath  and he told Tucker Carlson last night that  there ought to be a law investigation or something  stopping Facebook and Google from  disadvantaging conservative content.  Well, free speech is about includes the right to edit,  includes the right to say what's hate speech and not to have it on your platform.  But that's the that's the meme that's being put out there.  And there's no consistency in any way between those two things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A guy named Jeff Jarvis on MSNBC said it all.  He said, this is all about enabling the oligopoly of cable  and the telephone to control the net.  A tie. Yeah.  For those of you listening, I have a tie on.  He's wearing a black suit and tie.  And you look much nicer.  Hey, hey.  Well, hey, you dress up for Stephanie Ruhl.  You say, yeah, yeah, Stephanie. Yeah.  By the way, she calls you one of her favorites.  Mave, I think it was a fave, one of our faves.  You know, I almost don't want to bring this up because it's  I don't think we can influence the vote at this point.  I don't think there's much we can do.  What should we do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Call your Congress critter and you could and you should, because just who?  There was a Republican congressman who came out against it.  So there's a couple things after this vote repeals it. There's.  Then the process will happen again.  We could have a lawsuit. We could find another case.  You can also expect.  I mean, it's possible that even it's a shame no one got Trump upset over this.  And so Trump could tweet, you know, ah, I want the net to stay free  because then, you know, Ajit Pai would have to go around.  Here's there's not a lot to do.  No, you can do what the Internet pioneers do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can do what the Internet pioneers did.  They wrote a letter, scathing letter, scathing letter to members of the House  and the Senate.  We are ready to respectfully urge you to call on FCC Chairman Ajit Pai  to cancel the December 14th vote.  We are the pioneers and technologists who created and now operate the Internet,  including Vint Cerf, Steve Wozniak.  Paul Vixie, Stephen Wolf, Ron Rivest.  I mean, these are names you all know, Ted Nelson, Susan Landau, Brewster Gale.  These are the Whitfield Diffie, Vernon, Vinton Cerf,  the father of the Internet, Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the worldwide web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Steve Bellavon, who tweeted yesterday that that  net neutrality is what enabled him to invent the web.  He needed a permissionless environment. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So people who say, oh, you guys are out of touch.  You know, we don't need net neutrality.  We don't want more government regulation.  OK, don't believe us.  But do you believe the people who invented and run today's Internet?  Do you believe them?  Because they seem unanimous.  This is it. But this is a list of who's who.  Why is it?  Unanimous in their contempt for what is happening tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Contempt is a good word, because that's exactly how  budget pie is reacting with by moving forward this with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He has contempt for us, for the people, for 86 percent who said  we want net neutrality for the creators and pioneers and people who run the Internet.  Complete and utter contempt.  All he cares about is lining the pockets of the telcos and the ISPs, the big guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And he also has a contempt for the facts in the sense that he says  this isn't a problem when it's actually been a documented problem.  I'm just so.  Baffled that this is actually going forward and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, yes, yes, as Stephanie Ruhl said today to me,  it's not the violations are not going to come quickly, they're going to come slowly.  I said at the end of the show, I'm a frog and I'm getting a little warm in here.  Yeah, it's going to happen in subtle ways.  It's already happening if you look at things like zero rating,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  zero rating is a net neutrality.  It's just a friendly one.  And now in the coming years, we're going to see unfriendly ones or we're going to see.  I mean, we already see if you think about things like data caps,  when that began all the way back in 2008 with Time Warner saying, hey,  maybe we shouldn't have all you can eat broadband.  That was the beginning of the data cap efforts in that very slowly  over the next four years before Comcast kind of instituted theirs happened.  And the carriers are playing a long game here because right now  they're the only ones with this asset. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Stacey, you mentioned the suit.  Is there any scenario in which you can imagine a  temporary restraining order on this or anyone with standing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think you it's a repeal of rules.  So I don't think you can sue over the repeal.  You would have to find a violation or something and sue over that.  Like you can sue when there there was a lawsuit happening  and there's currently a lawsuit about the comments. But.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think Eric Schneiderman in New York State is suing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't see that as he found a huge number of the fake comments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The FCC wouldn't hand them over.  What was it? It's a million.  Two million fake accounts.  You could also go to a site and see whether because identities were stolen.  So you can go and look up your name and see if your identity was stolen  for a fake comment to the FCC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did we do that last week? Yeah, you weren't here, Jeff.  But we did that last. Oh, I see. OK, yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which I think identity theft, isn't that an FTC issue?  Congress is someone correctly pointed this out in the comments  that Congress could make laws in training  and neutrality or some variation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, FCC only does what Congress says it can do.  And here's the problem with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What Congress?  101 million innovations from the ISP industry.  I looked up I have two Democratic senators.  Cory Booker got two hundred ninety thousand dollars.  Robert Menendez got seven hundred some thousand dollars from ISP.  My congressman got two hundred ninety thousand dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you think really that the thing we should be do  Larry Lessig thinks this.  The thing we should do is forget all these battles,  these these short term battles and go for the go for the big one,  which is to change how elections are funded, to get money out of politics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If we don't you remember the campaign finance reform bill that didn't pass?  That was a bipartisan effort.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can't have the people who benefit from this voting against it.  They're not going to do it.  It's the same thing about a coup.  It's the same problem as gerrymandering.  You know, if you have the people who are going to benefit doing the  gerrymandering, of course, they're going to do it to their benefit.  Sometimes I despair of our republic.  Comcast, by the way, is already injecting sometimes many times.  Comcast. No, not always, though.  You know what? There's some I if if there's anything.  That's positive in this is we're seeing our institutions,  chiefly the courts, because Congress is useless, but some members of Congress  and then definitely the courts holding the line,  trying to preserve our republic.  And I hope that they continue to do so, because if they get eroded,  if the if all the institutions get eroded that are protecting us right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Then we've moved into a straight up African kleptocracy and hey,  I feel like we're kind of there. We're getting close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, we're getting close.  Comcast, if you think Comcast, oh, no, they're nice.  Nice ISP. For years, they've been injecting code into your websites.  Four hundred lines of code to let you know you need a new modem  that you don't even even need.  I see this all the time. I'm a Comcast customer at home.  You do see it all the time. Yeah, it's easy to it's easy to fix.  And I think what we will do as a network going forward,  because we're talking to technologically literate folks is show you  how you can prevent your ISP from snooping on you,  from injecting code into your websites. It's not that hard.  You can do it with routers and and and, you know, plug ins and things.  And, you know, I guess we're just going to have to start the resistance  and, you know, how to how to keep your Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Free. Oh, my gosh, it's like Homeland.  No, what's it like? Little brother. It's like little brother.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Cory Doctor is a good friend.  It's very much like little brother.  Cory saw this coming years ago. You see the new homeland?  No, no. I got fell behind.  I haven't seen anything since the four.  Really? Yeah.  And I hear it's very got very good.  And I just Lisa and I have to catch up.  I didn't mean.  All right. That's net neutrality in a nutshell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a pressing way to end the year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I, you know, just you should you should stay in touch with your member of Congress.  The thing I do want to remind everybody is maybe we can't get the influence  of money out of Congress.  But what is money by it really?  In most cases, unless your Congress person is completely corrupt, which some are,  it doesn't buy them a new home or a nice boat.  It buys them votes. It goes into their campaigns.  And who ultimately controls the votes? We do.  So we do control the levers of power.  And we just need to make sure that we get our voices heard, because ultimately,  the only thing that speaks louder than the money being poured  into Congress right now is our voices as voters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So why wasn't there a soap of people level Silicon Valley fight?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The large a lot of the big tech companies were not as they had mixed feelings about this,  didn't they? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because ultimately, they are incumbents and they do benefit.  Incumbents benefit from this, which is why it's really stupid  of Agit Pai to go after Twitter and Google,  because they're natural allies of his.  But he's not smart enough to really understand what's going on.  I don't think. Hey, good news for donors.  Patreon has backed down on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, Jack Conti, if he should just be in charge of Silicon Valley,  he just seems like the most decent. I love Jack.  He listens. He listens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We met him when he and Natalie were pample moose on, you know, the great  they performed for several times in our studio.  And I knew when he started Patreon and I know he did it for the best of intents  because he himself was an artist and he wanted to support other artists.  And it's really been a boom for a lot of creators in a lot of different fields,  but especially podcasters.  Then you remember last week, they decided to kind of flip  how Patreon works in the past.  Service credit card service fees were paid by the the creator, not the patron.  They flipped it on its head, which meant that in many cases, a dollar  donated to a creator would end up costing you a buck fifty in additional charges.  The credit card fees, like two point nine percent plus a thirty five cent  per donation charge.  People howled and it hurt creators.  A lot of people canceled their subscriptions.  Well, Jack has listened and he has published a blog post.  He's explained, you know, I think he's explained well what he he says.  We messed up. We're sorry.  And we're not rolling out the fees change.  But he did. He did need to explain what was going on.  But he says it did.  It was poorly planned because it disproportionately affected the one  and two dollar patrons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there is not going to be the entire credit card billing system we have.  Yes, that's why everyone who's dreamed of micro payments,  they do not work economically.  Yeah, simply don't.  And psychologically, I don't think they also work, but economically,  they just can't be made to work. Right.  And it's just a reality of of the structure that's above him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And we've we know a lot of people have tried to create a micro payment scheme  that works.  I think 20 years ago, we knew that the net  things like journalism on the net would require something  that would allow a person to say, I'll give you a penny to read that article  or a nickel to read that article.  But never happened. It never happened.  And it's because the financial institutions want to charge those large fees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are efforts now to say, well, Bitcoin, we'll use Bitcoin  because Bitcoin is the gravy that will make any bad meal, of course, taste good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. So it's not it's not Bitcoin  per se. It's a blockchain based like digital contract kind of situation.  And that actually so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I have to point out the transaction fees for Bitcoin  far exceed that of Visa and MasterCard. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if you if you create if you create all of that  and this is blockchain versus Bitcoin.  So if you create a digital it's a digital ledger, a  monitoring of transactions, you could create something like this  where you could either aggregate wide micro payments  and then cash them out at the end.  Maybe. I mean, I think the reason the Bitcoin's transactions have gotten

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  there, they're $20 and more now is it's kind of in the nature of blockchain.  You have to give people an incentive to handle those transactions  because there's no central bank.  And it turns out people are just as greedy as central banks.  They're not going to handle those transactions unless they get something for it.  And so blockchain, you're right.  I think the key you actually nailed it, Stacey.  The key is not blockchain, but the key is aggregating micro  payments, what Apple does.  Apple doesn't charge your credit card till you buy enough stuff.  But we need some sort of aggregation system.  But but people want to get paid for their work, even if it's just Bitcoin mining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That'd be an interesting role for journalism.  So a newspaper creating or a blog creating an aggregation  platform that can fund, you know, the ability to grab all those payments  and then distribute. There's a new startup called Civic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have you heard of this, Stacey? No, I think it's called Civic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know a lot about journalism despite being a journalist.  That's I think common.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's only us people who observe journalists that know anything about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. I always left that up to Matthew.  I'm sorry, Civil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Join the Civil dot com.  I'm somebody I work with as enthusiastic.  I'm a little dubious just because I think there's a high level of complication here.  And they also think that.  It'll have a anyway. Anyway, I'm going off on a tangent here.  I think that Jack did what he did for sensible reasons.  But he listened quickly.  And I think you have to give him a lot of credit for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And in a way, Jack's big mistake was taking investments.  Once you once you take venture capital, the the goal, the goal of the game changes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And, you know, I'm not having that argument with people like Jay Rosen and others  that the VC is presumed badly because of journalism, too.  Well, Axios got a big investment and I tweeted, hey, good for them.  People just came after me all over. Oh, no, that's terrible.  That's terrible. But capital money.  I said, no, investing in journalism is a good thing.  Yes. Yes. But they're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have no they have a return structure that is problematic for journalism.  I can as someone who is inside a journalism startup  that took a lot of venture funding, had to come up with a model that  like met the hockey stick. Killed Giggle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That killed us. You see, that was Pando.  Didn't you know Pando wasn't Pando, Sarah Lacey's startup, all based on investment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was. Now, in Jeff, I would I would say no, we actually did several new models.  At Giga, the research model we pioneered was was very new and was actually  an example for the rest of the industry.  The challenge is running those things at.  And there were other challenges associated with Giga, starting with,  you know, crazy salaries for our sales staff and some accounting issues  around the research product. But.  At the end of the day, journalism doesn't  pay. And we had.  If you're not journalism.  This is the year of journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If journalism doesn't pay in 2017, it's never going to pay.  Would you agree to that, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, no, I think it's early days.  I think we're still an inefficient industry.  Just yesterday, I had a meeting of the top 20 people who were trying to.  You disagree with Stacey. You think journalism can pay?  Yes, yes, yes. That's what I devote my career to now.  But the economics are going to be very different.  It's going to be much smaller and multiple revenue streams.  And I don't think we've I don't think we've begun to reinvent  the notion of what journalism is in this age.  We are still we're trying to make pay is pay us for what we used to do  100 years ago, pay us for making articles.  Journalism, that's that's journalism as factory, not journalism as service.  Now, so for example, I had in 20 people at CUNY.  We started a community of practice around commerce,  because I think it's an area that ought to be explored for its own, for the revenue.  Also, because it pushes us to do user profiling,  which I think is an important strategic effort.  And I've also learned in talking to these people think about commerce.  It's really interesting is that trust matters greatly.  It matters more than ad support, because if you lie to your readers about a deal,  they're going to be away in a second.  So I heard the word trust constantly around the room.  So that's what that's not that's not salvation.  It's one of many revenue streams.  And you're right, Stacey, you go home and try.  Maybe it was too early.  But but my point back to the VCs is  their expectation is set only on a volume based business.  And we have to give them new models in which they invest.  And we still need their investment.  We don't have the cash to start stuff.  And we can't just do things as mom and pops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I would I would say that your thought about trust is absolutely correct.  And at GigaOM, what we're banking on is the trust that our readers had in the reporters.  And because of that, they they could sell all these other things.  So like the challenge was as one of those trusted people, I couldn't scale.  My trust didn't scale to the the venture levels.  Right.  So we had three different revenue streams, but I couldn't participate in all of them and stay safe.  And that was that was ultimately the challenge.  And I'll be honest, there.  There's my dog. She's she totally agrees, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She agrees completely.  She said, what Stacey says?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's only a few Stacey Higginbotham's in the world.  There's only a few gig or O'Malek's and Jeff Jarvis's and Leo Laporte's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you're absolutely right.  But call up, if you would, the Jonah Peretti email.  Oh, the buzzfeed. Actually, let's take a break.  I want to say, I was.  Well, I interrupt the Stacey.  I didn't. OK.  Because Stacey, I was going to ask you your reaction to his matrix.  For just that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, wait, go to break so I can read this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK. So he he put out a letter saying that there have been some serious challenges  and the media is in crisis.  But he believes that the diversified model  that BuzzFeed uses is going to ultimately work.  So first, I like what you said, Stacey, though.  I loved what you said, which is that trust.  Trust is the gold coin.  Trust is the trust is what you can sell.  But you have to be very careful not to damage that trust.  And for any enterprise to succeed, it has to continue to build  new reporters like all menu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you'll trust in the fast paced world of online journal.  I mean, like I hired a bunch of people at Giga Home and we  we tried both hiring experts and that was easy.  And when we tried hiring people and developing them in the type of journalism  that we did was not conducive to letting people learn on the job  because of that trust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Trust and expertise. So Stacey, let me understand what you're saying.  When you say you didn't scale.  That basically it was about selling your relationship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It wasn't selling my relationship.  It was people came to me because they said in my particular niche  there were other people who were good at other things.  People came to me because they were like.  I know what's going on.  I have a worldview that I can explain and articulate that so far seems to  map to money making opportunities, because again, we didn't sell to the mains  or we didn't write to the mainstream.  And then from that, they would say, OK, Stacey, in addition to all the articles  you write that we give away for free to monetize that, we would like you  to plan a conference.  So then I would plan a conference.  And in a sense, I'm monetizing my relationships because I would call people  I know and we would put on a show.  Now, we did not do pay to pay for the conferences because if they had  both own would have said no, I would have said no.  I mean, none of us were all like old school that way.  So in a sense, that may have been our failing.  But again, that was important for the trust.  So you knew if I developed a conference, you'd actually see really cool people  talking about really crazy, cool things, because that's what Stacey does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Interesting. We face very similar challenges, Stacey.  I don't think we could have survived.  Twitter, I'm saying, could have survived had we taken venture capital.  It's a very fragile.  Thing. And when economic pressures get too high, it's well,  look what happened to poor Jack Cotty.  He's lost considerable amounts of trust because of this.  And all he was doing was I'm sure exceeding to the pressures of a board  trying to turn some profit because they're valued so much higher than they're  there. You know, they make eight million a year.  They're valued at hundreds of millions.  So I think I would argue VCs a bad thing.  Jeff, can you give me an example of a journalist  and a journalistic enterprise has taken VC money that's thriving?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you got two questions wrapped up in that.  One is, can you name a journalistic enterprise that's thriving?  Well, Texas Tribune's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's well, I would say the Washington Post with the patronage of Jeff Bezos  is doing quite well.  But Jeff is clearly not the kind of investor who's saying,  and I got to see some profit right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that's true. And the problem with that is, and I agree,  and God bless that with Jeff Bezos, who buys some more things.  And he's a trained to be a very responsible owner.  But there's a fine line between a benefactor and oligarch.  I was in Ukraine.  I saw a lot of oligarchs.  And and so this notion of having somebody control the place  or Sam's L in L.A. or and on and on and on.  So so the benefactor as owner depends greatly.  And then at some point you give up, you know, don't forget the grams.  It's probably not a model for many years.  It's probably not a probably not a model.  So there's that thing that's happening.  So there's that first.  So the first question is, it's hard to judge  venture backed media companies apart from the entire media industry.  The entire media industry is what I was trying to say badly.  Hasn't yet found and perfected the the models in the mix.  We're still in the experimentation stage.  And unfortunately, Stacey, you suffered the scars of that.  But the lessons that you learned and taught,  I think will keep paying off for others as time goes on.  You're the cautionary tale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But no, I'm also I mean, like I when I started my own business,  I did it with an eye to never taking outside investment,  even though that was scary.  You and I did the same thing, Stacey.  Yeah, we learned a lesson.  But you're scaling right now.  I'm I'm like, yeah, I'm not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm kind of hovering.  I don't think we're going.  Our revenues were off about 10 percent from last year.  Our profits weren't because we canceled shows and laid off people.  So I wouldn't say that we are.  Now, there's there's other things in in in play here, like the  growth of the podcast pool and people's attention  being distracted by other things and so forth.  But I would say I don't I don't, you know,  if I had economic pressure from the outside, I wouldn't have.  We wouldn't be able to survive that.  We'd have to sell out, basically.  We have to sell that trust.  We'd have to sell it.  So if you say that you have trust and you could play on your trust,  you could sell it, but you can only sell it to a certain degree  before it starts to diminish.  For instance, we do a lot of ads, right?  That diminishes trust a little bit.  But those ads are valuable because of the trust  that we have created with our audience. Yes.  We have to monetize.  So we have to sell a little bit of that trust off.  The trick is to not sell so much that it diminishes. Yes, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Stacey, Ohm then became a VC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ohm was a VC beforehand.  Ohm actually was a VC starting sometime in the middle of Giga.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, because he had deal flow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He did. He's it's all about the deal flow, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not just deal flow.  He did have a very cogent and good worldview that, you know,  VCs love that. Yeah.  VCs love any man with a worldview. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Emphasis on man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's take a little break.  I do want to say, though, one more thing, which is I mentioned  the institutions that are saving this republic right now.  And frankly, front and center foremost is the fourth estate is journalism.  If it weren't for the integrity and the assiduity  and the and the careful work of journalists,  I think we'd be in a hell of a lot worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But given the story of this week, Washington Post.  The amazing work around. Yeah.  Or right more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And being a lot worse shape, we would be in a lot worse shape.  So that's one of the institute.  I mentioned courts, but really, I think it's the I think it's  frankly the fourth estate that's keeping us afloat at this point.  It's keeping us a republic.  And of course, it's there's no surprise.  It's the first thing authoritarians shut down.  Whether it's Putin or Hitler or whoever, that's the first thing they shut down.  The lying press, Hitler called them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Is it 20 percent?  19 percent of Republicans believe that are only 19 percent  of Republicans trust the news now.  This is a crazy stat. That's the pupil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But the news doesn't agree with their worldview.  Why would they trust it?  They've been told over and over again, too.  That's the other problem. No, I know. Yeah.  I'm going to change the subject. We're going to take a break.  We I will we will talk about Jonah Peretti's memo  and which came out today.  And then I have an unboxing.  Oh, it's something you would like to find in your tree because it's big.  We all like bigger gifts, right?  Biggest like, oh, no, no, no jewelry is small.  Small, sparkly gifts in a light blue box.

Mr. Jeff Jarvis from the City University of New York.  I love talking about journalism with you guys.  You say, Stacey, you don't know anything about journalism,  except you are completely an expert.  You are. Yeah.  I don't know anybody.  Besides Jeff, who's more expert.  And yeah, and I love it that Stacey, you had the guts when Giga-Om-Folder.  You went to Fortune briefly, but you decided I'm going to do it myself  and I'm not going to make the same mistakes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I'm making new, more exciting mistakes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you know, if you don't make mistakes, you're not learning, right?  That's what I tell myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's the biggest lesson you've learned since you've been on your own?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Only do a newsletter once a week, because any time,  any time more than that, you're really on the hook, especially if you're traveling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And were you originally like daily?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I gave me that advice and he was so right.  And my other piece of advice is, you know what?  Maybe the last week of the year, just don't sell an ad.  So you can just not produce something.  Take it easy. Yeah.  It's really hard to produce content that last that last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, my advice is surround yourself by smart people  like Stacey Higginbotham and Jeff Jarvis.  And then you can always coast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There we go. That's that's what Kevin's  Kevin's writing a story for me right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. No, Leo, Leo.  I what I made.  And when I see I thought this is hard.  What you do is hard.  The art of what you do is you make it look easy, but it's hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thank you. What do you do?  How is that going, by the way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, we ran out of money. So it was that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, you ran out of your grant funds.  It was grants. Yeah. So you know, there's only one really hard thing.  And that's finding really smart people like Jeff Jarvis and Stacey Higginbotham.  I have been. It's true.  I have an extraordinarily fortunate.  The team that we've put together is so good and not just in front of the camera,  behind the camera.  And that's that it's it.  But you said the totally is you set the voice.  That's that's key to this.  I'm just selling my trust like nobody's business.  Your trust is a block.  I think that's really I never really thought about that, Stacey,  but that's actually very astute.  That is really what you bring to the table.  You know, people sometimes call it brand or a name awareness.  It isn't, though.  It really is. People have a relationship with a it's  especially journalism.  It's even true in performing performing arts, but really in journalism.  They have a relationship with the journalist.  And that's what informs their interest in what the person has to say.  And you really have to and you have to be very careful with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I mean, I remember I there are still certain people where when something  happens, I want to know exactly what a specific person says about it.  So it is that is that is the relationship  I want to have with my readers, listeners, anyone.  It's hey, crap, this deal just happened.  Let's go see what Stacey has.  She's usually pretty smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So now I look at somebody like Marcus Brownlee, who came out of nowhere,  created a YouTube following, and it's entirely based on trust.  You know, you could include likeability and other factors,  but ultimately, it's trust in what Marcus is reviews are.  And he's done it all on his own.  Right now, he's regretting not surrounding himself with more people  because it's exhausting, I'm sure.  But he's done it all on his own. And then.  I wonder if this is true.  It does seem like you have to sell a little bit of that trust to monetize.  It's not necessarily selling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you pick things that you like,  I mean, yes, people can dislike ads, but you don't have to add up everything.  You know, we try to preserve trust in that case with our process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. Exactly.  Check picking advertisers, rejecting advertisers.  We don't want to introduce our audience to and picking ones that we like and.  Limiting the number of.  And things like that.  There are always people who are going to come out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I've Kevin and I have encountered this where we're like,  someone pings us and is like, I can't believe you wrote that story.  They must be advertisers on your show.  And we're like, they're there.  They happen not to be.  But, you know, here's why we think that.  And, you know, that's just a.  I tweeted the headline about which we'll get to about T-Mobile

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  buying level three television and getting into the cable business,  which I thought was a little bit of a shock.  And I said, I really like what I say, something like I really like T-Mobile's Moxie.  And I immediately got to how much they pay you for that.  No, I can have an opinion.  I may even have a positive opinion.  Number of people tweeted, how can you like T-Mobile with their zero rating?  But the world is complicated.  And as you get older, you might realize it's not all you can't just black and white everything.  You know, right.  It's a complicated world we live in.  Well, but you should acknowledge that.  I mean, it is complicated, but you if you're going to make compromises,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you should recognize what those compromises are and how they can trickle down.  Yes. Yes.  So it's a shame that BuzzFeed doesn't spell better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But here is the media is in crisis, says Jonah Peretti,  and he lays out his vision for a more diversified BuzzFeed.  And here's one of the brand new TV shows that he's going to be doing.  And here's BuzzFeed and here's one of the brands, BuzzFeed media brands, Tasty, Nifty, Goodful, etc.  I, you know, and then I guess unfortunately is not a word that he learned in college.  But so BuzzFeed has struggled this year, haven't they, Jeff?  It has not been an easy year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, he argues in there that they didn't want to struggle as they're maturing  and that the expectations were higher  and that he has to he has to experiment with more revenue models.  That's what he's really talking about.  He was critical of Google and Facebook in there in a way that made the haters gleeful.  But I argued on Twitter that he was negotiating.  He was saying because Google and Facebook have or Facebook has paid him for content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He says the biggest challenge they face is that everybody faces at Google and Facebook are eating up all the digital ad revenue in the world,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  which is what everybody says.  But again, that digital revenue wasn't God given.  That's true.  Google and Facebook came and offered better deals competitively to our customers.  That's the way the capitalistic world works.  And we stood behind and we said, no, no, no, no, we want to produce the same product we've always produced.  And you should still pay for it.  And you should still pay for our audience, even though we don't want anything about them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How do you compete, though, with a company, I don't know, like Facebook, I don't know about Google,  but how do you compete with a company like Facebook that is getting all those ad dollars because they're willing to completely compromise their users' privacy,  invade their privacy in ways that are offensive?  Oh, no. Oh, geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo, I have to give you props for having just a wonderful tone of voice when you ask somebody,  how did it feel when you murdered that family of four?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He goes, he's baiting me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What does Zeynep, okay, I watched Zeynep Tufiki's very good TEDx talk in which she points out that Facebook wouldn't hesitate to sell an ad to a company,  a gambling company, let's say, that wants to reach people who are bipolar in their manic state and therefore more likely to gamble.  But by the way, not that Facebook, it's the Facebook's problem or the gambling company's problem to their complete detriment.  That's a very valuable kind of thing to sell.  And of course, if you can offer that kind of ads by to a company, you're going to get all the ad dollars.  I can't do that.  You know, and I wouldn't do that. I would never do that.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know how the news, the old, the holy, wonderful, sainted newspapers.  Do you know how they made their money in their earliest days as a mass media product?  How?  Started wars.  Patent medicines.  Yeah, snake oil.  Absolutely.  Literally snake oil.  But I don't sell snake oil.  But wait a minute, I am not them.  I'm quoting from Boo Sreenivasan's wonderful book.  I didn't know this.  I know.  I didn't understand this, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Tim Wu also mentions in the Intention Seekers.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's really interesting.  But that doesn't mean I'm doing that.  And how am I to compete?  No, it doesn't mean that somebody selling snake oil.  I admit, by the way, we have a hard time competing against companies that are willing to sell crap products because I won't take those ads.  But it's worse if a company is willing to trade on what it knows about its users in ways that I find offensive.  Well, but do you think Facebook doesn't do that?  Am I wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think they do that.  I don't think they do that.  And I think that here's the problem with that with that line of talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And Zane Epsrum, she says ProPublica was able to buy ads that way.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I believe it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's another story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I believe Facebook wouldn't maliciously do it, but they probably, I mean, they have the capabilities to identify people at their most vulnerable.  They don't label it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They label it sentiment analysis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Someone is coming along and using the capability of the platform they created to do something that Facebook may not have anticipated like Rubel's buying political ads.  So they've got and they have to have a more moral structure built in to that architecture.  I agree with that.  But I also here's the problem.  I argue strangely that media companies have to know more about their users.  And that's the only path to gain trust in the long run, giving them relevance and value, gaining greater value and surviving.  Wait a minute.  I want to stop you right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Media companies in order to survive have to know more about their users for like I need to know more about my users so I can serve them better or so that I can sell against them better.  Both.  I would agree serve them better.  I would not agree sell them.  But it also follows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It just naturally follows.  If I know you're a parent and I give you a product for parents and I can then get higher value advertising, I can get.  OK, so I'm doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're right.  We sell.  We're selling.  I just sold what was a video blocks because we know that many of our viewers are creators and would buy stock video footage.  Right.  But that seems to be far less intrusive.  So what I think you're missing.  OK, go ahead, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What we're isn't being talked about is we are moving from demographic information or broad strokes to almost an omniscient perspective on people.  And once you have that, advertising has always sought to make us feel vulnerable so we could assuage that with buying something.  Right.  That doesn't have to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think I do that in any of our ads.  No, you don't have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's always been a mode that can be employed in advertisement.  What happens when you are omniscient, you can identify people at their most vulnerable in places you don't have to create the low self-esteem.  You just swoop in when it's there and can offer a product.  And I think that's that's almost predatory.  And we're having a hard time discussing it because we don't recognize these companies is having again that omniscience.  And the only thing we think of is.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.  I thought you were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, here we go.  Only thing we think is omniscient is God.  Right. And we've ascribed all sorts of moral rules associated to God.  So it's really kind of thinking about what the role is for something that has that power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  With omniscience comes great responsibility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. So here's the question, Stacey.  You're right.  And then omniscience can be used for good and bad.  And so what I think we need to do.  And what happens is the Facebook has an opera.  It has it has this this this targeting machine and someone comes along and figures out how to target racists with giving them more racism.  Right. And Facebook didn't build it that way.  That wasn't part of the architecture.  And once it's pointed out to them that you can do that or you can buy political ads with rubles or you can do these other bad things.  Think like your cuts.  You figure out how to cut it off.  And the other thing I think the task is if we give Facebook we give Facebook the benefit of the doubt insofar as they're not trying to build something that can be that is intended to be used to get people they're vulnerable.  But it is being used that way.  What are the principles that you would suggest to them about how to architect this and what to guard against and what to look for.  That to me is the constructive way to have this conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's before you even begin.  Facebook should recognize first and I don't think it has done this yet.  It should recognize what it's built because you can't start addressing these except by piecemeal which is probably not the right way.  But to say OK so I would like to see it maybe Mark Zuckerberg and his trip around the world is doing this.  But I want to see them understand and admit that they have built this thing that can see into people's lives and feelings in a way that is historically unprecedented and say hey that's an awesome responsibility.  And once they've done that I think they need to establish some sort of moral code.  I mean again.  Yeah I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I'm about to start a project.  There's a guy named Dove Seidman.  We haven't announced anything yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah I just did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kind of.  He runs a company called LRN.  If your company gets in trouble and you want to hide it you hire a PR company.  If you want to fix your culture and figure it out and learn how to be ethical and teach your staff how to be ethical you call Dove.  And Dove is a very good guy and he has a big business trying to make companies more moral.  And so we're talking about trying to work together and this is a discussion I'm going to come back to again and again and I want to call on you guys.  Is that I think what we have to do is to help them figure out exactly those kinds of moral principles.  And and so when it comes to let's say political advertising I would argue that the way to get ahead of all this is to decide to set entirely new standards that leapfrog everybody else about transparency and political advertising on who's buying it what it says what the message is and who's targeted.  And go overboard and say that's the right thing to do for the democracy.  What is it to do about advertising to emotions and emotional signals.  What are the principles there that you can they can do that we can then call upon and we say hey somebody I just got a disease and somebody called him tried to try to sell something to me.  There's a principle we can call on and say whoa Facebook you shouldn't allow that that's not that's against your principles.  Well first you're right. They have to know how it's being used and second we have to help them establish principles.  And I think the same is true of media because our business model leads to cats and freaking Kardashians and it leads to the kind of polarization that we have and Donald Trump said two heads of American news organizations may be bad for America but he's good for business.  So we've got the same problem media as we're going to new revenue streams goes back to your trust point Stacy right.  What's what's miss selling your trust.  What is the violation of privacy.  What is the violation of of emotions and exploitation.  This is a big discussion to have and I don't think that the platforms or media companies know how to it's a discussion we have to have so I want to come back to you often on this topic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think this is actually a discussion we can have in a capitalistic society and I'm not saying I'm a socialist.  I'm just saying that.  Exactly.  Exactly. But if your highest goal and you will hear this again and again from people is the fiduciary duty is to shareholders. And if you put that in the mindset of my duty is to make money.  Your morals, often will go by the wayside. Often but not inevitably. No, but you also have to think about if you're going to do that, everyone has to play by that game.  Otherwise, you're like this holy roller who's like feeling all good about themselves and everybody loves you, but you're not making any money and thus some activist investors going to come in and change your policies.  So I think it's I think it's fine to say, hey, this is what we're building.  This is the world we're living in, but we can't just isolate it to the companies.  There's a big we're kind of in this like race to the bottom in terms of putting a price on everything as we atomize all this data about people and we turn it into insights to help sell them things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the insights can also be used to give them greater relevance and value to give them greater service.  So that's why demonizing if you demonize the data as opposed to the use of the data.  I'm not demonizing and I'm just.  You're not what others are. Others are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think you actually get a very well, I don't think you need to investigate people's sex lives, love lives, friendships, social graph to serve them better.  You get very good signals from just what they consume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but we should change our products, to do that.  Right. But we don't even we've done that for generations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's how media works. If you sell more newspapers, you're doing the job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No media makes media treats everybody the same.  And that's exactly how we ended up in this mess.  That's exactly how we ended up with click bait.  That's exactly because because we had at least you had a scarcity.  You could say you were a hottie and wonderful, but you were also putting in sleazy real estate sections that were actually just bought.  That's the immediate money. OK, but I'm the only guy in town with the newspaper and I'll do that.  And that's fine. And I'll cheat there and I'll be OK over here and nobody's to buy me a game.  Then when you get into a button space market where everybody's to be with everybody, then you fall to this desperation.  The lower the value, the higher the desperation.  And so that business model is leading us astray.  And it is the business model the media has.  It's also the business model that Facebook and Google have to this extent, to an extent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you're saying, for instance, television by chasing ratings, we ended up doing reality shows and bad sitcoms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When cost became prohibitive. That's what we did.  Now, when you only have three networks, you made crap and you could sell it.  And that was that. Then when you had 150 networks, the belief was that's going to be too much content.  Quality will go down. What happened? Quality rose because we had more choice.  We could leave the crap and go to the good stuff.  So then the market is still buys networks.  The networks have lower audience, higher costs.  So what do they do? They go to crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. So I wish advertisers realize how good a good a deal podcasts are.  But that's another story.  Amen, brother.  So but that's so but that's been a benefit.  So having a much broader market has allowed many people to chase individual audiences, not but not necessarily intruding on people's privacies to do so.  We do a survey once a year that gives us some information and we notice what shows get watched and we read our emails.  Isn't that aren't those enough signals to generate good content?  So I'll give you why do I need to know what the person at home is income is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's because you're doing that because the advertiser was.  I don't ask that. I agree. That's that's ridiculous.  I'll give you an example. At my commerce meeting yesterday, I heard someone who's experienced the business.  And I heard that the business was involved in a big travel site and they were doing commerce there.  And for some reason, there's no rhyme or reason to this.  Only experience would tell you this. That what sells best on a travel site.  What would they going to be? Obvious question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hotel hotel hotel reviews. Right. Right. Right.  Travel. OK. I thought that was a trick question. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's not. It was over the obvious. Yeah.  This is this is the professorial thing. You ask the double question.  Socratic method. You prove yourself to be smarter because you're going to give the real answer.  Real answer. Shoes. Shoes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why I have no idea. Yeah, I'm fantasizing when I travel and then a shoe ad that has followed me there might become an affordable luxury, an escape from my boring everyday life.  Very good. I buy a lot of shoes online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I buy a lot of smartphones. Same thing. Having data about people is not a thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, let me ask you this then. Let me ask you this.  Do you think that Netflix's Twitter about the Christmas Prince was terrible or funny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I say funny. I thought it was both. But wait, before you move on from shoes, how did the travel site learn that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because they would try different things and they would find. So what's wrong with that? What sells? That's not that's not spying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's data. But that's not spying on you. That's not figuring out who's in their manic face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you can advertise gambling. So in this company, in this company, when they see somebody is travel interested and they go to the travel site a lot, wherever they are, they sell all data together.  There's some data that I'm saying. Don't. Yes. That's exactly what I'm saying. You don't want all day together.  Make data bad. The use of it. I'm not making data bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I'm saying that selling against intrusive a company that uses intrusive.  No, it's not all intrusive, but a lot of what Facebook does is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So wait, wait, wait, wait. So this is what I'm trying to get you both to be constructive.  So define intrusive to the point that they could that you end up with a principle that they could enforce and that you could hold them to.  That's the goal. That's what that's the discussion we need to have.  Instead of just saying, well, Facebook's just awful. They don't know all this stuff about you. And my God, what could happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the reason they established. So we've already established these.  Look at you don't advertise against medical conditions. Right. You don't advertise against sexual orientation.  You don't advertise against race, race, color, national origin, many medical conditions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'm going to disagree. I'm going to disagree strongly there.  Oh, because you have information because I have a lot of medical conditions and I've gotten value.  That's how I discovered Cardia. OK, but I discovered Cardia because I have atrial fibrillation and I talk about it.  And it was extremely valuable to me and could bloody well save my life that I discovered that device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The challenge is what's useful to you there on Facebook could also be used to discriminate against you in hiring, for example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There are other ways to find out about this. There are very good methods for finding out about products for your various maladies without resorting to advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would never have. I wasn't going to go searching for it, Leo. I wasn't going to go.  It came to me. And you're lazy. It came to me. And I was no, I didn't know it existed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It would behoove you to find out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so here's the deal. By having by talking about something broadly, Jeff, you opened yourself up to it and people would talk to you about it.  Eventually, you would have found it regardless because you would have been like, oh, I have a fib and someone would be like, hey, I don't know if you know this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's how we used to do it. That's how it used to work. Called word of mouth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, so yeah, OK, give it a look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This stuff could be weaponized. That's why Jeff, it could be, could be, could be, could be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That doesn't mean is being weaponized. Regulate that you don't regulate the data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You don't call Facebook evil for doing this. If I go to if I go to it, I go to it's hard to regulate if it's dark and Facebook has not cooperated in any way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fine. Then that's a principle you set.  But the fact that people talk about their age of fibrillation is not a bad thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Facebook has very carefully hidden what it's doing because they know it would be highly offensive.  And so we haven't still haven't even seen the dark ads that they showed people for the 2016 election.  And they never will because it would hurt them if people knew what they were doing.  And you can't regulate something that's hidden like that. How are you going to get that information?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you can have a discussion of the principles involved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we are and we're having a discussion of principles.  And what you are doing is you're taking it down to your personal level and you constantly do this.  And it's very frustrating because you seem to conflate a principle with your feelings.  And that is in your value from something. I think it's the opposite.  No, is it? You're talking about you were saying this bad thing could happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I'm here as principle as a principle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have regulated medical stuff already. You don't advertise against medical stuff.  That's that's actually something that even when AT&T and others were looking at doing web based search,  like advertising its people's web searches, they were pulling out certain categories because they were deemed sensitive.  And that is just a fact. It is not an opinion.  It is something that is so far in society been agreed upon.  Now you're coming in and you're saying, hey, I don't agree with that, which is fine.  But as an argument, when we're trying to set these principles, you can't just take your personal.  You can't take your personal experience.  And you say, what's the definition of privilege in a lot of ways?  Because you're not considering the other ways that people are hurt by this.  And so we were arguing about this, but you're not talking about it at this level, Jeff.  You're talking about it at your own personal level.  We need to take it up to talk about it from everyone's perspective.  So throw your perspective in there. But that is not the end all be all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Stacey, here's the problem. When you take it up too high, then you end up saying all data is everything could be dangerous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're you. I do understand that. But you're taking it too low, too personal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm just kidding. That's all I'm saying. I see. I wrote a book about sharing.  Right. I believe that there's a value to society sharing.  I believe that if you go to which I set you for free, by the way, I believe that if you go to the the root causes of some of the issues here,  they're not about the technology is not about Facebook. It's about our own society.  Why are we ashamed of talking about being sick in the society?  Well, there's a real tangible reason, which is you could be affected in your employment, then regulate that.  That's Dana Boyd taught me that. Right.  You regulate the use of data and the use of the knowledge, not the knowledge.  And that's the end because it's so.  And don't cut off the opportunities that can come. You cut off opportunities that can come of benefit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nobody's going to regulate your ability to share with your friends and family or in public or even on this show, say your medical issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nobody's going to regulate that. They're going to regulate that. Cardia can't can't.  Zik and Dodrick can't advertise it to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that would be the wrong place to regulate it. The place to regulate is the place is most difficult to regulate.  It is the company that is willing to take that information and monetize it in a way that I think we would all agree is inappropriate.  Well, maybe you wouldn't, Jeff, but I would say I would agree is inappropriate. Right, Stacey.  So I think that the problem is I don't think you're going to get Facebook to help you in this.  And I don't think you could. I don't know. Maybe you can force them to help you in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know that. Well, maybe they will. Maybe they will.  But what I'm trying to say is that the discussion that I hear constantly is basically just writing off Facebook  and the two billion people who are there and saying, oh, it's so awful and wrong.  If we don't demand if we don't have a discussion about the principles in a way that we have expectations of them, I think they should be doing their own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think there's I'll be honest. I don't think there's a way to save Facebook.  I think it's it's it's it's it's it's business model is entirely based upon the unfettered sharing of personal information, which it then sells against.  OK, there's that from day one. That was its business model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is no way to save media because media is built on exploiting tabloid interests to an extreme and inevitably leads to click bait, which will inevitably lead us to where we are in a political atmosphere.  There's no way to save media either. But of course, we try to save media because it's worth doing.  And I'm not going to write off Facebook. I'm not going to write off Google.  And I'm also going to do my Gutenberg spiel. Take a drink that were early days.  We've got to learn. We've got to have these discussions. Writing off.  That's the essence of why that's moral panic. That's moral panic.  It says this is going to be awful and we've got to stop it.  Well, there's huge benefits that get thrown out with the bathwater.  I'm only lately come to this point of view, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that there is a problem. Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Outcomes. Let's let's talk about that, because that's that's actually really worthwhile.  And I think especially in the case of algorithms, we do actually have a problem that will only be because you can't see what's happening behind the scenes.  I think outcomes is a great structure. Yes, I agree.  So I know. I know that. So when we talk about that, though, right now we don't have the framework for it because someone has to be hurt before we see the problem.  And then once someone's hurt, we tend to over specify it to that particular case.  We get a lot of knee jerk reaction is the knee jerk legislation is the worry.  But we also then need to think about if we're going to regulate outcomes, how can we do it to offer retribution?  Do we want to offer retribution to the person who's hurt as we discovered that?  Oh, maybe this was a bad use of data sharing. So we've got to think about that.  We've got to think about how to do it quickly so someone isn't hurt a lot or maybe multiple people don't have to get really hurt.  We have to set up things in place to track when people get hurt and who gets hurt, because right now there's a whole I mean, Black Lives Matter is all about people who've gotten hurt for years and we've just ignored it because it was inconvenient.  So if we're going to start talking about regulating outcomes, we have to think about how to build that into the way we work as a society, how we legislate now and I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree. That's a positive way to have the discussion.  And you're quite right about the this is where you're going after the specificity on technology is an equal problem to the specificity on the person.  The example I always use on this is the German official who said that henceforth the use of facial recognition and geotechnology together was a lot a lot.  Not seeing that it could find missing children and Alzheimer's patients and so on and so forth, obviously, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And people who've been stalked by abusive spouses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we look at the outcomes and we figure out how to regulate this, but the two technologies together is not fundamentally evil because it could be used in a case in bad ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's not panicked to bring up the problems. And that's what we should be considering in the beginning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the German that should be their reckoning.  I agree. And that's what I'm also trying to say to all of us is that we the public and we who are the tech cognizant have to help them do that.  Just saying Facebook cannot be reclaimed as Leo just said, it's going to get us anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, same. I think you're going to get us somewhere. I have a should abandon Facebook immediately.  I think you're I think you're playing in a space that's incredibly dangerous and you will deeply regret and Congress is never going to regulate it.  And it's only going to get bigger and more malign.  And I think we need to all stop using Facebook.  A world without social is a world I already regret.  It's not a world without social. It's a world without Facebook.  That's a big difference.  In fact, you conflating social with Facebook is part of the problem, Jeff.  You need to get out of the house here a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go through your feed right now and show me the first awful, evil, horrible thing you find in your Facebook feed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it's nothing in my feed. I'm not talking about my feed.  I'm talking about Facebook is doing it's I'm talking about the use of big data and the kind of data Facebook's gathering and how people are providing happily, willingly providing a Facebook without realizing that it's OK.  And share with a go have a meal with a friend then stop putting it in this giant maw that is chewing up all our data and creating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, this is making a moral panic about data.  And again, I argue that this data is exactly the salvation of media and the journalism that you rely on.  I say, well, I think it was Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it will say Facebook.  I see no evidence that it's going to save the New York Times.  I disagree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just had a meeting of executives from that company and others just yesterday where commerce as a revenue stream built on trust built on data is a major contributor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You use data as if it's a monolithic thing.  There's all there's data and there's data.  There's data about what mental state visitor is in so that we can give them an ad that will take advantage.  Maximum advantage of the principle and regulate can't regulate it.  And we, by the way, have a Congress that will never regulate it.  We could barely keep the Internet service providers from screwing us royally and self regulate to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then you know what the self regulation is?  Stop using Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the self regulation.  That's a very, very, very good self regulation.  If everybody does that, then I won't worry.  Google is a more troubling problem because I don't know.  You know, I don't know how we stop using Google.  To be honest with you, you can easily stop using Facebook.  That's that's that's a that's a very low bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you can you can use what's the one that you could end up getting absolutely.  No, I agree.  Search results. No, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I used to go for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Facebook is Facebook is completely unnecessary.  Google is a little bit more difficult to live without because Internet search people to connect with each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wonderful things can happen on Facebook.  It's that's just too cynical.  Not the only way it can happen.  I don't understand why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't understand why you think it's the only way people can connect with each other.  So what do you want to do instead?  You have to invent anything.  We've survived pretty well for a few millennia without it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, in a world in a world that was controlled by a very few media companies.  And that's the only way we could learn anything was from them.  Here's the good news.  That world's long gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And with or without Facebook, that world is long gone.  So you don't have we no longer need Facebook to save us from the oligarchies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What you're complaining about is your fellow man and woman in some level.  No, I'm complaining about Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook.  It's very simple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm complaining about a company that is willing to mine personal data from people in a way that is offensive to set to make money.  And I think it is a blight on our society.  And I think we will look back and say it was I think we already know it is.  I think we've we've seen the results of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff, I have to do my caveat here.  My my full disclosure.  I know I know I haven't done it in this show yet.  You didn't do that show.  So I started the News Integrity Initiative, which is funded substantially by Facebook, Craig Newmark Foundation, Ford Foundation and others.  I'm independent of Facebook.  I'm critical of Facebook.  But I also believe that there is value there.  Otherwise, I wouldn't have done this.  I would never impugn your independence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, no, I should anyway.  And I think it's important people understand that that that's a good thing to disclaim.  But there's no suggestion, no hint of impugning your integrity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But yours, but you but the audience can decide for themselves because he's just defending social and Facebook because of that.  You can you can make that people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Cobra in the chat room says, well, you can say that about anything.  You could say don't watch Monday Night Football because it's contributing to violence.  Yeah, actually, I'm very seriously considering stopping watching the NFL because what it because it's what it does to the players.  It does to those people. Yeah.  Yeah. That's actually a very legitimate point, Cobra.  I agree with you.  I agree.  Let's let's move to we're going to stop.  We're going to stop.  We're going to stop and we are going to we're done with the philosophical conversations.  You have gifts.  We have toys.  We have an ad from Sonic.  We'll have more with Jeff Jarvis and Stacey Higginbotham.  No, I think it's really a great conversation.  Very important conversation.  And I think it's crystallizing.  I think the timing it's becoming more and more of an important conversation.  Let's say that our show today brought to you by a company that is doing everything it can.  To preserve net neutrality.  You know, there are Internet service providers who believe in net neutrality.  And one of them is Sonic.  And I know it because I know Jane Jasper, the founder.  I've known him since he started Sonic.  I've been a customer since he started Sonic.  In fact, we're customers right now.  In fact, if you're watching this show, you can say thank you, Sonic.  We are literally brought to you by our 10 gigabit fiber interconnect connection to the outside world through Sonic.  Too many people pay too much for unsatisfactory cable Internet in this country.  Sonic delivers fast, affordable Internet, phone, even TV to homes and businesses all over California.  Residential and business fiber to the premise networks, gigabit connectivity.  Look what you get.  And look at the price.  15 email accounts, a gigabyte of storage, personal web hosting, including a new domain, fax line service, a home phone connection.  You can port your existing phone number to it so you don't lose your number.  Unlimited local and long distance calling.  Remember, we used to have to think about how much your long distance bill would be.  There's no long distance bill.  How about that?  And let's not forget gigabit Internet, 1000 megabits per second, only $40 a month.  $40 a month.  And incidentally, Sonic stands up for privacy, friendly local customer support.  Never caps the bandwidth, has affordable pricing, and believes in net neutrality.  We'll never, ever, ever block any bit of the Internet.  It's your Internet.  Get it from somebody who cares.  Join the Internet revolution.  Visit sonic.com slash twit.  Receive your first month of Sonic Internet and phone service free plus bundle with Dish and save $120 on your Sonic bill.  Visit sonic.com slash twit.  That's one way you could fight for net neutrality.  If you're lucky enough to have a choice in Internet service provider.  If only I could.  Choose wisely.  Love to have them.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did Google ever get near you, anywhere near you with the Google Fiber?  They did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They went south.  They had a lot of problems with their contractors.  And now they've kind of given up, haven't they?  They have definitely pulled back.  I think they're going to do some 5G stuff with a millimeter wave and microwave.  Maybe the last hope is wireless Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe the last hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just filed.  So I have a new column coming out in IEEE.  I'm writing a column for them on the Internet.  That's geeky.  Wow.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Holy cow.  I'm impressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, yeah.  So 5G is supposed to be in millimeter wave.  The specifically the fixed wireless access to homes could be competitive, but it's not  going to help our rural problems.  And you can learn more about that all the way in March because this is a print magazine  and I don't even understand.  Remember those days?  I'm like, I'm sorry, when is this coming out?  Did you ever write for print?  I did.  I did some for Fortune and then I had a print.  Back in your newspaper days.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I worked for a weekly for a little while.  I worked for a daily.  I started a magazine that was print.  Really?  What was that?  It was my college magazine.  It still exists now on the web.  This is heavy.  This is it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The new Google Max.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's bigger than I thought and it's heavy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Bread boxes aren't that big.  When it comes to, yeah, it's about the size of a large bread box.  When it comes to now available for $3.99, I ordered it the day it became available.  Got it two days later.  The heavy is good when it comes to sound because it means you have big old transformer in there.  Oh, come on.  I hear a bell in there.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Thump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thump clock.  Well, you know, for people listening at home, that's the only way of illustrating the actual weight of this thing.  You know, it's kind of frustrating.  They put a tear tab on one side, but not on the other.  Oh, wait a minute.  Yes, they did.  There it is.  All right.  All right.  Now there it is.  It's a fabric covered speaker.  It's the largest Google Home they make.  This is pretty good.  It's bigger than I thought.  I was thinking that they were kind of hiding the size of it by not showing it in pictures with humans.  But now that I now that I a human have it in my hands, it comes with a rubber coaster to sit on.  It isn't attached to it in any way.  Oh, I guess it is kind of magnetic.  Why?  Yeah, I don't know.  So you don't scratch your furniture?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And also for isolation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Attach base here for vertical orientation.  That's why you could put it on either side.  So it could be horizontal or vertical.  Here's the plug, John, if you want to.  Plug it in.  Give it to us.  BC.  Nope.  Oh, she's but it's a standard power cord.  It's got it.  It needs more power probably than USB-C can offer.  Ah, yeah.  It's got on top of it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's got am I supposed to tear this off?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, wow.  You just voided the warranty.  I don't know if I should have torn it off because it's a sticker that's been on for a while.  It's a sticker that shows where you raise the volume and touch and play.  But it's not a problem with the Google Mini.  There's no on the plastic.  It doesn't have anything at all.  You just have to remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that was I feel like that's not the best designed decision.  It's pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I Google.  It's pretty.  All right.  So I've just plugged it in.  You can see on the front through the fabric, there's some lights going.  It's like a Google Mini only on steroids, right?  So now I have to watch the Google Home app.  Let's get my phone out here.  Wow.  That's a rich sound coming out.  Is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google Home app on a phone or tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's definitely good sound.  There's my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If the Google lady didn't sound good, I'd be very concerned.  Yeah.  Yeah, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Guys, come on.  Come on.  It's really sounding good.  All right.  Now I got to do the Google Home app.  Let's see how it figures out.  Get started.  Okay.  Welcome home.  That's the account.  Okay.  Location access.  Yes.  Yes.  I guess I've never used this on this phone.  This is the new Pixel 2 XL.  One device found.  Look at that.  I don't know how it knows.  One device found.  It sees my Google Home already ready for setup because it couldn't possibly be on our Wi-Fi.  It must either be Bluetooth LE or sometimes it's the noise.  It's making a noise, right?  Would you like to set that up?  Yes.  Let's see how I can show you this so you can see it.  Your phone may disconnect from Wi-Fi during ... Oh, sorry.  You moved it.  Go back to that other shot.  Yeah, there you go.  Your phone may disconnect from Wi-Fi during setup.  Little bouncing, interesting bouncing.  Connected.  Do you hear the sound?  Yes.  Okay.  Where is this device?  Add custom room.  It's in the shed.  Okay.  We're going to add it to that Wi-Fi.  It's going to get my Google Home ... gets my Wi-Fi password from the phone.  That's good.  Yeah, put a little microphone in front of it so we can hear it.  Yeah, that's a good idea.  I kind of like how this looks.  It is the size of a Sonos, roughly.  Isn't it, John?  Would you say it's about play five sized?  Yeah.  It's smaller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a bright light behind the fabric.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's telling you that it's alive.  It's alive.

Add a payment method.  No.  Thank you.  No, no.  Actually, it should already have one.  It's now going to download an update, unfortunately, which is going to say about four minutes.  This is a Sonos Play 5.  So it's a little shorter would be the only thing.  But that's big enough to be good sound, I think.  So that's what you're looking for.  I mean, really, the idea is this is a speaker that can do all the Google assistant stuff, but sound good, right?  So I'm actually I think that might.  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  It's got multicolored lights.  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's not bad.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Bass is a little bit better once we get it that loud.  It's very...  It actually sounds...  What do you think of the high end, guys?  Do you think it was kind of tinny?  It's all right.  They're going, eh, it's all right.  My trained listeners.  So, it's a little pricey, right?  What does a comparable Soto speaker cost?  Right?  Yeah.  So, it's less than that.  What I don't know what it does is the multi-room playing.  I think it's supposed to do that, right?  But that's the thing.  That's Sonos' secret sauce.  Anyway, I'm glad I got it.  I think that that's actually...  That's a good thing.  You put that in the...  You know, where you listen to music in the bedroom or the living room or whatever.  That's pretty good.  Now, oh, that's another thing it doesn't do.  The Sonos will let you buy two and pair them and stereo, left, right, stereo.  I don't think Google's mentioned that capability.  All right.  One more thing to cheer you up, and then we'll get back to hard news.  The year in search.  This is going to...  Okay, get your hankies out.  Do you have my audio?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I don't know if it's politicized.  Some of them are, but if they're actually popular searches,  a lot of people did say, hey, how do I run for office?  Even I've Googled that.  Good for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are you going to run?  Not now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  Olio, last week, did you ever get the earbuds?  I did.  Did you talk about them last week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  What do you think?  Are you wearing them now?  I canceled the order.  You should have.  Right, Lisa?  Good move.  Good move.  The thing that they really sold them on, the Translate thing,  actually, in hindsight, I feel like I drank the Kool-Aid at that event because  truthfully, it doesn't work as well as just doing it with the phone.  The problem being that you hear the translation, but the speaker doesn't hear the translation,  so can't identify errors in the translation.  When you do it with the phone, it works exactly the same way, just as well.  The only difference is that when the guy's talking to you,  the translation is heard by both parties instead of just in your ears.  It still requires a phone if you're using the earbuds.  There's really no advantage to it.  It's not some special magic that the earbuds do, the Pixel Buds do.  Right, got it.  Pixel Buds are hard to pair.  They're hard to wrap up.  Yeah, it's really bad.  The sound is good, but not the best sound ever.  For that price, I was able to buy, at $149, the Jabra Sport Elite,  which sound 10 times better and have many more functions, including heart rate monitor.  It is, I'll tell you the one nice thing about the Pixel Buds that I really, really did like,  and I would like to see more of, is I was able to hear the,  if you wear them around, you can still hear ambient noise because they don't seal the ear,  and any notifications that come to your phone, you can hear,  if a text comes in that says, you just got a text from Lisa, would you like me to read it?  You could say yes, just without hands-free.  It reads it to you, would you like to respond? Yes.  What would you like me to say?  And you could do all that hands-free with the earbuds in.  I think that's a nice feature, being able to hear notifications and respond to some notifications.  Let me show you something I'm going to unbox.  Ooh, another unboxing.  Ooh, we'll have a more complete review of the Google Home Mac Saturday on the new screensavers.  I won't spend some more time with it.  The other thing that Google did this week is three app experiments.  Are you familiar with the app experiments?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to ignore that that word even exists.  Yeah, exactly.  They released some experimental apps, did they?  Yes. App-speriments.  Nope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Cannot hear you. No, no, no, no, no. I'm not listening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I agree. Not exactly a felicitous neologism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They also acquired someone to make app-speriments.  Introducing app-speriments, exploring the potential of mobile photography.  They're all three of them kind of dopey, but they're kind of interesting.  So Storyboard is only on Android.  And I'll show you how it works a little bit because I have all three of them.  Two of them are available.  Two of them, let's see.  Two of them you can get on both phones, then there's one unique one for each phone.  The Storyboard is unique to Android.  And what it does is it takes any video in your phone and turn it into a comic book.  And the problem is it doesn't seem to be actually using any artificial intelligence.  And by the way, if you don't like the mix, once you get a video, you can load it, save it, share it, load a different video.  And then swiping up will do a remix, or swiping down rather, will do a remix.  But for some reason, it's like, for instance, that's the same picture.  That guy's cut half.  There's no people in that one or that one.  It's like, at least Google, you have face recognition.  You could attempt to center on a face.  What's this panel?  It's got half of somebody's hair.  And that's exactly the same twice over.  I did this at a staff meeting.  And of course, people had fun with it.  It's cool.  But there's no reason for this panel.  So it seems like Google's not actually applying any of its artificial intelligence to the generation of these.  It is cool that you can just generate these panels.  But what I found is you have to swipe through it a bunch of times until you find one that works.  Like that one almost works, except for that empty one.  So you just keep swiping until you get one that...  I tweeted a few that kind of worked.  If you find one you like and then accidentally sweep away, you can't go back.  So that's it.  So sweep slowly.  Sweep slowly, make sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe they're anti-conditioning us for Tinder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Like what's...  Yeah, right.  What's that?  Why would he make a frame out of that?  I don't know what that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that just too big?  Do you have to shrink the image?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, that's the comic book.  So sometimes it does cool things like split it into two panes.  That's cool.  I would save that.  But it seems like Google could have done better with this app experiment.  This is a failed...  That's his shoulder?  That's the back of a chair?  I don't understand why you would...  Because I was going through a 20-second video and picking frames and then cartoonizing them  and putting them in panels like a comic book.  It does seem like it likes smiles.  Like it keeps picking this picture of Megan.  It really likes Megan, I think.  I don't understand it.  Anyway, so that's one.  I'll show you some of the iPhone ones here.  Get my iPhone out.  Actually, I don't have my iPhone, so I can't.  Would you get me my iPhone?  So that's Storyboard.  There's Selfissimo, which really has no reason for its existence.  Selfissimo is a selfie generator that basically just keeps taking pictures  and puts them in kind of like you were at a photo booth.  That one's iOS and Android.  They're black and white.  Snaps a photo each time you pose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, that is super cute.  I would do that a thousand times with my child.  Well, it's like a photo booth, right?  Yeah.  Think about how popular floaters are for kids' parties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here, I'll do Selfissimo.  Can you show over my shoulder?  Okay, so it says start.  And then it just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you stop it or does it just go until you stop it?  It goes until you stop it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And now I have nine somewhat interesting...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guarantee you, if I show that to my daughter, she would be all over that.  It's like photo booth kind of on the Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Only it's not distorting.  And it's black and white, which is great.  So they kind of look like literally like a photo booth.  Yeah, that's fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of fun.  And it's awesome.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  These are all free.  And even Google kind of, they're experiments, or as we might call them, app experiments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We would not call them that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And finally, Scrubbies.  The idea of Scrubbies is...  So you've played with Boomerang, Instagram's Boomerang, which allows you to take a clip and loop it forever, right?  So I'm going to capture something here.  John, come closer and do a little dance.  Okay, that couldn't have been better.  So here's John's one finger to preview.  Okay.  So that's his dance.  And I guess you have two fingers to make a scrubby.  Okay.  So let's make a scrubby so I can choose which portions of John's dance I'd like to make into the scrubby.  And I've created it now.  And that's the scrubby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it moves it into slo-mo and then loops it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know about the slo-mo part.  I think that's not necessarily something...  I don't know.  It's an app experiment.  Get it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Again.  Stop trying to make app experiment happen, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm just teasing you.  I know.  Okay.  Did you get the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  Stickers?  I can't...  I'll show you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is the best thing.  Wait until you see this, Stacey.  I don't know if it's Pixel 2 only.  I bet it is.  Pixel?  I have a Pixel.  So you go into your camera and you pick AR stickers.  If you have the latest camera app, you'll have AR stickers in the hamburger menu.  In the menu.  And then...  I don't have that.  Oh, Jeff, update.  Update.  So then you have a variety.  So there's Star Wars.  There's just kind of...  Oh, these things.  These are stupid things.  Oh, they're great.  Yeah, but look.  Here's one I made with my daughter's name.  Okay, watch this.  I just have...  So this is my daughter's name in those inflatable balloons just floating.  It looks like you can move them around.  It looks just like it's really floating.  It's augmented reality.  I'll show you some other ones.  I'll show you some more because I did...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I remember the Demi-Gorgon from the...  Yeah, let me go to my photos booth and I'll show you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Photos.Google.com because they get saved out.  It makes movies out of them.  So here's the app.  Actually, this is a better example so you can see how it is.  And then here's...  This is a...  What is that?  They call that a walker, right?  It's taking a while to load because these are all videos.  I don't know why it's taking...  And it's got audio too, Karsten.  Why has it taken so long to load?  Maybe this is loading.  Maybe this is loaded.  It doesn't...  Let's try some other ones.  Here's a Porg.  Is that what you call it?  And a BB8.  We did this during Windows Weekly, but they're not...  Come on.  What's going on?  Google's not loading the videos.  Anyway, stickers.  I imagine there'll be the opportunity to enhance it with other movie tie-ins,  but right now it's Star Wars because that's coming out tomorrow.  What else?  You have birth letters so you can write any message and have it float in balloons.  You have...  It's kind of like emojis.  In fact, this is probably, I would guess, Google's response.  So shall I make one?  So what I do...  This one, I don't know if you can show this over my shoulder.  Here, let me...  Let me point.  You can't.  Pull out.  Yeah, there you go.  So you have to point somewhere like a desk.  Target bot shipped.  Hold on a second.  You're trying to do news.  See that little guy?  See that little guy?  Now he's there.  Oh, this is a Stranger Things kid.  Isn't it?  So I'm going to rotate...  You can rotate around him.  I don't know if you can poke him.  No, you can't poke him.  But that's the Stranger...  So I record a little video with a Stranger Things kid on there.  That's kind of cool.  I don't know.  That's kind of cool.  He's standing on my computer.  That's a lot of AI going on.  Yeah, I mean that's...  Well, I think it's Google saying, oh yeah, Apple, you know that iPhone thing that you did?  We could do that.  With one lens, we could do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How do I update the app?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know why you didn't get it.  You're on a Pixel 2 XL, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you 8.1 or?  Yeah.  I'm still 8.0.  Do your updates, dude.  It says I'm up to date.  You're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know what I did?  Because I was impatient.  I turned beta on, Android beta on.  Got 8.1.  And then it said now it's the shipped version.  Now you're getting the shipping version of 8.1.  I said, okay, and I'll turn it off.  So that's what you need to do.  Maybe that's the case.  Maybe you need Android 8.1 to do that.  So, ship it.  So, I also...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We don't have to talk about it.  I can't even remember when I did this.  I did a crowdfunding.  What is that?  So, Anchor is Zolo Liberty Plus.  Those are like the Pixel Buds.  Yeah.  That's what it cost me. I think it's $149 now.  Those look a lot like those

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jabra Sport Elites I was talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They look very similar.  The problem is, nothing ever fits in my ear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They didn't give you a variety of...  They do. They do have that.  And here's a pretty heavy...  So, Jeff, you got to really...  That's one of the things I found with the  Jabras is you have to really try all the  little nubbies until you get a good fit.  I'm going to do that.  These are white.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I use the smallest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I use the biggest.  I have big ear holes.  More than we want to know, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And mine are hairy, too.  Don't tell anybody to wax.  Let's talk about something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's an experiment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're not.  Stacey, I just want you to know.  Just to clarify, I don't.  So, Google is a great place to do that.  So, Google.org donated $260 million to nonprofits.  Is that one of your numbers, Jeff, in 2017?  I didn't know that.  So, they put their mouth where their video was.  That doesn't really sound right, does it?  They put their money where their video was.  That's what I should have said.  Education, economic opportunity, inclusion,  disaster relief, crisis response.  They gave $20 million towards efforts in Puerto Rico,  the Caribbean, Florida, Houston, and South Asia.  Project Loon, of course, remember that.  They restored connectivity to Puerto Rico  with parts of Puerto Rico through Project Loon.  That was a volunteer.  Did that work?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to be there next week.  It works if you have, I believe, an AT&T phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Was that what it was?  Yeah, it was with AT&T. That's right.  That's pretty cool.  I actually got a press release from Puerto Rico

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  saying we're open for business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, you're going?  Yeah, I'm going in a week.  A week from tomorrow.  I'll be in San Juan.  For Christmas?  Yeah.  My son and I have chartered a catamaran.  Oh, that's right. You mentioned that.  Yeah.  And we're going to sail it around the British Virgin Islands  visiting all the exciting hurricane spots.  Senator Pichai said $500,000  for the Southern California fires.  Anyway, nice job.  Thank you, Google. Of course, every company  Google size should be donating  at least that much.  At least.  I think we should bring back tithing.  What's 10% of Google's profits? More than that.  If you're not going to pay taxes,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you might as well donate your money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.  Well, Facebook just announced that they're going to start  booking their advertising revenue  locally in the country and not sending it all to  Ireland.  That's a big deal.  I wonder how the shareholders feel about that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't matter

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because the shareholders have no power  given the class structure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I did see that the new  tax bill, and I don't know if this is the Reconciled  tax bill that they just announced  or the Senate version,  but with the 20%,  I guess now 21% corporate tax  rate, Apple will save 49  billion dollars in taxes.  So,  God knows they need the money.  Google Maps will wake you up when you need to get off the bus.  I thought that was good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Leo, they're going to know where you are.  No, see, there's a good example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're right. That's an example of data being beneficial.  That's why I'm hesitate to throw Google in there.  Well, Facebook could have

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Facebook, but see, that's a perfect example.  So Google uses location information in interesting  and I think useful ways to the user.  Facebook uses it just to keep track of where you've been  and let advertisers know.  The only thing I ever get from Facebook is  hey, I see you're somewhere.  Would you want to check in?

Speaker: UNKNOWN

Transcript:  Why did Adobe buy it?  They buy it to kill it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Storify is saying get your stories.  I remember Dan Patterson used it to great effect  to cover Occupy.  I think that's a good example.  Storify was just simply a way to put tweets together  in a way, any collection of tweets you wanted together

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so that you could preserve them  and share them as a collection.  You can no longer...  Or talk about Twitter's new functionality.  Yeah, Twitter may have kind of scooped them a little bit.  Storify says no new users  and we will end existing users access  on May 16th.  So I think that's a good example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that's a good example.  I think that's a good example.  I think that's a good example.  So we will end existing users access on May 16th.  Download your stories if you want to say them.  Download your stories if you want to say them.  But it doesn't seem that they've offered an API  or any simple way to do it.  I'm seeing people complain.  I have hundreds of stories on Storify.  There's no easy way to get them all.  That's a shame.  I'm willing to hate Adobe just as much as any man.  Adobe's not a great steward, obviously.  So Twitter's going to let you thread tweets now.  You'll be able to do  better tweet storms.  I thought you could always thread tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, those are going to make it easier to do that.

You got  BB8 in your life.  That really looks good. That's pretty good,  isn't it? What you look at  is how well it's matched to the  tabletop. Which is not perfect.  But given it doesn't have, you know, tango...  Does it do a shadow? Yeah.  Given that it doesn't have tabletop  quality,  tango quality sensors,  that's not bad.  Not bad at all. Not bad at all.  I wish I could get the other ones  playing. You got BB8 in your life.  But I can't for some reason.  I don't know why.  Wait a minute. Here's the one I just recorded. Let's see if  that... No. See.  Seems to be a problem with Google Photos.  Let's take a break.  And the number, the thing,  the stuff will all happen.  Momentarily. But first a word.  Oh, this is your holiday gift.  I'm telling you, I'm going to save you  a lot of time for a family member,  a friend, a colleague.  The Ring Video Doorbell.  Ring's mission  is to make neighborhoods safer, your  front porch safer, your home safer. A million  people now. I feel like we  deserve a little credit for this.  Use the Ring Video Doorbell.  I started using it a couple of years ago.  I see it all over my neighborhood now.  What it is, is a doorbell replaces your  regular doorbell, but it puts a camera,  high-def camera,  a speaker, a microphone,  motion sensor on your doorbell.  When somebody rings your doorbell, it rings your  phone, wherever  you are. You can see video.  You can talk to the person  at your door. In fact, you can set it up so it  notifies you even if somebody walks down the path.  You can have your Amazon Echo show you  what's at your front door. You can answer your doorbell  from your Amazon Echo show, or  from your phone. Two-way audio.  See and speak  to visitors. Now they have the Ring Floodlight  Cam. Kind of the same technology, but  it goes around your house. It has a  big LED floodlight that lights  up when somebody  moves in your area.  It has attached to it,  of course, the same camera and speaker and  microphone. It's got one more thing, though.  A 110 decibel alarm,  which you can set off from your phone.  You can say, hey, you, get out of my yard.  And if the raccoons don't leave, you press  the button, the alarm goes off, they go running.  When things go bump in the night, you don't  have to guess. You can see from your bed  or from across the world,  whether you're at home or away.  Ring  Floodlight Cams offer the ultimate in home  security. High visibility, floodlights,  a powerful HD camera,  and it puts your security in your hands.  Named the Wall Street Journal's best of CES 2017.  So now we got a Ring of Security  Kit that includes  a Ring Video Doorbell in your choice of  one, two, or even three floodlight  cams. Surround your home with security  and save up to $150.  Connect your Ring Video Doorbell with your favorite  smart locks and hubs for added convenience,  monitoring, and safety with Ring.  You're always home. It's like caller ID  for your house.

It's time for Stacey's House.  So  set us up. How did you wire this all  together?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that is easy. I feel like at some point  in time I think I did a story  about it, but basically what this  is is about six or seven  smart plugs, both outdoors.  I've used the Jasco  Z-Wave ones, but now there's actually  credible Wi-Fi ones that you could use.  So each one of those is about 35  to 45 bucks depending  on which one you get.  And then inside  I use mostly Wemo switches, but occasional  SmartThing switches, and  you just create a group called Christmas  and voila. And  this is going to trigger your Madam A.  Just so you know. That's right.  Turn on Christmas.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're going to bloop all those A words.  Don't worry. My mom has a new  my mom was on iOS today yesterday  and I told her she couldn't use the A word so she  says hoo hoo.  I know.  I love it.  Hoo hoo. Turn on the lights.  It's awesome. I have this vision that Stacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is going to, Stacy's daughter is going to someday write  an amusing New Yorker short story about  my mom who automated  our home. Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My Christmas episode  of the show actually that we pre-recorded  a couple days ago is my family talking  about what it's like to live in a smart home. Oh  really? So we do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  every year. Do they like it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Parts of it. My daughter  hates smart things.  This is the year she talked about  capitulating on  Mademoiselle.  She finally accepted that into her life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Mr. Jeff Jarvis, your number

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  of the week my friend. I'm going to see if you  know about this. You probably are way ahead of me on this. I didn't  realize this. Did you know  that Tasty, the the BuzzFeed  food site is selling a  cooktop? No I did not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh yeah. I've eaten from it.  You've eaten from it.  I've had a tasty meal. I knew  nothing about this. I actually like Tasty.  It's the one that it's  what's his name?  Ze Frank right? He's the guy  who created this whole format which now everybody copies  even the food network of like the top  down, sped up, how you make  stuff video. So now you can connect  the app to the cooktop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh no.  And the cooktop will recognize  this is for you. It's only a hundred  bucks too. Is it a  induction? Induction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I want to say invection.  It does sous vide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Invective powered top.  Slow cook and it connects the  app and the recipe in the app to  the cooktop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Two years ago Tasty started with the mission  of connecting the world with food.  Today with the launch of our Tasty One Top, we're making it easier than ever

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  to cook and share delicious meals with your family.  At first glance it may look like  just enough. My son will probably order this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The One Top is the most versatile appliance we've ever used.  This came out like in  February. Pan fry, slow cook,  pretty much anything. You don't need anything  else except for the one you do. I just didn't know it existed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All of this is made possible thanks to  technology that we here at Tasty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So that's a new Jonah Peretti monetization strategy.  And it was also because

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Quirky, the founder of Quirky  works there now.  And they have this connection to GE  appliances and it all came together.  Does GE make this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do they even have a Tasty thermometer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well you need the  thermometer to talk to the induction pan.  That's pretty cool.  It is pretty cool and I'll want

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  cheaper than the June Oven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's very similar in idea except there's  no AI so you've got to trust.  But the thermometer, there's weights in it  and it controls the temperature just like  the oven. So it  knows what you're cooking based on the app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know what I used the other day is the meter, Bluetooth  thermometer. Have you ever seen that one? That actually worked  quite well. I have. Yeah I like the meter a lot.  And you can put it in the oven.  Because it has two ends. It has an end  that gives you the ambient temperature, like the  oven temperature and an end that tells you what the meat is.  It worked quite well. I was really  impressed with that. That's M-E-A-T-E-R.  We did, we had a food  technology segment on the new  Screensavers. That was one of the perks. What?  What? I know. We didn't invite you. I know.  I would have  invited Mr. Tasty's  Cooktop if I had known.  Yeah. Oh.  So you don't have this though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do not. I didn't need it  because. I like it though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can do slow cooking with it. That's really  interesting. Yeah I found this  fascinating. Oh you could do shabu  shabu with it. And note

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the features in the bottom. Yeah.  The bottom right

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  feature. Bottom right  feature. Pentagon shaped because  Instagram.  It's made for Instagramming.  Wow.  And it has a tasty app.  It's an engineered crystal glass surface integrated  surface sensor tracks the surface temperature  of your pots and pans, capacitive touch,  thermometer. That's key.  So if you were  Suviting you'd put the thermometer in the water bath.  That's actually pretty impressive.  Start shipping  December. Oh it's not out yet.  You could buy it in a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm ordering it.  Yeah. I thought  they had a trial run  because they launched this.  I think they launched it like last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Eww. I'm not getting Baby Blue. That's  disgusting. Wait a minute. Baby Blue is  cute. We should. Well  that's for you then. One thing we should  note that you do need with inductive cooktops  pans that are magnetic.  Yes.  So you can put a magnet on your pan.  If it sticks to your pan. I do. I bought  one just to test my pans and none of them  work.  So I'd have to get all new cookware. We had to buy  all the cookware for ours. Do you have one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you like it?  We have inductive. Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well I have a gas cooktop and I'm thinking of  replacing it. But I like  gas a lot. And I know Stacey has  elected. Well we're ready to the kitchen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have no. I have gas.  I have a gas cooktop. The tasty  one was announced in July.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay.  This actually is a good idea. I just don't have any room on  my counter for even one more thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So actually I want a new feature.  Every week we should figure out a way  to get Leo to buy something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's already been done on MacBreak  weekly.  Every day. Every week.  All right. What was I had a pick  of the week and I had forgotten what it was.  Oh well I have actually  done already the Google Home  Max, the new camera  app. Yeah that's true.  But I will throw in which we didn't get to  Silicon Valley's worst  apologies of 2017.
