Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Great.  How are you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Doing great.  Happy to be doing this last pre-holiday show.  Jeff Jarvis, buzzmachine.com also here.  Hi, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hello there.  And since it is, I have not done this in a while, but since it is right before Christmas,  if you need that last minute gift, oh, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nice.  For the reader in your family.  Yes, if you have one, if there are any left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The perfect gift for someone who has everything but Jeff's book.  Right there.  Check it out.  Exactly.  So, on the news, the RIAA never hesitates from throwing around some judgments, and they've  put out a report card for Google because Google said that they were going to really pay attention  to how the search engine works with piracy because there have been all of these accusations  that Google makes all their money off piracy and they don't do anything to fight it.  So a year on, the RIAA has graded Google's efforts as incomplete.  I used to get these in school actually, an I. They didn't give F's for a while in elementary  school.  I would get an I for incomplete.  I thought it stood for improving.  Maybe that's what it did with elementary school, but with the RIAA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You had a complex your whole life and you were actually just improving, Tom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought I was incomplete.  I was improving the whole time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, it's the same.  Life is a beta, man.  You're always incomplete and you're always improving.  It means the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right.  Exactly.  As a kid, we just made puns out of it.  I got an I. And then we pointed our face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  School yard wit, I can tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It hasn't changed.  The industry group complains that phrases such as Lady Gaga MP3 download are still suggested  by the auto-complete feature of Google search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so why should they ever change that?  That's what people were putting in there.  That's what the algorithm says.  People should not be in a position to edit the auto-completes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I download Lady Gaga MP3s from Amazon all the time after I pay for them.  It's wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Lady Gaga MP3 download.  The first result is EMP3world.com.  I've known nothing about them.  Then MP3 raid, then BMP3.  The Amazon born this way, Lady Gaga MP3 is the fifth result.  So this is their problem.  It's not that the auto-complete says Lady Gaga MP3 download.  It's that you have all of these other sites that we don't know whether they're legit places.  I mean, it's 15 cents a track.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not Google's job.  It's not Google's job to go in and edit the web.  The RIAA should go take a lesson from Louis C.K.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well yeah, actually they should adapt their business model.  I agree.  But they fault Google for refusing to explicitly prioritize sites with authorized content over unauthorized sites.  What comes down to is how do you judge that?  How do you as Google decide algorithmically, because it's not a person sitting there indexing all these things.  How do you decide algorithmically what's authorized and what isn't?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the next thing we're going to hear is European authorities saying that Google is editing the web and Google has too much authority and Google shouldn't have this much power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, exactly.  Which is it? Are they an algorithm that indexes without bias or are they going in and tweaking things and making judgments?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, just to play devil's advocate, I mean, Google pulled down.  Was this an AdWords issue?  Pulled down the links to those pharmacies that were selling drugs and within, you know, inside the US illegally.  Right. So that was they had to do that.  It was incumbent on them to do that.  So I mean, I can make the argument that they shouldn't have these sites selling these ringtones.  It looks like the first result is selling Gaga ringtones.  I don't know how you judge whether or not that's, you know, I don't know.  Is it up to Google to figure that out?  I mean, is it is it incumbent on the R.A. to prove that these sites are are doing something illegal and take down those sites?  Or is it about Google?  I think it's on it's on our R.I.A. to figure that out.  Take down those sites if they're doing something illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. I think you're right, Gina.  And it actually becomes kind of a precursor to SOPA where we need so.  Oh, wait. No, the government won't do the blacklist.  Then the R.I.A. says Google should be doing the blacklist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Exactly. Well, and there is there is a good question here.  And I actually, Neely and Leo got into this on this week in tech this weekend, which is there.  You know, we say, OK, don't use DRM because that gets in the way.  And then we say, and don't make Google pull down the unauthorized sites because that's wrong for the algorithm.  And then we say, don't pass SOPA because that breaks the Internet.  What? And I agree with all of those things.  But what should they do?  I mean, what is the recourse for copyright infringement?  And, you know, let's get I think honestly, we need to rethink what copyright means and what deserves protection.  But short of that, how do we enforce copyright?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the argument from Louis C.K.  And the argument from Apple, iTunes, too, would be make it easy to buy.  And generally, people will.  And by the way, when things get you know, Louis said at some point, so I know some get pirated.  But last count was seven hundred fifty thousand dollars.  And that was two days ago in sales.  Now, he's Louis C.K. and he's beloved and he's great and he's wonderful.  But at some point, you as Gina says, you've got to adapt your business model to the future.  Is it wrong to pirate stuff? Yeah, I think it is.  But but whack a mole, man, you're going to you're going to be licking ants off the screen for a long time.  If there are a lot more sites that offer MP3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If there are a lot more sites that let you download the Gaga MP3 for a buck ninety nine or whatever,  that they would show up higher, more people would do it.  They'd be more relevant.  That's you know, I think that that's one answer for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, why why aren't the record companies hosting files and providing an affiliate link situation like  Amazon or letting Amazon run it? Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, if people are Googling Lady Gaga MP3 downloads, you know, give them what they want.  They want they want the music, give them the music and they'll pay if it's easy.  And if it's, you know, like I said, I bought all the Gaga stuff through Amazon, actually.  And, you know, listen, there are always people that are going to steal.  Oh, wait. I mean, if someone wants to steal, then they're going to steal.  But I think the majority of people and there's yet yet to be data about this.  But but I'd love for us to try to get the data.  You give people the opportunity to buy something at a fair price and make it easy.  And, you know, on the up and up, they'll do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Flood the Internet with with legitimate links that make you money.  Play the that's the way the search engine game is played.  So search engine optimize drive these other sites off the page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly. And give it to them in a format that they want.  People are asking specifically for MP3s, right?  They don't want to download your crazy proprietary player that, you know,  given the MP3, which Amazon does and several services do some of the big services.  And and they'll do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, the the thing that the RIA paid the most attention to was takedown requests.  Last year, Google said that the first service to get faster  takedowns would be Blogger and Search.  And the RIA didn't say anything about how well Google kept its promise  with respect to those two services, which is pretty much admitting  that it kept its promise with those two services.  But they did criticize Google's management of the Android  marketplace, noting that Google doesn't adequately screen apps  before accepting them into the app app store.  Also complaining that apps removed from the marketplace  aren't automatically blacklisted from AdSense and Google Wallet.  Two separate issues there.  One is, I mean, they don't screen apps.  That's the whole point of the Android marketplace.  Should they have to just because the RIA would like them to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, of course not.  There is a problem with an app.  They should file a complaint.  There's there's there's channels for filing problems, complaints, bugs,  whatever, with with with different apps.  They should do that.  And then they should be pulled if it's a legitimate complaint.  But Google shouldn't.  That's insane.  The whole idea of the market is that developers can upload their apps  and there isn't this this this review that it's an open market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And then they finally complain that the tools Google has built  have limits on the number of submissions rights holders can submit each day.  And they don't scale to the scope of piracy online.  I mean, you know, having I feel having recently been  the target of a takedown request, it seems like they work well  and lots of people that don't didn't even do anything wrong.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're deeply efficient for taking out, you know,  legitimate fair use examples.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the scope is I think the scope is wrong  in that it's like shooting buckshot trying to hit a bullseye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yep. Yep. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've got it.  Yeah, we've we kind of said all of this stuff before.  It's nothing new, but there there's the reports.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was a little bitter about the music industry these days.  I know I like Tom. He's kind of salty about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like that.  I mean, clearly the R.A. wants to make Google out to be the boogeyman.  Right. There you know, doesn't shock me at all.  They give them a terrible report card.  I mean, they're using this information to pass things like well,  well, the R.A. is involved in SOPA.  Is it are they? I think they are.  Is it or is it just they are?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're not. They're not as high profile.  The MPAA is kind of taken point on that one.  So they're they're making all the statements.  So right.  And frankly, I think that we have overindexed  the amount of discussion that needs to be had around the media industry.  There are people doing actual harm to actual people  involving life or death situations, as well as crazy amounts of malware out there,  none of which is getting prioritized.  You don't see the committee in Congress  pushing at the last minute before the holidays to put in an anti-malware bill.  Yeah. Which would actually protect people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't protect people, they protect institutions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right. Well, that's very obvious lately.  Google renewed their search deal for Firefox.  So this is good news for Firefox.  They make and for Google, 80 plus percent of their money from the search deal  with Google, although there was there was talk that there's a Bing version  of Firefox, meaning they could have gone to Bing and got that money.  So so, Jeff, I think you're right.  This may be a better better thing for Google because it keeps them in a  in a large browser footprint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was asked today and I don't even know.  I know that Chrome has now passed Firefox.  But where does Firefox where do they stand against  IE in market share?  Does anybody know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  IE just recently dipped under 50 percent of the market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was a big deal first time in 10 years or something, right?  That it was below 50 percent.  Yeah, I thought that I thought that the IE just I'm just from memory.  I thought I just went below 50 percent.  And then it's, you know, Firefox and Chrome.  And has Chrome surpassed Firefox at this point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a specific statistic in in a certain way that you counted  in the United States. Chrome has passed Firefox.  I think in the general, it's still Firefox.  Yeah. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, what it means is it's both of them against Microsoft, which is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  which is, I think, why it makes sense for them to be together.  And Google kind of has to.  You know, well, the great thing about even though I'm a Chrome user now  and I like Chrome, Firefox's presence is very good for the market.  And Google supporting that in, you know, a tangible way,  I think is a good thing.  And it pushes the competition.  It's not unlike that time when when Microsoft invested in Apple  when it needed help.  I keep Firefox alive, I think it's good for everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, we talked about this on tech news today under the auspices of  is this is this a problem for Google for antitrust?  Because they're under so many antitrust investigations.  To go into Firefox means there they are in another place dominating.  But at the same time, they're supporting their survival.  If they don't, yeah, then they're just giving over market share to somebody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's sort of sad, though, to put it that way, they're supporting their survival.  It's like, you know, Firefox is largest source of revenue, has a competing browser.  I mean, if Firefox had had Google and went to Bing,  it would have been the death knell for any power user nerd.  You know, I mean, maybe not the death knell.  You can always change your your search engine, right?  You can change it to Bing right now.  Yeah, you could change it to Bing right now. Exactly.  But I feel bad about Firefox actually kind of getting trampled by Chrome in a way.  I love Chrome and I use Chrome.  I just remember kind of when Firefox came out and people loved it  and started to switch and getting people to switch their default browser  seemed like an impossible feat that it just would never happen.  And it happened and Firefox proved that that could happen.  And I don't know, I feel I feel kind of bad.  According to that counter, Chrome had 25.69 percent of the global browser

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  market in November, Firefox, 25.23.  Net applications has Chrome with 18.18 percent and Firefox, 22.14.  So it depends on who's counting. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Gina, I think the answer to the hegemony of the big companies  is more open source products, is more Apaches and Firefox's and Linux's.  And, you know, that says I feel a little guilty  liking Chrome because we need to support these other things.  I download Firefox, I use it here and there.  But I think that that's our answer as an open net.  Even though I'm a Google fanboy, I don't want Google to own the world.  I certainly don't want Microsoft to.  I don't want Twitter to.  The more we have open platforms, the better off we all are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I actually tried to switch to Firefox recently  because of the improvements with tab management and responsiveness.  And for a while I was enjoying it and I was like, I like this.  I can use no script again.  I can use a bunch of other add ons for security.  And then after a couple of weeks, the tab management just bogged down.  And I don't know if it's that I need to keep restarting Firefox  to clear out the memory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I went back to Chrome and, you know, like Chrome has been bogging down lately.  If something opens up in some window and then it just starts  going, I've got to relaunch it, which is fairly new for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That has been happening to me when I have spreadsheets,  which I always have open because we do all of our rundowns in there.  Every once in a while, it will suddenly just take forever for it to open  new tabs and everything else grinds to a halt.  And then then that just goes away.  I don't know what it is. It may not even be a Chrome issue.  It may be some some other operating system or Internet issue.  I don't know. But, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Firefox's extensions are still better for power users who do like  I launched Firefox when I want to use down the mall,  which is my favorite download manager.  Firebug is available in Chrome, but it's not quite as rich as it is in Firefox.  But these are pretty strong power uses for edge cases.  But that's when I launched Firefox.  And I think, oh, this is pretty and new and maybe I'll try and stick to it.  And then I just I wind up back at Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I also continue to use Firefox for archive.org  because there's a bug that happens every once in a while in Chrome.  When I upload something to archive, it never redirects to my page.  And of course, the search engine hasn't indexed yet.  So I have to wait like a half hour before I can find the thing that I just uploaded.  Whereas in Firefox, it never fails.  It always goes and redirect.  That's still weird. That's a weird bug, though.  Google Plus got some improvements right before the new year.  Pump up or down the volume.  This is from the Google Plus blog post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Scoble feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So you can you can sort of.  This is interesting. It's not just a mute.  You know, I love Scoble's posts on Google Plus, though.  I made that joke one day, but that was because I was I was reading all these posts.  I'm like, wow, Google Plus is great.  And I realized like nine of the things I'd read were from Scoble.  But it's good. But you can just we can Scoble.  You can add controls that enable you to fine tune your stream  so that certain people show up less often than others, as it blends that more circles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't it isn't it circle is that by when viewing the stream for a particular circle,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you'll now see a slider at the top that lets you adjust how posts from that circle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're right, Jeff. You could make Scoble his own circle, which, of course, he deserves to be.  But otherwise, it circles, I think.  Yeah, and I haven't gotten it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I haven't either.  So I haven't got any.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is interesting.  I keep a VIP Twitter list of people whose tweets I absolutely don't want to miss,  and I will scroll back and actually read it.  It's a very small group of people.  I well, it's a private list.  I kind of do a similar thing on Google Plus.  I have this inner circle where I want to see every single post.  And I really love that I can say, turn up the volume all the way on these.  And the rest, I'm OK with just sort of the stream flowing by.  And if I miss a day, no big deal.  So but if it's on a per circle basis, if Jeff is in my inner circle  and also my really loud, noisy people circle,  if I turn down the volume on one and up on the other, I wonder what it does.  So I haven't gotten it yet. So I'm not sure.  I actually have a Twitter problem.  I have it. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I've never used it before.  So, OK, I got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're turning down your friends.  I'm going to turn down my friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know what that means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hear from them all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nothing's I don't see anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it doesn't happen immediately.  I know what happens is that it's going to feed in more to your mainstream.  I see. So you're you're you're big stream proper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, so this is like Facebook top stories, except you get to you get to graphic  equalize them, you get to, you know, play play with the settings sliders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it could be me, but go ahead, Tom.  No, no, I'm just going to say it sounds pretty cool,  but I want to play with it to see how it works first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I've been noticing and, you know, I like Google Plus and the  I abandoned it for about a week because I was traveling  and I wasn't in there much and I'm getting less conversation there now.  I wonder if it penalized me and put me in streams less  and I got less noticed as a result.  Because what this what this reveals is, of course, you're not  the stream is not complete.  The stream is some product of an algorithm.  And, you know, who gets put in your stream, how much?  So even though the number of followers has gone up,  my conversations have gone on either that or I'm just saying stupid ass things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I love how this is so reflective of the Facebook  and Google Plus's different approaches, right?  Like Facebook figures out kind of auto detects who your list should be  and tries to do it for you and tries to figure out your top stories for you.  And Google's like, here are all the sliders and buttons and circles  and just drag this here like you set this up for yourself.  And I prefer having more control,  but it is definitely very different approaches to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do like the fact that I don't it's not an all or nothing.  And there's a couple of people on Twitter that I've blocked  and I didn't really want to block.  I just kind of wanted to turn them down.  And this would this would have been perfect for that.  That's really true. Yes.  Also, redesigned Google bar,  the where the red notifications indicator is.  One thing I've noticed, I don't think it was part of this update,  but you actually get the actual number instead of maxing out at nine,  which is which is a little different.  But they also have changed the notification.  So you get a little more information about what's in them  before you kind of had to click through with a lot of them to see  what they were actually saying.  Now, as you can see in Eileen's, you get a little summary,  a little bit more one note, one liner about what's what's going on.  So you don't have to click all the way in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. So instead of saying someone plus one, your your post,  it shows you the content of your post and says someone plus one.  So you can you know what post it is without having to click over to the side  or expand it. That's nice. That's handy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that is.  I mean, a lot of times I would click in just because I'm like,  I don't understand what this notification is about.  Then I'm thinking to be like, oh, well, that's all it was. Oh, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was having that experience, too.  Like, really, I just clicked to find out that, you know, a couple of people plus  one that, you know, it felt like, why did I get bothered for this?  So this is it seems like just like better information density  and one in one one view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And pages for brands.  This is actually the Scobel fix.  You can now delegate up to 50 managers as administrators for a page.  Remember when they launched pages, it was one page per person.  So now I can bring in all my co-hosts on shows and at brand pages.  A new notification flow will ensure that these managers stay in the loop  on all the activity that takes place on a given page.  So the managers know what's going on and will show and they'll show  an aggregated count of users that have engaged with your page.  A little metric, either by plus one or by adding it to a circle.  So you can get an at a glance summary of who has been  visiting your page and interacting with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So nice, nice changes.  They do keep developing the thing.  Yeah, some stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, December is usually a slow month, right?  But not on the Google plus team, it sounds like.  And also some photos, the photo updates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, they improved that somehow, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Viewing a photo in Lightbox has been completely redesigned  with improved navigation, enhanced comment legibility  and just better overall utility, they say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that makes sense in time for the holidays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, and so many photographers use Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's going to be I wondered whether that's that was on purpose  or whether that was accidental.  You know, did they plan for Trey Ratcliffe to make it great for him?  Or did Trey Ratcliffe come in and make Google Plus a great place for photographers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a good question. That's a very good question.  I it's probably more of Trey than Google.  But I wouldn't say that they didn't have that in mind as a as one of the uses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But boy, photographers do love it and it's great.  It makes it so visual and fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I it I jokingly get angry every time I see Trey's amazing pictures.  Yeah, because it stops me in my tracks.  I'm like, I'll just look at Google Plus for a second.  Then I'm like, wow, look at that.  And I get totally sucked in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've got to throw out my brownie. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. Let's take a quick break before we get to some Android news  and thank our sponsor, Ford.  One of the great parts of Ford's sync is AppLink.  This week in Google, of course, brought to you by Ford.  And we recently took sync AppLink for a test drive.  Check it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, Tom Merritt here, taking off from the Twit Brickhouse.  And we're going to jump into the 2012 Ford Fiesta to try out sync AppLink.  Now, sync AppLink lets you use apps like Pandora with simple voice commands.  So you keep your eyes on the road and your hands on the wheel.  All right. So we're going to see how Pandora works with sync.  Plug in the phone here by USB.  And then we're going to say, line in, please say a command mobile apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mobile apps, please say a command Pandora.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now it immediately goes right to the channel that I had,  which was a classical music channel.  I only feel like that right now. So let's change that.  Play station Uncle Tupelo radio.  There we go. That's better.  All right, let's hit the road.  And you can do all kinds of things with voice commands.  You can bookmark a song, thumbs up, thumbs down,  create a new channel from an artist while it's playing.  All those things you probably shouldn't do while you're driving.  If you're doing them by the app, but you can do them safely  by keeping your eyes on the road and your hands on the wheel.  All right, we're here.  So that's how Ford sync with that link allows you to play Pandora  with simple voice commands while you keep your eyes on the road  and your hands on the wheel.  Of course, it's available on the 2012 Ford Fiesta,  and you can learn more at Ford.com slash technology.  And of course, we thank Ford for their support.  Good work this week in Google. Thank you.  Yeah, nice. Those were fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You made have you guys made a commercial like that before?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's the first time Leo and I both did versions of all the different stuff.  They're played all this week.  So, yeah, I like I like them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I think it's good. Thanks, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google's Andy Rubin trumpeting Android activations  and making it clear what Android activations are.  They're up to seven hundred thousand.  Wait, am I reading this right?  Seven hundred thousand per day.  Per day, seven hundred thousand per day.  And he makes it clear when he says activation, he means someone went  into a store, bought an Android phone and activated it.  And so it doesn't involve used ones.  Once a phone's been activated, it's been counted and they never counted again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a big number. That's huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's huge. I was actually just waiting for the I was waiting for the page  to load to make sure I got it right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait a second here. Seven oh oh oh oh oh times  three hundred fifty six equals two hundred forty nine million a year.  We believe that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does that does that add up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does it add up? It seems almost that doesn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If they're not, I mean, if they were duping, if used  androids that got activated somehow worked, there are now over seven  thousand Android devices activated every day worldwide, I guess.  Still huge. Still. Yeah, that doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess he didn't say every day.  He said one Wednesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One Wednesday just before Christmas, the last day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And for those wondering, we count each device only once.  Activations means you go into a store, buy a device and put it on the network  by subscribing to a wireless service.  So so Eileen's Samsung Galaxy S2 wouldn't count  because she just popped a SIM card in it.  That's not that's not activating it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's seven hundred thousand and one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you count your Galaxy S2,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the chat room says that he did the same thing last year  and that this was a current shopping season number, which is a good point.  But even so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, so it's a it's a it's a spike right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I also got the wrong number of days in a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which which planet were you using as your year?  That's a you know, makes a difference.  One of the new planets. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was off on the new planet, which is new science news.  You see how current I am. Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it'll be interesting to see what this number goes to.  But remember the last time he talked about it, it was five hundred  fifty thousand per day.  And I think we were having the same reaction.  How could that possibly be true?  So it just keeps going up.  All right.  Samsung Galaxy Nexus prices already slashed  with the contract, with the contract, of course.  We got one here.  Galaxy Nexus. It's monstrous.  Have you guys got a chance to look at it or mess around with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I haven't. I got the ice cream sandwich on my Nexus S.  So I've been sort of preoccupied just with that,  but I haven't had a chance to get my hands on the Galaxy Nexus.  Is it is it much bigger than the  hmm, what was the phone right before that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I have the Nexus S. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Nexus S. So compared to the Nexus S, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's this is this is it.  You can you can hide it. Yep.  It's big. Yeah.  It's rather large. It's fine for me.  It's a little heavier than the Galaxy S2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think I think Leo's review on your new wonderful gadget show.  Yes. Was was very, very good, because it was it was it was  it was more of a follow up to what he did last week on this show,  where he went in more depth and said, well, not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I know Eileen likes it.  I love it.  So I disagree with him.  Why are why are they slicing the prices down so much?  Is it because there's more people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They got to get 700000 a day, man.  You got to. Yeah, exactly.  Got to make it on volume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One hundred fifty five dollars after an instant rebate  and a seventy five dollar off coupon code plus contract.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, here's the problem with it.  So I still have idiot that I am my, you know, seven inch Galaxy Tab, right,  which now has prehistoric is like a Claire Froyo.  Oh, it's it's it's what it was.  What was the bee?  You know, it's there was no bee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was just butter scotch. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's it's the Fred Flintstone version, whatever that is.  And so I said, OK, this is ridiculous.  I'm paying forty four dollars a month.  I'm not using it.  I want something new, but I'm just going to get rid of this.  And of course, I've got a two year contract, two hundred dollars  to get rid of this. And it is out of date.  It is it is permanently awfully, horribly out of date.  So I appealed to T-Mobile.  I had to email them to appeal the two hundred dollar cancellation fee.  But it just makes you say never, never, never get a contract.  It's a lot more expensive, but I know feels better.  It does. So I looked up the prices.  I want to see if I can if I can't get out of the contract,  I want to take the same amount of this one and put it in.  Because my because my phone, of course, is the Nexus one,  which is even earlier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's classic. That's like that's good.  The Nexus one is a great handset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm delighted with it.  But I went on Amazon and you can buy unlocked.  I don't know what the trick is, but you could buy a lot of Android  handsets that are not that far back.  And so I can, you know, for less than two hundred dollars,  I can buy a whole new handset, put the SIM in it, get the data.  I'll be a little less mad at myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep, yep.  So, you know, Leo panned ice cream sandwich or he panned the the handset  or was it was the combination of both? Yeah.  Yeah. So first, I'm really sad for my Nexus one owner friends.  And I have several because that's a great handset that they're  that they're not getting ice cream sandwich.  That really stinks.  But I have the Nexus S and I got ice cream sandwich and I love it.  I am going to disagree with Leo on this as well.  And I'm and I'm with Eileen.  Yeah, Gina, it's it's really great.  I mean, the visual refresh is amazing.  It feels like a totally different, different phone.  This is just a straight up ice cream sandwich.  And, you know, the only thing I don't like about the visual refresh  is that things feel a little flat.  So it's not it's hard to tell where to tap.  I'm still sort of getting getting used to it.  But there's so many great new features.  Like I love all the new camera stuff.  The Gmail app is awesome.  I'm a widget girl.  So I love that you can scroll widgets now and resize widgets.  Like I have my calendar kind of on my home screen.  I think there are a lot of really great things about ice cream sandwich.  I'm really excited for apps to catch up to ICS  so that they take advantage of the action bar and all the kind of new stuff in ICS.  But for if you're if you've got a handset,  if you had an Android handset to go from gingerbread to ice cream sandwich  is a huge leap because you're you're you're you're hopping over honeycomb, essentially.  So I really love it.  And I was surprised that that Leo I heard a few people on Twitter said  that they didn't like that Leo panned it so quickly because he hadn't been,  you know, use it for very long.  And I mean, I've had I've been using it pretty steadily since Saturday.  And I'm still discovering stuff.  I just figured out how to take a screenshot on it today.  I was kind of excited about that.  The panoramic stuff in the camera is is great.  I'm not a camera buff.  I'm not going to doubt.  I'm not going to, you know, search the market for a camera app with panoramic.  But now that it's just built into the regular camera,  I've taken a bunch of panoramic photos, especially now at the at the holiday.  So I'm thinking ice cream sandwich.  How's your battery battery?  Battery seems about the same.  I have an extra battery.  I bought an extra battery a while ago and I and I carry it with me just because,  you know, that's that's I've sort of accepted that that's what I have to do.  I mean, all my iPhone friends have those juice pack things anyway.  It seems it's the same for me.  It seems about the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I say, do you miss your iPhone friends?  What about the other with my old eyes, Gina?  With screen res, what Leo said, what I've seen elsewhere  is that the type really does resolve pretty damn small.  Is it you find it all hard to read?  Or you have young, vibrant eyes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't I I don't want to sound ageist.  I'm not I don't have a problem with it with the title.  I really like that I haven't had a time.  I haven't had a hard time reading it.  It does actually get small.  Now that you say so, it is kind of small.  But isn't this this has to be configurable.  There are so many settings on this on this one.  I feel like I'm still discovering how many settings there are.  I'd be surprised if you can change that.  I love you. What was your biggest notifications to  swiping off?  I mean, what was your biggest complaint with Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, he didn't like anything.  He doesn't like he doesn't like the soft buttons.  He doesn't like  he doesn't like the look.  He likes the apps. He likes the updated apps.  He hates the task manager.  I'm just he hates the task manager.  He hates it. Yeah.  If you go to that.  Yeah, he can't stand that.  What else?  I mean, I can't even remember anything that he really likes  other than the the updated apps.  Like I said, well, what about Gmail?  Oh, and he likes voice recognition.  The voice recognition is much better on this on this on IC.  That was very impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that was really nice.  And, you know, the text response is super cool.  I can't use it because I'm Google Voice full time and it sends it from your  like actual phone number, which I said about it.  I'm hoping that Google Voice is going to work with that.  You know, when someone when you get an incoming call,  you can kind of swipe up and say, hey, you know, text back immediately.  Hey, can I call you later?  Some menu of responses, which is cool.  The visual refresh is really beautiful, although, as I said, it's very flat.  So there's no depth to any of the buttons or anything.  So I at first I had a little bit of a hard time.  I was like, where do I tap?  Because I was just used to having buttons that have a little,  you know, 3D feel to them.  But you get used to that quickly.  And some of the settings do feel buried.  Like I said, I'm on the Nexus S, so I have all my old buttons  that the Galaxy Nexus doesn't have anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There it is. There's Nexus with ICS there.  I think I think my biggest, maybe my biggest beef with him is he said,  unlike what you just said, Gina, is that this is not a huge improvement.  And I completely disagree with that.  I think it is. Yeah, I disagree.  It is a huge improvement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is. It is. Especially for some for handset.  I mean, unless you've had a honeycomb tablet,  not a lot of people have.  Yeah, this is this is it.  This is a really big improvement.  And I think even from honeycomb, it's it's quite an improvement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If I were going to buy a phone other than this one to get ice cream sandwich,  what phone should that be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, the only the only one  aren't the only choices right now are the Nexus S and the Galaxy Nexus.  Right. The T-Mobile Nexus S and the Galaxy Nexus,  I think are the only two phones that have it. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and all the other phones are going to get them eventually,  but we don't have dates. We don't know. Right.  And that's always, you know, that's always a risk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My my advice for someone who's looking to buy a phone right now  would be to just wait a few months for the for the ice  ice cream sandwich to come out on more handsets and also for the other apps  to catch up to the ice cream sandwich visual design  and incorporate the features that it has, because then you get kind of the best of both.  So, you know, if I mean, if your contract is up right now  and you're dying for a phone, I love the Nexus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tell me which one has physical buttons.  That's that's the thing that I think is so funny when people complain about this.  And I know it's because you're used to using it in a certain way.  But the physical buttons on the Nexus S aren't physical buttons.  They're not. They're just sort of touchscreens that are embedded and never go away.  The right the buttons on on ice cream sandwich on the Nexus S,  the Galaxy Nexus, I mean, look just like the physical buttons.  They just happen to be on the screen and they go away sometimes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And there are fewer of them, aren't there?  There's three galaxy.  So there's three on the Galaxy Nexus and then four on the Nexus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On the that you have the search on Nexus search. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they're both pure Android experience,  except that Verizon doesn't have the wallet, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, no, it does have the wallet now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't come with the wallet.  Right. You have to you have to go get it and put it side loaded.  But it will work.  What's the I didn't get a chance to watch the Ninja Galaxy Nexus  unboxing. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, this is this is from Matt.  This is the one that Matt Cutts said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I couldn't I couldn't figure it out.  It's a game.  Oh, is that what it is? Yeah.  Here. Oh, I get it.  I waited for something to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's respect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then the whole page goes eight bit and then you just start playing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I see.  So you're unboxing the Nexus, the Nexus  as part of the eight bit ninja. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I'm terrible at this. I try playing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a HTML five. Oh, here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, OK. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, nothing happened for me. I get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You watch it and now you start playing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why are we fighting a white ninja?  Are we trying to get to the box? Is that what's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the objective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's the what's my motivation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is how this is that is the ninja.  That's why he likes it so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's it. That's what it is.  We figured it. You've unmasked it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's down spammers.  Matt, calm, quiet, nice.  Matt sees himself as a ninja. I get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's on your ceiling right now.  You didn't even know.  All right. Google  sticks the the Dexys ice cream sandwich update back  in the freezer, says in Gadget.  Apparently not everybody was able to get it.  The way, you know, which some people are still able to get it.  Other people have not.  And according to a statement from Google Community  Manager Paul Wilcox, if you received an update notification  a little while ago, but the update isn't currently available for your phone,  this is likely the result of Google pausing the update in your area  while we monitor feedback.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I downloaded it manually from like the XDA developers.  You know, it was a rock and Saturday night here in New York City.  Good times. I have to have this right now and I will get it.  Oh, and I just there's no way I could wait.  Google TV made me wait too long.  So I just went for it with the with the next assess.  But so, you know, I think that you probably can still if you Google  where to find the zip file, it's sort of a pain.  I probably wouldn't recommend doing that.  Just wait for the update to come. You'll get it.  But it makes sense for Google that they pause.  But, you know, if you're an Android enthusiast,  you're going to be like me, you're just not going to want to wait.  But you can do it manually.  And it's not that difficult.  You don't have to have your phone.  Phone doesn't have to be rooted to begin with, which is nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, OK, that was going to be my question is if you have to root.  So if you can just you can just find the zip file, you can put it on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The file, you move it to your phone's SD card, then you boot up your phone.  You hold up the volume button and power and then just say, hey,  you know, run this loader and you're good.  And it runs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The International Trade Commission has ruled that HTC infringed upon one  of Apple's patents, but that one is still a win.  They have until April to work around the patent they found to be violating,  or HTC will no longer be able to sell their phones in the United States.  People sometimes freak out when they hear that.  ITC rules this way quite a lot.  And usually the company gets plenty of time, like they did in this case,  and are able to work around it.  HTC says they already have the solution, so they don't even need until April 19th.  But they get a lot of time.  What does this mean for Android, though?  It's another loss.  Now, there are more than one patent here, but they lost on one.  We're still kind of waiting for Google to get Motorola in the house.  Will this sort of stuff change when that happens?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. I mean, doesn't this go doesn't this then become dominoes  from HTC to the other manufacturers in Google itself?  HTC is just the the the victim in the in the crosshairs, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, one would think, although it depends on whether that particular patent  is is easily proved to be a problem.  Remember, there were other patents here that they were found not to be violating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. And Apple and like he said, they were going to develop around it.  Right. That's another that's probably another forked version of Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it is Gina, do you know, is that does that mean they have to fork Android  if they if they work around this stuff?  I don't know enough about the patent that was found to be violated  to to know if that is something that is core.  Like if I'm if I'm using a stock Android, is that also going to be violating this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good question. I'm not sure.  So it looks like this patent refers to a method of data detection  that allows a mobile device to recognize things like email addresses  and phone numbers and move them to, you know, a relevant  like the dialer app or your email app on your phone.  This just frustrates me so much because it's like this is not this is just, you know,  this gets me crazy.  This is crazy. So you tap on a phone number and it launches the dialer app.  And so this is the patent that Apple says that it had  and that Android shouldn't have.  And as far as I know, this is this is just kind of built into Android.  Android is actually has innovated in the area of being able to send data  in between apps that the Android share menu is very customizable.  And as a developer, you can, you know, you can insert items  to be able to send data easily to your app.  So I think that is core.  And I'm not sure what this means then for stock Android.  I don't know if they if they have to fork it or.  Well, Google could come up with their own forks,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because it's the only one that has to do with it right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. But Google could decide to come up with its own technical work around  or HTC's work around could be contributed into the source code  and be implemented by anyone.  There's there's ways for it to propagate.  I don't know if they will. Right.  But it's just, you know, the ongoing patent wars,  it's not going to get any better, folks. Sorry.  It sucks. Now, the.  Yeah, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know, I know.  I always go back to the like when, you know, the Apple folks went to Xerox  Park and saw the GUI and came back and said, you know, great, you know,  job's a great artist steel.  It just I can't help but listen to, you know, think of that that whole story,  whatever these things, these things come up.  You know, HTC said this is a small UI experience  and would remove it from its phone.  So maybe this is maybe this is detection and sharing  that goes a little farther than the stock Android.  So maybe this won't be an issue for the core. Yeah.  Anyway, sorry, I won't get tongue tied about my frustration about patents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Paul, David, that says it doesn't affect two point three and later.  So that almost makes it irrelevant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, all right. I hope he's right.  Never mind.  Last time I was on this week in Google, Eric Schmidt had just said that by summer,  every TV you saw in stores would have Google TV on it.  He likes to predict things in six month increments, apparently,  because this time he told an Italian newspaper in the next six months,  we plan to market a tablet of the highest quality.  Let the parsing begin a tablet, not tablets.  And we are going to mark, we plan to market  not an Android tablet.  Is Google going to come out with their own tablet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A Google Roller, pure Google experience.  Yeah.  Page of Google dot com.  Buy it through us. Well, maybe not buy it through us.  I wish it would just not talk so much as a ship.  I wish that we were just sort of like surprised, like, wow,  this is a serious iPad rival.  I wish the consumers were saying that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I kind of feel like he was talking to an Italian newspaper.  It was printed and the quote was printed in Italian,  although he probably said it in English.  And then it was translated from the Italian back.  We could have something lost in the translation.  It's quite possible, although it's Eric Schmidt we're talking about.  So who knows? But it's quite possible he was saying, yeah, in the next six months,  we're going to be marketing all these great tablets with ice cream sandwich.  They're going to be high quality.  And it just gets babble fished into sounding different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or Google translated or Google Voice transcription or, you know, yeah.  Whatever it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It happens to Schmidt English to English.  You can imagine what happens to the Italian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does Google Translate have a Schmidt to English?  Oh, my God. They obviously need one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If they have Klingon, they need Schmidt to English.  Schminklish.  We're going to attempt to make a really good tablet soon.  Just hold on and we'll check and we'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the other side.  It's like, look, yeah, all the tablets have to now be crap.  But we're going to make a high quality one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're going to make one that's serious.  Now we're getting serious about this tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do think I do think that it's quite possible  that Google comes out with some sort of reference tablet eventually, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yes.  That seems absolutely.  And hopefully we'll get one at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You mean get one free?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, actually, I don't want to get one free.  I want the Google tablet to be so damn good that I can't help  but go out and get it.  You have to go back.  It makes me abandon my iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, I'm very curious to see ice cream sandwich tablets.  I really feel like in this case, that's what Eric Schmidt was saying,  is we've got ice cream sandwich coming out on tablets in the next six months.  And it's awesome.  And I hope it is. I hope it is awesome.  Are we are we going to do the Google Zeitgeist?  Up to you. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was kind of bantering my head.  Do I save it for next week when Leo and Jeff run through the top stories of the year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But we could do that, because I've also got I've got one  I'll put on there right now that you can say, Vyline, we do next week  for top stories in Google versus blog and blogs  versus Twitter versus news.  Why don't we do that next week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. You guys should do the year end.  Yeah, I'll put that on right there now.  So we can talk about the augmented reality glasses.  Oh, sure.  Those that's more fun.  So those need to be discussed.  There was a lot of wearable computing news this week.  There were rumors about Apple  dipping into wearable computing and, you know, sort of the watch stuff.  One of the interesting things is and I can't remember the guy's name  and I don't see it in this article.  An expert on wearable computing was hired by Apple,  worked for them for a while, but the summer moved to Google  and ReadWriteWeb has a story about possible glasses  that would look like normal, probably hipster glasses.  They wouldn't look like big, you know, virtual reality goggles  like we're used to seeing from the 90s.  But they do look like normal glasses, but have a heads up display.  So they would augment reality while you're just walking around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google goggles kind of installed in the inside of your glass,  glasses lenses, basically, kind of telling you what things are  and bring up the Wikipedia page, that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Nick Bilton wrote about it for New York Times, says  it's part of the Google X Lab  that prompted Google specialist Seth Weintraub now at Fortune  and formerly of Computer World to call the news an open secret  among some in the Google community.  There's a lot of that kind of stuff where they're like,  oh, yeah, everybody at Google has been doing this.  They've been trying it out.  So we should station a reporter down in Mountain View  to just look for people who are all wearing the same kind of glasses,  wearing hipster glasses and kind of have a 10000 yard stare when they look at you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stumbling around the street, seeing nothing. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. If we go to Mountain View, looking for people wearing hipster glasses,  we will find them.  But that doesn't mean that these kind of glasses. I love this.  No, this is this is William Gibson, Neil Stevenson,  Daniel Suarez's world come to life.  This is the kind of thing that, you know, makes me feel like we're living  in the future. The idea that I could just put on a pair of glasses,  look totally normal and walk around seeing like, oh, that's, you know,  that's so and so. Or this is the location where this happened.  Or there's the menu for that restaurant that that kind of Google goggles kind of stuff.  Well, that your last Google Plus post.  Yeah. Notifications from the person that's walking toward you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, whenever I see friends who I just haven't seen for a while,  I always try to like look at their Twitter stream or their blog or whatever,  their Facebook before we get together.  So I kind of had like, oh, how's your dog? I saw that you, you know, whatever.  I saw you took him to the vet last week.  Kind of that that ambient intimacy that you get from social media.  I want that. I don't want to have to remember to check before I leave.  I just want to see the glasses, you know, kind of the latest tweet.  You know, I had tuna for lunch. How was your sandwich?  You know, right, right on my head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or in my case, it would tell me how many times this person has insulted me on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, this is the troll that said, have you, Jeff?  Like 50 times you could say that I turned into a ninja and.  And we press the K button for you to kick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right.  Last year at CES, I think they somebody had  ski goggles with Google Maps in them, right?  So, you know, we've seen this layer.  L A Y A R has been talking about this for a while.  So, yeah, then then what will happen is that the federal government  will outlaw walking in them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, well, actually, Marshall Kirkpatrick and ReadWriteWeb  speculates at the very end of his article in a future with SOPA,  they could prohibit looking at copyrighted materials through these glasses.  So you don't have the rights to look at that television screen  with those glasses on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And in Germany, you'll walk in the blur certain buildings as you pass by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right. They would because they do that on Google Street View.  So if you're using Google Street View and your glasses to get extra information,  all of a sudden everything gets blurry.  You wander out on the Autobahn and get run down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That building is not in your rights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The building does not exist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had to take off my glasses so I could see. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. Facebook, Google, Apple and Rackspace rated best places to work  among the best places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The latter comes just from from Scoble voting a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, come on. They had they they deduped him, right? Right.  Yes. Yeah.  Just speaking Scoble.  Exactly. Glassdoor does this.  This is an annual thing for them.  This is their fourth annual Employees Choice Choice Awards.  When I worked at CNET, actually, they would let folks know that it was going on.  It wasn't quite a campaign, but they'd send out a company wide email like, hey,  Glassdoor's taking the voting on best places to work.  You might want to go look at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Speaking of which, guys, you all want to vote for us, of course,  in Twig nominated on TV.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, absolutely.  Well, speaking of cheating on polls.  Speaking of voting,  speaking of campaigning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're an army. Do your thing. Go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, just the tech sector 2012 best places to work in technology in this order.  Facebook, MITRE been around for a long time.  Heavy duty back end stuff.  Google, Apple and Rackspace.  Facebook actually slipped from the top spot to number three on the 2012 list.  And Google has moved up to the fifth slot from number 30 on last year's list.  Oh, Larry, Larry, Larry.  And then there's the CEO approval rating.  Everybody fell. Oh, never mind.  Mark Zuckerberg slipped to 89 percent from 96 percent.  I think that's the economy. Right.  It is the economy.  I mean, not just Zuckerberg, but pretty much everybody.  Tim Cook had a 96 percent approval at just one point below  Steve Jobs approval rating last year of 97 percent.  So that's that's not too bad.  Eric Schmidt's 96 percent at the end of last year  compared to Larry Page having a 92 percent. So a little lower.  These these things are, you know, they can they can easily be wrong.  There's no this isn't a scientific poll, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no. Yeah.  And, you know, Cook, let's see how he does next year.  Yeah, I think right now it's like support Tim and Apple.  You know, I want to see what his approval rating is next year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  New Facebook apps out and read, write web, amongst many others,  reporting that appdata.com revealed daily average use on Facebook for Android  surpassed Facebook for iPhone.  Android Facebook app now has 58.8 million daily average users,  while Facebook for iPhone has only 57.6 million daily average users.  Why is that? Is the Facebook app on Android just that much better?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, this is fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'd love to know what Twitter's numbers are like.  Is this about Facebook or it's going to be about the installed base?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's installed. It's 700000 a day.  That's what's happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, is it good? Is it just bulk?  It's bulk. Yeah. Right.  More Android phones out there.  So more people using Facebook.  Makes sense.  All right. Let's take a quick break and thank our other sponsor  for this week in Google Netflix.  Stream thousands of TV episodes and movies.  Directly to you instantly on all kinds of devices.  If you've got a television that's internet connected,  you probably have it as an app right there on the television.  It's also available in all the major game consoles.  Xbox 360, Wii, PS3.  In fact, I read a stat the other day that the Wii has the most video streaming  of all three consoles.  People using it to watch television.  Get it on the Google TV.  I was watching, well, Eileen was watching Gossip Girl over Netflix on...  I have admitted, yes, I'm watching that show.  All kinds of ways to watch all the TV episodes and movies you want  directly to you on your mobile too.  Phone, tablet, all those ways.  And you can get it for free for 30 days.  Netflix.com slash twit.  The perfect cheap out holiday present.  When you've forgotten you're at that holiday party,  someone has gotten you a gift certificate to Red Lobster  and you don't know what to do.  Write down Netflix.com slash twit.  30 days free, hand it to them.  You're in the clear.  Because it works for anybody.  It doesn't matter.  30 days free, unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows.  And we thank Netflix for their support of this week in Google.  Kindle Fire.  Fastest growing tablet since the original iPad.  Doesn't shock me.  Is it surprising to anybody?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't surprise me at all.  I'm seeing lots of friends and family this week  and everyone's gotten a Kindle of some sort.  But the Fire, a lot of people get in Fire.  Yep, yep.  I think it's like the iPad opened up this market  of this small handheld touchscreen computer  and the Fire is affordable.  And there's an update out already apparently.  Yeah, there's a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Facing the lagginess of it, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, update out today.  It does all those things.  It allows you to delete embarrassing things from the carousel too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ah, does it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you can safely visit the Gossip Girl website.  No one need ever know.  Also added features to the Kindle iOS app  on the other tablet.  So you can access all the magazines and newspapers  that you can on the Kindle Fire on iOS.  I think that's interesting that Amazon has created  this very nimble strategy of competing with itself,  which I think ends up getting you more people in the end.  Because you can't say like, oh, well, you know,  that Kindle app on the Fire is much better than the iPad.  It's like use the Kindle, buy our stuff.  And that's really the point is that they are making  hand over fist.  We talked about this on Tech News today yesterday.  They're making a lot of money off of the Kindle Fire,  off of all the Kindles actually, all the versions of it,  more money than ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a very efficient buying machine for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've done great.  I think it's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it good for Android, bad for Android or neutral for Android?  I've never figured that one out.  Since it's so modified.  That's the question, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we've talked about this a few times.  And at first I thought that it was good for Android  because, hey, it's an open source project.  And it's great because this means that Amazon is working on the Android code  and more people are going to know Android and have experience with Android.  But I think that it's kind of to the point where I just think it's neutral.  I think that the fact that it's Android is a complete non-issue for Amazon.  And I guess Google's happy that Amazon's getting it out there.  But yeah, I don't think that it really goes either way.  I think for Amazon, this is just like this is an easy way to deliver  a color touchscreen experience on the Kindle.  But we're just going to make this a really good buying machine.  I don't think that Android really had much to do with it.  I think it's kind of neutral.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the way I feel right now too, Gina.  It's neutral.  It doesn't hurt Android in any way, but it sort of doesn't really give it a help  because I think people think of it as Kindle.  Yeah, exactly. It's a Kindle, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's not a lot that's recognizable as Android on it.  And it's an older version of Android.  And I have this kind of, I'm an open source hippie, right?  So I have this vision that Amazon and Google are going to start working on the Android code together.  That Amazon would be submitting patches.  And in theory, that can certainly happen, right?  I don't know that it has.  I don't know if it will. I hope so.  But, you know, that's cool either way.  I think it's great that you have two companies with the resources they have with engineers working on Android.  I do think that that makes it stronger.  But for the most part, I think it's just neutral because it's such a different version,  because it's been totally Amazonified.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But one thing is there was a report out of Canada this last week that Amazon was interested in buying RIM.  And basically that now puts RIM on the market finally because the value has gone down to nothing.  And that becomes interesting. Does Amazon have its own phones?  And if Google owns Motorola, does Amazon own RIM?  And then does Amazon change OSes?  RIM supposedly turned down the offer, but this is just the start of a process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, apparently RIM turned out a lot of offers.  And Microsoft was also nosing around and they said, no, we don't want to sell.  At least the co-CEOs, Lazaridis and Balsillie, said, no, we don't want to sell.  Amazon kind of has a soft spot for RIM.  I think maybe Bezos looks at it and says, please, please let me buy you.  I like blackberries. I want to save blackberries.  I designed the first Kindle to look like a blackberry.  And they actually did, which is one of the reasons it looks so weird, I think.  But yeah, the Kindle is doing exactly what Amazon wanted.  It's making money off of sales.  It's making money off of selling you things, getting you to buy things from Amazon  through all the different stores that they offer on there.  And I think it's a huge success in a way that doesn't impact not only Android,  but I don't think it impacts any other tablets really.  I know it counts as a tablet, and so it's taking share from the iPad in that way.  But I think there are two different things.  I'm on that side of the argument.  I don't think it's wrong to compare the Fire and the iPad.  But I think what Apple's doing is saying, we want to sell a device,  so we put some content out there to get you to buy the device.  And it's an expensive device, not horribly expensive,  but it's a high-end device, and it's an appliance,  and it's meant to do a lot of things.  And hopefully we can convince you it's good for productivity,  and we can sell some to hospitals and schools and pilots,  and pilots can use it in the cockpit.  Amazon's saying that's not what we want to do.  We want to make a very inexpensive device that gets you to consume media  and buy MP3s and videos and books and even physical objects from us through our store.  Yep.  Yep, I think you're absolutely right.  Are we offended that they seem to be redirecting any request  for the Android Marketplace to the Amazon store?  I think more choice for consumers is better, but it's their device.  But if I just want to look, if I want to go on the web

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and look at the Android Marketplace and just kind of browse around  and see what would be available there, it takes it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's slightly obnoxious.  It redirects me.  You're right, it is obnoxious.  That is kind of obnoxious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I get why the App Store would work, like an App Store link would work that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's usability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's got to be a way to let me buy a device.  I think that's a good point.  Of course, I put Get Jar.  That was the first thing I did when I got my fire.  I put Get Jar on it.  You put Get Jar on it, yeah.  Makes sense.  There's nothing that would be confusing about letting a user look through the Android Market

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  on the web browser.  If they clicked install, their Kindle wouldn't show up in the list of compatible devices,  even if they were signed into Google.  I think it would be pretty confusing.  I think it's a good point.  I didn't realize actually that they were doing that, redirecting just web links to the market.  That's slightly obnoxious, but it is their device.  They're very involved in all the web browsing that happens on the fire.  That is a feature.  That's the Silk Browser.  I think when you buy the Kindle, you're buying the Amazon Experience and the privilege of  buying Amazon products.  Very easily and cheaply.  Apparently, the new update fixes this.  I have yet to get the update and check it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hope it is fixed.  I can't imagine Amazon would really want to be that annoying.  FTC Senators Herb Kohl and Mike Lee have written to Google, or actually, no, not to Google.  They've written about Google to the Federal Trade Commission about Google's market dominance.  They want the FTC to investigate whether Google is abusing their position in the marketplace  to steer users to its own web products.  I put this in here just mainly for one little reason, which was to sigh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We went through this before.  We're still going through it in Europe, right?  They're just being idiots.  When this issue was first raised, I think it was either in 30 years or 40 years, I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it was either in the Texas case or maybe one of the European cases, I absolutely rolled  my eyes and said, look, Google is a website, and you don't have to use it for search so  they can direct you to anything they want legally.  However, there is an argument to be made that search has become so important to using the  web that it may be some sort of quasi-common carrier.  And if that's the case, could they be found to be abusing their market share?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they don't have the market share here that they have in Germany, for example.  Market share here is 60-some percent, Germany is 90-some percent.  There's plenty of other competitors.  And, you know, by that same token, the New York Times has a large market share for national  newspapers and it promotes its own stuff.  So Good Morning America promotes ABC shows.  Really?  Yeah, I know.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Shocking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And honestly, I don't think Google is, I don't know this for sure, but I don't think Google  is purposely redirecting searches to other things.  For instance, when you search on search, this is my favorite example, the top search result  is Bing.  Now, if I mean, no one would blink an eye if the top search result in Google for search  was Google.  But somehow they're not even at the top.  It's Bing, then Dogpile, then Yahoo, then Metasearch, then Google Insights.  I don't see AltaVista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a great example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But yeah, I mean, and granted, they could be saying, oh, well, that's too obvious.  Let's get ourselves out of there.  And maybe they are.  Maybe they're saying, well, you know, if you're in Google looking for search, then you're  obviously not looking for Google because you're there.  That makes more sense to me.  I think search could be considered a utility to some extent, though.  I think it's very dangerous.  I think it's starting to become that important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I disagree.  I think it's also becoming less and less a force.  And what becomes more and more a force is social.  And search is yesterday's war.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think it's always going to have utility.  This idea that we've been saying for years, well, this is going to replace search.  Facebook's going to replace Google or Siri is going to replace Google.  I think those all take a bite out of what we use search for.  But I think there's always a core to what we need search for that will mean a search engine always has to be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think it's abused in any way.  And I think that this is just a couple of senators grandstanding.  So yeah, I agree with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I really don't see any examples of them abusing their position.  And like you say, it's 60 percent.  It's dominant, but it's not massive.  I mean, if you're going to do that, then you need to sue Apple for any trust for dominating the iPad market, which has been proposed.  Don't think it hasn't.  All right.  We kind of touched on why Amazon would be interested in buying RIM.  Yeah, I think we're so we can we can kind of skip past that, although I don't think RIM is going to sell.  I said that before.  And I can't wait to hear what Gina's tip is now.  Yes.  Do you want to talk about the tax cut or should we go into the tips?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that was just a minor note that just said that Obama took to bringing the fight, the tax cut fight to both Twitter and Facebook and started a I think a fair.  So forty dollars.  What does forty dollars mean to you and a forty dollar hashtag?  So some smart social person in there is using these for political ends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is certainly not going to be the first campaign to be fought on social networks, but I think it's it's going to be the most fought, if that makes any sense.  I mean, it's just especially when it gets down to two.  Yeah, it's a it's a given that they're going to be doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely.  They're really smart social media people.  And I think that they know that if they ask a question like that and we're tracking all the responses to those questions that they pose, if you ask a really direct, simple question like that, you get some great, great responses and amusing.  Think up with the White House to capture those responses.  So I mean, yeah, they're they're only going to get better at social media, especially now that the campaign is going to heat up next year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now they need voice response.  That's the new trend.  Yes.  I just speak to a campaign and it gives me answers.  All right, Gina, let's go to your tip.  What do you got for us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right.  I'll do I was going to do a completely fluffy tip.  I'll do two tips.  One is one is actually helpful.  It's Christmas time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course, give us lots of tips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to do a fluffy tip, too.  I just changed my mind.  So do a fluffy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to do a fluffy tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, yeah, well, I'll do something somewhat useful.  If you use Google Voice and you're on iOS, the Google Voice app for iOS just got an update that supports multi recipient texting, which I'm sure that you're going to be wanting to do over the holidays when organizing get togethers.  So it sounds like a little minor thing, but I remember when the Android app got that, I was like, oh, God, finally, I can send a text to multiple people.  So that's that's the actual actually useful tip.  The the fluffy tip is this holiday season when you get your new phone, your fire, your new tablet and one of your family members who doesn't spend as much time on the Web as you do is like, OK, show me something good.  Go to YouTube dot com slash rewind.  And I'm sorry, Jeff and Leo, I'm stealing one of your best of the year stories.  Top 10 most watched videos on YouTube.  All absolute gold.  Number 10 actually is my favorite.  It's a it's a it's a mama kitten hugging her little kitten.  It's amazing.  It's just amazing.  There's a little kitten.  It's YouTube kitten is sleeping and the mom is sleeping.  Little kitten starts to have some bad dreams and shake her shake her little paws.  And it's absolutely adorable.  And then the mama kitten just gives her a big hug.  And you're just like you will your grandmother, your grandfather, your aunts and uncles, they will all melt.  They will just be like, this is amazing.  The Web is the best thing ever.  So top 10 most watched videos.  And we have the video up now.  Look, she's so the kittens having a little bit of a she's dreaming, you know, maybe like and then the mama kitten reaches out and pulls her in.  Look, that is the cutest thing.  Is that not the cutest thing ever?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't like cats and that's cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of course, you're going to find like Rebecca Black Friday and you know, the kind of typical a lot of videos you probably seen already.  But there's some really good gold in there.  So so show your relatives the top 10 videos in YouTube of the year and they'll be completely blown away about all the good stuff on the Internet.  Let's be clear, folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The tip is not that there are cat videos on YouTube.  The tip is to use the cat videos and the other top 10 videos to entertain the family, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To entertain the family and to get them enjoying using their new devices, which will play YouTube on them.  I think it's a great tip.  Yeah, it was a stretch.  It's good to have material.  I had to get that in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, Jeff Jarvis, what is your number, sir?  Two million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Two million dollars is the fine that the Federal Trade Commission has just levied against Santa Claus for violating the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, for collecting their consumer preferences for toys,  for giving that information to third parties without permission, for maintaining a database of naughtiness and niceness, for tying this data to personally identifiable information,  including the name, address and age, for making visits allegedly in the dead of night to these homes.  And he's done it on an unprecedented scale.  And it's time for it to stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree. I can get that.  Where do we sign the petition?  To go get Santa.  To support this.  I'll tell you who's been naughty this year.  The FTC knows.  That's hilarious.  Did you? That's on Buzz Machine.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just wrote that.  You just wrote that up.  That's fantastic.  Cabernet. You can thank the Cabernet. Blame it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, now this is a tool you can use to help fight this menace.  You want to know where this guy is.  If he's coming anywhere near your house, go to noradsanta.org.  This is my tool.  This really is this week in fluff.  You can track him.  There's even a Google Earth layer that you can install on Google Earth that will track in real time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That sounds too legitimate, Tom.  Not fluffy enough.  There's a Google Maps for mobile app that you can install.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  NORAD's been doing this since the 50s.  You know, this started. I covered this on Tech History Today.  This started because NORAD's number was accidentally published in a newspaper in Colorado.  I think it was Colorado.  As the phone number to call and leave a message for Santa.  And so the Colonel in charge of NORAD, it was before it was called NORAD,  but the Colonel in charge at the time said, well, let's start giving them positioning information.  That's what we do.  And that's how it was born.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's great.  Yeah.  It's a tradition.  It's a holiday tradition, NORAD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and plus with this, you know, with this new FTC investigation,  it's important to know where the hell this guy is.  Sorry. All of Germany is blurred out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Germany is investigating his use of Street View.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google Santa View.  Also, last Friday, the Ho Ho Hotline from Santa teamed up with Gmail  to send personalized holiday phone calls to anyone you know who has been nice or naughty in the U.S. and Canada.  So if you get the message at his Google voice number 855-34-Santa, you can try that out.  Go to Send A Call From Santa dot com and you can have Santa call anybody you want.  This is an actual tool.  I mean, this is this is a fun thing.  By the way, people don't have a call me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's going to irritate me immensely.  It's spam.  It's going to just get me very Scroogey.  Okay.  Welcome to the North Pole.  I don't want that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Happy holidays, folks.  He's investigating this guy. Yeah, exactly.  We've got the Festivus Pole set up.  Okay.  Well, should we go out on the frog video?  We'll go out on the background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a follow up to last week's lizard eating Android screen ants video.  All right.  Leo Laporte.  Seven seconds long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo Laporte will be back next week for the year end wrap up this week in Google.  Don't miss it.  Jeff Jarvis, Buzz Machine dot com.  Every tree should have a copy of public parts underneath it this holiday season.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got you got you weren't worried about the third night of Hanukkah.  There you go.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Every menorah, every tree, every Festivus Pole.  Get one.  Put it under there.  And and then while you sit back and sip your cocoa and your eggnog and look at the fireplace over the holidays, go to smarterware.org and sign up for Think Up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, get Think Up.  Archive your tweets and your posts.  Own your data, people.  Exactly.  I actually won't be here next week for the end of so I will see everyone in the new year.  Oh, OK.  Well, I won't be here either.
