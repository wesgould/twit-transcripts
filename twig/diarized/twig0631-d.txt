Transcript:  There's a lot of there's a lot of little things but this is exactly what they were saying why doctors hate these things  These are body scans that you do without any indication that there's a problem just kind of to see if there's anything going on  Is inevitably you find things and then you pester them

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hi

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Anyway

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So  We were talking in fact we talked a lot by the way you were right in great show on Sunday on Twitter  We had Jeff joined two other very as the big kids table. I'm always so happy  It was too big the big kids I was  Completely intimidated. It was really good two professors of journalism Jeff Jarvis and Dan Gilmore from Arizona State University's  Cronkite school  When a guy that I vitalized since I started in tech journalism Stephen Levy who wrote  Packers and many other great books and just wrote a Facebook book and of course was the white male journalism panel  Yes, it was the one you were talking about last time when you were talking about you  Should have had Kara switcher on that would have really added to the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somehow I think she's hard to book, you know, she used to be on Twitter a lot  She's been here a lot. I remember watching. Yeah, that was when that was before. Yeah, it was when she was back with all things D and

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Mm-hmm. We actually she you may think that she canceled us we canceled her cuz her dog pooped in the living room carpet  So yeah, I heard about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So no her living room or your living ours no here the studio she was in the studio. Oh  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kind of dog this Kara Swisher have I forgot what kind of do you remember John was a little dog and you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Not a big deal. I'm just kidding. I mean these things happen. I've pooped on the living room carpet. It's just  No, I the reason  That's why I brought it up because we talked a lot about the Wall Street Journal Facebook files  Long I think it's still going on. I feel like the Wall Street Journal is still publishing articles our conversations to going on  Yeah, it was kind of endless and then  Facebook is gonna be called on the carpet  Actually Congress the Senate has they I believe the whistleblower  They want whistleblower status who revealed the information from the internal Facebook studies to the Wall Street Journal  Facebook of course said well, that's not you know, you're not seeing the whole picture  They we were talking last week on this show about the fact that Instagram  Has in their studies showed that some made some girls who felt bad about themselves feel worse  But then Facebook comes back with an 11 out of 12 metrics girls felt better  So it's that it's one of those and of course they're still not releasing of the 12 day counted  Yeah, it's probably about 30 metrics. I think though the pressure is gonna is starting to  To kind of tell the the head of safety from Facebook is testifying in front of the Senate this week and they say that we will publish  some  Some Nick Clegg was speaking in a public event hosted by the Atlantic  They were released to data the data to Congress before making available to the public  Particularly two internal slide decks talking about how Instagram affects teens mental health  But I think there is one positive side of this Adam Maceri the found the head of face Facebook's Instagram  Instagram said we are gonna pause  the development of an Instagram for kids

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and and and why they ever started that I mean that it's just indicative of  Not reading the room

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, the idea because of course  Coppa  The child online protection and Privacy Act prevents kids companies from gathering data on kids under 13  Which really hampers Facebook?  So in theory if a kids under 13 can't join Instagram or Facebook  So they were gonna make an Instagram kids for kids under 13 which would say one can't argue

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not gonna argue this one could argue that knowing that that's happening  Anyway, it's wiser to create a place that is going to be safer  However, what it looks like instead is exploitation of young people and it's just not smart

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know, I think what Facebook would do is design it so that it doesn't collect data  But that's not the only hazard. Go ahead. I'm sorry, Stacy. Well, no, it's not just well if they design it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So they don't collect data. How can they market to the children and they really want to make money?  I mean there's from a if you are a company like Facebook or even Google  There's no value in marketing to kids because you can't sell their information, which is your core business model

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Which is probably why you don't have Saturday morning cartoons anymore, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do they not exist? I mean, well, you know like Nickelodeon. No, you don't see it anymore

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You don't see him anymore and it's not because of  Coppa but it's because of earlier  Efforts to reduce advertising and children's TV. It's not that you're selling a story data

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just just to be just to be precise here. It's not because they're selling their data  It's they're targeting the advertising to them. It's marketing to them, right and secondarily and hold on second

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Secondarily, I want to make sure this point gets in and the concern of some parents groups  It hooks kids on Facebook at an early age, right?  And that's strategic it's a funnel into adult Facebook and Instagram. That's probably the reason to do it. What's the story is Stacy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, crazy story  Type in why he man rides a big green cat  the answer was back in the 80s when they built cartoons just to market stuff, but the  FTC was like hey guys, you have to have actual content. You can't just make marketing copy for kids  The reason is the toy company that wanted to sell he man stuff Mattel  Mattel had a  Big green cat and they didn't want to pay for a better animal for he man  So they just they were like buddy  Just use this big green cat. It's the best story. There it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Here's the story from Wikipedia while the decision was made for he man to have some sort of vehicle  They no longer had the budget to be able to produce one  The decision was then made to repurpose a tiger from the Big Jim toy line  However, it wasn't the same scale as he man and compared to he man was about the size of a horse  Cleveland however clip Paul Cleveland of vice president of Mattel marketing  Insisted it be used even after artist Tony  Guerrero made a green version in an attempt to discourage Cleveland who instead simply suggested putting a saddle on it  Was resulted in battle cats  final design

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Holy cow, we have always compromised our artistic and whatever principles we have in exchange for  Marketing and selling things at a profit. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, although you one could argue he man was not exactly the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Pinnacle of art. Yeah, fine art. Okay, but you know what he looks like he just stepped out of a German sauna

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a little area

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I  Loved it and every time I see a he man  Ad or whatever it just it it warms my heart  But it also reminds me of my dad yelling at me waiting yell, but he always say I bet he did his push-ups today  Did you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Because you grew up watching this

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When I watched he man and every time my dad knew I was watching it  He would usually reference did you do your push-ups? I'm just glad he man did you didn't adopt the blonde page boy hairstyle

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, that would be no

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, really

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And I loved she wrote oh there she is  He managed she read

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, that's not she read. That's not sure that's some make Eagle way to sorcerer

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  My god, I you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you watch them now you're like, oh my god

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, it's hard to watch now. I guess the point really is that you survived it a whole generation survived it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I did eat a lot of sugary cereals and asked my mom and I had castle grayskull  I had an entire she reset. I mean, but it didn't but it didn't in the long run

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Pollute you do she still eats waffles  Maybe why I have a tail and she didn't kidney. I don't know for all that

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I could blame that on he man

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I probably probably got it from the big gym kidney set and they just didn't want to resize it  Anyway, good news Instagram has it as abandoned its plan to although  Wall Street Journal not to be slowed in their role  Continues with a Facebook file and Facebook's effort to attract preteens goes beyond  Instagram kids documents show  Exploring play dates as a growth lever. Holy cow

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, this is I mean you don't want to think about people I mean I know people market to children  I will say the best thing about Anna's  Donald's doesn't have yeah like because we had Netflix and things she didn't actually watch ads until like she was like  six or seven but like  It's very insidious  like the idea that your children are going to be marketed to  On a platform that also as they grow is going to make them question their self-worth  I mean, it's like you're not doing anything good for the kids actually McDonald's

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I just learned this to my great dismay has abandoned several years ago abandoned Ronald McDonald the clown  Yeah, they did but they didn't do that because they were worried about  Kid being in influencing kids. They did it because they learned that kids were scared of  Clowns

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But no what I was saying that they marketed to kids with those arches

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh and the 10 year we're happy meals, right and the playground and the playground

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And French fries ladies and gentlemen and french fries. Well, no, I like french fries. Yeah, here's the slide

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  from the  tweens competitive audit  source February 2020 Facebook presentation  Why do we care about tweens they are a valuable but untapped audience our ultimate now this again  This slide is in the Wall Street Journal and is claimed to be from a leaker  But you know, we haven't seen the actual Facebook release  Our ultimate goal the slide says is messaging primacy messaging primacy with US teens  Which may also lead to winning with teens  So there you go, that's the funnel right there if we can get prime if we can get primacy and messaging with them when they're young  They will continue using Facebook messenger and whatsapp  MK begins to lose PMF as kids age. You're somebody's gonna have to interpret that for me

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  MK North Korea starts to lose  Our primacy Facebook's gonna kidnap kids from North Korea. That's it. Yeah, I got it. Well MK

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you know Google gets kids for Google classrooms because a lot of classrooms use it right and then in Apple  They usually get Apple devices at a certain income level  So what you get is kids moving between those two platforms and Facebook on the messaging side loses out

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  our primacy declines at 10 and  82% of our users are 10 or younger in some product. I don't know what that is  MK

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's MK something kids? Oh Kevin Kevin says it's mini kidney

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Kevin troll full  MK something kids. It must be something they're doing to kids messenger messenger kids. Oh, they do have a messenger for kids, don't they?  That's what they're talking about. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Speaks Facebook. Oh, wait a minute. I know mr  Raga and said it in the chat as well messenger kids messenger kids

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So it's not just me loses PMF, which is some sort of you know  Primary marketing focus or something as kids age our primacy declines at 10  How depressing and users are 10 82% of users are 10 or younger, but that all they're really saying is we don't get tweens  So how do we get tweens? Here's a 10 year old boy from Detroit quoted on the slide. I don't think I would use it

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's just me. I would have to get my mom's permission to connect with my friends and everyone would make fun of me  That's as if I was riding a big green cat. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Think I had and had puss in my ear. Stop it. Put that mass story back in

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Virtually  Wall Street Journal is is of course  Points out that virtually every major social media platform  Including bite dance limited stick tuck and YouTube is confronted legal or regulatory problems related to how children use its products  And you know everybody wants kids  You know all broadcasting wants kids too because again the habit formed is  valuable

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look at a firm

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is this a situation where Facebook and Instagram are damned if they do or in damned if they don't because  They've already created this monster in their quotes, and they're saying hey, we want to try to fix this  Monster, but at the same time  They're gonna be targeted because they're a monster and say hey well  We don't want you to bring those same habits over to this new product that you're building for our kids  Is it damn if you do damn if you don't for them I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Think you're right aunt, but would have maybe worked six years ago  given present situation  Starting anything for kids is  Just gonna get you attacked and rightfully so yeah, I think so you know the other hand  Leo you're talking about the marketers perspective right if you're a kid you want to watch cartoons you want to go  I love Saturday morning  Yeah, so you know can somebody can somebody somewhere my daughter when when when American Girl  Had a social network that was there was very closely policed  And it was wonderful my daughter was there and then they killed it she was she was just crestfallen  I'm sure it was too expensive for them and the marketing value wasn't there  But but kids do want this and the question is can somebody create something that has parental  Control that that  Doesn't deal with have created this

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Kids like look at Minecraft look at roblox look at board nine look at some

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Star not all kids are gamers

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Played neo-juris. She loved neo pets and that was online probably gathering a lot of information about her  I would I don't know if I would let her do it now knowing what I know  Well because you're paranoid no, yeah, well yeah, yeah  Let's talk about Russia  Actually it all starts with YouTube banning and they announced this this week  any  anti-vaccine  websites including  Robert F Kennedy jr. And yeah, very popular Joseph Mercola. Dr. Mercola is  You know sells his own  Varieties of vitamins and things but doesn't want you to get vaccinated  Both have been knocked off of YouTube  Facebook banned misinformation on vaccines seven months ago, but they still have both Kennedy and Mercola  Twitter both accounts are still active  Dr. Mercola said I shouldn't call him a doctor he's yeah, please yeah, he's not an M.D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's put air quotes around us like it's like Arizona audit. I think he's an osteopath. I think he's an osteopath

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Mercola said he's being censored. Yeah, that's exactly what it's happening and said without presenting evidence that vaccines had killed many people  Kennedy also said he was being censored  There's no instance in history when censorship and secrecy advanced has advanced either democracy or public opinion  Either democracy or public health?  Well, that might be accurate. I don't know. I have to think about that  More than a third of the world's pot, but this isn't censorship in the sense of government censorship. This is just a  Private website declining to allow you to promote your fallacious theories, which seems okay to me  Yeah  We should say vaccines have proven to be overwhelmingly safe and effective and preventing disease  Of all kinds by the way, this isn't kovat vaccines. It's all back to all vaccines  So they're basically trying to do to stop the anti-vax movement

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So so that decision led them to also take down  RT

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Videos, which is Russia today, which is Russian government's news service and in Germany  Show me air quotes again, please news  It's really a propaganda service right? Yes, I was in service. Although I suppose in Russia  They'd say the same about voice of America, but I think it's pretty much a blatant propaganda service  So if YouTube has shut down two German language channels, this is in Germany managed by  RT they were deleted after they published what YouTube called misinformation about kovat 19 and coronavirus  Vaccines to which were the Russians Russia's Communications Ministry  Russ commons or said it sent a letter to Google demanding that all restrictions on YouTube channels  RTDE that's RT Germany and their film the Philander part which means  What the other story?  Operated by Russia media outlet Russia today be lifted as soon as possible and the threat was to fully  Or partially restrict YouTube in Russia or find Google if the channels were not restored  So that's still pending this just happened  Russia has also by the way said Google needs to ban content

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  that we know at the same time we don't like a

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Moscow court  Find alphabet six point five million rubles, which is a mere eighty nine thousand dollars for not deleting content that Russia deems  illegal  remember though both Apple and Google have  deleted during the Russian elections  apps by from the opposition from Navalny  in response to Russian requests  so  you know and part of the problem is that Russia has a law that a lot of it turns out a lot of  totalitarian regimes do this  Requiring these companies have in country representatives employees that they can complain to and threaten to jail  And both Google Twitter Facebook do that. They've responded that way Apple  So that some people say I think that this is part of the reason why Apple and Google are more amenable is they don't  Want these people to be thrown in the gulag?  Russia it's interesting. I don't I don't think Russia  We're not talking China here Google walked away from a billion people in China  Russia is not a huge economic power not a huge market  You could without much harm. I think  Could you not walk away from Russia? I wonder why they don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There are a hundred and forty four point four million people in Russia should you care?  Yeah, it's it's a it's not a huge economy

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, it's I know for a fact especially  you know due to the politics and and  You know their Gazprom their big Russian oil company has been I think is somewhat  sanction under sanction, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or sanctioned because they're just like a kleptocracy for Putin is well because of the  Invasion of Ukraine

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I  Don't know if I Google the value of the Russian economy to Google  So the Russian entire Russian stock market is worth 325 billion dollars Google is worth 340 billion dollars  So in other words Google is worth more than the entire value of the Russian stock market in other words  I think you could

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you could yeah, but I think you could walk away if Google starts leaving it starts doesn't fight

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Starts leaving the countries where it's causing not fighting their cause trouble. Let's be clear. They're not fighting the choice is these are not there lever give up  Right. The only way you could fight is walk away

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well  Yeah, they could find eighty six thousand dollars and just keep going and keep doing the same thing  I guess they could do that they could afford to do that. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In Russia though continuing to piss off the Russian government does not a good strategy pain for your people there. Yeah, it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Not a long-term  Good strategy  anyway, I just I've wondered myself for a while now why Apple and Google just kind of seemed to  Bow down to pressure from the Russian government. I guess I kind of understand from a  Financial point of view why they might do what China asks them to do but Russia's getting more and more

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Aggressive about this stuff, but but they but the consistency is we follow the local laws, right?  So that's where their stock is is except where we don't like them. Yeah, I think so but okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's a hard but so they so taking down the RT in Germany is not against the law

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is probably because that was an activity in Germany was in Germany  So the Russians are also accusing Germany of having had the German government having it

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What if Russia's then says okay, well we're gonna fine you and sanction you  For what you do in Germany. Yeah, which they're threatening to do  Then what then what do you do Google?  You just pay the fine you keep paying the fine or you don't pay the fine at all. Well, they wait wait wait didn't you YouTube?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Turkey  Did YouTube leave Turkey shut down because it refused to go along for a while didn't it? Yeah, I think so  So there is precedent here. Yeah, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Don't know I this all this is above my pay-grant I just thought I'd  Mention those three stories because they're all kind of related  All right, well, I'm gonna take a break and then the really the biggest story today and I know Stacy was paying attention is  Amazon's event in particular  Astro the spy robot we will talk about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was designed to be a security robot that's not I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Follow strangers around your house  I mean a dog would do that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Better not. Yeah. Yeah, my dog would follow you around barking and trying to lick you. It's very confusing

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We know there and then it's more than that they announced more than that  Actually Amazon as usual with these product announcement and unfortunately they don't do us live stream  So I would be thrilled to sit down and you know snark over a live stream, but they don't do that  Yeah with each other we had a lovely

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Lovely time going back and forth so we can share some of that with you coming up

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's like I knew that would be a highlight this week. I said, oh, I can't wait. I know

Transcript:  As soon as I saw I said I know what we're talking about our show today brought to you by a

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Really excellent podcast from red and I love it. The red hat  Likes us enough to say hey, would you tell your audience about our podcast? And I think you would like this  It's called command line heroes that gets you that gives you an idea  It's a epic true tales of developers programmers hackers geeks  open-source rebels who are  Revolutionizing the technology landscape the host of course is the wonderful saranya barak  I was just reading a new book program not a new book a 20th anniversary edition of a  classic programming book called the  pragmatic programmer and saran wrote the forward to it, which I thought was great she  in command line heroes  Tackles a particular question this season. It's the eighth season, which is amazing  And they and it's all about this this season. It's all about robots love them  Perfect timing. What is a robot? Is it a servant? Yes a factory worker. Yes a prosthetic  he could be a vehicle absolutely a  Spy in your house. Well, I guess so. Why do we build robots that look like us?  ever wonder about that and we often ask whether we can trust robots, but  Saran asks an interesting question can robots trust us  Of course robots are the meat of many a science fiction story and we presume in the future  They'll serve our every need will they develop a mind of their own will they turn against us or will they be the savior of humanity?  This is what it's all about season 8 of command line heroes  And it actually talks about the robots that are already in our midst and the determined dreamers who are bringing them to life  eight episodes in season 8  comparing the science fiction  Robot with the reality of robots today. You actually I have a little clip. This is from robots as a  Servant here's a little clip for you

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  While making this season we discovered a robot reality. That's pretty removed from the robots  We imagined and yet all those misguided ideas about what a robot should be  Actually shaped with robots are and no robot fiction shape things more than the story we told ourselves  about robotic servants

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Command line heroes season 8 is out now  It's all about robots an award-winning podcast hosted by saran yabarak produced by redhat  So, you know, it's gonna be good season 8 is out now search for command line heroes on Apple podcasts or anywhere  You listen to podcasts and I will also put a link in the show notes for today's episode of twitter TV slash twig  My thanks to command line heroes  So much for their support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Stacey every every few months Amazon for the last four years. It's been every September. They've invited this is the big one  This is their big device launch. Although this year was way fewer devices than normal and  actually  Fewer infrastructure launches. So I look at this is like a maturation of their strategy with just a few devices  way more services  They're pushing the envelope forward on what they call ambient intelligence what we might think of as the smart home or

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It all kind of follows out screens it follows along with what they've been doing all along there's more echoes. There's more ring  cameras  There's a ring alarm pro system, which takes another Amazon product euro and  incorporates that into the system  I  Think the most was there anything before we get to astro was there anything  Particularly interesting to you and the things they announced

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There were really a couple things one the Amazon glow which was a video conferencing device for kids  Less so on the video conferencing front but more on what they have is a vertically oriented screen  That kids can talk to people with and then it has a projector coming out the front that projects things like games  Whatever so the kids can play with someone on the other like on a place in front of them. Yeah  That's the actual projection

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I know but it's on to some sort of placemat sized thing. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a projection or it's or is it a camera taking an image of to share it. It is a projection of

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  An image and that's actually not on a placemat. What's it on? Well, they're there  Okay, they may have a placemat there, but they showed it also without a place  So you don't have to think the div I think the device inside is actually from Bosch, but I'm not sure I saw this  It goes 2018. It's C. Yes, right  It it was a pico projector  But the cool thing about it is you could actually interact with it, which is different than most projections  So you could actually create a touchscreen with it  It also was really good because when you changed the distance the resolution didn't it didn't change  So yeah, and it was it was actually a really cool device  Anyway, so I was excited about this because we haven't seen  projection in the smart home and  It there's a couple things that are interesting here  We already saw voices being like ooh, we're all so high on voice and then we're like, oh, but we need a display  And now we're looking at a different way to view a display and so I was really keen on

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I like this because a kid is gonna it's a little more like a book  So grandma can be reading and the kids gonna see the projection of the page  in front of her

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Confuse that this is gonna confuse the hell on a grandma

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, grandma's gonna be somewhat literate, right? Yeah, I don't think grandma does it on a tablet  It looked like there's a tablet  That you could use like an echo fire tablet that you would use to

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know what they're using on grandma's end. I really don't they might have it the same device on the other end  It's unclear to me. Okay. Yeah, it looks like she's talking to something like that. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, cuz she's sitting up straight  It's interesting 250 bucks. Here's a video we can we can watch of of the kids running around  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Remember seeing you won't give me Instagram. So give me this Amazon thing. Oh, yeah. See the

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Holding a fire tablet. Yeah, I  Think this is kind of cool. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Think it's cool because I want to make projection mainstream in the heart in the smart home because I think there's so many opportunities  Where you don't need a full display like you could just project something and interact with it  so that's one the other thing that I thought was cool other than the  robot which we'll get to  Oh was okay Amazon killed their care hub app, which was their service for aging in place and they introduced something called Amazon  Was it a lot together? I think it was a lot together and this is a 1999 a month subscription for aging in place  But two neat things here and Jeff you might appreciate this one  Is it gives you the ability to collaborate with someone else like if you have other family members monitoring your parents, maybe  beforehand it was old it was like  Me to my parent but I couldn't invite my brothers and sisters in so you could add more people and then two  It gives you the ability to  Sign your parents or whoever the caregivy is up for things and to help them troubleshoot and add  Contacts and do things so they don't have to do it. I don't know if it gives you the ability to set it up  So like if you're if you gave your father an echo, for example, you could share  Everything that happens on that echo with you have a sister. Yes. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you and your sister could be on this account

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, so that is new and then to like you could add like  Your kids contact information to your dad's echo instead of having him do it you could add like oh  I see so I could take it over Spotify kind of preset it. Yeah, you can take it over and do it good because so just

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They made that's what kids are doing. Yeah, that's that  I mean, we're all trying to do something like that, but but without support from Amazon  So it's good that they build this in I think that's great question. Yeah, Stacey. Yeah, does it does it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Transcribe into text for deaf parents  Does it  I think the echo did my son was looking at Jake was looking into this for just this reason  we find  I'll tell you later about the hell on a spectrum  I know about spectrum

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  God the worst most evil

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Worst most evil  We have a text phone now where it'll transcribe us on the phone, but it'd be great to be able to see each other and have transcription  Earlier echoes did this  Okay, I will ask and find out for you later. Please do. Thank you

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'd be very grateful, but I think everybody who has older parents or older family members is I  Set up an echo show for my mom  so  That for you know, but it was on my account and she reset it because she didn't want to see and it was like no  But mom now you have to set it up  So it need that Apple did this with their watch too  They had it finally you could set up an Apple watch for somebody else a kid or an elder perhaps  Who doesn't have an iPhone but you can set it up and so they get the benefits of that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think this is smart and Stacey is this a different device or is this just a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Same device it's a monthly service the service also has the older care hub stuff  Which is like anytime your parent interacts with the echo you'll get a notice that says so and so played music

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, they're they're alive. That's the question. They're moving around. Yeah, what's the name of the service?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's either a little together or Amazon together hold on okay, okay, that's that's close enough I

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Think it's a like together and because I'm just Alexa together. Yes  I think that sounds interesting. It's an elder care subscription service basically, so there's there's another one  Grandpad it's you sign up early enjoy six months of service for free limited time offer  $20 show the screen, please $20 billed monthly  $199 annually

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it is expensive, but I guess it's much less expensive than the competitor which is grand pad which is a really neat device  Oh, yes, I asked me about that on the radio show that is  How much is here? Oh, it's really yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Have you tried the grand pad because I somebody asked me about that on the radio show no my somebody recommended to my sister

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was thinking about I'm shopping. I think it's overpriced. I think it's overpriced

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So this is yeah, you're right 20 bucks a month is a lot more reasonable. You obviously have to buy an echo

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and they can actually call out and dial either a emergency services through this or they can just like call you  Jeff yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm gonna have my mom call Jeff if there's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Problem is this already available for order the service

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The service it it's not yet out. It says email me when released

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Together what's it together? Thank you

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is a really good idea  It's simpler than the granddad pad or grandpad grandpad

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But so simpler if simpler means fewer ways to screw it up

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, in fact I would say it's more complicated to set up  But it doesn't do as many things as the grandpad does because the grandpad has a button  You know if you want to call the grandkids is a button on it says Ted's a tablet  There's a button on the screen you just press it and you can do  Multi-person zoom calls by just pressing buttons and things like that. This isn't really so this you just shout at it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, hey Jeff  Hey  Although then you get the

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Issues from there's also a professionally staffed  24-7 urgent response team  So yes, that's what I was saying  So if you had an emergency you could call some doesn't have to just be they don't just call Jeff they can call somebody  Actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Most old people like I shouldn't say most old people but many like I know my mom would never call emergency services  She would want to call actually I could picture her just laying there not wanting to trouble someone  But like she would be more likely to tell me than this is phenomenal

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  If you're a loved one allows it you can set a reminder on their phone  for take your pills mom or managing shopping lists

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's this is really a good if they're too old to do a phone we bought  You know one of the simple phones  Android done with big buttons and we didn't even open the box. We just not gonna work

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I bet you could have the echo also say take you you could drop in on them on the echo or the right could be

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Like a right reminder. Yeah, but if you can get them to carry a phone, there's fall detection response. Oh, yeah, I'd love it if we could

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, they're working with Viar. That's really awesome  What's that is Viar is a 60 gigahertz radar company out of Israel and that's a I didn't even see so these are fall

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Detection devices sky angel cares another. Yeah  So if a fall is detected at the echo will ask your loved one if they need help then connect to the urgent response line  And alert emergency contacts. This is you know, you're gonna see more and more of this stuff with the as as as we the boomers age

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you I thought you were gonna say as we incorporate more RF sensing into devices and that

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And as you act poor gen Xers have older and older parents that you need to take care of and the thing is  Are you're not necessarily near and I noticed that's a big component of this  This is this is for me and my mom who's in Rhode Island

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's interesting to ask you at the end. I'm signing up for the notification now. So there's there's five reasons  Why are you interested? So this is what their marketing?  One customized alert notifications for daily activity take your pills Bob  To 24 7 hands free access for your loved one to trained agents just discussed  Three circle of support allows multiple family members to stay in the loop and help provide support  But you touted for I think is important for remote assist allows you to manage device settings  Yeah, pop hit that button doesn't work and then five fall detection with compatible devices called urgent response

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is nice  Okay, a lot of this won't be available till early next year, but yeah, that's good

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's coming to these I think that's really other things they announced. Yeah is a fitbit looking device  It's the hey, that's the next generation halo with a screen. They also announced a $60 thermostat that  is  interesting only because it's cheaper than any other smart thermostat out there and  Amazon's a lot of fun was a big investor in ecobee and I'm like, oh  They also announced the 15-inch echo show this is a big that's big  widgets they did it as a and then as part of that they announced Alexa widgets, which is little like sticky notes calendar weather  I was really excited about this as a potential to like control all of your smart home devices and see like all of your camera feeds  But I don't think it's powerful enough to drive all of that  So I'm kind of sad about that  But you can see like a few things and control a few things the echo show 15 is only 250 bucks

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's really interesting. So it's not much more expensive than the  Countertop normal echo show, but it's a big old screen. You could hang on your wall  It also comes with a stand if you don't want to hang it on your wall. I'm tempted. We love our echo show

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you can even do it in portrait mode

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We love our echo show you can even do it in portrait mode

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, oh, yeah, it looks kind of are you saying something? It's attractive  Are you bottles body shaming?  Amazon Echo show I'm hardware shaming the echo show

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Given that price, I'm not surprised. I mean you're not getting a top-of-the-line

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, yeah, Kevin said it looks like the work from 2019  So we would make your call. Yeah. Yeah, it doesn't work. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Mean the price is very is surprisingly low  Available later this year. This is all part of their new. Is this another day one? This is

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  250 bucks is not day one. This is not you have the the drone camera is one of their day one

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So we talked about this always home cam I thought by now they would have given up on this  This is the camera that flies out of the base to look around your house 250 bucks carrying cats to death  just  So some of the day one stuff is really highly experimental, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, when you sign up for this it asks you things like how tall are your ceilings?  Do you have giant walls of mirrors or glass?  Are there multiple floors in your house?  Are yours?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What the head is that it's coming for me  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  My god, just imagine a Facebook made this oh you can carry it around. Why would you carry? Why? Why would you do that?  Oh, you're teaching at your house

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is so terminated Amazon Amazon put a lot of effort into  This is really important actually  AI some of it local so now they actually have their voice processing chip will do your utterances for a  On the edge so locally on the device. So that's a big deal  Two they announced that you can now teach  Things like from a computer vision perspective from a sound perspective and also your personal like personal habits perspective  And this is important wise actually said they're going to do this as well  Google has this capability but hasn't really focused on doing much with it because I think they were worried about privacy  um, so like you can teach a  What your washing machine sounds like when the chime goes off and then it will notify you that like your wash is done  Which is something people ask me for all the time  You can teach it your face to listen all the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It also apparently has a Seth Rogen mode  Where if Seth Rogen tries to break into your house?  It'll come and chase them away, which I think is

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's pretty cool. I like talking about seriously cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I give up. I think there should be something that chases Seth Rogen away from your stuff. I just that's not Seth Rogen

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, okay. I mistake. I'm mistaken then that is less interesting  um  So would you buy this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Drone  So I signed up for it because i'm very curious about it. It's your job something I would actually buy if it wasn't my job. Yeah

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, you just could add up i'm i'm now a little tempted because  So let's talk about astro the robot. All right, let's get to the wait one more question. Hey ant, would you ever buy it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, because of pets and I know they try to put all of this fail safe

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They could watch your pet though. You could check up on your pet

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but what are you gonna do when you see your pet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, but have y'all met biscuit that dude tries to attack anything that moves. I don't care

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, you definitely don't want to get astro the robot then

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right, so I mean, I know they try to put at least the drone is above the dog. It's not going to be near the dog  But that dog will chase it. He will jump at it. I'm i'm positive it it'll eventually be a mess in my scenario

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We have a video coming up. I just put the rundown later on of a dog. Oh, you're gonna you want us to show the raven video again

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I debated I almost put it in there  But I knew you would say that so I didn't yeah. Yeah. Yeah  I have something I have two videos that are better  better than the rain

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You just wait nervous, all right

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  All right, let's talk about astro, uh the thousand dollar now this one's a little more expensive  Uh the robot which like a lot of look, you know, we had an advertiser  It was actually bosh  That uh was advertising a robot. They never made they gave everybody their money back  Um, there's been a lot of companies making home robots, none of which seem to do much  This is no different. I was gonna say this one doesn't seem too much of anything either  So yeah, this is the astro. Here's a motherboard article in which they talked to some developers  one of whom says  Astro is terrible. Wait a minute. I gotta read you the quote

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It will throw itself down any flight of stairs exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Exactly  Astro is terrible and will almost certainly throw itself down a flight of stairs if presented the opportunity  The person detection is unreliable at best  Making the in-home security proposition laughable  The device feels fragile for something with an absurd cost  The mast has broken on several devices locking itself in the extended or retracted position  And there's no way to ship it to amazon when that happens  Um now now admittedly, this is a guy who did work on it  It's not currently working on it. Maybe the early prototypes weren't as good as the the version they're going to sell etc, etc  Okay, so stacy tell us uh what astro how did amazon pitch astro?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So amazon's big I should tell you the big overarching theme of the presentation was ambient intelligence  They said this phrase like 15 to 20 times throughout the entire hour. It was just everybody that was their their thing  and  The idea here is that your home is becoming smarter  And and we're all for that usually the way amazon's doing its little freaky, but  so  Astro's ambient intelligence is that it can roam around because you have all these devices and they can gather some intelligence  But they're they're physically stuck  so this and the drone are designed to amazon pitched as something that can  Wander around your house and check things out for you

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's kind of like a fire fire tablet on a on a stick extensible stick with wheels  So it's like a tablet on the floor to use it. Well, no, it'll go up. Okay. No, no, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it will roll around your house at one meter per second, which is really fast  Um, and it also has a periscope camera on it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then you look at the keyhole of your bedroom

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, so it's basically like hey, you know, did I leave the the stove on I guess you could walk around  It has a cup holder in the back  It has a cup holder  Yeah, if I were in the kitchen I could send someone drinks and you could say that because it knows people so you could say

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Send andrew this beer  Oh, there it is. It's gonna dock. Okay, it's docking. Um, it can only work on one floor

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They did a lot of effort talking about like hey, it's cute. It reminds me of actually of anki vector  If y'all remember that robot, it's super cute. It sounds not quite as good as the eyes of the anki, but okay  No, but it's it's it sounds a lot like the anki. Um,  And you know, it's  I don't think for a thousand dollars  There is a pressing need for a security perspective  um, I do wonder if with its quote unquote personality and some of the features if  It might become kind of like, you know how ibo really made a lot of lonely people happier by being kind of personable with them  right, I do wonder if this could  Have that role because there is they also talked about it from the aging in place perspective like you could say hey go find grandpa  So if you wanted your dad to take his pills jeff, you could be like go find dad  It goes and rolls up to him and then you say dad take your pills. Yeah  So that's that's  but  It's way too early. I hate that amazon is like  Hey pay a thousand dollars for us. Well, there's early adopters

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There's early adopters in the world who will I mean a lot of people?  Yeah, yeah, are you buying?  This reminds me so much of the bosh robot that we did  Jibo, is that not jibo? I think it was or no, we have a jibo that that was static  Um, oh, yeah name of the bosh

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Robot, I remember you guys having the ipad on a stick that rolled around. Yeah, that actually still exists

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. No, they've gotten better and better. We I gave that to somebody because it was an outdated device because the  What was the name of that sponsor we had gosh, I can't remember anybody remember I can't remember off the top of my head but  Uh, we brought oh mixie

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mikey rockster

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Okay, the fact that there are so many names tells you something this is a product category rockster is their back everybody's trying to get curry  That's it  The curry I gotcha. Yeah  Um, and it was being I went down to see it and uh, it was being developed and the real problem was it with it was  It didn't really do anything  It was it was able to wander around  But it just didn't it didn't do anything and that's the same here

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean this robot will recognize your face theoretically, although it sounds like it has problems with that but I mean  I it's not gonna fold your laundry. It doesn't even vacuum your floors. It's not gonna you know, so  But it will turn your lights off. I'm so sorry y'all

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Being like a surveillance kind of so when gadget says that amazon is turning into a personal security company  Well, if you add all this stuff up is that is that no, I mean that's no amazon has so many things

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's certainly going into that suite a suite of personal security things. Yeah. Well, that's part of a suite

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, what was that phrase they kept saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They kept saying uh  Ambient intelligence computing. Yeah, that's I think more to the point than security. Well

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I wonder remember when the amazon look camera came out and they used that actually to gather so much data about like outfits and fashion  And then they launched their own fashion clothing line  Um, I kind of wonder if this is a way for amazon to get a lot of data  Casual data about what lives in people's homes like I mean  I don't think it's necessarily nefarious exactly  But this is always going to be amazon's problem that my child has this type of backpack  Yeah, I don't think they're doing I have this type of appliances. There's a lot of information the hazard for them

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Would be so great of doing that

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh, I bet I can't hear you. That's what I thought

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  She's turned me off

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay ask again

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I I don't think they're doing that because if they got caught doing that it would be such a problem  But I don't think they need to do that to get value out of this. I think part of the partly what they're trying to do is  Desperately figuring out how this can be of  Use they want to be they think this is going to be the next big thing and I think  Echo has shown that there's a that there is a valuable market and they're just expanding that that's that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Really understanding like it's going to be hard for them in your  Think about it understanding the number of rooms in your house and gathering  I mean they can gather state from smart things because they already know like I robot did that remember they got a lot of trouble

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  For mapping but that's how you have to do it because you can't vacuum. I robot did not share that information with amazon

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They just shared the fact that you have a kitchen right but they shared it with themselves

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So people people are very concerned about this and that's going to really hamper amazon's ability to do these kinds of products  because of the privacy issue

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, and no  I think if they can offer sufficient value  So I have an iRobot that maps my house and I freaking love it and I don't care that they know exactly what my house  Looks like because they do things like say hey  This is by your kitchen counter. Do you want to set up a vacuum?  Here because it's constantly dirty and i'm like  Thank you. Yes, and they're like hey, this looks like it's under your couch. Do you want to vacuum here more often?  I mean those are things like if amazon can deliver you value by like having their  Robot roam around your home and understand like this is the lighting preference that stacey has let me create an automatic routine for her  Those are going to be hugely valuable to people and I think the question is  How do technologists and engineers?  Communicate the value of that data to people and build trust in the consumer  So they're willing to share that data and honestly amazon isn't there yet  I I looked at some of this stuff  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I do like the idea that you mentioned about it  Being a little personable for people that that are lonely because  quite frankly people are spending a thousand dollars for dogs to just

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Follow them around but a dog's an actual living thing as opposed to  Yeah, but they don't do much

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, and they require a lot of effort over there and snores and farts and you know, he  That's why you love them anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think the I think honestly what amazon's doing is really interesting and  Powerful just as I thought sidewalk was really interesting and powerful and I think it's probably  uh  dead on arrival because people  If just imagine if facebook did all this stuff  People would go crazy amazon's almost as bad in people's minds. I think I know a lot of people  Yeah, you don't have any echo shows or echoes in your house, right? Because you don't want echo listening

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, sir. I think you're very I think you all I have is the phone because that's enough listening devices in here  It's just these phones. That's it

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So it's going to be a battle between your thesis stacy, which is that these are valuable enough people overlook the privacy angle

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sure that's what amazon's hoping well amazon's getting better at privacy. So there's a couple things to note here  Amazon is doing a lot for privacy  But you also have to ask yourself amazon is also not a trustworthy company  Even if they're protecting my individual privacy because as a macro level they're using data in ways that hurt people, right?  So there's that's a really subtle distinction that people aren't necessarily making yet  and I don't know if  I don't know if they should I mean I  Ethically, I have a lot of problems with what amazon does so  Am I not part of their smart home ecosystem because I don't want to be complicit in that  Am I complicit in it if I like have a ring doorbell? Yes  Those are hard questions and I don't think many consumers are thinking about them

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the thing they offer some good stuff but at what cost

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And it may be that they're cheap the group they are cheap. I can't believe 250 bucks for this 15 inch  Display  I mean, that's kind of mind-boggling  I think their  Commercial success proves that people aren't as worried that the people in our circles  Are everybody I talk to all of our fans and all of our hosts?  Are terrified but I think normal people probably aren't not all there's one who

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Has no moral panic. So this week I just wish that thing would do more

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know, it's just well if you had an echo, okay  But if you had an echo show you would say that this 15 inch echo show screen this replaces the family bulletin board  I mean, this is really great  Okay, but you won't have one of these in your house, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's got to be an alternative if I just want a family bulletin board  It's less useful though. See this more useful than the bulletin board because the camera says oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's Andrew and then you put up the post-it note that you wrote for Andrew  Watch out for the robot. It's about to steal your shoes  You could put that up there  And uh, I mean I think that that's really cool  Look, they're even selling it this way leave each other's sticking notes update shopping listen to the list  Update shopping listen to the list she or see your shared and individual calendars. This is this is  Clearly to replace the family bulletin board and I think with much more functionality  Yeah, that's cool  I that's cool. I think and for 250 bucks

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think and you can talk to it to make those things happen, right?  Like if you had to go into the app, it would be a no it would be no go  Just saying hey tell Andrew to  You know walk the dog

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, put a sticky note on that starts to sell yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I think this is a that of all of them sounds the most interesting  I don't think I think the robot we're gonna see a lot of companies  Kind of working on making these robots more useful  There's a there's a physicality problem  And maybe only boston dynamics will be able to make a robot that can really get things, you know  Wash your dishes and stuff. I for one look forward in grand. Yeah, minimal dynamics in my house  Yes, but but astro is all part of the  evolution of this  Over time and to get people comfortable. That's what uh, that's what bosh was saying about curry  The whole idea was to get people comfortable this in fact in the ad copy we would say things like  This is your child's first experience of something that they're going to grow up with which is home robots  So give them a good experience, you know, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The the one thing I will say is the toyota robots  I mean so astro is way cuter compared to like toyota's robots for the home which do wash your dishes  But they hang from a gantry on your ceiling and they're just like these giant arms reaching down. I mean, that's terrifying  No, I don't want that. That's not scary at all. So compare this

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is and by the way bosh, uh had a company called mayfield robotics. They were the advertiser  So compare this to what this is four or five years ago  This is five four or five years ago what amazon was doing with astro. This is very  Similar if you ask me down down to the eyes. Remember this we did ads for it  And it didn't and I kept saying well, what does it do? Nothing  It'll play music for you to walk around. I think it's a it's almost identical idea  Uh, do you have audio of curate or of um astro? No, should I get some audio video?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, there probably is audio that you should hear it. It's very it's very anchor vector like

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Okay, what's anchor vector?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anki, sorry anki vector. Oh the anki vector anki those onkeys are really cute

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, so let me play the let me because i've been leaving the audio off. Let me let's let's do the ad with the audio  If you will john

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Astro  This is aunt and queen follow me after he's been brainwashed into getting one at work

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I like the uh  The et music. I mean, this is very intentionally spielbergish music  I like the sound. Yeah  Okay, the sound helps you're right till I heard the sound but you don't want grandma on the floor following you around

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's too weird grandma might like that. I don't think that's weird at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I thought that the screen would grow up in the air  Not the camera only the camera goes up the screen's always at your ankle level

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, the screen would be hard. Yeah. No, I mean that's that's an expensive proposition

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The defeated dog. This is all right. You've replaced me  Yeah  I have to say this very much like curry curry made cute sounds curry talk to you for having given up  This is maybe a little bit closer

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So imagine this plus a little together  Right and you know, you can see where they're going with something like this for of course

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The first thing I asked him is curry gonna throw itself down the stairs and they said no, no, no it has edge detection  It's not gonna it it it doesn't you know  Actually these things have a little bit more difficulty getting over  Uh like bumps in the floor like door door jams and things like that  But I think this has got pretty big wheels that probably could get around. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It has two big wheels and one tiny wheel. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And it goes really fast yeah meter a second is extremely fast  So it does make these sounds which are interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So then now what do you do? All right, so there's a raccoon. Yeah, that's always oh you got a alarm  now

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  All right, as long as we're playing tweets  It's almost as bad as playing tick tock  Here is a seeing eye robot. This looks like it's a boston dynamics, but it's not it's a hybrid robotics

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's turn the sound on on this

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  researchers at uc berkeley's hybrid robotics group  Uh, oh the guy he has a blindfold on this is a quadrupedal robot that works like a guide dog  Oh, that's really interesting. All right. It's like a rumba with legs  All right, we're gonna someone's video is not

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh accessible to the blind which is yeah  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  All right, let us move on to more weighty matters  Uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What did google do what did google do what would what would they do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Uh  Google plans to overturn the eu's five billion dollar antitrust decision on android  Uh  Could get worse, you know if they basically hey, what about apple? Yeah. Yeah  Uh that that could go up so  It's risky while the appeal is underway  Google has had to comply with the decision offering all users of new android phones in the eu a choice screen of alternative search engines  That's not a good experience for anybody. But so far google's market share for search on mobile has remained stable

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have you guys noticed an uptick in improve the cookies clicks lately?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've gotten more than ever. It's just i've gotten used to it because it started two years ago

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I know but it's but it's I think it's gotten worse and

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh  Thank you eu you go in and you tell it to decline all and all of that good stuff. It's yeah, it's annoying

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, I just acceptable. Let's go up. There is a a plugin  I use and unfortunately it only works on macs and on safaris actually it only works on safari on ipad iphone or mac called hush  The entire intent of it is to block  The cookie thing and the and the thing that pops up on stacy's website that says subscribe to my newsletter

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no stacy from the ceiling

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Stacey from the ceiling. Sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It works. Yeah, no, it's fine. I don't care. I just so does hush  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I I have no problems with that  I I get it although I will say  I don't use your data for anything. I don't know send you a newsletter

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The only problem I have with it is I subscribe to your newsletter. So I don't I know what it's so annoying  There's no way to connect the two. I understand so  Uh, you're gonna get it even if you've already subscribed

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, not without being super intrusive on your data, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Because then they'd have to they'd have to know it was me and they'd say oh there you are again  Yeah, okay  We won't show you that see she's honest which by the way  I just want to point out is how those cookie tracker things work, too  If you say I don't want any cookies. What do they do? They set a cookie to tell  The site not to send cookies. So that seems like a bad idea. But okay  Activision also this is going to be the court action section Activision will pay an 18  Million dollar settlement. We talked a lot about this Activision blizzard  Issue and what a boys club it was and what a mess it was  Especially in the world of warcraft division. Well, I think this counts as a slap on the wrist. They  made an agreement with  the feds  um  And paid us eight actually no, it's not with the feds  I'm sorry  The it was with a federal employment agency that filed a civil rights complaint. I guess it is the feds  They're going to pay 18 million dollar settlement  Uh that money will you be used to compensate and make amends to eligible claimants with the remaining funds go to charities that advance women  In the video game industry or promote awareness around harassment and gender equality issues  you know what I guess the main point of this lawsuit would be to get them to change their ways and I  I if as long as it works that way, I guess it doesn't matter what the settlement is  There was it was really bad  There there are other  lawsuits pending  Uh the communications workers of america filed a complaint this month with an lrb  Accusing Activision of violating federal labor law. The sec is also exchanging so they're not out of the woods  But part one of the uh of the problem is over  I like this deep mind  artificial intelligence called deep mind you'd like this too stacy because it uses something like  GAN it's not exactly gan you can explain what it is. It's it's uh, a deep generative network  An ai that's trained to generate new samples of data that are very similar to the real data. It's trained on  Uh, it is now predicting  but one of the hardest  Problems in meteorology is it going to rain in the next hour and a half

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well in seattle, it's just the answer is yes  Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's it's no surprise. This research is being done in the uk where they have a similar problem  Working with the uk's national weather service the met office deep mind has developed a tool  Called dgmr that can accurately predict the likelihood of rain in the next 90 minutes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's awesome dark sky does a pretty darn good job of that. I love that dark sky thing. Yeah  Yeah, but all the google lovers no longer have access to it. I use it on the web. That's all I just I just go to the website

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Apple bought them and shut down the app even on ios. Oh the website. I never thought to do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I just do that. Yeah, that's fun. We're like what the web

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Their website. Yeah, what's that? I used to love that app

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, so they're keeping the website alive. Oh, that's good to know. Shh. Don't tell apple, but you don't you won't get the notifications  Uh that it's about to rain on the website. Will you maybe you will you can look up in the sky and you go to this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To say

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Thank you, yeah, I don't even need a generative adversarial network to do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't need I don't need no artificial intelligence. I got real intelligence  I got eyes. Well, that's a good point put my hand out. Oh no. Yeah. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They've been working on this for several years jeff do you feel guilty input from the met office's expert shape project  Years of labor down the tubes. Oh wait, you could just look at the sky  Oh  Oh  Our friend mike masnick writing on tech dirt  About something called the shop

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Safe act jerry nadler such a good masnick analysis. He was a little sounds so good, but yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  jerry nadler who's who's uh  He says a close friend of the always anti-internet lobbying force that is the legacy  Copyright industry has proposed something called the shop safe act  Which sounds like a good idea to keep counterfeit goods  out of online stores  but apparently  Uh, it has side effects that could put these online stores like ebay out of business forever  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The yeah, yeah all it does is it supports the owners of trademarks and it's the it's the it's the thing equivalent  of  um having to put up uh detectors for for copyright

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Uh, eff says one measure platforms would have to take under the shop safe act is verifying the identity  Address and contact information of any third party seller who uses their services  So you might have to provide a driver's license to craigslist to advertise your garage sale or sell a used bike  I don't think that seems  too much  Uh, but but it would also apply to facebook and of course even email services  If if you sell something using your email  Uh, and this is another one and this is happening in australia now where the liability  Uh  Ends up with not with the seller but with the internet platform  See what happens? Yeah  so in australia  Uh, the platforms are now responsible  for um  Comments

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know in forums or on websites attached. Well, no, no, no, it's not the platform  The publisher is responsible for the comments left on someone else's platform under your article  So if you post whether or not you placed it there right whether or not you placed it there

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So if you have a news article on facebook and somebody comments on it  You're liable for that comment

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Once wants to attack. Oh, I don't know me on a on on on twit  Why did you have that jerk on sunday?  And they put it up there then you put it on  On youtube then youtube become not only youtube is liable but twit is liable

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So cnn's response is  We're going to restrict access to facebook pages in australia. Once again australia without news

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the second time that this kind of regulatory reflex has led to taking away news from australian consumers

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You if you're australian, you will not be able to access cnn's facebook pages. The company said it wants to avoid liability for user comments  Following this australian court ruling

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Facebook says well, no, it's okay. We continue to provide australians a destination for quality journalism through facebook news  And it benefits facebook, right  Um  If you go to line 56 for a moment. All right 56, uh, uh  In australia writes jeff jarvis. Who's the monopoly? I should know it was me  I'm starting to get a feel for it. This is from media week neilson releases data from latest

Transcript:  Where do you get your news? And if anybody says I got it in facebook then oh my god people get the news from facebook  But it doesn't go to the next layer here to say number one  Well, then what did you click on that and go to a news site which will make us happy  Uh, how many places do you go for news? What do you define as news?  So it never it never goes to that next layer to make this actually use because usually when you get news on facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's not facebook giving you the news. It's a link to an outside news source

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In facebook, which is why news sources get so much traffic from facebook  It's like saying I go to google to get my news

Speaker: SPEAKER_10

No, I think uh, it's not a rubens  not a rubens  The results are quite astonishing  Said the scientist who cared that carried out the study the algorithm has returned a 91  Percent probability for the artwork not being authentic. They compared the painting to 148  uncontested proven rubens paintings  And uh, and it just basically said no, that's not even that's not even  I was so shocked said the dr.

It's only a copy of a rubens original that is known to have been painted  Between 1608 and 1609 for his antwerp patron, but then disappeared after his death in 1640  They argued that the national gallery picture is different one that only surfaced in 1929  Declared a rubens by an art expert who after his death in 1960 was found to have misattributed paintings  By giving out certificates of authenticity for commercial gain  Uh-oh critics dismiss the colors of as uncharacteristic of rubens palette the composition is awkward  It differs from two contemporary copies of the original  Okay, so there is there is there was an original but it's been lost forever  um, and this was a

Just something to pay attention to  Uh later, oh, this is cool  They're going to turn on cameras and data feeds  So that you can go online and see what it's doing as it cruises the uk coast through the  Through the winter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  China doesn't like the internet now suddenly. This is my favorite story and then we're going to uh, go to our picks of the week  a teenager on tiktok  I like stories that begin with a teenager on tiktok  Uh has confounded  Social scientists and researchers  The social scientists used a site called prolific  To do surveys  Uh, for instance behavioral lab at stanford mainly uses the prolific platform for online studies  Uh  Where do you get your news? This is from the voyage  No, i'm saying always is like that survey. Well these socials, you know  So  Scientists doing this sort of research in the u.s  Says the verge generally want a pool of subjects who speak english are not too practiced at taking psychological surveys and make up a reasonable  reasonably representative democratic  demographic sample of the american  population all of a sudden  All of a sudden and this is a tweet from one of the researchers at stanford  uh analyzing her  300-person prolific study  Very generic title and description survey questions mostly mostly about social comparisons and money all of a sudden  91 of the respondents were female  Seven percent were male  How does this happen?  Then a member of the stanford behavioral lab posted we've noticed a huge leap in the number of participants in the platform in the u.s  Pool from 40 to 80 000, which is great. However, now a lot of our studies have a gender skew  Maybe 85 women plus the age averaging 21  Wayne state psychologist hannah schecter said wait a minute. This might be far-fetched  but  Have you seen this?  tiktok video

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Welcome to side hustles. I recommend trying part one  This series is going to be all about things that you can do relatively easily to make a little extra money or a lot depending  On how much you do it  I'm going to try my best to do things that you probably haven't already heard of like the basic door dash depop all of that  But I might have thrown a couple basic ones if I think that they're really genuinely a good way to make money  This first one though. I have been doing for a while and it makes me about  $15 a day, which is pretty good and it definitely adds up  The site is called prolific and it's spelled like that and basically it's a bunch of surveys for different amounts of money in different amounts  Of time that earns you money. So today I made  1460 and that's in pounds but it converts to 20 us dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So this video by  sarah  and dom  sarah's side hustles apparently has been seen on tiktok by millions

She's ever posted  It didn't occur to me. It would blow up. It just posted it for my friends and followers  She's paused her own side hustles as she settles in to her freshman year at brown university  I think she has a very promising career. Wow ahead of her brown the power of tiktok  Yeah brown's hard to get into she's good  She's good  She was a florida high school graduate posted it on july 23rd  and  It completely screwed up prolific.co. Whoops  Social media at it again  speaking of tiktok  Sacha nadela was talking to caris swisher at the code conference  She asked him about i'm glad she did. I don't think  You know, I think our good journalists would probably not have brought this up, but she asked him  about the  weird  microsoft  Attempt to buy tiktok  Uh, yeah  Yeah  He said nadela said it was the strangest thing i've ever sort of worked on  He said I was kind of intrigued by it, but I guess the rest is history tiktok came to him  Not the other way around first of all, you've got to remember tiktok came to us  We didn't go to tiktok tiktok was caught in between a lot of issues  They were having across two capitals and they wanted a partner obviously washington dc. I'm not sure where the other one is  Maybe beijing tiktok wanted a security focused cloud computing provider  He added but I was pretty intrigued and let's say it's a great property, obviously  Unfortunately  Nadela continued microsoft was effectively turned off of any potential deal by the particular perspective of the trump administration  President trump, I think he had sort of a particular point of view on what he was trying to get done there  Nadela said then just dropped off  It was interesting. There was a period of time. I felt that the u.s. Government had some particular set of requirements and then  They just disappeared  Uh  So now we know uh  And I think we suspected this tiktok by the way has now a billion users  one billion, uh active users  This is amazing, right? Yeah  This is according to the company itself  Monthly active users which and its its growth has happened in five years  Compared to similar growth that took eight years with facebook eight years with youtube and whatsapp  It's a very fast  growing  And it is now  As we mentioned a couple of weeks ago  Engaged the most engaging social media beating youtube and time spent viewing  Okay  Anything else did I leave anything out jeff or stacy or aunt that you wanted to talk about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'll show you the one that only got a quarter of a million views that'll that'll turn you off french fries  And a chicken hero  Well, that'll still climb though  Yeah, he actually this is you know, I didn't I know why I didn't this one is an ad  For danos spice seasonings or something  They're paying him to put their seasoning in them and I think tiktok saw that because it went from 4.6 million  16.7 13.7. These are the adjacent videos 9.9 million  Quarter of a million right in the middle because I think because it hadn't added I think tiktok did he did he?  um  Hashtag yeah hashtag  Uh, I think at the bottom it says hashtag danos partnership  Not  I think they don't want them to do ads  They don't say anything against it  But that's the only explanation I can there was just a story

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In the wall street channel about tiktok and ads, I think they do ads, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But you don't the problem with the ads is they're not attached to your video like youtube ads are they're  Interstitial so they don't really share the revenue with you. They have a creator's fund  You can make some money from that but it's not tied to the ad revenue  So but they don't say you can't have ads in your tiktoks. Lots of people do  But I notice I mean that's an interesting trend  All of a sudden  Phew no views  I mean could be I mean it was pretty subtle. I don't think it was because there was an ad in it  It was it was just you know, he showed the stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, well, I don't know makes you wonder maybe because you shouldn't put french fries in heroes. I think might be that  I think it might be I think it might actually just been nobody wanted to eat that

This is actually a larger processor than the traditional sp 32  But with the risk five you can do some machine learning stuff on it. That's pretty cool. So  I just threw this out there because it's  It hasn't been in stock. It's fairly new  And I just saw it in person and it is like so tiny and so cool and  I don't know. Anyway, that's it. That's me. That's a good thing
