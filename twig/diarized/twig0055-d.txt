Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wave?  Wave?  Wave?  I don't know.  Also with us, as you've probably heard, Jeff Jarvis.  He is the author of What Would Google Do?  and Google is still in business so the book is still available.  For now.  For now.  I think Google will last.  But there is a copy of it.  What Would Google Do?  I keep it by my side at all times.  It's a book for all business people.  What would Google do in this situation?  That's a question I ask myself all the time.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm afraid we're asking this week.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This week we have a very, very big question.  Joining us to help us with the discussion.  I can't show her because she's on the phone.  Because her power is out in Austin.  Stacey Higginbottom of GigaOM.com.  Stacey, thank you for joining us.

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Thank you for having me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Nice to have you here.  Stacey wrote a very good article talking about your blog post,  Internet Schmitternet, Mr. Jarvis.  Stacey, would you summarize what happened this week between Google and Verizon?  Sure.

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Together the two of them came to a compromise agreement over net neutrality.  Net neutrality has been an issue for almost five years.  And last year in September the FCC had opened up a whole proceeding  kind of trying to establish regulations for net neutrality.  And they kind of got bogged down.  And so Google and Verizon, they'd been working together for a while  on this since the proceedings were open.  And on Monday they just launched with basically this is how we see net neutrality.  We think it should work.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, except that everybody in the world went, what?  In fact, some people even said this was a sure sign that Google is evil.  Somebody called them surrender monkeys on the wire.  Wire did, yeah.

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Area humping surrender monkeys.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Okay, let's get it all out.

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  That was wired. It was awesome.  Yeah, it was.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  A lot of anger about this. Google said, well, what was Google's response to the criticism?

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  I haven't heard it yet.  No, their response, the only response we've had from Google and Verizon  other than the editorial in the Washington Post was the press conference on Monday.  And both Eric Schmidt and Ivan Seidenberg were terrible on the press conference.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Eric is very bad at this stuff.  He has consistently proven that he does not know how to spin.

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Which is maybe that's a good virtue actually.  So Google's position was kind of, in my understanding was,  well, look, it's not everything we would want,  but we wanted to take this opportunity to at least get some rules about net neutrality.  Essentially what it sounds to me, and correct me if I'm wrong,  and Jeff and Gina, please weigh in on this,  but it sounds to me what the Google Verizon pact did is say,  yeah, there'll be net neutrality for everybody except wireless carriers.  And wireless carriers like Verizon and AT&T who recently weighed in with,  yeah, we agree, wireless carriers should be allowed to do basically anything they want,  including tier, differentiate services, charge more for some, less for others,  essentially completely abrogate any idea of net neutrality,  and build in effect what some critics have called a dual internet, a public internet,  and then a private telecom-based network for value-added services.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Just the fact that we're using the term public internet makes me want to kind of stab myself in the eye.  Yeah, it really does.  Because that implies that there's another internet, which is exactly what Jeff wrote about, right?  There's a couple of internets, right?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I mean, it's that, yes, you have this old dog internet showing you cat videos on YouTube,  but oh, you're not in your house right now?  Oh, that's not the internet I said in my post, that's the Schmitternet as an internet Schmitternet, right?  And so, oh, it's a new service.  It's an education service that didn't exist before.  Oh, sorry, sir, that's the Schmitternet.  And on the Schmitternet, we'll take you through all of our new fees and restrictions and regulations.  Please hold.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, let me be the devil's advocate here.  And there's some precedent for stuff like this in the early days of cable, for instance, cable internet.  The FCC gave cable companies a lot of concessions, for instance, the power of monopoly saying,  in order to justify the cost of building this out, we believe the internet is important,  we're going to give you some concessions here.  Isn't that what's going on?  It's clear that anybody who's using an iPhone understands that when it comes to wireless internet,  it's a different beast.  And so doesn't it make sense?  Well, yes and no.  One thing is something else is doing that now.  Sorry, Stacey, go ahead.

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Go ahead, Stacey, and then we'll go to Jeff.  No, no, I was just going to say, so the wireless stuff, I will 100% agree that you cannot have the same exact network management practices for wireless.  It's clear. Yeah, I mean, there's just not enough bandwidth.  They're not going to work.  The way that they've phrased this, instead of fighting for as much as one could hope for in terms of getting some kind of reasonable network management  and coming up with some ways to define that for wireless, that may be different from wired,  Google and Verizon have hijacked the whole process, taking it outside of the realm of the FCC.  Yes.  The only thing that's likely is Congress is going to listen to this and say, oh, yeah, and that's because he's already in a position right now where Congress is looking  at scant at it and saying, whoa, there, you don't want to regulate the internet.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right.  Right. Yeah, I think that's exactly right, Stacey.  I think that the problem here is that this was not the FCC or the government giving concessions.  This was the companies asking for their own concessions and saying this is their ideal.  And, you know, you have Google, which only a year ago was pushing for the white spaces around broadcast to be freed from regulations so that they could become  quote Wi-Fi on steroids, in their words, and could provide competition to the wireless providers.  And, you know, the whole idea of mobile and wireless becomes an oxymoron, becomes ridiculous, becomes meaningless.  So I walk with my iPad, which I don't have, but imagine I did.  I walk with my iPad from my home when it's on Wi-Fi.  I walk outside, it goes to cellular.  Oh, sorry, you've just gone to the Schminternet.  Now you can't get this and this and this.  Now you have to pay for this and this and that.  And if that wireless so-called, that mobile so-called came from some new provider like white spaces, like, you know, new technologies, where does that go?  The Internet is the Internet is the Internet, damn it.  And if we end up with multiple Internets, that sucks.  What Stacey's really quite right about is the problem is these guys, I still don't understand why Google did this.  I do not get why Google did this.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It feels like capitulation.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It really does.  And the problem is that these guys negotiated the future of the Internet without the owners of the Internet sitting there.  And the owners of the Internet are us, damn it.  And we've got to yell and scream and have a fit because the Internet is not Google's.  It's not Verizon's.  It's not the FCC's.  It's ours.  And I hate to plug this old post that nobody cares about.  But this is why I wrote this bill of rights in cyberspace.  Love this post.  Because if we the people don't stand up on principle and say, butt out, ass swipes, get out of here.  This is not yours.  This is ours.  Yeah, we pay for the broadcast.  What we want is more competition, more choices, more openness, more development, more people on the Internet.  And if we start doing this, it's going to clamp down on this.  It's going to clamp down on our economy as well.  Sorry, end of speech.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Axel Librius in our chat room quotes a past Google statement that says, there's no network problem allegedly solved by prioritization that cannot also be solved by additional bandwidth.  Google in the past has said, just throw more bandwidth at it.  Now, I guess that you still haven't answered my devil's advocate question, which is because of the bandwidth constrained nature of wireless telecommunications, is it not unreasonable to say it should be treated differently than land?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  By that logic, then shouldn't fiber to the house be treated differently from copper?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because it's more capable.  All right, go ahead, Stacey.

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Well, I was going to say carriers can treat it differently in a way that's perhaps competitive.  So things like congestion pricing.  And I know people hate when I mean people hate cured pricing.  Right.  I'm against it as a principle.  But if you're worried about congestion on your network, don't limit people to, you know, five gigabits or gigabytes per month.  Just charge them more.  Charge them more for it.  Charge them more during times when you're experiencing usage, recognize the fact and tell consumers about the fact that if for some instance like a hurricane hits, yeah, their video, their YouTube streams are going to be, you know, be prioritized below voice calls.  That makes sense.  That's interesting.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I had never heard of that before, Stacey.  Is that a solution that people have been proposing?

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  That's what I mean.  Eric Schmidt will talk about that.  I mean, when he was at the thing in Tahoe last week, he talked about, you know, figuring out how to prioritize traffic and he made it sound like what Verizon and they were agreeing to was something like that.  And the carriers will also say that that's kind of their friendly face of this.  But there's no rules in place for that.  And it's hard to write those rules into legislation without them being kind of subverted later on.  And that's why this is such a contentious issue.  I don't know if you guys want nuance or not, but that's.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We do want nuance.  We're absolutely that's that's kind of what the show is about.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We feed on nuance.  Nuance is our middle name.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And I think that that's to me, you know, what you're going to see is a very and we already have seen is very black and white.  I'm again, or I don't know if anybody was in favor of what Google and Verizon have done, but presumably somebody is AT&T anyway.  But I think there is more than just the yes or no to it.  There is. That's what I'm trying to get at.  It seems like there's there's some rationalization for giving at least at least temporarily.  And maybe that's the mistake here that this doesn't sound like a temporary measure, but temporarily giving wireless companies a little pass.

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  No, I think there's a there's a place for doing real case by case adjudication.  That's probably the wrong word at the FCC for net neutrality kind of rules.  The problem is right now the FCC doesn't actually unclear if they have the authority actually enforce any of that, which is what this whole process is designed to do.  So. Implementing some kind of network neutrality in talking about reasonable network management on wireless networks by saying that you at least get something down.  And then when cases come up, the FCC actually has the ability to go in, you know, say, hey, carrier, don't do this.  Right now, that that doesn't exist.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yes, Stacey, isn't that part of that is that is that the FCC, of course, as of right now, does not have authority over this.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, there's some question about it after the Comcast reversal.  Although I've talked to a number of offline conversations with people who say, well, you can't interpret the Comcast reversal too broadly.  The court didn't say the FCC doesn't have the right to do it.  They just said it wasn't doing it correctly in this case.  So it's very unclear. It's very unclear what what the FCC's mandate is.  And of course, he's trying.  Do you want to know? Yes, I would love to know.  What does the FCC think of this?  This they I guess they'd be another group that's against this because it's it's undermining their authority.

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  So my sources at the FCC are they're staying silent on it.  They don't want to comment basically on this because it's something that they they feel like talking about it condones this as a legitimate solution.  They don't want to legitimize it at all.  But there is a clear power vacuum.  There's a clear lack of leadership from the FCC right now because of the whole reclassification debate,  which is what you're talking about after Comcast, where they're trying to figure that out.  And net neutrality is actually tied to that because if they don't have the authority to like legislate net truth or regulate broadband,  they can't implement net neutrality.  So they're really closely tied in the FCC is trying to work this from all angles.  And I personally think it's failing miserably.  And that's that gave Verizon and Google the ability to step up and propose this and get so much traction.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, Google says that this is really they're they're proposing a blueprint for legislation.  It sure would be nice if Julius Genachowski or somebody you you know,  you know somebody at the FCC, Gina, you were you were talking about if somebody stood up and said, hey, wait a minute.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  This is what there was.  There was a comment. There was an official comment by Michael J.  Kops. He said some will claim this announcement moves the discussion forward.  That's one of its many problems.  It's time to move a decision forward, the decision to reassert FCC authority over broadband telecommunications to guarantee an open Internet now and forever.  Yes, this is my favorite part.  And to put the interests of consumers in front of the interests of giant corporations.  Yes, that was the most heartening response I could have possibly.  I mean, I like just one of five commissioners.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  He's sorry. He's just one of five commissioners.  And so Kops is coming out strongly.  So you at least now see some discussion, some fighting.  I just saw on the friend feed, Susan Crawford, the brilliant Susan Crawford wrote a post this morning basically telling the FCC to grow a pair.  Yeah.  And I think that's the point.  I think I think, Stacey, you're right.  There's a vacuum.  I think, Gina, you're absolutely right that what Kops says is what they should all be doing.  But the problem is he's basically protesting against the FCC from inside the FCC.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, there's a long history of that, by the way, of division among FCC commissioners.  That's not at all unusual.  I'd like to know where Genachowski stands on this, because he's the one needs to take a leadership role here.  And he's been very outspoken for Internet neutrality.  I think he had a lot to do with the broadband plan that the FCC put forward.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  He did have, when the New York Times had that story on Monday saying that they had reached a deal and presented it somewhat differently than this,  Genachowski did say that basically he was pissed about this and that there would be no more meetings under their aegis.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's right. They did call off the conferences. That's right.  Stacey, go ahead.

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Well, those conferences weren't going anywhere.  And so Genachowski called those off because they weren't making progress.  So once this whole thing became public, he knew he was going to fail.  You might as well just fail without being castigated for having all these secret meetings, which is what was happening.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So instead, we've got this backroom deal between two major corporations with what we thought were different interests, but apparently are maybe not so different.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, it's not really a deal. I mean, it's not policy, right? I mean, Verizon and Google don't create policy.  It's proposed policy.  It's a proposal. It's a proposal. And also, let me just say, the wireless thing broke my heart, but the rest of the document is great.  Like I'm with them the whole way.  The new services part, Gina?  No, the wireless part.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Okay. What is the new services part? Let's hear that story. Jeff, what is the new services part?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Maybe Stacey's probably a better position to say it, but it's another carve out.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Stacey?

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yeah. There are three big, I mean, there are three problems. One, emasculate the FCC. Actually, one would be wireless, but we've talked about that.  Right.  And then there's a carve out for managed services. They don't call it that. They call it, oh, additional network services.  And that's things like U-verse or FiOS TV or anything that the carrier and the FCC has been all the way back in October and September was worried about this because it's a way to say, in the worst case scenario, I have, you know, this may not happen.  I may be crazy, but to say we're going to develop our broadband infrastructure and we're going to allocate X amount of it to our advanced network services, which cost extra, which, you know, you may have to pay as a consumer.  And if you want to get on it as a service, like a web service, maybe you have to pay. Maybe you don't. We're not sure.  And then what happens is you've got this like public ghetto.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, but what's wrong with that? If Verizon has a vCast service that lets you watch broadcast television, what's wrong with them saying that?  That's fine.  This is a private service.  But here's the problem, Liam.  Okay.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's a big open door. It's a hanger door sized exception because it says, the example they give is that if an opera wanted to broadcast in 3D and it used a lot of bandwidth, that's new and then that's outside of net neutrality.  Well, so anything new is the Schminner net.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. And that's definitely a problem.  So the EFED makes a really good point.  Go ahead, Gina.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm sorry. I didn't mean to cut off Stacey.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I was going to say, you know, the additional online services is very vague, vaguely defined, right?  We don't really know what that is.  I mean, they're trying to future proof.  They're trying to say, you know, new things are going to come out.  We don't want to squash innovation.  We want those new things to happen.  We don't know what they're going to be, but we're just going to call them additional online services.  That's troubling.  Also, the definition of reasonable network management.  You guys all seem to agree like, oh, yeah, mobile networks are different.  I mean, yes, they're technically different, but are they really different?  Like, what is reasonable network management?  What does that mean exactly?  Like, I felt like the-  It could be as much as blocking YouTube over wireless.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  So network, I mean, like wireless networks, like the constraints that they are under,  I mean, you've got a certain amount of spectrum, right?  And you have a certain amount of bandwidth that fits into each megahertz of spectrum.  And the issue is if you're, you send that to towers and people are rooting in and out,  it's actually really complicated to keep track of.  And so there's the limited amount of spectrum, right,  which kind of limits the capacity at any one place and point in time.  And then there's also the issue of tracking these users as they're trying to like stream,  which is really hard and like intensive over the wireless network.  While other people are trying to do like voice calls.  And, you know, maybe we shouldn't be prioritizing voice calls.  And in all, in like a 4G network, we won't have to because they're all IP.  Right.  I don't know.  We know from-  There are issues with that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We know from the Wired article, or we, at least the Wired article asserted, for instance,  that AT&T wanted to, or did propose to Apple that YouTube videos stop after 10 seconds on the iPhone  because it was killing their network.  That's, I'm sure, the exact kind of thing that these wireless carriers would like to see.  Is that a violation of net neutrality or is it just a reasonable statement  that we just don't have the capacity yet?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's a really good reason for AT&T not to build up their capacity.  Every single network has limitations.  And the fact is that you have to build up your infrastructure.  The demand is there.  Yes, I appreciate the technical limitations of the mobile network, but figure it out.  It's a technical problem.  We can figure it out.  You know, I don't know.  It's the same thing like Jeff said earlier.  Why treat Internet over copper differently than broadband?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Isn't some of this because we've seen how anti-competitive the wireless companies are in the past?  I think that's it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And Google says, Google acted as if, well, wireless is different because there is competition there.  No, there's not.  There's no competition there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The other way around.  Yeah, it's the other way around.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Exactly.  Let me try it this way, Alio.  Just three steps.  Step one is that imagine if this document came not from Google and Verizon, but from Verizon and AT&T.  Oh, boy.  Three.  We would not probably be very surprised at all.  There'd be no discussion.  A few moves, a few inches.  Right.  Well, but they do a few things.  They make a few concessions.  OK, we see what they're negotiating.  Right?  That's step one.  Step two is what shocks us so much that Google's involved in this.  And I want to come back to that.  And I don't fully understand why.  I think Wired came to the closest to say, well, because Google is now a phone company.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They're a carrier humping net neutrality surrender monkey.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So that's where Google shot.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's why this is so heartbreaking.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, by the way, this isn't the only...  This might be the week we say Google suddenly stopped not being evil.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Stopped not being evil.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because there's also this document and there's Eric Schmidt going around.  Eric Schmidt says the future of the web is no anonymity.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right.  Let me try one more step on this.  One more step.  Which is that if someone were speaking on behalf of the Internet of what we used to call consumers,  sorry, Doc Searles, then how would any policy be written?  Now, to answer Gina's question about mobile or agree with Gina, the answer would be,  if you say you deliver the Internet, you deliver the Internet.  Damn it.  Period.  And we have standards for what it means to deliver the Internet.  And delivering crappy Internet is something consumers can sue for.  Because if I tell you I give you milk, I really give you is water with chalk in it,  you can be sued.  You give me an Internet that's not really the Internet, F you!  So this is good.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So what it really comes down to, and this is what you've been saying,  it's what is the definition of the Internet?  Right.  And who decides that?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We do!  But we're not doing it, people.  We're not setting up and making these principles.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's letting these big companies decide what the Internet is,  and it's not what we've all said it is.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Here, Leo, I got an idea.  Just now.  Coming out before your very eyes.  The tweet twig community should deliver their principles of the Internet.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think you did it, Jeff.  You have that great Bill of Rights.  I would point people to the Bill of Rights.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Now, the Strait Heart version, it'll be geekier in this case than just big principles,  but we should say what we expect the FCC and Google and Verizon to do.  Because no one's saying that.  Wait, when you do it, can you file a comment?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You can. I'm sure you can.  And I don't know if you'd file with the FCC, but you could also...

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  No, no, you have to file with the FCC.  That's what I'm saying.  They have a proceeding open and want comments.  Great!  Where do we do that?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, God.

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  We'll find it. I'll find it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The other thing is the EFF has gotten involved in this,  and I think the EFF might be the people that we need to look to  to try to defend us in this regard.  Leo, I didn't mean to walk over your statement,

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  because I think there's two big things we're talking about there.  One is what the proper view of what the Internet is, and how we do that.  But the other one is, this being Twig, Google.  And I, as Google fanboy, just really can't figure it out.  I think that they're going to hurt themselves.  I don't get the strategy. What did they gain?  You know, again, if Verizon...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They said they realized that they'd have to give some concessions up  in order to get some other good things.  And so they gave this part...  By the way, it's not theirs to give up, but...  What? Right.  But they said, we're going to give up on these items.  By the way, the EFF says there's also another troubling,  as long as we're going to get into this,  there's also another troubling part of the proposal  that says it applies only to lawful Internet content.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yes, that's scary too.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And who would... Is copyrighted material...  Well, it sounds like distribution of copyrighted material  by somebody other than the copyright holder is unlawful.  And then that, the EFF says, opens the door  to an entertainment industry and law enforcement efforts  that could hinder free speech and innovation.  Of course it would. They want to do this desperately.

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  They're already talking... I mean, they're already commenting  on the net neutrality proceedings at the FCC talking about...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So you've got this axis of evil,  which I'm sad to say that Google has joined,  between the big content companies, the big carriers,  the wireless carriers, now Google's involved,  and the feds, of course, the Congress is just going to say,  well, hey, if Google says it's a good thing  and Verizon says it's a good thing...  Actually, I'm sure they...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  One of the Twitterists just sent me that a resolution was just put in  in the House commending Google and other companies  for advocating uncensored Internet, adhering to free speech principles  and keeping the Internet open for users worldwide  from Representative Carolyn McCarthy, July 13, 2010.  Oh, well.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And the truth is a lie, and black is white, peace is war.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I just don't get it.  So, Leo, you just said Google got things. What did they get?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I don't know. I mean, I guess they got...  On the land-based Internet, they got a concession of net neutrality.  Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Old steam-powered Internet.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Of course, everything's moving mobile.  So I guess that's what they said.  Well, hey, at least we were able to get some rules made for net neutrality  on the ones...  Why Google is not fighting for net neutrality globally is beyond me.  And this is one of the reasons we've given Google a pass for so long  is because it was always my understanding  that Google made its money by the free flow of the Internet.  And for them to say, no, yeah, okay,  but when it comes to wireless services, maybe that's not the best thing.  What, are they getting a cut?

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Well, yes, they are.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I mean, in the sense they're now in the phone business.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They're in the phone business.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They're in the phone business.  Part of this deal, too, is giving up the Nexus One.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's all part of the same thing.  They had an opportunity to say, we're going to forward things along  by creating a carrier-less handset with an open-source operating system.  We're going to support the Open Handset Alliance.  We are going to break the monopoly of the cell phone companies in the US.  And instead, they said, maybe that wasn't such a good idea.  We make so much money with Motorola and HTC  making these handsets for Verizon and AT&T.  Maybe we just go along with that.  Wow, 100,000 handsets a day.  That's a lot of handsets.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's really difficult not to go down that road, even for someone like me.  I mean, basically what they're saying is, you're good.  Your typewriter is going to work for the next five years.  There's that.

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  It doesn't affect them anymore.  Just thinking, Google is a corporation.  They're out there to make money.  And frankly, they have the infrastructure built up  that they don't have to worry about wired net neutrality.  They have CDN-like services.  They have the demand on the consumer side.  So maybe they thought, heck, we just bought wired net neutrality for everybody.  But wireless, it's too much for us.  And frankly, we can go it alone because we're here.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, but Stacey, Eric Schmidt has said that they're going to make more money from mobile  than they make from the internet today.  This matters greatly to them.  He said that in the past.  He said that a year ago to Jim Cramer.  And so mobile matters.  The thing is, if you get a whole balkanized internet of a bunch of internets, that hurts Google.  They can't search across it.  They can't place ads across it.  They can't get data across it.  So that's why I don't understand is that for Google's worldview and way of operating,  a balkanized internet, I think, is bad for them.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, yeah, you would think it's bad for everybody except for Ryzen and AT&T and Comcast.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Are we taking it too far, though?  Is it really going to be a balkanized internet?  So, OK, so maybe this is going to happen.  Maybe this becomes policy.  And we all have a choice of wireless providers.  And some of them let you stream, get your 3D television or whatever, do those social services.  And some of them don't.  And it forces better, more competition.  It forces more carriers to build up their infrastructure, to be more competitive.  Maybe it'll be a good thing.  So here's the issue, right?

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  We have very little competition in wired internet.  And that has brought us to a point where some people have fiber and some people, like,  they barely have broadband, right?  And they pay a lot for it.  And then on the mobile side, the FCC, if you look at their broadband,  and they're really trying hard to address all the areas that don't have sufficient  broadband competition with mobile, they're really like banking, they're banking on that.  So if we go to a place where people in like four years are reliant on Verizon's LTE network  to get their internet, basically, their own internet, no wired,  then suddenly they're stuck on an internet where maybe they only get 10 seconds of YouTube.  And that's a problem.  Bingo. That's the problem.  AT&T and Verizon have been buying up Spectrum,  and they own a huge chunk of the 7 MHz Spectrum that the LTE,  the next generation of wireless is going to go over.  And they're actually doing a lot of things right now, like policy-wise,  to make sure other people have a harder time competing with that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Really? Like, Stacey, say a little more about that.  What's happening in the future?

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  So they filed petitions with the FCC to make, to claim like interference  in certain channels of the 700 MHz section near where rural carriers have their own 700 MHz stake.  If they get that through, that lessens the incentive for someone like Qualcomm or a chip maker  to make chips that work across the Spectrum,  and instead those guys will choose to work with AT&T and Verizon  because they have a huge customer base leaving the rural guys with like handsets and devices that could cost a lot more.  So that's like one example.  So we're back in the GSM versus CDMA.  Well, no, you're really, I mean, it still might be all LTE,  but it depends on like what frequencies you're tuning to and how many you want to tune to.  I mean, these are really nitty-gritty, but Verizon and AT&T have really awesome lawyers who like really work the stuff.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They have the best Congress money can buy.  I mean, Google, I don't know how much Google spends on congressmen.  I don't think they spend much, but Verizon spends an awful lot.

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Well, and they have these workers.  They have unionized workers who vote like they're supposed to across a bunch of different congressional districts.  Silicon Valley has Silicon Valley.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.  You point out in one of your articles on GigaOM that in effect this sold tech companies out,  companies like Pandora and Skype are the companies that lose here.

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because they're the ones that end up being blocked on these wireless networks because they use so much bandwidth.

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Or they could be blocked or they could have to deal with carriers.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They'll have to do deals with carriers.  We're already seeing that.  Yeah.  That's what's really happening in a very rapid way is that the carriers are rapidly asserting themselves in these markets, making deals.  This is a deal with Google.  Who knows what really happened behind the scenes?  These guys...  You know, if you go back to...  Go ahead.

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Oh, no.  If you go back to AT&T and their deal with Prodigy, they bought Prodigy and then they had this deal with Yahoo.  There's still tons of AT&T subscribers who go online through Yahoo, right?  Right.  Because they do.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's their Internet service provider and their incumbent carrier is AT&T.

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  It's the Yahoo Internet.  Those kind of deals that happen.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, the Yahoo Internet.  Yeah, they have a great history of this.  You also...  Boy, this is a quote, a pull quote from the framework that you put in your article.  The FCC basically says the FCC doesn't have anything to do with this.  The FCC would enforce the consumer protection and non-discrimination requirements through case-by-case adjudication,  but would have no rulemaking authority with respect to these provisions.  Parties would be encouraged to use non-governmental dispute resolution processes established by independent,  widely recognized Internet community governance initiatives,  and the FCC would be directed to give appropriate deference to decisions or advisory opinions of such groups.  This basically pulls the rug out entirely from the FCC's ability to regulate net neutrality.  It kills it.  I mean, I can see why your commissioner is a little upset here.  And the fine?  Two million dollars.  Up to two million dollars.  Nothing.  It's chicken feet.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's more expensive to say bad words on the air.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, and they can't actually...  Yeah, that's right.  Howard Stern's much more at risk than Verizon is.  And it can't make any rules as a consequence.  All they can do is fine them.

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Right, and those fines could be overturned in court.  I mean, look what happened to Comcast blocking P2P.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.  They have to do it just right.  It's basically a tightrope that the FCC has to walk, and they're kind of doomed.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And the EFF was in support of this limited FCC jurisdiction.  They felt like this was a good thing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I could tell you from my friends in the EFF board that there is dissension within the EFF.  Exactly.  You know, I mean, there are those who say, well, you got to have net neutrality.  Who's going to enforce it besides the FCC?  And people said, well, the government shouldn't be involved at all.  By the way, and the chat rooms brought this up a number of times, we're talking about the US.  Does this impact anybody else around the world, or is this a US-only issue?

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  There are net neutrality things happening in Canada.  I want to say the UK, maybe France.  I know that people are saying they're watching the EFF.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Does this become the template?  This becomes the template for other countries then?

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Pretty much.  Yeah.  I mean, obviously not for every country, but many countries are watching.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So, Stacey, politically here, you've got the phone company and Google basically putting the FCC on warning that we're going to have our own government screw you.  Where does this go?  Congress is or isn't involved.  The FCC was planning this fall to claim provenance over the Internet again.  I'm trying to understand the politics of this.  What happens next, from whom, how, why?  Small question.  Little question.

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  This is a midterm election year.  And I am not deeply steeped in politics.  I am like a network nerd kind of person.  But my understanding is very little will happen, but Congress will bluster and threaten.  And the issue is, you know, no one wants to vote to regulate the Internet in an election year.  And that is what people are saying the FCC is trying to do when they do this broadband reclassification process, which is basically them trying to get back power to regulate broadband the way they regulate copper voice lines.  And so I don't think much is going to get done, quite frankly.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So that's good.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So why did they do this?  That's what I still don't get.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It must have been a tin ear.  I must not have realized what the reaction would be to this.  Oh, no.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Do you really think so?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I don't know.  Well, then why did they do it?  If they knew that this would be the reaction, if they knew that whatever they said didn't really matter because we're in a midterm election year, if it doesn't even seem to really help their cause, I don't know.

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Well, it'll get Congress will say, this is reasonable.  We should do it.  Go, FCC, go.  And the FCC will be like, really?  Okay.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, the FCC lives at the pleasure of Congress.  They can only do it with Congress mandates.  Right?

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Well.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So if Congress says that, the FCC, what are they going to do?

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Well, yeah, Congress writes legislation or changes the communications law to strip them of power.  Then the FCC would have to take the court.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No choice.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, here's the thing, I'm ruining my number of the week, but for the greater good, I'll do it.  Oh, don't do it, Jeff.  Don't do it.  In the Pew study on broadband that's just out that Stacey mentioned at the beginning, 53% of Americans polled do not believe that the government should make spreading broadband a government priority.  That's surprising.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That ain't good.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Because then there's not the political, you add this all up and you think, well, there's a political will to say stay off our Internet.  But I'm guessing this number comes out of a fear that that's going to cost tax money or something and or cause new fees like we have on phones to guarantee coverage.  And so Congress will look at that and say, fight for your Internet?

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Why?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let me kind of mix into this batter this confidential seven page Google Vision statement that the Wall Street Journal leaked that shows that Google is right now grappling with this notion of how far it should go in profiting from our private information.  Google's considering building a vast quote trading platform for buying and selling Web data.  Should it let people pay not to see ads?  I mean, it's not like they've made a decision, but it seems to be this is all part and parcel of the same thing, which is a Google that has decided to go for the gold and is somewhat leaving behind the principles that we kind of celebrated Google for.  I mean, they're a private.  They're I mean, they're a public company.  They're they're they're they're a business enterprise.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They're this is what Siva and I will see about nothing.  And I will probably if we get selected in debate at South by Southwest, his proposal is and I'm right now I'm losing the debate.  Thank you, Google.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But yeah, his argument is South by Southwest is until the spring.  This could get a lot worse, Jeff.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm I'm I'm I want points on that call.  You could be in trouble.  I want Tiger Woods new handicap.  So what Siva says is Jarvis, you know, when it came to China, you shouldn't expect Google to do anything but what an evil company does, which is make money and to expect any more of them is not the case.  And I quote Umair Haik and others and say, well, no, nowadays doing evil is bad business.  And because we can all talk about you and we can all things can happen and you're going to be screwed if you do evil.  And that's what that's why Google's don't do evil.  A pledge is not a matter of grace from God.  It's a business decision to say that if we do evil, well, we're going to screw ourselves.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, this is that you're now in the test case.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, we sure are, man.  We sure are.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And here's the as users, I think we all want to stand up and say, you know, if we care and we care a lot and let's see if we can influence this company and keep it on the true course.  I'll be very disappointed.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What do we do then?  The problem is, you know, boycott Google now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I'm willing to boycott Google.  You know, there's there are choices out there.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You know, I don't like boycotts.  It's a rule.  I think it's more about about what we say and Google does a lot that is good.  And I still basically like what they do.  I just am baffled by this.  We should say, by the way, that we did invite on Google and Google PR was looking at trying to get someone on the show and they didn't.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We'll leave that door open.  That's possible.  I'd love to hear.  I'd love to hear.  I know they listen to the show.  I'd love to hear their response.  I'd love to use this opportunity to influence them in the direction that I know that probably Larry Page and others would like them to go in.  I think there are a lot of people within Google who believe firmly in net neutrality across all platforms, who believe firmly in privacy and and in doing no evil.  And is this maybe this is maybe maybe Google's sitting at a joint fork in the road.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You're right, Leo.  One thing I say that this versus other companies is that at least Google asks.  And as a result, it defines evil every day.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And that's what they said about this document, by the way.  They said this is not this is a private document.  This was none of these.  Some of these were non-starters to begin with.  It wasn't even shown to higher level executives.  It's just discussion points.  And I think it's appropriate for them to discuss this.  I don't you know, it's not like.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Gina, let me try one on you.  Was was was not giving wave the fair shot evil.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I didn't I didn't I can see it on the way front.  I can see that wave didn't have the users that that that that they wanted.  They expected it didn't reach milestones.  It didn't perform so they so they killed it.  I didn't think it was evil.  My question for you, Jeff, is is this China compromise again all over again?  So you kind of gave Google a pass right at first for being in China.  And then they changed their mind later on because you said, well, they're getting some information there.  And so I mean, can we look at the same way I was on the side?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I was on the side.  I was on the side that said they were wrong to go in China under those circumstances.  So I was glad when they stopped censoring.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But did it trouble you the same way that this see that didn't trouble me as much as as much as this does.  Does this trouble you more?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, it does, because it's the heart and essence of the Internet.  China was a case where I think they found that they put themselves in a stupid position.  They violated their own standards to make the business.  They were dealing with people they couldn't trust.  It came back to bite them in the butt.  And then they used principle to justify getting back on the track where they should have been in the first place.  And I'm glad they got back on the track.  Fine.  In this case, in this case, and what you just said, Leo, about well, Larry and Sergey believe in net neutrality and believe in privacy, we think I I want them to believe in this because it is good business.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because that's the only thing that will keep that belief going forward.  You can't do it.  You know, you're not going to give up profits in the long run.  You are a publicly held company.  You have a fiduciary responsibility to your stock.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, I want them to be smart enough to do that.  Well, it's why I push entrepreneurial journalism, because I don't want to be a charity.  I want it to be a sustainable business.  I want the Internet to be sustainable and successful.  And frankly, that's the reason I got that.  That's not AT&T going to blockades was because it was going to limit use and use more use is what makes the Internet grow.  And Google knows that better than anybody.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And that's the only reason I've ever had any faith in Google is because it made sense from a business point of view that they support net neutrality and privacy and all these things that they do know evil.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  OK, so if we move from a wired world to a wireless world, let's try to just because again, I'm honestly trying to figure out what could Google's business rationale for what it did this week be.  So if we move from a wired world to a wireless world, Google sees that's where all the money is.  And Google is antagonistic with all the carriers.  Well, they're kind of screwed in their business, right?  Because they can't sell their even though they got a free OS.  Thank you very much.  We're going to use it to try to limit it as much as possible.  Limit your chances to make money as much as possible, which was wires argument.  Is that what what's behind?  I mean, did the idea of defending the Internet stop?  And in fact, mobile isn't the Internet.  It is the Schmid Internet.  And it's all new rules.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So what is evil?  Somebody is asking in the chat room.  What is what would be evil?  Using the information Google knows about us against us or sure, not protecting our privacy, not looking out for us in terms of usage, net neutrality, serving corporate interests instead of users.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right.  Period.  You're not not furthering the open Internet, not supporting the open Internet.  Open Internet is critical.  The whole thing.  Open Internet.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's what Google started its founded its business on.  That's that's what is good for its business.  And that's why Jeff keeps asking that question.  Why Google?  Why?  What is the business case for what you've just done with Verizon?

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Maybe it gets it further.  I mean, maybe it gets it enough of a base.  So when this becomes a real issue, and I know it's it is an issue today, but when it starts really hitting home for people, then maybe they'll have the influence to to stay to step up and actually act.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, could it be they're playing a lot?  Could it be they're playing a longer game?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's why I raised the idea of the Munich Accord.  And the problem was the Sudetenland just went to Germany.  Right.  And without Czechoslovakia at the table.  Right.  And it didn't work out very well.  Mr. Chamberlain passed the sour cream.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's the devil Chamberlain version.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  So, Stacey, I could.  But they're too smart for that.  They know that they sit at the table with the devil phone companies.  You know, they're the ones who went in the spectrum auction to push openness.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.  They were in the they were in they were in this on the side of the angels.  What happened?  You know, I wish they bought that spectrum and opened it up.  And he was there, too, by the way.  Of course, I can't blame him for saving three and a half billion dollars or four, four point  nine billion.  But nevertheless, another opportunity missed.  All right.  So is this the week should we mark it?  The Google stopped being not evil.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It took us just over a year.  Yeah, this is the test.  I am feeling very much like a guilty lover.  The rose colored glasses have fallen off.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, we used to be the big you know, I used to be the guy that said, no, I trust  Google because it's in their business interest to be trustworthy.  And and and but they're clearly not.  They're playing some other game now.  I don't know what it is.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I know somebody suggested earlier.  I'm not endorsing this idea, but we should change the name of the podcast in this week  in evil protest this week in cloud.  We could do that, actually.  You can open Internet.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, look, there's no there is no question in my mind that every single person listening  to this show, every single person who cares about technology wants an open Internet.  The only people that don't want an open Internet are commercial forces that want to capitalize  on the Internet.  They want to the Balkan eyes, the Internet.  They want to use it against us.  It's very clear.  I don't see any black and any gray there.  It's black and white, isn't it?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And the one party we had the faith that saw that in its interest.  So our interests were aligned was Google.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We're going to we're going to rename the show this week in being somebody said.  I'm going to start to cry any second now.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  We have to go to commercial.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All right.  We're going to go to commercial.  Stacey, I know you have to run.  Thank you so much for being here.  Thank you, Stacey.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It was great.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Stacey Higginbottom writes for GigaOM, G-I-G-A-O-M dot com.  And if you go to GigaOM dot com right there on the front page, you'll see a link to all  of Stacey's articles.  And I like net nerds.  So we'd love to have you back if we may, Stacey.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Thanks, Stacey.  Oh, I'd love to be back.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Next time when your power isn't out, we can get to America.  Yeah.  Poor Stacey's in a minor power outage.  And you're but her MIFI is surviving.  Thanks, Stacey.  Oh, my MIFI died.  Oh, it did?  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Well, take care.  Well, thank you for joining us.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And is it Verizon?  It is.  Oh, could it be something else?  Could it be something you wrote?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Thanks, Stacey.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We'll talk to you again very soon, I hope.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Take care.  Bye-bye.  We're going to take a break.  We'll come back.  There is more Google news.  We'll get speculation from our guests, our panelists, our hosts, Gina Trapani and Jeff  Jarvis.  In just a minute before we do, though, I want to thank our friends at Ford for the  support they've shown this show.  And in fact, the support they gave us to go to Detroit last week.  We had such a good time.  I am a Ford fan.  I use that incredible Ford SYNC.  It's in my 2010 Mustang.  If you want to know more about Ford SYNC, go to syncmyridepodcast.com.  That's the website.  It is the true hands-free calling.  And by the way, works especially well with Android.  I don't want to say anything, but it is really sweet with Android because, for instance,  on my Droid X, SYNC reads my text messages.  It just sees them coming in, reads them out loud in a lovely female synthesized voice,  which can make for miles of merriment, depending on who's writing the text.  You get turn-by-turn voice directions, true GPS without having to purchase additional  hardware, 911 assist, which is great.  I just repaired my Droid X with the car because I did that reboot last week, that reset, which,  by the way, fixed all the problems I was having with the lag on the Droid X.  So I had to rebond it, and it said, no, make sure you want the 911 assist on because it's  not on by default.  I said, you bet.  That's when the airbags go off in the car.  The car uses your...  This is what's kind of interesting about SYNC as opposed to other things like OnStar.  It's using your phone.  So SYNC gets better as your phone gets smarter.  It gets better.  So that's a very interesting idea.  It's kind of a partnership between the technology you bring into the car and the car itself.  So the 911 assist is a good example.  It'll call 911, gives you an opportunity to say, no, forget it.  I'm all right.  But if you don't respond, it calls 911.  It feeds the GPS coordinates from your phone to 911 and then plays a recorded message and  then turns on the microphone on the phone.  This gives you a chance to speak.  Help me!  Great.  Okay, that's the kind of...  That may be a little bit morbid.  There's also some positive stuff.  You can play podcasts just by asking for the name.  The whole idea is you never take your hands off their wheel, your eyes on the road so it is safer.  Traffic alerts, weather, movie times, and so much more.  I want you to give it a try.  Here's a couple of ways you can do it.  Go to the website, syncmyridepodcast.com.  There's some great videos there you can take a look at.  Or maybe easier, just go to your favorite Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury dealer and test drive.  I love my 2010 Mustang.  I'm looking at the 5.0, the new 2011 Mustang and thinking, hmm.  And Jennifer, I showed her the Flex and now she wants to trade in the Toyota for the Flex.  So we may become a Ford family.  You know, it's kind of neat when you go to Detroit and you see American workers in a really high-tech plant.  It's got a living roof.  It's got sedum on the roof so it absorbs the water.  And they have solar.  It's really neat to see what is considered one of our oldest industrial companies move into the 21st century so aggressively.  And you've got to give Ford props for that.  SyncMyRidePodcast.com or your Ford, Lincoln, or Mercury vehicle dealer today.  So let's see.  What do you think tomorrow?  Now the latest I'm seeing is that it might be an Android announcement.  New Android feature coming tomorrow.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, I think we're going to hear that Google is now a paid service.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  A penny a search.  Hey, we got to make some money here.  The Google blog post.  According to Google spokesperson, it's a small event.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It is a mobile event though, isn't it?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's mobile. Yeah. They say it's going to be Android at Mountain View.  Is it a new app?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So this is kind of odd, right?  Because gingerbread is not supposed to drop until next quarter, right?  So we've still got some time for that.  So it's not going to be gingerbread.  Most likely it'll be an app or a new feature functionality.  Is this typical? Did they do this typically?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They have an event?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  The last event like this, they announced turn by turn directions.  That's what Gizmodo said.  So that was huge. That was huge.  Yeah. I mean, that's a pretty cool feature.  So I'd love to see something like that.  The first thing that came to mind was the streaming music that they talked about at Google I.O.,  which I kind of assumed would come with gingerbread, but it was during the Froyo demonstration.  And that was that you'd be able to purchase music through the Android market  and I think even stream music from your desktop.  That would be pretty neat.  So I don't know if there's going to be...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's what I thought. I thought this was the month that we're going to announce Google Music.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, like a Google Music app, right? That lets you stream.  That would be my guess. I don't know. What do you guys think?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That sounds right. I'm going to put my money in Google Music.  We knew they were going to announce that.  It would be an Android app, of course. That makes sense.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Okay. I'm going for it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  They have simplified media.  Vic did that demo at Google I.O. in May.  So I don't know. I mean, what else could it be?  It's not gingerbread. I mean, we know it's not gingerbread.  That's 3.0.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The Dell Streak came out or is coming out tomorrow.  Maybe they'll show the Streak. I'm excited about the Streak.  I think I'm going to run out and buy one.  That is a 7-inch Android 2.1-based tablet from Dell that is priced below the iPad.  Of course, it's a smaller screen.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  7-inch or 5-inch?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is it 5? I'm sorry, 5.  Yes, 7 is what the rumors are that Apple's next iPad will be 7. It's 5.  You know, the 4.3 on the Droid X or the Evo is almost iPad-like.  A little bit more might be enough.  It's interesting. I wonder...  This is, by the way, why I really like the Google space for phones versus the Apple space for phones.  Because you know what happens at Apple.  Somebody makes prototypes of the iPhone in 3.5-inch, 4.3-inch, 4.8-inch, 5.4-inch.  The whole range. Steve comes in. They're all on the table.  Steve looks and goes, let's do that one. And that's it.  There's no discussion. There's no consumer testing.  They don't ask anybody. Steve goes, that's the one we're going to do.  Versus...  There's no data?  There's no data. And I admire that. I love that.  I'm a big fan of the auteur principle.  I like the idea that some great thinker with vision can do something.  But I also love the idea that anybody can take Android and put it on any size they want.  However stupid it is and let the market decide.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And you could go to a store, that same table is there with all those choices, and you get to say...  You decide.  That's it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's the thing. That's the difference right there in my mind. That's choice.  And who wants a carrier-humpening, net neutrality, surrender monkey to choose?  Oh, I'm sorry. That's the wrong company.  Plastic logic is killing the... I'm sorry. I just love that phrase.  In fact, that's going to be the title of the show.  You know that.  Plastic logic has killed their Q reader, which everybody...  They earned it.  They earned it.  The Q reader, everybody was excited about this kindle killer.  Just shows you how hard it is to kindle the kindle.  In fact, Amazon is reportedly working on other devices.  Amazon wants to be in the hardware business apparently.  Come on, the more the merrier. That's great.  If you were in Russia, you might have been bit by a Trojan in the Android Marketplace since removed  that steals from you by... It's an SMS Trojan that sends messages to a paid service.  You get the bill for hundreds of dollars, premium rate service.  Just a word of warning. It's not out there anymore.  We should mention Ted Stevens passed away. Died in a plane crash.  Sean O'Keefe, the former head of NASA survived. Thank goodness.  Senator Stevens known in the cloud circles for coining the phrase,  the Internet is a series of tubes.  It's kind of sad that that's how he's going to be remembered.  South Korean police raided the Google office.  This is again the backlash on this Street View collection, I think, right?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, it is Street View.  And it's going to start up again in Germany. Google's about to start to Street View again in Germany.  Did you see the other great story this week?  Wirtschaftswoche, otherwise known as Vivo, the business week of Germany,  reported that Google was buying photo drones.  And the company that was selling them was bragging about this.  And it was doing no one any favors because the drones were shown  focusing in on a woman in a bikini and a blanket and then looking in the windows of houses  and all kinds of things that got picked up.  So I pinged Google PR and it was a Saturday so they couldn't do it.  But Monday, first thing I heard.  No, no, no, no, that was a company did not buy them is not looking at them.  A executive at the company bought one of these to experiment with it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I'd like to experiment with it actually.  I'd like my own creditors.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You also said that on Long Island, I think I put this in the feed,  Long Island local governments are using Google Earth to find illegal pools.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes, I thought that was hysterical.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So it's this combination. Now you imagine the droid, I mean the drone rather,  or the droid drone perhaps, it'll come to that, can look and find illegal deck construction or something.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I hope that there's a student at UCSD who has developed,  Arturo Flores has developed a program that removes people from Google Street View automatically and quite effectively.  I didn't realize this apparently, according to this article in Tech News Daily, Google blurs people's faces.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  In Germany you have to. Yeah, it's part of the ridiculous part of this.  What I loved about this story, Leo, is if you look at the picture on the left,  the person is gone but the dog with the leash is still there.  I think it's a very, I really hate this because I think it's a, remember the neutron bomb,  it killed people off the buildings intact.  This is a neutron bomb version of the world because we're all so scared now.  No, don't show me. I'm walking down a street. Oh no. What could happen, folks? What could happen?  And it presents a very strange view.  I think of now we have streets filled with little ghosts that are left there.  And by the way, the other thing that happens is sometimes the shoes are there,  which reminds me when I came through the World Trade Center right after the planes hit,  the mezzanine was filled with nothing but shoes as people ran out of them.  It's really, I don't like this. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't want to see a world with just shoes and leashed dogs.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  A couple of people in the chat room are suggesting that maybe Google Me will get announced as a world trade center.  Google Me will get announced tomorrow, but I don't think that's going to happen.  It's definitely a mobile event and I think Google Me will be a whole other thing.  I don't think that's going to be just a small event.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Do we now imagine? Sorry, Leo.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, you're going to say the same thing.  Go ahead.  We're in agreement that Google is doing a Me or Facebook thing.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm pretty sure. I had a long conversation with a former Googler who shall not be named.  There's definitely a social product that's getting built and it's kind of a black hole in terms of engineers.  There are engineers from all over the company kind of getting pulled to work on it.  And they never emerge?  Well, it's a big secret. I mean, no one knows what's up.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Really? I like that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, I don't think they have any new executives.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What's his name? Is it Vince who was in charge of mobile?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's Vin Gundutra, right?  Vic.  Vic.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So, Gina, didn't you hear that Vic was assigned to this as well?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There was a story to that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, no. Was there? I didn't hear that specifically.  But I believe that Rick Clow, who we were going to have on the show, has something to do with it.  Because I think that this new social product has to do with profiles.  And I think that he wants to come on the show when this product launches.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And what did he say? What did he say in September?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  He said, when I have something to talk about.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He was very careful.  Liz Gaines writing in GigaOM, Google's social czar is Vic Gundutra.  He is officially...  Well, he's the guy who did the keynotes at Google I.O. and did so well, I thought.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes, very well.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Google was looking to the outside for a head of social.  Did apparently hire a recruiting firm.  However, ended up giving the nod to Vic.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Vic is a good bet. He's charming. Developers like him. He presents well.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And he's technically... He does big things.  He's not a marketing guy.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Been there since 2007. He's relatively new there.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, let me ask you this. Because Google has now left the Nexus One behind,  and we see nefarious motives in that, does this mean that Google will never do a pad?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, because they said... Eric said they were going to do that at that famous party in Los Angeles.  We will do our own pad. I don't know why. I always think of Eric talking with a German accent.  I don't know why.  Viltro e pad.  Yeah.  Why is that? Is that...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I don't know. When Tara Swisher wrote about my Internet Schmitternet post,  she didn't understand the Yiddish joke that was there and said I was actually making a play on Eric Schmidt's name,  which I wasn't doing at all.  Oh, Internet Schmitternet.

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  It didn't even occur to me.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, you know how I feel about him. So I think this whole thing is just really amusing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Kara is such a wasp. Is she a wasp? I don't know.  Yeah, exactly.  She's such a wasp.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So I thought the other one was... I can give you examples. I said it's like Kara Schmera, Jarvis Schmarvis, and Risen for Klimt.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And there is our Yiddish expression for the day.  Any other stories before we get to our tip and tool and deprecated number of the week?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, I got a second number.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Go ahead.  Slight Gmail rollout this week.  Oh, yeah.  A little redesign.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I didn't want to say it because I thought maybe you'd, I don't know, mention it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, yeah, I don't really have a tip related to it. I'm actually a little dubious about it.  It kind of rearranges some of the links on the top left side.  It puts contacts and tasks above the compose button.  So tasks is really high up on the left side, which is interesting because it's still just this little pop out product.  You know, it's like on one hand, it's like, oh, there's a commitment to tasks.  And on the other hand, it's like, it's just a little pop up.  I shouldn't show that it has all these phone numbers in there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Whoopsies.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It is cleaner and there's a little more room for your messages.  And the contact section was big, was really, was overhauled and is looking much better.  Yeah. That's the big change is contacts.  Yeah, it was one of their Gmail's weaker points.  So I think that there are definitely improvements in contacts.  And this redesign hasn't rolled out to Google Apps accounts yet because they're saying that they want to do a little more work with contacts.  And I think that probably has to do with grouping contacts on your domain and that kind of thing.  But hopefully our app users, we app users, will see that soon.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Gina, this is off topic here, but I just saw on Twitter, user named Leahy asks,  how come nobody has talked about Orkut moving to using Google Wave code base in UI?  What?  Is that going to happen?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, that's a joke.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, not that I know of.  It's got to be a joke.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I lost the irony. Sorry.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Maybe not. I don't know. Let's go. Orkut is going to start looking like Wave.  Let me see. I'm going to Orkut right now.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  This is someone from England. They have irony.  You know, someone from New Jersey, they have no irony.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's the problem.  I can't, I don't really see Wave becoming merged into the Orkut code base.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm actually still not really clear on what Wave's, you know, what's going to happen with Wave.  Is it going to live? I mean, I know that Novell has that Pulse product, which is based on Wave.  I'm not sure, you know, where else it's going to live on.  Gina, could someone take over Wave and make it live?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I mean, it's open source, right?  Or is it open source?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Much of it is open source.  From what I understand, not all of it is open source.  And like decoupling parts of it, some of the most crucial parts from the Google code base was kind of a challenge.  And I don't know that they've done, I don't know that it's a totally standalone run your own server product yet.  And they're not developing it anymore.  So I'm just not sure if that's possible.  You know, someone said, hey, well, can't just people install it on their own server and run with it?  And it's like, it just hadn't quite gotten to that point yet.  So, yeah, the outlook is grim.  Aw.  Unfortunately.  Aw.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All right.  Let's get our tool tip and the number of the week starting with you, Gina Trapani, your tip of the week.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  A quick tip for Android users this week, and this comes from Kevin Purdy, who's writing in the book on Android.  You can hang up phone calls by hitting the power button.  So you don't have to hunt for the button on your touchscreen.  You can set this up in the accessibility settings.  So if you go in Android into settings and accessibility, you just check off, use the power button to hang up calls.  So if you're doing something or driving or something, you can easily, you know, turn, hang up your phone call without having to, you know, hunt on the touchscreen by just tapping the power button.  Very cool.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, I got thanks to the Twitter people.  I got some numbers.  I'll use them real quickly.  The Pew numbers are interesting.  They're out about broadband.  And this one, I'll highlight this as well.  In 2009 to 2010, the percentage of white Americans who have broadband went from 65 to 67 percent, which is a leveling off of speed.  But among African Americans went from 46 to 56 percent, which is a huge growth and nears, you know, starts to narrow in on the digital divide, which I think is very good news.  That's one number.  Another number is, of course, one hundred twenty nine million eight hundred sixty four eight hundred eighty.  You know what that is?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, say it again.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  One one hundred twenty nine million eight hundred sixty four eight hundred eighty.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The number of wave users who are now on the put.  I don't know.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's the number of books that exist in the world.  Google says and they're going to scan.  Well, two more real quick.  One is one hundred twenty nine.  That is the number of blogs that TBD dot com, a new political local service in Washington, D.C., is working within their network, which is the way to do it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Folks, I want to tell me about TBD because I've been reading about that.  What exactly is it?  The post?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, no.  It's started by people who used to be the post.  Jim Brady, who used to be the online editor, now working for Politico and Albritton is starting a new local service that launched this week that is doing all things right.  Its policy is in my favorite line from bumper stickers near you.  Do what you do best.  Link to the rest.  If somebody else does it well, they'll just link to it.  They are working with one hundred twenty nine local bloggers and sending traffic to them and making them the star.  Not like the HuffPo.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is it like the HuffPo where they kind of put the bulk of the article there or is it?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, what they do is if you have a blogger and the network has a really good article, they will promote the hell of it on the home page of TBD and link directly to the blogger.  That's smart.  At the site.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's very smart.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think it's really good.  Finally, the last number of the week, of course, has to be nineteen point seven five.  The number of hours per week that the now fictional Spencer spent on Farmville.  The hope of.  I put the link up.  We all see now that it's an actress named Elise and it was a hoax, but it was such a wonderful hoax.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, I have to say, when I first saw it, I had no thought in my mind that it was a hoax.  This is the woman who there was thirty three white board things where she quit her job and then outed her boss as being a complete Farmville junkie.  All because he called her an H.P.O.A.  And which I'd never heard of.  I had neither.  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Honestly, I had never heard of it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And it was a creation of two brothers who do the chive dot com.  And they've done it before a couple of times and fooled the mainstream media.  I loved it that it was tech crunch that they wanted to fool and did, in fact, fool with that story.  And then it was tech crunch that outed the actress.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So I also love the fact that it got as great quit moments go.  It got upstaged by the guy from JetBlue by the JetBlue guy who was real.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It was real.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Although, yeah, I'm pretty sure that was real.  You know, it's hard to say, you know, of course, he endangered.  It was a day.  It was, you know, you don't do it.  But boy, what a great way to make an exit.  And I hope I'm actually having an exit slide built into the studio here just in case.  And I got a couple of beers in a special break glass in case of emergency.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You're not going to grab your cell phones and slide out and go to the full cell phone?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It was a little bit of a screw you Mike Harrington moment.  I kind of had some sympathy overall with him.  It's one of those things you do.  It feels good at the time and you deeply regret.  But you got and boy, he's going to benefit.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, and this guy's a hero.  He's a hero.  He's a Robin Hood.  He's going to make a fortune.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There'll be TV shows, speaking engagements.  He can pay for the slide.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I have one little plug.  Yes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I have one little plug this week.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm doing a new video series for a fast company.  I'm doing kind of a tech help Q&A.  I'm doing personal Skype consultations for folks who have questions about Google, cloud,  personal productivity, software, whatever questions you want.  So if you hit my blog at smartaware.org, submit your question.  If we choose it, we'll record a little Skype Q&A video action and it will publish it on  fast company.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And of course, if you've been reading my Pulse blog, you would have known that because I  immediately bookmarked that in Pulse.  And that's my tool of the week.  And this is a Android app, although it is also an iPhone and iPad app.  And as I was traveling around, I used it quite heavily to try to pull stories for the show.  Pulse is a really awesome newsreader that, you know, we talked a lot about Flipboard  when it came out.  This is predated it, but I think does a nice job.  And they've recently added a feature where you can have you can heart something, any  story, and it will add it to a post-race blog that it sets up for you automatically.  And you can then follow people's post-race Pulse blogs.  I'm having trouble getting to mine right now.  I don't know if it's down because I've just sent everybody there or what.  But I have one.  It's leolaport.pulsememe.com.  And that's actually one of the first stories I bookmarked on there, Gina.  Awesome. Thank you.  Yes, was that video series you're doing because I think that sounds really, really cool.  Pulse is a dollar ninety nine in the Android store.  You know, I have to say one thing that's really become clear.  A bunch of big Android applications came out, big name applications that have been on the iPhone  only in the last couple of weeks.  It's very clear that developers of portable applications are no longer seeing the iPhone  as the only platform that they realize you have to do it for Android if you're going to do it.  And so anybody who is saying, oh, you know, I want to use Android, except that XYZ isn't on it.  I think those days are now gone.  I can't think of a single major app.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, from the time Android came out to that didn't take long.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Big Evernote update.  There were a couple of apps that just came out that were iPhone only for a long time.  I was very pleased to see and clickset.  And I haven't tried it. I was going to make it my recommendation, but I haven't tried it yet.  Clickset just put out Android and iPhone apps.  Clickset is a kind of a friend feed replacement that I've been on for a while that a similar idea.  It collates all of your social media into one Twitter style stream.  And they've got 70 services.  It's kind of an amazing real time thing.  They just released an Android app and I would have recommended it,  except I haven't had a chance to really play with it yet.  But I suspect I'm going to be doing that a lot.  And then there's one other app that I've been using in conjunction with Foursquare.  It's called Pick Please, P-I-C-P-L-Z.  And it allows you to do a Foursquare check in with a photo,  which I really like the idea that you do the check in with a photo  because it just gives you kind of this neat visual of what people are up to.  Yeah, that's cool.  Yeah, a lot of times when I...  That's a good idea.  Yeah. And then you can see what people are up to by location as much as by the person you're following.  And so they're trivial photos. You know, it's what I'm eating or what.  But I think it's a lot of fun.  I used it quite a bit while I was touring around and I think I probably will use it more and more.  And it's on the Android platform as well.  I don't think it's on the iPhone. I haven't seen it on the iPhone platform.  So there's a few recommendations.  It's hard to just pick one when it comes to Android.  We love downloading those Android apps.  There's SFO. There's my son on the plane.  There's my son waiting for the plane.  You know, a lot of times they're silly. I don't even know what that is.  Oh, that's somebody else.  OK, there's Hyde Park.  Had a beautiful time at... That's the Vanderbilt Mansion.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, that's a beautiful mansion.  Have you been there?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I've been there. Incredible. I love that area.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I went to school nearby.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, you did?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I did. I went to school in Poughkeepsie.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, you went to Vassar?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Marist.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Marist. OK.  Yeah, the other Vassar.  The other Vassar. One next door.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That other school.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's a beautiful area. That Hudson River Valley is just spectacular.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And the fall, there are just a few weeks where you just sit on the river and look at those leaves.  It's beautiful. Good for Abby. Bard is great.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Bard has this great art museum where I took a picture of the...  They have a white flag flying over the museum that says,  Please don't kill us.  I don't know what it means, but I love it.  And the peaches.  And the peaches.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I saw you tweet that. And I was like, What is Leo talking about?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, that's the pic, please, right?  So anyway, that's another fun one.  P-I-C-P-L-Z.com.  All right, everybody, we're out of time. We're way over time.  Thank you very much, Gina Turpani.  Smarterware.org.  That's the place to go for Gina's great posts.  She's on Fast Company and lots of other places as well.  And of course, that Fast Company video series.  If you go to... Where's the best place to go to that for that again?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Just go to my blog, Smarterware.org.  You'll see where to email in your questions and submissions.  That's a great idea.  And we'll get it going.  Wish I had thought of that.  I want to be Leo when I grow up. Are you kidding?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You are. You're better than me already.  But you don't have this.  This is a dog collar that tweets for your dog.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's it. Until I have that dog collar, I'm never going to be like, oh.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Leo, I dare you to wear it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I was thinking, you know, why would I... I'm a dog tweet.  I'm going to tweet. I'm just going to put it on.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Now you need a dog collar that takes photos while you walk and sends them a pic, please.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, the minute that's available, guess who's going to buy it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Then you'll sound just like Craig Newmark's Twitter feed.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Squawk! Squawk! Squawk!
