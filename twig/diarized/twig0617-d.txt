Stacey's here, Jeff's here, and a very special visit  from the former administrator of the United States digital service, Matt Cutts is in the house. Is  Sundar Pichai a terrible CEO or is the New York Times just putting out link bait? We'll talk about  that. Congress going after big tech. What does Matt Cutts think of that? And Peloton owners are just  a little bit miffed because they can't use their treadmills unless they pay a subscription.  Details to come with the entire show next on Twig.

I just have a feeling Stacey Higginbotham is back. It's  great to have you Stacey. We missed you. Stacey at dot com. You went to Texas. Did you have fun?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I spent 10 days in Texas and my gosh it was warm. Yeah. They're having a heat wave. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well it's good to see you. Welcome back. Also with us Jeff Jarvis who's back home from his  trip to real microphone Mark Twain's birthplace. Yes. I'm positively giddy about the next person  you're going to announce. We are very thrilled. So I asked Ant Pruitt to take a step back. He's  actually producing today. Jason had to take the day off so it worked out fine to make some room  for an old friend. Mr. Matt Cutts is with us. Yay. So good to be back on twig. So Matt has a  rather checkered past. Storied. Go with storied. Storied is good. Good word writer. Very good word.  Storied past. Early employee at Google. He did all those great webmaster videos. He was in charge of  fighting spammy links. He saved us all from spam. Saved us all from link farms. And then got the call  to go into government in the last six months of the Obama administration. He went to the United  States digital service. And you've been on since then to talk about USDS and to invite programmers  and other technical people to join to help make our federal government's technology work better.  With Veterans Affairs has used USDS. There have been some amazing success stories. It was originally  started because the Obamacare websites, the National Obamacare website was so poorly done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And did you didn't go then? Did you or? No, I was sort of in that second wave, but got to overlap  with people who worked on the original healthcare.gov team. And some of those folks have now come back.  So it is the perfect time to come and do a tour of government service if you're interested.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  USDS.gov slash join. And for your term, you've done four and a half, but promoted to acting  administrator and eventually a full administrator of the USDS, which is great. He is a Colonel in

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the US military. It was funny when you were all were doing that and I couldn't respond.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So yeah, it was the pay grade, not the title. Did you do get a title though? I mean, you get like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  not really. Everybody at the US digital service is just a digital service expert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, good enough. Anyway, since you've retired from the digital service and are now just kind of  living the life up there on DuPont Circle with all the lobbyists, you're not going to be a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  lobbyist though, are you? No, oh, no, absolutely not. I wish you would. So you stop the government

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  from doing horrible, stupid, damaging internet regulation. Not all lobbyists are bad actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wouldn't do it for money. I just, you know, trying to help make bad things not happen. Sneak  into the congressman's office. Just change some language in this. Yeah, let's just clean this up

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  a little bit. You don't want to do that, representative. You don't want to do that. Hey,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  as long as we're doing an old home week, I should mention that Gina Tripani, who is also a long time  host in the show, has now been promoted to CEO of her company, Postlight. So congratulations, Gina.  She left us in 2016 or 2017 to go to work there in New York City and to have a child. And, you know,  she was pretty busy and she's risen through the ranks, is now CEO of her design firm, Postlight.  So congratulations, Gina. That's really great. That's fantastic. Be nice to get her back sometime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How old is her kid now? Geez. Oh yeah. Probably headed to college soon. I know, it goes so fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It really does. So, Matt, is there anything you want to share with us about your experience  working in government? Was it a good overall? Was it a positive thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely. Yes. I mean, working under Obama, the Trump administration, now Biden, the thing that  unites all of that is people really care about making government work. This is the people at  the US digital service. And it is such a fantastic time right now. If you are a, you know, a  technologist, a software engineer, a designer, a product manager, like they desperately need those  skills. And US digital service got like a $200 million dollar infusion because of a bill that  passed. And so that's good news. Yeah. What they really need, they have amazing projects. They  helped along with, you know, Boston Children's Hospital on vaccines.gov. So they've been doing  phenomenal work helping veterans. Now what they need is some more people who are willing to go and  help out in government. And you don't even have to come to DC right now because of the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah. And it's a paying job. It's not a volunteer job, right? I mean, it's actually work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's absolutely right. So if you're at what's called a GS 1510 general schedule,  you can earn like $170,000 plus a year. I'll be there. I'm on my way.  This podcast is not very long. Yeah. They do. We do need content strategists. So if there's,  you know, there's a lot of different check out the website, usds.gov. There's a lot of really good

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  stuff to do. What you really need right now is cobalt programmers. The Medicare payment system  is 8 million lines of cobalt code, 2.5 million lines of assembly running on 15 mainframes.  It powers four and a half percent of the entire American economy. 53 million people depend on it,  including me in about six months. And it needs to be updated a little bit.  Are you having trouble finding cobalt? Somebody actually called the radio show  and said, who's looking for cobalt programmers? I said, Matt Cutts is, but now it's the U.S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  100% true. We have had people who'd learned how to program cobalt for fun because they're like,  oh, this would be an interesting way to get, go deeper in the job. We also had a U.S.S.  former engineer write a book talking about her experiences modernizing things, including some  cobalt stuff. I think the book is called like, Kill It With Fire or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. This is really, you know, I think, especially geeks, we're a little cynical  about government. I think years of Ronald Reagan, you know, bad mouthing big government really kind  of turned a whole generation against it. But it's really about public service. And it's about  making a difference. And yeah, government is big and unwieldy. And it's running on a lot of lines  of cobalt code. But here's a chance to make it work for people. And it's really important. It is  a very important part of our economy. And the work. It hugely matters. And you can make stuff work

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  for one tenth, you know, either the price or, you know, the complexity. And you can bring in user  center design so that it's actually a good system to use. You know, Rick Cloud just became the chief  technology and innovation officer for the state of California. And that team has rolled out,  you know, a vaccine passport for the state of California and it's open source. So, you know,  it can be state level, it can be federal level. There's so many great places to slot in to help

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  out with really important projects right now. Let me just check and see if I got my passport yet.  No, still waiting. But Rick, Rick created Feedburner, which was a great way, especially  in early days of podcasting, to make a RSS feed. I used it. I was a big fan of Feedburner. Google  bought it. He was at Google for some time, eventually Google Ventures, and is now CTO of  the state of California. And a really nice guy, a really great guy. Yeah. Well, good. USDS.gov.  If you want to know more or you want to tell your friends about it, I think this is a,  this is just, I love this picture, by the way, this hero's picture on the site is the  bestest picture ever. It is full of all, here's a little Drupal icon. It's full of so many

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  fascinating little things. I just adore it. You might be able to notice if you look on the hearth,  there's actually Pez dispensers from like former presidents. Oh, there they are right here. Oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  wow. Look at that. Right there. And the world's tiniest whiteboard. Yeah. Then you really need

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  a bigger whiteboard. I think we can afford it. With 200 million dollars, you can now afford

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a bigger whiteboard. We can get a bigger one. That's actually, it was a nicely done whiteboard  though, I must say. Anyway, thank you so much for joining us. We won't pester you too much about  what it was like working in DC for the last four years. But let me just ask one general question,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  if I can. Going from a private company to government. And I have a small taste of it working  in a state university. Were there any kind of bureaucratic cultural moments?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, absolutely. I mean, there's different pockets in government that are great. USAID or  even the Department of Defense has some really high functioning technology. And then you go to  some places that are a little, that you think might be really high flute and great tech.  And I felt like I had a 40% productivity hit. You couldn't use any of the common cloud software  that you're used to or your Chromebooks or for security reasons. Yeah. Well, and there's a lot  of people who are still afraid of the cloud. Like they think either it's illegal or they're  worried is somebody going to subpoena this and I won't have a chance to weigh in on it, which is  why I'll try to bring this around to Google. Whenever Google just announced they're going to  allow client side encryption and people keep their own keys. Like that was really big news.  It took us four years to get access to Slack. And the breakthrough was primarily because you  can encrypt it such that nobody could send a subpoena to the executive office of the president.  And so the idea that you can now use cloud software and maybe Google workspace and not have to  actually worry about a subpoena because you've got all that stuff encrypted in the cloud. Like  those are the kinds of things that will unlock a lot of enterprise tools within government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you probably weren't involved, but were you maybe peripherally in the Jedi contract and  the battle between Amazon, Microsoft and Oracle and others to get that big Pentagon contract for

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  a new Pentagon cloud? So I was off on the side, the US digital services in one part of the  government, but there was a different group, the defense digital service, which we were working  closely with at the time that started the Jedi initiative. So I actually had to sell all of my  Google shares because I wanted to avoid even the appearance of it. Yeah. Well, it turned out to be  a costly time to sell the shares. But that's okay. It's important that government be fair and that  you make sure that you're in good shape. So I think that definitely turned into a more  complicated procurement than probably a lot of people would have liked to have seen. But  it's nice to see government starting to embrace technology and thinking, how are they going to  move to the cloud? Should it be seamless with one provider or should it be many providers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And in fact, that was one of the big specs of Jedi was that it'd be an encrypted cloud that  was safe for the DoD to use. Cross service. So the irony is that government wants encryption for

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  itself, but wants a back door for all of us. Different branches of government, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Even within- That's just like us, Jeff. We want everything to be cheap, but we also want it to be  high quality. People suck at it when it comes to trade-offs. We're not good at that, are we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, we are. But even within the NSA, part of the NSA is about breaking our crypto and part of it  saying, no, no, we need really strong, good crypto. Exactly. It's so funny. So even within  a single agency, there's a debate over this. I was thinking about culture. I thought that's what  your question kind of was about, Jeff, was the corporate culture versus the Google culture.  We're going to get into the Google culture in a little bit, but I read a really good blog post  from a guy who, former senior developer advocate at Amazon Web Services, talking about Amazon's  document culture. I found it really inspiring. This is justingarrison.com. That's his blog.  We've talked about kind of what Amazon does before. For instance, you don't start a meeting  without a document and the meeting begins with reading time, where everybody reads the document  so that you're all on the same ground. It's fresh in your mind. I think there's just little things  that Amazon does that are really kind of smart. This is a good piece. But I'm wondering how much  of that kind of thinking is making its way into government, or is government so hidebound,  Matt, that it's hard to change the corporate culture?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was this video clip, I remember, of Eric Schmidt who said the tech industry and startups  move three times faster than regular companies, and then regular companies move three times faster  than the government. It's tricky because the government, there's a lot of risk aversion,  and people are worried about getting called up in front of Congress. At the same time, if you can  do a mortgage on your phone, it's very hard to figure out, okay, why do I have to sign a piece  of paper over here? Why can't I do the equivalent of a hello sign, docusign, whatever? Those things  are making their way into government. The wild thing is that it feels like now we have a lot of  proven great examples. I love this. The meeting begins with reading time, and you've written the  document in advance. We've gotten proven examples, and they haven't made it over to government yet.  And so you can literally bring in, I know that user-centered design is going to create a much  better experience, and people think it looks risky, and it's not really risky. It's going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's listening to constituents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't want government to move too fast. Our government is designed not to be too fast.  It's all the checks and balances because you don't want to be too efficient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I was going to say, and government has to serve everyone. When you're a company,  you can alienate a quarter of your users or a quarter of the population because you don't care,  but government can't really do that or shouldn't rather.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although the good news is corporations now do have to worry about being brought  in front of Congress. There is a certain parity now.  That's real terrifying for them, sure.  All right. I want to take a little break. We actually have a lot of news. Matt,  we love having you here. It's great to have you. I didn't want to make this the quiz-Matt-cuts  show. I appreciate you putting up with a few questions. As you know, we're here to talk about  what's going on in the world of Google and tech. We will get to that in just a little bit. There's  actually a big breaking story we're going to get to. First, a word from our sponsor, Nareva.  People are heading back to the office. The way we meet is going to change. Distance  and going to have big implications for meeting room audio. You're probably going to have to  change your room configurations. You still want good mic coverage. You still want good audio,  but people now have to be distanced. They may be facing in different directions.  What you need is Nareva. Nareva makes this possible. It's not a beamforming system. Those  need adjustments often by an expensive technician. It's not a tabletop system because you're going to  add mics and then you have to sanitize mics between meetings. In both cases, your participants are  going to have to be sitting. You have to put marks on the table. This is where you sit.  Predetermined spots. This is the direction you face because that's where the microphone is.  Wouldn't it be nice if there were a better way to get clear, reliable audio, but your team could  still act naturally, still sit the way they want, still socially distance appropriately so they feel  safe? One analyst called Nareva, the first socially distanced mic system. It's designed  for these kinds of distanced meeting rooms. I have to think they designed this before  COVID-19, so it's kind of a happy coincidence. It was really just designed to make meeting room  audio better. They actually have four patents on this technology. They call it Microphone Mist  that uses digital technology to place microphones everywhere in the room and to automatically adjust  whoever's speaking so people can sit where they want, can face in any direction, and still be  clearly heard. Their HDL300 system, that's the big system, has become the first microphone and  speaker bar to be certified for large meeting spaces. That's as big as 15 by 28 feet. It fills  a room with thousands of virtual microphones. The audio adapts automatically. No technician  necessary. In fact, you can set it up. It's very easy to install each microphone and speaker bar.  Just put it up on the wall and it's there. But you'll get full room coverage. People can be  heard from anywhere in the room no matter how they sit, how they face, how they're distanced.  Once you get the Nareva system set up, you get the device management in your hands because  the Nareva console is web-based. You can adjust settings, install firmware updates, check device  status and more, all from a secure cloud-based platform. That console comes, by the way, with  every Nareva audio system. In fact, when you enroll your system, you'll even get an extra year of  warranty absolutely free. Nareva Audio Products have won numerous awards. Top new technology at  ISE 2020. That's for the middle-sized system, the Nareva HDL 200. But no matter what size your room  is, they have systems for small, medium, large spaces. Actually, they use the big one, the HDL  300 at HubSpot. Jimmy Yan, their principal collaboration engineer, said, quote, we were  so impressed with the sound quality, the ease of install and the ease of use of the HDL 300. It was  a no-brainer for us to adopt it. To learn more about how Nareva Audio is the simple, cost-effective  way to let your teams distance in meetings and still act and converse naturally, go to  nareva.com slash twit, T-W-I-T, N-U-R-E-V-A, nareva.com slash twit.

Just before we went on the air, breaking news. John McAfee,  a pioneer in software, found dead in a Spanish prison cell, reportedly died just hours after a  Spanish court approved his extradition to the United States. McAfee had been arrested in October  in Barcelona and it was being held for extradition. He was being investigated by the SEC  and IRS for tax evasion, failing to pay taxes on millions of dollars he earned for, among other  things, promoting cryptocurrencies, consulting work, selling the rights to his life story.  The authorities said he owed $23 million. Had he been convicted, he was facing as much as 30 years  in jail. The 75-year-old John McAfee, dead at the age of 75 in Barcelona. He was already on the run  from the Belizean authorities. He was wanted for questioning concerning the murder of his neighbor.  He ran for president in 2016 and 2020. He tried to get the nomination of the Libertarian Party.  He says the tax charges were retaliation for that.  He had a fall of 2019, launched a cryptocurrency called Whack-D or Whacked.  Anyway, McAfee best known of course because he was working at Lockheed in 1980 when he got a copy of  an early virus called Brain and decided to write an antivirus program. Founded the company with his  name. McAfee Antivirus was a very well-known antivirus, one of the big two for years and years  and years, purchased by Intel in 2010. John McAfee dead apparently by suicide but it's unknown  at this point until an investigation. He was alone in that jail cell I think.  That's all there is to say about that I guess. He was quite a character is the most generous

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  thing you could say about him. Where do you go after that? I'm like, oh, this was a tough

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  story to talk about. There's nothing really, no analysis necessary. Let us also say that to  anyone out there, whenever talk of suicide exists, it can have an impact on some people.  So if you have any feelings of depression, any desire for help, there are tons of resources out  there. Suicide Hotlines, Calore, plus family and friends and doctors and please make sure you reach

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  out. National Suicide Preventional Life Nine 800-273-TALK. There's some good people there who  will be glad to talk to you. Thank you very much. I'm glad you mentioned that. Suicide is a permanent  solution to a temporary problem and it's never necessary. Get some help. There's also a text  line. You can text TALK to 741741 if you'd prefer. I know people who work on that and I think Dana

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Boyd works on that and it's amazing what they manage, especially with TV shows. It's actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  part of the rules now, the best practices for journalists. If you're reporting on a story about

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  this, you're supposed to include the number. Good. I'm actually reading from the Daily Beast  story and that's exactly what they did. Thank you for saying that. I will from now on mention that  when that comes up because it can be triggering, I know, to people. We don't want to lose anybody.  This has been a very tough year thanks to COVID for teens and it's been  isolative and difficult and a lot of teens have been struggling. I'm going to take that seriously.  All right, Matt. Now you're back in the hot seat because the New York Times says Sundar Pichai sucks.  Can a nice guy be an effective leader is the question the Times asks Daisuke Wakabayashi  talking to restive Google executives, all anonymous of course, who say that Sundar takes too long to  make a decision. We have seen some blog posts. The guy who founded Waze, Noam Bardeen, when he left  wrote a blog post kind of excoriating the Google culture saying it had turned into a big slow moving  company. Do you stay in touch with people at Google, Matt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah, absolutely. It's interesting because even in the later days when I was at Google,  you could definitely feel like getting a change launched was more difficult of course than the  early days but also just like, okay, how does it affect international markets, the search quality  and other languages, that sort of stuff. Some people are like, oh, you have to get all of these  approvals but also it's a natural thing that when you are a really big company with a really big  footprint and impact, you're going to have more scrutiny and it's hard to try to figure out how  can you move quickly while still being big and I don't think anybody's found the perfect solution  to that at all. Every time I wrangled or interacted with Sundar, he was always doing a really good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've only talked to him when he was running the Chrome OS division but I was very impressed by his  genial nature, his intelligence, his candor. I thought he was a really great guy but that does  not necessarily make a great CEO. In fact, it might be the contrary abilities. I have to say,  the Times buries about eight paragraphs in, the Google executives complaining about Mr.  Pichai's leadership acknowledge that and say he is a thoughtful and caring leader. They say Google  is more disciplined and organized these days, a bigger and more professionally run company than  the one Mr. Pichai inherited six years ago. Stacy, you were going to say that all piped in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I was just going to say what they're doing is building a story based on an archetype, right?  And so you've got the Zuckerberg archetype, which is I don't care about other people,  I never apologize, I never think about things, I'm just in it for, I don't know what he's in it for,  anyway, the money, the data, the whatever. And then you've got this sort of thing, which is,  oh, he's too slow moving, you know, and very thoughtful and blah, blah, blah,  Google's separate problems that are slow moving and it is, it is a much bigger company, it's trying  to do a lot more things. But to there's two things happening here. One is conflating the person at  the top with the fate of the company. And I know that leadership matters. I mean, you look at Intel,  and you can just watch how leadership has just sucked a company just down the toilet. But I also  know that there are many people under him and Google is, Google is a company that from the outside  really looks pretty disorganized just in general. So I don't know if I don't know if I feel like  the executives they're complaining about Pachai really means much. Does that make sense? And I  think the New York Times is kind of making a story to fit a mold that it needs. Jeff kind of was a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  little pissed off actually, as I remember. A surprise. Well, no, journalist, journalistically,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I thought I just came, Peter Kafka and I from Rico just went back and forth with each other on  Twitter, like, well, I don't know if I could do well in your journalism class. I said, well,  maybe not. I think this is based on anonymous reporting. You can write this story about any  boss out there. Well, some people like them. Some people don't. They don't like your mixed decisions.  Any boss there is. And in my tweet, you can I said, I said, can you scroll up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. The more I think about this New York Times, one man trend story about Senator Pachai, the more  ridiculous it is, Jeff Jarvis wrote, it could be written about any boss in any organization. Some  agree. Some disagree. Some like some don't like go up to the prior tweet. And the initial tweet is

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  go ahead. Media move fast and break things is Silicon Valley evil. Google, our CEO is thoughtful  and patient. New York Times. Let's do a trend story about Google cracking because it's not moving fast

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and breaking things. There is a little contradiction there. Mike Masnick replied to you. He said,  how much do you want to bet that if Google had acquired Shopify, we'd be seeing New York Times  story about how weak antitrust is that it was allowed to happen. So that's another point is  that the Times has a little bit of a dog in this hunt. But we have said on this show, Mike Elgin  said at first, we've said it several times that Senator Pachai may not be the right man for the  job. Google is making a lot of money. They've doubled their staff. They've tripled their  revenues since he took over. But it's making money the way it's always made money in search

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and advertising. Well, you can't abruptly switch. I mean, Google is clearly trying other things to  make money. I don't think anyone in Google is like wandering around going, ah, not aware that  search one day is going to erode. But I think they're struggling with how to build up that  much money again. And part of that's just because they got in early. I mean, it's like you got in  early on the web. That gives you untold advantages. And actually, that's why the FTC is in the  Congress are looking at antitrust things now is the companies that got in early in these kind of  newly forming networks are raking in the dough. And well, if they did it well, there's also,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, of course, Alta Vista and Yahoo are untouchable. Yes, you know, I mean,  yes, I mean, Google to its credit did really well. Yes, same as Amazon, same as Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apple's a little of an outlier there. But you know, it's interesting to me that I feel like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Larry Page, Sergey, like they hired a lot of really great slash smart people in the early days. And  then sometimes if if Larry or Sergey or even Eric were like, we're going to go down this route,  they had enough people who were like, maybe and they it wasn't mutiny, but it was like, you know,  we'll just have our backup plan in our pocket, where if this thing doesn't work out, we're ready  for the next thing like you had a really high caliber of people. And I think they've been able  to maintain that much better than a lot of big companies that I know of. The one thing I would  just add is Google is it's kind of entering the whole tech industry is entering the lawyer season,  like, you know, the ability to talk well in front of Congress makes a difference and will for the  next few years, at least just because of the spotlight that's coming on on big tech in general.  And if you compare and contrast or think about Sundar, you know, testifying to Congress versus  Larry Page, you know, Larry is brilliant. He's fantastic. He has all kinds of amazing ideas.  But he wouldn't be my first pick to go sit down in front of, you know, the Federal Trade Commission,  or Congress. And it feels like Sundar is pretty well suited for that. You know, certainly there's  areas where he, you know, you might say, okay, well, where's the maniacal vision or something  like that. But Sundar does a good job of listening to, you know, the feedback that he's hearing from

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  what I understand. So I think, though, from the outside, there are some clear problems at Google,  one, of course, the firing of Timnit Gebru and the difficulty they're going through over in general,  their diversity programs, their inclusiveness programs, employees seem to be a little bit upset  around a variety of things, whether it's government contracts or this, or this problem with the AI  Ethics Committee. And then there are a lot of people who have lost faith in Google because they  seem to announce products and kill them so rapidly that people are very reluctant to go all in on  those products. You know, I'm sure there's justifications for that. But it doesn't look  like a company on the move. And I have to say in 2020, it really felt somnolent. The Pixel 5 was  just like a, well, we can do this. They haven't put out a new Pixelbook or a new Chromebook.  It really felt like the company, and maybe because of COVID, I don't know, but it really felt like  the company was not on the march. And I have to point out that companies, other companies like  Apple took advantage of 2020 to really do some interesting stuff, but not Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you thinking about devices? I mean, Google announced some interesting research around AI,  some interesting results around DeepMind that could be eventually productized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, that's what Google IOs keynote was, which was a lot of stuff in the labs. That's not a  product. You know, Google's always done that from verily trying to figure out a way to use contact  lenses to measure blood glucose failed. The Project Loon now shuttered. Google's always had a lot of  interest research projects. That doesn't mean anything to the outside world. It's just, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  interesting. Well, Google's core value isn't in devices. And so when I hear you, the examples  you're throwing out are devices. So I'm trying to think of something exciting that Google's done in

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the last year, something new and different. Translate. No, they've had Translate forever.  They're coasting. I got to say. They're coasting. They did a much better job. It's improved immensely

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  though. And it was in their AI. And this is actually a really interesting question. And I'm  not challenging you just to be sneaky. I'm thinking about what that means. I'm thinking  about things like, where are we? Where is the value in tech going to be? Is it going to be in  like, I am producing devices, a la Apple, and thinking about things like, Oh, what is my heads  up display coming? Or is it going to be in services, a la Amazon? Or is it better services  delivered through AI? And Google just hasn't figured out how to monitor like I truly am like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  well, just as a reporter, tell me what they've done that's interest nest.  hasn't done anything in a year, more than a year, they've done some interesting things on the cloud

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  side. I feel like they've done some interesting works on the back end related to security. But  a lot of these are nerdy and I don't cover them as much. And, you know, when I look at their their  TPU designs, and their embedded ML efforts, I'm like, there's some cool stuff there. But I don't  know how realistic it will ever chrome has had seven zero days this year, they just had another

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  one this week. I mean, I know, there's all sorts of issues. And I don't see amazing. I don't see  anything interesting coming out of Google. In the last couple of years, I really don't even this  documents feature that they've added to workspace feels like a reheated wave, maybe something that  Microsoft's been doing. It doesn't seem inspired by anything. When's the last time they came up

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  with a Gmail, for instance? That's a fair point. It was interesting in the chat, somebody said,  what about fuchsia OS? Like, if, if Google's created a whole operating system from scratch,  that most people haven't even noticed that's built from the ground up to, you know, provide security,  or something that, you know, current operating systems don't do a good job at. And I think Stacey  makes some really good points about you don't notice all the places where AI is like the search  team is never going to talk about all the ways that artificial intelligence or machine learning  has improved their search. But, you know, it creates a much more defensible position where  it's harder for, you know, other companies to try to compete in search. But I think you're also  fair to say, look, you know, if you're thinking about outfitting your smart home, you know,  do you think of Google first? Like, where's that? Where's that Google Chromebook laptop? I need

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  to that. Yeah, I think I think Leo, you everything you list, Google Killing Well Like Services,  I will be not impressive, the messaging mess, which we'll get to later, the AI ethics and equity  problems, all stipulated, Your Honor. But but I think Matt's point is really important to about  the age they are in right now, is is I think twofold. It's a lawyer run age, it's a it's a  lobbying congressional run age, where if they started doing too much that was too exciting and  big, they would get hammered for it for overusing their power and going crazy. And second, it's a  huge company. Eric Schmidt always said the biggest problem Google was going to have was when it grows  too big. And so it's also a Ruth Porat age, which is going to be about economic efficiencies. And,  and so that's not exciting. Just like Microsoft for a lot of years was not at all for I would say  its whole damn life, but we'll live another day was not exciting. But it became a well run company.  And I think that's the kind of phase that Google's in. So maybe we shouldn't have a show about Google.  I don't want to go too far down this path. But I think that it's a different time for the company

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to well, you know, one of the reasons we started this show something like 12 years ago, was this  was Google all by itself was a single company doing all sorts of interesting things, changing  the world around us. I look, I'm, I'm a fan. I want Google to be the Google of old, I want it to be  innovative and exciting, and groundbreaking. Maybe is maybe this is just part of the life cycle of

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  any corporation. What excites me is who's going to compete with Google, who's going to come up with  the next new thing outside Google, I think that's where we should be looking. I'm going to talk

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  about brave search in a little bit. I think that's pretty interesting. But I, I don't know, I don't  know. I mean, you know, Chrome is the number one browser in the world by a huge margin. And, and  in fact, what's happening is that other companies are nibbling away at Chrome just by duplicating it,  including Microsoft, you know, using the chromium engine, and making their own version of Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So don't just blame Google blame the entire world of mobile phones, nobody's excitedness,  it's all pretty much just more of it right now. Blame the entire world of browsers, it's arrived,  it does what it's supposed to do. What do you expect? Right? So, so rather than looking at  what's there, then we got to look at something new. Well, if any of these companies that are  in regulatory trouble and political trouble, try to do something majorly new to go into a new area,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they're going to get body parts chopped off. Well, they're being quiet about it. But if you look at  things like we can talk about this, but we are about to enter into a new era of computing,  it's going to be highly distributed, there's going to be lots of processing happening at each  node, it's going to be both not just the processing power being distributed, but like the databases,  and well, networking is always distributed. All of that is going to require a different model.  And Google's already built a lot of this at the macro level for its data centers and for the cloud  stuff. So you know, and they have those engineers. And then if you look at what they're doing in  containers to run software at all these different levels, I think what we're kind of in this just  really super boring era where people like whenever I talk about like, machine learning at the edge,  people are like super bored because they don't understand why it's going to be a big deal. And  they don't understand the computer problems yet. But rest assured, the people at Google do. I mean,  the people at Apple do as well. I mean, nobody's going to be caught flat footed if they're in this

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  world. But I agree, Google should be ascendant in artificial intelligence. They might be we just

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  haven't gotten there yet. I mean, if you look at like TPU light, you look at their work with  Kubernetes, you look at the partnership deals they're doing on like the industrial IoT side to  kind of bring in some of this stuff. They're making a lot of the right moves, but no one gives a poop  about them because they're not gadgets and they're not sexy. But you know what, Stacey, I think the

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  lower point is they're not products. Well, but that's okay. The other doesn't have to be gadgets,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but there's no products either. I mean, at some point, you can't build products until the base

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  infrastructure has to be there. You can't build McDonald's until the freeways are there. You can't  build the freeways until we figure out the best type of concrete to use. I mean, that's right now  we're at the concrete laying state of this next era of computing. I really believe that. And I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  not saying Google will win. I agree. Right. Right. That's true too. The other thing is, and I'm not  first to say this, Clay Shirkey said it, others have said it. It gets interesting when the  technology gets boring. Right. Watch out, watch out, Leo. I'm going to go back a few hundred years  here. It took 150 years after Gutenberg, there have a drink everybody, before we got the newspaper,  the modern novel, the essay and the market for plays because the technology was boring.  We knew what it was. Everybody knew how to do it. It was no big deal. Then people started to say,  oh, I can do this with it. And that's when the world around it gets interesting. So I think  you're looking at the wrong place. What Google has done with translation is going to enable  really interesting things to happen around the world. It's going to be really interesting what  happens to be able to read information literature because of its advanced leap years from where it  was. And it's boring. Fine. Others will make good use out of it. And that's where the excitement is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Matt, does it pain you when I attack Google like this? Is it like family? Do you feel like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, I've got a little bit of distance. And I also know sometimes you stir the pot for fun.  No, no, never. But I think it's interesting because Stacey's point about highways and concrete,  if you think about it, Google is only just now, I think, presenting some of the stuff where they've  done software-defined networking. So the joke at Google used to be we didn't just build our own car,  we vulcanized the rubber on the tires. And so in some areas, Google is only just now revealing  some of the ways that they've gotten far ahead in some ways. And maybe they're being independently  recreated at Amazon and all these other things. But you see that I do think thinking about machine  learning, voice recognition and transcription has gotten so much better even the last few years.  And there was this article that was talking about you can almost have a coach that teaches you to  speak another language just using AI now. So if Google rolled out a way where I could practice  my Spanish and not have awkward interactions with humans until I feel like I can speak better than  a four-year-old, that would be really great for me and probably a lot of other people and lead to  a lot better understanding around the world. And so it feels like some of this stuff, the infrastructure  is there and you won't quite know it until people pounce. And then they're like, oh, we call everybody  in the United States, all the businesses once per month with AI that's indistinguishable from  a human voice just to make sure we've got the COVID hours right or something like that where  you don't even know it until it's done. I think Google has a problem, which is they're too

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  successful. This is historically is always a problem in any business, especially in technology.  They basically mint money with their advertising and search and there isn't a huge amount of  incentive. Everything else is at a loss. Literally everything else is at a loss. It's all other bets  but they make so much money in search that they can just kind of...  Well, it's not search that they make the money. It's advertising.  Advertising.  Search. Advertising.  Advertising on search.  That's a weakness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, advertising otherwise too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But what if they're building, think about this, what if they're building, and everyone seems to be  trying to build this, a scalable digital assistant so everybody has a little digital  voice in their ear that helps them.  I would love that but I see no progress in that direction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is Google Assistant better than it was five years ago?  Shhh.  They see a sunfish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay. Like a good assistant, you take them almost completely for granted. They learn what you need  and they deliver it when you need it and you may never realize until you have a crappy assistant how  great your one was.  Okay, but you're writing science fiction at this point.  No, I'm not. If I look at like Matt just talked about things like Duplex or calling things up to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Duplex is a good example. They showed that how many years ago?  Two.  It seems like two.  Three.  Okay.  Two or three.  I can't wait to try it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The point is some of the stuff they're building isn't for you in the methods they're building.  They're building it so they can create ways to get information to you the way you want.  Because we are human, that means they've got to figure out how to deliver something via the web,  which they're pretty good at. They have to figure out how to deliver it in a format for Google  voice type displays. They have to figure out how to build routines into your smart home that  makes sense and deliver exactly what you need. They're working on that.  Those things get announced as silly little features that we talk about in the change log.  If you don't bring it back to five years ago.  I think we're going to have to stop measuring technology based on cool devices  and start measuring it based on five years ago, what did my experience look like? Today,  how much smoother is it? It's going to be super incremental and we're not going to be awed by it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Think of the pandemic without the internet or just without Google.  Think of what it would have been like without that. Again, when it gets boring, that means that it's  useful as part of our lives. It's just integrated in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And if you get super bored, let's see how they ruin Fitbit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there's a good example. They acquired Fitbit. I don't know what's happening with it.  Android Wear is a great example of a product that just like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh God, Android Wear was terrible. I was going to tell you about Fitbit. So this is a new Google  product that's actually, I'm using it in my life today. Is it life changing? No. But okay, here we  go. I got a new mouth guard because I grit my teeth like a crazy person at night. It's not fitted  well. So I started snoring and my husband was like, Stacey, you are terrible. And I was like,  oh no. So then I started implementing different storing solutions and I used my Google display  that now tracks snoring. So the second gen Nest, whatever I talked about on the show.  So I set that up and then I was able to set up controls between like things that I was  trying, including taping my mouth shut. Thank you, Leo. Did you try that? To see how I could  do this? I did. It worked for two days and then I figured out how to snore around it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. My wife says my snoring with my mouth taped shut is comical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. It's like a cartoon. It's not effective. And when my alarm goes off in the morning,  I can no longer say, stop. Okay. So the point is, this was like a tiny personal problem,  but I figured out Google offered me a tool that was really easy to use to start solving it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they're recording your snoring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're recording it, processing it on the device, analyzing it on the device, dumping that data and  only sending you snored for nine to 12 minutes versus 30 minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're telling how long you snored. That's interesting, I guess.  But it's kind of sad when you have a multi-trillion dollar company telling me how much I'm sorry.  And that's the thing you point to is like, look what they're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But no, what they're doing is they figured out how to do the A, somewhere they figured out  algorithms that actually in this case, it's not that hard, but they figured out how to break out  snoring from coughing and any other nighttime noises. They figured out how to take that data,  process it on the device, which again, this is not a huge difficult problem, I don't think to  solve algorithmically. And then they've made it accessible to me through lots of other places.  They are now bringing that technology to the wristband. So again, they're solving tiny problems, but  unusually, they're trying to solve them well in lots of places. They're going to have to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  solve problems to solve them. It's probably a good thing.  Just like a university does a lot of research, kind of pro bono research, it's probably a good thing  that Google's sinking a lot of money into R&D. And there's a lot of PhDs working hard at Google,  getting supported in their research. I mean, I guess it's kind of like a university in that respect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So imagine, Leo, we did this week in AT&T. They haven't come out with anything since the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  princess phone. Well, I would never do this week in AT&T. But what about this week in Amazon?  At their Amazon announcements, they do about 150 new products every announcement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  AT&T had, well, did AT&T have Bell Labs? Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So AT&T did those, well, I'm talking about way back in the day when it was a monopoly.  On a product level, you'd be bored with it. But behind the scenes, they were doing amazing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  things like the semiconductor. Yeah. Well, hopefully, AT&T, or sorry,  hopefully, Google does not become AT&T, which is just regulatory capture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In a way, that's the question is, is this a normal state in the life cycle of a big company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a different evolution. I mean, I don't think Google is going for regulatory capture,  because they're like, they don't need to. They've got, you know, all this data, I mean,  is data monopoly? Is that a thing that we should be thinking about? I've been thinking about this a  lot. I'm trying to write something coherent, but it's taking time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In a way, this is my defense of Google that says, Congress, you don't have to worry about Google.  Worry about those other guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's interesting, though, to also jump up a level and think about the tech industry,  because for a while, like 20, like if you said in 2020, what are the big things that happened in  tech? A lot of it for a while was social networks, which the more we look backwards  at social networks, well, maybe we're not getting all the benefits that we thought we'd get.  Lately, it seems like some of our best and brightest minds in technology are chasing,  you know, cryptocurrency stuff. I remain a person who feels like if you think you need to  decouple money from government in order to fix money, maybe you should actually fix government  first. Because government can still come in and take care of your freedom money and do all kinds  of interesting things to it. The tech industry sometimes feels like it's taking a little bit of  a weird turn. Think about semiconductors and chips and personal computers and desktop publishing and  how the internet, all of that, huge productivity gains. Then in the last 10 years, has it all  necessarily been good? How good is your quality of life compared to 10 years ago because of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  technology industry? Yeah. Again, what excites me, so I'm working on a project that I'm not ready  to talk about yet, but I've talked about a little bit, is what interests me now is internet studies,  more than media or journalism, and the opportunity to design our future. I think that what excites me  is what we start to do with this outside of these companies. Now the question is then do they make  it possible? Do they make things transparent? Do they make things portable? Those are all issues.  But even using the technologies that they patent and use eventually get used in other ways and  inspire other things. That's what interests me. I want to encourage students to think about  designing that future, design companies and functions and features and regulatory regimes  and ethical regimes and think about what is it we want to build. Also, when we're stuck,  as Matt brought up, the social media and our disappointment, shall we say, lightly in that,  all the talk is around disinformation and getting rid of bad stuff. That limits the conversation to  can we incrementally fix what we already have? It also entrenches the incumbents in power because

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  we're not imagining new competitors. Well, I think we've concluded this conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exhausted this area? We've exhausted this area. I just want a good Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I just want a Chromebook. I just want Stadia to work. There are just a few things. I'd love to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  see a Pixel. You want a better Pixel phone. Mine is about to die. Yeah, mine did die. Mine is Tuesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My 4XL has exceeded its battery, has exceeded the width of the case. It's now  has blossomed. It's too bad because I was using Android 12, which I like quite a bit.  I can't wait to the Pixel 6. You know what? We may be saying in a couple of months,  wow, look what Google did with the Pixel 6. It's just mind boggling. Google strapped a phone to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  my face or maybe it was my wrist or maybe it's implanted in my skull. It really may be that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're sounding like me. Watch out. I'm not blaming Sundar Pichai for this. That's kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  the point here. Coming off the New York Times story, as I said back to Kafka, there's plenty  of things to complain about with Google right now and things to be disappointed in. Fine,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  there's stories there. I do think though, maybe if they had a more dynamic, it's too big a company.  It's too late to have the dynamic CEO in place there. I don't think that's what it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  talking about. What does dynamic even mean? I'm sick of dynamism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Sacha Nadella is a dynamic. Sacha Nadella brought his company to be his true trillion dollars.  Sacha is not dynamic. He's dynamic in terms of what he's done at Microsoft. He sure as

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  all is. I don't mean personal dynamic. Okay, yeah. Well, that's what you're kind of  complaining the two. No, I'm not. You are. I think Sacha Nadella is dynamic, not personally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's not dynamic in any way personally, but what he's done with the company is very dynamic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Microsoft's turnabout is dynamic and you're excited about that, but Google, you're not.  But you are directly conflating Sacha and Sundar. I'm saying that it may be that having a good CEO  is the difference. I don't think Sundar is a bad CEO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do. I think he's the problem. No, I think he's the problem. I think they need somebody who can  take do some leadership in that company. Right now it's scattered. There's our show title,  Sundar is the problem. Well, I don't think the problem is that he's too thoughtful or moves too  slowly. I don't think he's dynamic. I don't think he has the vision. He's more like those Intel CEOs  that you were talking about, Stacey. You acknowledge that a bad CEO could be a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Brian Kresnich was a terrible CEO in the sense that he could not handle people telling him  things that he didn't want to hear. He was a bad leader. I don't think Sundar is a bad leader.  He might be a quieter leader and I don't know if he's ever rallied the troops with some grand  vision for Google and that may be an issue. Well, it depends what you mean by a good leader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think Steve Jobs was anybody who could listen to criticism,  but I think he actually did a lot of good for the company. So I don't think that somebody who's  nice is necessarily what you want, to be honest with you. I don't think Elon Musk is a nice guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Elon Musk, his stock price is up because people are loyal to him. I mean,  this gets back to our old conversation, remember, about financial engineering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Musk innovates. Look at how Tesla sells. Look at what SpaceX has done. There is no question that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Musk's company is. How old is this company versus Google? There's a life cycle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe that's what it is. TikTok. Although Microsoft's older than Google,  Apple is older than Google. Microsoft was a rescue, Leo. That's different.  I don't think Google's ready for a rescue. How was it rescued? By bringing in...  Microsoft? Yes, by bringing in the right guy to run the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He also looks good because the act he followed was knocking futz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, Jeff, is what you're saying that Microsoft was closely tied to Windows and Sacha pivoted to a  more open framework, which then, you know, naturally got him kudos and goodwill and maybe helped pivot  the company? It sounds like that's... He came from Azure. He understood the cloud. He understood that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Microsoft's mission was not selling software in boxes, but it was a very different mission.  Pivoted the company and it's done very, very well with it. Nobody could do that.  Here, I'll agree with you, Leo. I'll play with you for a second.  Microsoft was very static. Now, Bomber had the same... You know, you could point to Bomber and  say the same thing that you could say about Sundar, which is, look at the revenue of the  company's up. I mean, the company's growing. All of those things happened under Bomber,  but it wasn't a company on the march. Okay, so let me play you for a second here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And go dystopian on Google. I think where Google's weak, of course, is not just that  even though it's diversified a lot, advertising is still the lion's share of the revenue.  I think that advertising as an industry is going to be in trouble soon.  And that's why I'm not worried about regulation in the long term, because I don't think Google's  going to be king forever because it's an advertising company. But...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Then it would behoove them to get a little innovation under their belt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They'll all agree. But then the problem becomes, then they get accused of bigfooting some new  sector. Right.  And so what would you do? Leo, fine. You are the CEO of Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you think Google should be doing? Do you think Google... I think the moonshots  were too moony. I think Google should be looking for what its next business is,  just like Apple does, just like Microsoft does. A well-run company.  Intel is the Polaroid of tech. I mean, Intel is a poorly run company with a product line  that did not innovate and is going down the tubes. I don't want to see that happen to Google.  I really don't. I think you might be right about advertising. That's a pretty big prediction.  It's going to be interesting. But I think for at least the next 10 years, Google will absolutely  continue to be a revenue juggernaut. I don't think that's going to be a problem.  But now's the time to figure out what the next thing is, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree with that. It's interesting to think about Google because they break down into very  functional units. And so if you think of them in terms of silos, I started to make a list,  right? You've got search, you've got ads, you've got Chrome, you've got YouTube,  Android, cloud, Google apps or workplace or whatever they want to call it this year.  But, you know, sorry. But if you think about it, each one of those is run pretty well individually.  Yes, I agree. YouTube is a great success story. Absolutely.  Yeah. And so if you distinguish between, you know, manager versus leader, I think all of those  individual silos are managed really well. And Leo, it sounds like one of your things is, okay,  don't just go for the moonshots with Waymo because it turns out that was harder than anybody thought.  Where are the roof shots that are in the middle of it where you could grow to, you know, those  kinds of juggernauts that they do have in the existing silos. That's an excellent point, Matt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In a way, that's what Alphabet should have been seen as, is it's now a holding company  of a bunch of good companies. It's a holding company. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then we keep using the word Google, really, we should be calling it Alphabet because that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  really what we're talking about. And then I think Matt's analysis,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  of course, the problem with that is, okay, fine, let's break it up into five wonderful little  companies, which by the way, might increase the hell out of shareholder value. I think it's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  mistake to get too worried about what's going to happen in Washington, DC. I understand that that's  a legitimate fear, but I think that can freeze you and that could be bad too. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think- But also ignoring it can be really bad.  Microsoft was cocky, Google and Facebook were cocky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Most of these guys are doing, it was a lot easier with the other guy in office because it was easier  to kind of pet him. But I think most of these companies are doing what they can to appear  to care while they still go full speed ahead with all the things that the antitrust regulators  don't like. You know, you got to say the right words, make everybody feel good. But honestly,  if you're running a company at this point, you still got to want to win and play as hard as you  can. You can't stay with- Look, Microsoft, although I'll argue against myself, a number of people  pointed out that the DOJR indictment of Microsoft helped them be a better company because it taught  them a little fear and it slowed them down a little bit and it gave them the space to pivot  and to change in ways instead of just saying, let's just eat the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or you could argue that only because they were so huge and were, I've been arguing against myself,  monopolistic, they had the room to shift. Yeah. Yeah. I mean-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Versus Intel, versus other companies. I think what's happening in Washington is  pretty shameful to be honest with you. And you're going to be surprised to hear me say this, Jeff,  because you've been defending big tech and I've been attacking it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I'm defending the internet. I'm not defending big tech. I'm fearful of what  doing things to the big tech will do to the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think these bills, these five bills that we're looking at are really risky.  Tim Cook called Nancy Pelosi a couple of days ago saying, you know, you could put us out of  business. This is very risky what you're proposing and it's going to really hurt consumers. Now,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  obviously he's lobbying, but- Did I put the letter that the various industry

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  trade groups sent to Congress? Yeah. Well, there's the Times article here,  which is tech giants fearful of proposals to curb them, bid Blitz Washington with lobbying. Of course,  I think there's a little slant in this, but- From the Times?  Tim Cook told Pelosi that antitrust bills were rushed. They will crimp innovation and they'll  hurt consumers by disrupting the services that power Apple's lucrative iPhone.  And this is according to five people with knowledge of the conversations. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Leo, line 118, the various trade groups, and they're trade groups, they're company groups.  At the time when voters are looking- This is a letter to the House Judiciary Committee in  Sicily. At the time when voters are looking at Congress to address the country's most  pressing challenges, it seems hard to believe that Congress is instead on the verge of banning  Amazon Prime and Amazon Basics, banning the pre-installation of iMessage and FaceTime on  iPhones, and banning Google from including Google Maps in its search results.  That starts to get to a really- What consumers are you protecting here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. Wait, hold on. Hold on. Okay. No, this is important because I sat through the net- I spent  over a decade covering net neutrality and you can read these- You cannot determine what a law  will or will not do based on these sorts of letters. You have to actually read the  legislation. You have to actually talk to people on- I hate to say it, literally both sides-  to figure out- And you have to understand the underlying issues in a way that's really hard.  Do I trust Cecilia Kang to do that? I do. And yes, she is at the New York Times.  But this is an area where I would read these letters, but I knew what they were going to say  before I was reading them because I had done the legwork. And this is where news organizations  and reporting expertise is so essential. And I'm sorry, I've been on vacation for the last 10 days,  so I have not started doing this. But I know Gigi Sohn, for example. I'm going to give her a call  and I'm going to be like, hey, let's talk about this. And then I'll call the people who are working

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it. But yeah, Jeff, just- No, no. What I'm saying, Stacy, is that's why I emphasize five times,  it's from trade groups from the companies. So it's pure lobbying PR. What I am trying to say is just  that it's going to be a political- it's a political fight now. Right now it's purely politics. And so  there's a political view that says at some point, if you start attacking the apps we like, maybe  there's a political blowback on them. That's all. It's totally political. Jayapal's bill,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  which basically says you can't self-deal. So you got to stop all those things that you were just  talking about, using promoting Google Maps on Google and things like that. And it's really,  it's as if there is no antitrust law. And so you're going to write a new one. And it's not,  because she says, and the Clayton Act has to be enforced. There is antitrust law.  It's bizarre. I think this is very much about posturing, making the right sounds. We have  antitrust laws, which are not enforced in this country. It's a little late to tell Facebook,  you got to get rid of Instagram and WhatsApp. Facebook's right to point out-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You approved these. Our mechanism for antitrust does not reflect the market advantages of  the tech companies because our mechanism for antitrust results looks only at the prices a  consumer pays or looks primarily at the price of consumer- Well then rewrite the antitrust laws,  but that's not what this is. Okay. Well, okay. Have you, do you remember the last time we wrote  a big piece of legislation? It was in 1996, the telecommunications act. And we've been  attacking that thing since like 2002 thinking, Hey, we should go back to this. And what have we  done? Nothing. So coming at it with the new law, maybe it doesn't make sense, but government isn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  about making sense. I mean, well, and the other problem, just to build on something you were  saying earlier, Stacey, you were talking about, Hey, to really understand the implications of  these laws, you need reporters who have tech expertise, who think about this stuff deeply,  who talk to both sides. And I a hundred percent agree with that. The other side is you need  legislators with tech expertise because otherwise you get all kinds of unintended consequences.  When heaven of heavens, a law actually does get passed. People don't always foresee how it's going  to play out. Like certainly being in DC, I saw a lot of laws where it's like this software practice  will be implemented on February 14th of such and such a date. And the idea of like doing beta  testing or like a stage rollout or any of that stuff just never even occurred to people. So  for example, there's a group called tech Congress that puts technologists working with Congress  people. And so like, if you're a technologist and you want to see some better laws, like the FTC is  looking for technical people, Congress needs, you know, some of these kinds of fellows to go and help  make sure that when laws do get passed or regulations do get passed, that they're sensible  and not like, you know, as Jeff, you've mentioned many times, like don't, don't say here's what you  can and can't do, you know, on the specific mechanism, you know, instead do it in the more  general way and don't hard code technology into a bill necessarily. And I should also

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  have like beta lawmaking or sandboxing in certain like you think about like how municipalities will,  you can look at various state or municipal governments for new ways to kind of create  some legislation or implement different programs. It would be very interesting to,  and it might be utterly impractical because-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, Stacy, France kind of did that. France did that. So in the, in the, in the, but I'll tell you,  the end of the story isn't so great, but, but one of the members of the, of the Susan Ness task  force that I was part of, the Transatlantic High Level Working Group on Content Moderation and  Freedom of Expression was a brilliant regulator, and listen to those words come out of my mouth,  a brilliant regulator named Benoit Luttrell who embedded inside Facebook for six months  to imagine what it would be like to regulate Facebook. And Facebook went along with this.  And, you know, the weird thing was there was nothing to regulate against, there was no law to do.  But, but he saw where it worked and he came out with, I think, a brilliant scheme, which became  the basis of a lot of what we recommended, saying that what you, you don't want government to tell  the platforms exactly what to do because new stuff's going to happen and they're not going  to know it and they're behind. You want to have something to hold companies accountable to,  you want the data to be able to do that, you want the research to be able to do that. That all came  from his experience inside Facebook. Now then what happened, of course, in France was the  legislators take it over and it gets kind of messed up. Same time in Britain, I was just part  of a session that Susan Ness led today about the Digital Services Act in the EU and about the online  harms thing in the UK. And in the UK they're still going for you must take down legal but harmful  content. And I said, well, what's harmful? Harmful is now defined as anything that would cause  psychological or physical damage to people. So you're going to have courts trying to judge what  psychological damage, the mind gets blown, right? So it's not just our dumb laws, it's dumb laws.  We've got to do something thing going on. And Benoit was brilliant at saying, no, let's stand  back and say, what's the proper role of a regulator? It is to hold people to account.  And his argument in the end was, nobody trusts either the tech companies or government. And the  real job here was to increase trust and the way to increase trust was to get data and research. So we  knew what the impact was, so we made wiser decisions. This is a path that I endorse, right? I keep on  worrying about internet regulation because I worry about the kind of stupid regulation Leo was  talking about. Smart regulation, I agree, is a good thing. But as Matt also said, it shouldn't  be down at the nitty gritty level. It should be up at a level of principle so that it can last for

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  decades. Well, and we should point out AT&T wasn't broken up by Congress. AT&T was broken up by the  courts based on a law that was passed 30 years earlier. And I would say principles make really

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  crappy laws. I mean, the point of a law... You know what makes really crappy laws?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Congress of the United States of America. Well, I mean, this is hard. This is why this is  so tough. Amy Klobuchar is now complaining about what matters because she says, you know,  Echo is 50% of the speaker smart market, Nest is 30%. You guys are too dominant.  I want to know what period of time do you commit to support interoperability and who at your  companies is responsible for determining whether to extend the length of your commitment to matter?  I mean, it's so scattershot what's going on that it's ultimately going to scare the hell out of  any company. As he said, it's posturing. It's posturing. Right. And all of this is because  Sonos decided to testify that, oh, if you put Siri on smart stuff... That is not why this happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sonos, the peloton of speaker companies.  This was a legitimate consumer issue. No, no. The lack of interoperability between these devices,  the amount of data they hold, the fact that the consumer has no rights when a hardware device  becomes a software-based service is something that is inherently worth looking at from a  governmental perspective because none of these companies pushing this have any incentive to  behave well absent some sort of government regulation. Why? Because consumers are scattershot  and the companies finally figured it out 10 years after these devices were making their way into  people's homes because enough people were like, well, crap, this is confusing and I don't want  to invest in it. But they only decided to deal with the interoperability level, which is the  matter stuff. We still don't have any answers or basic rights when we start talking about a device  that is actually a service. And this is exactly what government is supposed to do with tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's what the market is supposed to do with tech. And I think the market is currently  weighing in on this stuff. Look at all the people who say, I will never have an Amazon device in my  house. I'm turning off sidewalk. I don't want to have anything to do with this. Look at how many

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  services and doctors and insurance companies and essential ingredients for living your life are  going to be mediated through these things. This is the same issue we heard from 20 years ago when  people were like, I don't want the internet in my home. Those people are now in there. They're gone.  They have nothing. They can't. Their kids can't go to school. They can't find jobs. This is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you really think that not having an Amazon Echo or a Google voice assistant in your home  is going to disadvantage you in the years to come?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. In the years to come, not having a credible digital assistant will disadvantage you  in your job. I don't know how much it will disadvantage you at home. Although with the  advances in medicine, like maybe cough to see if you have the flu or COVID, those sorts of things  will roll out to those devices. Yes, I 100% do. And I don't think it's a smart speaker. I think it's  access to a digital assistant. And you can tell I'm passionate because I never yell about these  things. And I threw my bobby pin down. I got all more panicky. This is a universal basic access to

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  an assistant. Yeah, that's it. Well, Marissa Meyer going way back when I remember we talked about  this in the show so many years ago. Oh, I'm doing it again. I'm going back in the years. I just  can't help it. You know, I'm a grandpa. That's what I do. When I talked about hyperlocal, she  said, no, no, no, Jeff, the hyper personal digital assistant. She's had that vision for years and  years and years. But that also requires that the company knows enough about you to be a good  assistant. And you're right. But Stacey, I think Leo's point about Klobuchar is that the irony here  is don't build a walled gardens, interoperate. Okay, says that company. Here we are interoperating.  Well, I'm worried about your interoperations. You can't win. Well, that's your job as a parent. You

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  don't trust that your kids with an overplay. Just fine. You pop your head in the door and you say,  really? And that's what she's doing. She's saying I'm watching you. Okay, that's fair. That's all

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  this letter. That's fair enough. Let's take a little break. It's great to have you here. Matt  cuts formerly administrator of the United States digital service. He is now gainfully unemployed  and having a good time professional vagabond. But could you see yourself as being a CEO? Would

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you like to be a CEO? I mean, it's next for you, isn't it? No, no, I will. That's what comes after  Colonel. That's what comes after going back into the tech industry. I think all the stuff we're  talking about, there's a, there's a lot of interesting problems to solve in the world that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  aren't strictly strictly technology. So I like that. That's true. We focus so much on technology,  but it isn't the be all and end all by any means. Absolutely. What kind of what at a high level,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  what kind of problems fascinate you these days? Leo is just trying to get to the break. He's just

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff does this to me all the time. Don't worry about it, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, man. Okay. So if you if you if you say the political system is messed up,  you know, and and you don't have good, good legislators who know about how technology works,  like all of these things, all of these, you know, two sides shouting at each other very loudly,  how do you break through that? You know, it's things like money and politics, it's things like  gerrymandering, it's things like, you know, voting, you know, all of this stuff is government is the  people who show up and the people who show up need to represent America and they need to do it  well. And it feels like everybody is tuning out of all the things that are happening in DC. They're  not participating there when they could really make things work a lot better in a lot of cases,  and maybe even lighter touch and maybe a lot more efficient. And it's part of some folk strategy to  make people want to tune out. And that's crazy. That's true. You're absolutely right. We are the  country that put people on the moon. Like, yeah, there's no excuse for us to tune out, we need to  figure out how to fix some of these problems. And it feels like technology could help in some ways.  And there's just so many good hearted people that I've had the privilege of working with and the  honor of working with. And so those kinds of things, how do you know, web spam is people cheating  on Google and in the web search results, right? That's a hairball of evil. Where are the other  hairballs of evil? There's all kinds of people who need help. Sounds like public service might be in

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  your future. Continue in public service. Oh, I'll vote for you. He'll be our representative from  Ottawa. It'll be great. He's our representative from the internet. You know, should there be  internet representative in Congress? I think that's not a bad idea. I think statehood for

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Washington and statehood for the internet. Yeah, yeah, now we're talking. The internet does not

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  want to be part of Congress. That would be phenomenal. Memes going all anyway. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis is also here. Leonard Tao, professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig Newmark  Graduate School of Journalism at CUNY. Great to have you. And of course, Stacy Higginbotham. I  didn't give you guys your due. So let me give you your plugs. Stacy Higginbotham from stacysoniot.com  where everything matters at gigastacy on the Twitter. Don't forget to subscribe to her  newsletter and more. Matters and more. And listen to her great podcast with Kevin Toffle who has  refused to be on this show. And now I think I know why. So he's pursuing a graduate degree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, is that it? Oh, yeah, sure. And I need Kevin's advice for Chromebooks. Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  about Chromebooks.com. You have time for your blog. No, no, we asked, we've asked. And he said,  no, I'm just he said literally, I'm too busy with my masters. So I understand that he's going to be  a teacher. Is that his goal? He's getting a credential? He? Well, he wants to teach at

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  his local community college because he's done enough classes there and he helps work with the  kids there. So great calls them as young links. It's really nice. And they're getting great jobs.  And he just wants to like, just to like, help people succeed. I love him so much. He's like  a good person. He's kind of the Mac cuts of Python. Yeah. He's attacking smaller hairball

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  colleges. Yeah, little hairballs, little bitty hairballs. Every hairball matters. Every hairball

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  is made up of a lot of little hairballs. Yeah, little hairballs. Hairballs all the way down.

Headless body and topless bar.  That was the New York Post. New York Post, yes. I think this is a rival from the New York Times.  When an eel climbs a ramp to eat squid from a clamp, that's amore.  I really did appreciate that person. Isn't that a great headline? Let me give credit to, oops.  You think it's the copy editor or the writer? Oh, copy editor. Oh, yeah. Yeah, the writers had a real

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  publication, professionals, Ray, or had that for you. You can suggest it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not Sabrina Imler. Sabrina Imler has a story about, this is it, an eel  that is eating in public. When an eel wants a squid that's on land, God forbid, that's amore.  It's amore eel. And actually, scientists are very excited about this video because  they were able to get the moray to emerge to eat this food so that they can see its second set of jaws  slurping it down after the first set of jaws gets it. It's a snowflake moray eel named Chani.  It bites a squid. It's a little too cuddly a name for a moray eel. Sorry. No, I got it.  It's the secret set of jaws that evolutionary biologists at UCSC were trying to film and they  succeeded. Congratulations to Dr. Rita S. Mehta, the pharyngeal jaw, no longer a mystery.  I just wanted to read that headline out loud. That's all. It's a great story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just want to appreciate there are people in this world who are dedicated to finding this stuff out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love that the world has people like this. This is her life work, Dr. Mehta. In 2007, she  was the first to describe the pharyngeal jaws, but she's been trying to get a video of it.  They finally figured out if you make it come up a ramp, there's a whole thing. I think it should be

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  on TikTok myself. I've been after this because I'm trying to prove Sasquatch exists. All of my  research efforts. Nothing has come of that. That's secretly why I moved up to Seattle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Y'all. The truth comes out. Are you sincere? Because I have a friend, we call him Squatch.  He used to be one of the hosts on tech TV, Scott Harriot, who has retired from television to pursue  his life's goal of proving Sasquatch's existence. Sincerely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay. This is not one of my sincere, but I like that there are people out there who are  working on this. I was just trying to think of something we don't know about that we haven't  filmed yet. Santa Claus was the first thing. And then I was like, eh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. If you want to know more, go to his website, squatchfilms.com. I am not kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The thing is, you know, Squatch is living his best life. Squatch is probably not worried about  regulatory regimes. He doesn't need to worry about censoring the internet. No, no. Squatch

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  is just, he's loving life. I think you'll be interested in Scott's kind of magnum opus,  which is called a Squatchalypse Now. Don't get me ideas. Oh, I love it.  Available for rental. There's also a DVD and a Blu-ray if you want. There's Scott in the middle

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  there doing pushups. Looking quite happy. That's right. He's actually, he was a-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Does Sasquatch wear Crocs? That would make sense. Is that why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know what the Croc deal is. They're using them so that they can do their pushups, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I, you know, it's, what can I say? What can I say? How did we get onto this? Oh yeah, Amore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Amore. Moving on. Let's see. Chromebooks. You wanted to talk about Chromebooks. It happened today.  Samsung has slipped out a new Chromebook, the Galaxy Chromebook Go with a 14-inch  display and Intel Celeron quietly launched. It is, yes, I'm sorry to say, Jeff. Jeff doesn't  want an affordable Chromebook. No, no, I want a ripoff Chromebook. I absolutely want a ripoff.  He doesn't want to save money. No, no, no, no, no. Only the best for Jeff.  Some sacrifices have been made in this Chromebook, although you can't get eight gigs of RAM,  but it is, yes, it's a lower cost Chromebook Go. Sorry. Sorry.  I think that the man has the best Chromebook out there, the Acer Spin. Is it the 715? Is that what

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it is? 713, I think. 713, yeah. 713. How's the keyboard, Matt? I wasn't as crazy about that  when I went to Best Buy and bothered the Google guy. It's okay, you know. It's no Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's okay. It's what we have to do. Do the best you can with what you have where you are, right?  So until Google gets its innovation together. Were you tempted by the Google Go at all?  I tried it and gave it to my mom, I think. That's the laptop, not the, what am I talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You tried it, didn't like it,  and so you gave it to your mother? That seems-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did. I'm going to own it. I'm going to own it. So there was an incident. There was a caller who  said that, hey, your computer has a virus, so you clearly need to go to this website.  Oh. And so that Windows computer was radioactive, or at least that's what I said,  please don't pass this on to my mom. And I'm like, well, we're done with Windows. I guess we got to  switch to Chromebooks. And so the timing just happened to work out where I was like, I'll try  it and if I like it, great. And if I don't, then- It's yours.  Since mom, you know, the trickle down effect. We all do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh no. All my laptops go to somebody else. That's right. Yeah.  Usually not within a few minutes, but-  Guilty.  Usually I get to use it for a while. Actually, Windows 11 comes out tomorrow. We're going to be  doing a special tomorrow morning, 8 a.m. Pacific, 11 a.m. Eastern. Panos Panay and the Microsoft  team are going to announce the next version of Windows. We'll be covering it. Paul Thirott,  Mary Jo Foley will join me for that live coverage and then we'll do a special Windows  Weekly shortly after talking about the brand new version of Windows.  Here's a good business. A CCTV, a closed circuit TV company, is paying remote workers in India to  yell at armed robbers. Maybe we should play this video. Oh, you have to contact them for demos.  Shoot. I think there was too much-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My favorite part about- Go ahead.  Oh, sorry. I was going to say my favorite part about this story is it drives home the fact that  right now a lot of what we think of as super advanced AI and robotics is really just people.  Yeah.  So dude in India is shouting at people who are robbing stores. There's a laundry folding robot  that's really just a person that controls the robot arms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's not going to ever-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's somebody who calls the restaurant for you when you think the machine is doing anything.  Yeah. That's a-  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a duplex. So in a short closed circuit TV video, a clerk at a small convenience store  can be seen- I wish we could play these, but I guess too many people were downloading it.  This is from Motherboard's vice. Vice's motherboard, I should say. Can be seen taking  a bottle of coffee from a cooler and drinking it when he returns to the cash register. An  unseen person's voice emits from a speaker on the ceiling and asks him, did you scan and pay for that  item? In another video, a cashier standing behind the counter talking to someone just out of frame,  there's a ding sound and the voice from above questions the cashier about who is that guy?  He's there to give the cashier a ride at the end of his shift and orders the man to stand on the  other side of the counter. Washington based live eye surveillance, $399, $399 a month.  Some poor guy in Karnal, India watches the feed from your business 24 seven and then  compress a button and say, Hey, maybe there's audio in this. Let's see here. Let's see.  Oh, it's a robbery in progress. Well, what's the guy in India going to do about that?  Hey, stop it. Knock it off. I'm coming here from India to get you.  No. Okay. That was just a little bit of an accent. Just a small accent. It would be so much more  funny if I did it in the Simpsons. Oh my God. These are terrible. What are these videos?  I don't want to see these. This is awful. I'm not sure this is going to be helpful. No.  The live eye system dings and a voice informs the robbers. The police have been called and they run  out of the store. What wimps. Here it is. Let him do the accent.  And they run out. They leave. They go, what? Oh, okay. Nevermind.  Registration number. Wow. I wonder how much he makes per hour for doing.  Nothing. Yep. Let's see. Hyundai has bought Boston Robotics. That's really interesting.  $880 million. The Korean auto manufacturers bought them. They bought a controlling stake,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but didn't they already have a stake too? Oh, let's see. Hyundai Motors, Hyundai Mobus,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hyundai Glovis and Hyundai Motor Group Chairman will have 30%, 20%, 10% and 20% respectively.  30, 50, 60, 80% total. Carry the one. So $800 million out of their $1.1 billion valuation. I  don't know who has the remaining 30%. I like this story. I see robots walking to Pyongyang.  Yeah. I don't know what's going to happen. That's interesting. I like this story. This is really an  interesting unintended consequence story. In Argentina in the mid 2010s, the government was  giving netbooks to kids in the slums to wire them up. And as a result, these kids started making  music and some of these kids are now massive stars in Argentina thanks to these inexpensive,  basic computers that they were given when they were young.  I think that's a really great story. By the way, SoftBank owns the remaining 20% of the cost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the deal was announced in December and just closed. I'm done now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm just behind. I'm just behind. That's all. She Googled it. When he first opened his Conectar  netbook in 2014, the 10-inch black screen reflected Mateo Palacios Corazines' face back at him,  a 12-year-old boy from La Boca, one of Buenos Aires' historic slums, about to turn on his first  computer. What neither he nor those who had handed out the device knew was that a new era of Argentine  music was about to be launched. But that one gig RAM machine, Mateo became a star using his netbook  as a makeshift computer. He is now known as Trueno, one of the fastest rising...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not a makeshift computer. It's a real computer. Makeshift Studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Makeshift Studio. Well, the netbook is not exactly a real computer, let me tell you.  But you know what? That's the point, right? The cheap computer, but it did the job.  He's one of the fastest rising stars in Latin American rap.  Pretty good story. This is from restoftheworld.org reporting global tech stories.  Through this I discovered that. I didn't know Rest of the World.  I feel like we've interviewed somebody who is involved with this, but I can't remember.  A program or restoftheworld.org?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Rest of the World. Somebody from this has been on our shows or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it's Toby Schmidt.  Oh, it's Sophie Schmidt.  Louise Massacos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, okay. It's also from Sophie Schmidt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Sophie Schmidt. Yeah.  That's where I heard of her.  So, yeah. Michael Donahoe.  Yeah. So a lot of the people that we know, this was started to give a voice to some of these  really interesting stories that just don't get covered in mainstream press in the US.  Restoftheworld.org. Give them a little plug.  Let's see what else here that we have. What else? Peloton. Did you see this? Wow.  So Peloton, which is the bicycle company, they do a spin bike. Actually, full disclaimer,  have a Peloton bike for which I pay $40 a month for spin classes I never take.  But I think that's a fair deal. They also made a treadmill somewhat later.  And the treadmill had, I mean, on my Peloton spin bike, I could do a spin class. In fact,  I could sit on the bike, spin and use somebody else's spin classes on my TV,  like Apple's fitness classes. The Peloton treadmill had a just run feature.  But unfortunately, following the tragic death of a six-year-old and 72 injuries,  including broken bones, cuts and grazes, Peloton had to recall the treadmill. And as part of the  recall, they said, we're going to introduce new features to improve the safety. One of the  features is treadlock, which locks the treadmill behind a passcode when idle so kids can't come in  and use it. However, it's only available to Peloton subscribers. So you can no longer just  run on this treadmill. You have to pay a $40 subscription fee. You want to go after an evil  company. If you want to lock it, correct? No, if you want to use it. If you want to use it.  Oh, you can't, you can no longer use the treadmill unless you're a subscriber. It's just a dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Remember how I said our hardware devices are becoming software services and we need to talk  about how to regulate that from a consumer point of view. People are very upset. Brianna Wu tweeted,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  wow, the Peloton tread will no longer allow you to use your $3,000 treadmill without a $40 a month  subscription. The pretext is their design issues led to a child's death. Somebody responded to her,  the ransomware business model is quite lucrative. Peloton understands this is a public relations  problem. They are giving three months free to tread plus owners. But I would be curious,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  how many people, the bike you were charged for the bike on a monthly basis? Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No. So you buy the treadmill, the hardware for $3,000. The classes are an additional $40 a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the treadmill. But on the bike, can you just ride the bike without the classes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No child has been injured with the bike, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm just trying to figure out what percentage of Peloton owners, the bike owners,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  don't pay for a subscription. Oh, I bet you a lot of them. You know how it is. You buy exercise  equipment, you spend the money on it for a while. Then you just, I'm not using it that much. I stop  the subscription, but I still have a spin bike, which I can use as a spin bike with some other  input or just to ride it. But not the case with this treadmill. Peloton did say that they have a  voluntary recall where you can return your tread plus for a full refund by contacting  members support. So you can get your money back. Well, then that's fine. Then basically what they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  doing is they're changing the terms upon which you would buy this device. That's right. And as  long as they're saying you can give it back. I mean, of course, I would require them to pay  shipping back to them because that is not cheap. It's expensive. We had to have a Peloton person

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  come and install it. There's a whole thing. It's expensive to ship. It's an installation process.  Don't piss off Bradley. This is a great story. It's such a good story. I'm a fan of the Atari  because my first personal computer was an Atari 400 back in the late seventies and then an Atari  800. It kind of got me into the thing. There is a guy who has bought up all of the new remaining  parts. He has a warehouse in San Jose, the world's largest remaining collection of factory original  replacement Atari parts. It's called best electronics, but apparently he's the soup  Nancy of Atari parts. You have to be nice because most of Kota's customers adore him. Right? Spice.  He's a skilled service technician with an encyclopedic knowledge of Atari systems.  He helps customers put the joy back in their joysticks with fresh replacement circuit boards.  He's been known to diagnose complex Atari ailments over the phone. He even occasionally  produces his own fresh runs of crucial replacement parts when his vintage stock runs dry. But even  those who love buying from Kota admit they experience a slight tingling of animal fear  every time they order from best electronics. If you call him too many times a month, he gets  annoyed with you. If you try to order too many things, he gets annoyed with you. It just comes  down to having to adapt the way he does business. But once you're on his list, it's really hard to  get off. He's famous for ignoring and blacklisting badly behaved customers as he is for selling  Atari parts. Learn the rules or accept your fate. This is what I love about technology. These guys,  he's been keeping this for decades. He's been keeping this alive. He will not accept PayPal  orders under $50. That's it. Just won't. Do not buy more than a few items at a time. He will not  handle large orders. Repeated attempts to convince him to make an exception will cause your future

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  emails to be ignored. Well, and the reporter reached out to him and was like, can I do an

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  interview? And the guy blacklisted the reporter. We're all blacklisted now by the way. I hope you  don't have an Atari computer. You want to repair? Wow. I know I love this guy. I would, I will,  I will Bradley, you're on our show anytime you want to come on. I admire you for doing that.  I really loved my Atari computer, although I don't have one. I maybe I could, I wonder if he sells

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  whole computers. Yeah. He sold out now. Huh?  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Samsung, we did mention, I should have mentioned this when I mentioned the new Chromebook,  Samsung is having an event. Jason, I don't know if Jason decided we want to cover this or not. I  think what we're not going to cover it, but we'll do a tech break right after June 28th. This is their  mobile world Congress event announcing their new Android wear ish watches. Remember Samsung was  using Tizen as its watch operating system. Problem was they didn't have access to the Google play  store. Google at IO announced, and I don't really understand what they mean. They're going to merge  where OS and ties in together so that the new galaxy watches will run apps from the wear store,  which makes me think that it's just galaxy wear, but okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm confused because I thought they were getting, they were merging with the,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they use the word merge, but we were confused when this was launched and announced and  Leo had thoughts that basically Tizen goes away. Yeah. And we're just waiting to see what it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  actually goes away. One of them goes away and it's well, it won't be where going away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Should go away. But the wear has the play store and that was the things galaxy watches were suffering  from is you couldn't add other apps. You had very limited apps. I don't know. Do you wear an Android  wear watch? Anybody? Anybody? Android wear. Anybody? Garmin. Nobody. Garmin. Oh, you're a  runner, Matt. That's it. That's the sign that you're a runner. Slow runner. Slow runner. I get,  I get vaccine donuts every run. When you were, oh, that's right. Yeah. Yeah. Are you training

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  for a marathon? You said so they haven't been doing marathons for a year and they just have  started to ramp back up. So I've got friends in California, one who wants to run a marathon in  every state. And she said, you know, Vermont in September. And I'm like, that gives me some time  to train and Vermont's pretty close to Canada, which you can just run up to Canada. That would  be like a four day run, but yeah, you could do that. Yeah. You know, 30 day challenge. You could  do that. Yeah. Long run, but yes, hopefully going to do another marathon soon and get back into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you at the Krispy Kreme by the DuPont circle subway stop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. I love that. Krispy Kreme. It's such a good one. And they know you now, like I walk in and I  just start to reach for my wallet and they're like vaccine donut. I'm like, yeah, I don't even  have to bring out the photocopy of vaccine donut. Yeah. Yeah. They have a pile. They have a pile with  bags. They're just like, here's your vaccine. Here's your vaccine donut. Enjoy it. You know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the idea was you'd come and buy 13 of them. All right. How do you know that Krispy Kreme,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stacy? Did you spend time on DuPont circle? I, A, every now and then I visited Washington,  DC for my job and stayed around there, but B, we did our baby moon and we stayed right by there.  And every day, every trip we took, we went by it and walked in and bought it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Donuts make everything better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was pregnant. So the fact that I gained like 10 pounds on that trip for beating Krispy Kremes,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that was fine. Let me just see. According to Google maps, it's going to take me 43 hours to  drive there via I-80, but I could be there in four days, Matt. I'll just send you Krispy Kreme donuts.  I'll get my free donuts. No, they're no good mailed. You got to get them fresh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no. If you put them in the microwave for eight seconds,  really, they're fine. You're kidding. Depends on your microwave between seven and nine seconds,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  depending on how many watts your microwave is. Then Stacy has a controlled hot sign in the window

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that starts flashing. Wow. Wow. So Stacy, speaking of hot, you were in Austin and it was pretty warm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're having a heat wave, right? Yeah. So I didn't notice it was any warmer than it.  It's always warm. It was just like, oh, it's summer in Austin. But it was hot and apparently  the grid was having some issues. So two things came out of this. One, I talked to a lot of my  former neighbors and friends about the Texas utility grid because they had their thing in February.  But two, I started seeing these stories about everyone's smart thermostats taken over their  house and turned into the heater or AC up. Yeah, turn it up. Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And my friends didn't have this problem. So I was really confused when I started seeing all these  pissed off stories and I was like, what is happening? And here's the deal. People were like,  I can't believe I signed up for a smart thermostat. This is not the smart thermostats  fault. It's energy hubs fault. It's energy hubs fault. So I participated in a demand response  program. I participated actually in one of Austin Energy's first ones, like before 2004.  ERCOT is the energy, they manage the energy grid in Texas.  Okay. Because they were in the news, of course, but when it got really cold in Texas  a couple of months ago. That's because ERCOT is the managing, that's because the Texas grid does  not attach to many other grids and ERCOT is the entity that runs it. And the reason why we had  such, sorry, Texas had such issues during the freeze is because they couldn't borrow power  from anybody else. It's not the only reason. Anyway. Okay. So this issue, it's not your smart  thermostat. It's how your energy company implements the program. And in Austin, you got an $80 rebate  if you signed up for this program. So they agreed for 80 bucks.  Hold on. Hold on. This is back to my favorite thing. I know I talk too much. Just hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I'm the one who talks too much. You don't talk too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I paid or I bought my thermostat. They gave me an $80 discount for every one of these. And they said,  this is how it's going to work. When they started a demand response incident. So every afternoon,  they were like, Oh crap, we've got to shed load. I would get an email and my nest or my ecobee  would show me via a notification on the device and via a notification on my phone saying,  Hey, we're going to change your thermostat. At that point in time, you could opt out or you could do  something like turn your thermostat down a little bit because they would only move it up by four  degrees. So if you wanted it to stay 78, but you still wanted to feel like you were helping,  you could do whatever. Anyway. So wait a minute. So you could override what they did. So they

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  turn it up and then you just go over there and turn it down again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You could only override it if you caught it in time. Once the demand response started,  you were just like hosed. Okay. So you got a few hours to do this. You agreed to do it.  Yes. And you agreed now. Austin energy is a municipally owned energy company and they have,  I would say an incentive to not piss off their rate payers and the taxpayers.  In Texas, much of the energy market is deregulated and you have power companies and then you have  third party providers like energy hub, which they're not the power company. They're just  the management company. They're just a management company that manages their demand response.  And they signed up people by offering them the chance to enter a $5,000 sweepstakes.  And they said, Hey, do you want to win $5,000? Because if you do, you should totally participate  in demand response. It's going to be amazing. And you could use your smart thermostat and blah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  blah, blah. What was the economic incentives? Was there some sort of pitch that like why this  would be good for you? It's good for obviously it's good for the neighborhood. So this, this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  gets into one of my big things. So I think not all these programs should be very transparent. I  think if you're going to have an unregulated industry tricking people using everybody's  favorite dark patterns, that's a bad sign. And people are going to be pissed. And you're,  and this is ultimately, and here comes my thing bad for all of us, because as Texas so recently  discovered, you need when you've got to shed load, you're it's like, it's like public health,  everyone has to shed load. You all have to behave well in here in California, they just turn off

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  your electricity. Well, that's a slightly that's a wildfire issue. But literally, we sit around here  during the summer months and wait to see if the power is going to get turned off. They call it a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  public safety power shutoff, or PAPS or PSPS. And you know what, Texas could go that way because of  these stupidly implemented programs, because at a certain point in time, it is a health issue to say,  it's going to be 100 degrees outside, and you're not we're not gonna have power. Yeah, this whole  story in the way it was covered is just so appalling, because we did nothing to we just  outrage outrage, we did nothing to educate people. We did nothing to point. I'm not assigning blame,  like, they suck. I'm assigning blame like you would for an engineering issue. It wasn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  got to figure out what the problem was to fix it. No, I think I agree with you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  It was a miscommunication. But it was duplicitous. Because they use dark because they use dark

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  patterns. Yes. I mean, the way my utility did it. Everyone I talked to in Austin, they like I mean,  I was hanging out with friends. They're like, Oh, we got to go out tonight to you know, we can't stay  at the house because it's a demand response event. We got to go. I was like, Oh, yeah, we got to go.  Oh, wow. Everybody knew. They knew. Wow. Because they were told and they signed up and they knew  about it. And they acted like responsible people because of it. Right. Right. Okay, sorry. It was

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a very bad week for Bitcoin this week. In a number of interesting ways. So the price obviously went  down. But that's not really the main thing. China is shutting down over 90% of its Bitcoin mining  capacity. China just kind of woke up to the fact that most Bitcoin miners are in China,  and many of them in Sichuan province. And they were closed on Sunday, an intensified nationwide  crackdown against cryptocurrency, mining, that's a lot of capacity so much so that the hash rate,  the rate at which transactions and new Bitcoin are mined has dropped by 50%.  Whoops. That's an ad not there we go. There's my by 50%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Dumb Jeff moment here. I would think that when the supply is down, the price would go up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it doesn't work that way. Oh, isn't that cute? No, the price for Bitcoin has nothing to do with

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  anything, including how much Bitcoin there is. However, I have to say it feels like this could  be a risky thing for Bitcoin because it is true that if you make less money, you don't get less  incentive to be a miner only. Right now, the reason there were so many in Sichuan provinces,  because energy was very cheap. And so it is the case that if the price of Bitcoin goes down,  your incentive to mine goes down, which means you may have fewer miners, which, at that point,  means the hash rate slows down, which means transactions slow down, Bitcoin becomes more  of a hassle. It is kind of a bad negative spiral, a negative circle. And then there's just bad news  in general. In South Africa, there were two brothers who were creating a Bitcoin investment fund.  They had raised 69,000 Bitcoins worth about almost $4 billion. They've disappeared now  with the Bitcoin. They're with Sasquatch. They're living with BD Cooper and Sasquatch up in the  Pacific North. They went to the work on lab and they got some viruses and then they went to see  So this is another bad thing that happens sometimes. I think it shakes confidence in it. So  all of this together might not be, I wouldn't be buying a lot of Bitcoin right now. Let's put it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I put up just a little GIF of the falls on a tweet that I just said, and oh, the cyber boys  are so sensitive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah, because you're hitting them where it hurts in the bread basket there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I lost two. My $500 that became like $12,000 is now down to $4,000, but fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's part of the problem with the cryptocurrency is, unlike stocks where the movement's sort of  tied to the performance of a company, unless you're GameStop or AMC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait, wait, no, no, no. We had this argument like a month ago and you're like, it's nothing.  Nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Prove it to me. But anyway, I mean, it's kind of sort of tied to it. But I mean, Bitcoin,  what is the price? It's whatever people pay, I guess, which is volatile. Let's put it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is capitalism at its finest.  It's fine. It's pure capitalism.  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. How much? How high can we go? All right, let's do a change log. What do you say? And then  we can wrap this thing up. You want to play that music there, Burke? I don't have a long change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's because you were lazy. You put it together.  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, because I have the strongly held, if not factually based position that Google's not doing  nothing. So why are we even doing a change log? No, they do some things. For instance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I tell you, the next thing that's going to come is Stacey's, we're getting canceled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That mean wait a minute, this one I did last week. I can't, I got to, I need newer stuff.  That's an old one. Here. We'll put this together.  You're right. This is terrible. Chromebooks getting a new update for the hybrid classroom,  some new features in Chromebooks, automatic updates for eight years on devices. I think  that's very, very good. They're going to roll out in August, pin logins for education users as part  of the device setup. That'll make it easy. You don't have to, you know, I always a little bit  of a problem with a Chromebook is you had to enter your Google password or if you had an  Android phone, you could pair it to it and that worked. But now you can just type in a simple  six digit pin. So when they set up, when students set up their Chromebook, they'll be prompted to  set up their pin. I think that's a good thing. Chromebooks will have the live caption feature  now. That's we've heard that I think at Google IO for students who need alternate input into  their Chromebook. There's switch access. There's a full screen magnifier to help users better  understand the screen reader Chrome Vox. They've released new tutorials. So all of this, it's,  it's time to think about back to school already. Sorry kids. And Chromebooks are getting some new  updates for the high year long snow day is over. Yeah. And two days ago, Monday was, I didn't know  this world music day, also known as Fete de la Musique, an annual celebration of music,  Google arts and culture created a Fete de la Musique music party, two new experiments, paint  with music and assisted melody. You want to try some of these? Let's do paint with music.  All right. We're loading right now. Turn on my sound Burke. This is a, one of those Google  experiments at arts and culture.google.com. What do you want in the sky, underwater, on the street  or on paper? Underwater reminds me of more a yields. Yes, that's some, oh, so now you can choose your  instrument down here. Flute, saxophone, trumpet, violin. I want blobs or wales.  There's that's a whale.  That's a violin. Sounds just like the whale. Oh, there it is. That sounded like a whale.  Oh, that's cool. So I'm drawing and then it plays later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is really boring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't piss on your Gutenberg story.  It ain't no, you're right. It ain't no blob orchestra. I'll grant you that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll grant you that. By the way. Yeah. I mean, blob is worth at least one bad eye. Oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  no, that's true. How about assisted melody? This was actually launched a year ago, but for world  music day, there's a new version. So let's try this. Let's see how boring this will be. You can,  we played, we played with this, I think when it came out. So you want to compose on box organ.  That sounds painful. Can't help yourself. No, not with the word organ. Now let's harmonize.  Box. Well, get on over here. Training. So this, this has been, this,  look at that. I wrote that.  That was Bocch. Do you want to, do you want to try Mozart? Okay. Let's play Mozart's harpsichord.  All right. Now we're going to harmonize and see what happens. It's the computer is working  harmonizing, harmonizing. It's a lot of work to harmonize that one. Show the computer  harmonizing. They apparently didn't give it the best. Here we go. Here we go.  Okay.  See, if I actually could play the piano, this might be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And this sort of, that was on a discord note there. Yeah. Well, I was trying to avoid that,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but that's why I didn't think so long. You want to try new harmony with the help of  Beethoven? Sure. Why not? Let's harmonize. Beethoven. Now, ladies and gentlemen, I give you  arts and culture experiment assisted melody. I will now play in the style of Ludwig von.  That was pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's about all it married. Well, that change got two huss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll bet a young kid could probably play with that for three hours though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like I'm making music. Yeah. She, this sort of stuff. That's all I got. That's the Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  change log. That's the most pathetic Google change log. I told you it's Sundar Pichai's fault. Blame  Sundar. It's his fault. No, no, don't start it over. That was enough.  Warren Buffett is resigning from the Gates Foundation and has donated 4.1 billion with a B  dollars. He has been inactive. He said in a statement for some time, his decision to step  down comes at an uncertain time for the foundation. Of course the Gates are divorcing for years,  says Warren. I've been a trustee and inactive trustee at that of only one recipient of my funds,  the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation. I'm now resigning from that post as I, just as I've done  at all corporate boards other than Berkshires. But he's 90 years old. I don't blame him. I mean,  I'm amazed that he's this energetic and he's given away 4.1 billion dollars of Berkshire  Atheway shares. His goal, of course, as part of the giving pledge is to give away 99%

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  of his fortune. He says he's about halfway there. I love the quote at the end of that article though,  because he said something like, no matter how you slice it, I'm past the fourth quarter and into

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  bonus time or overtime. I'm really impressed, especially since he has, apparently he has an  Egg McMuffin for breakfast every day. I don't know how he's doing it. He's, you know, he loves  his McDonald's. I guess he owns some portion of it. I don't know. Has a coke with it. Leo,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  have you ever gone to Berkshire Hathaway days? No, have you? Yeah, I spent some time in Nebraska.  How fun. It was the highlight of the year. They've got like Seas, Canny, all the different

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  companies at Berkshire Hathaway invest in. They have booths from all the different companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow. How fun. Yeah, it was fun. You know, Bill Gates would come and they would have a newspaper  throwing contest in the Invention Center. It was actually a lot of fun stuff. It's very folksy,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  very down home. Yeah. Yeah. That's nice. That's really cool. That's really cute. All right. Let's  take a little break and then I can't believe it. This has been so much fun having you here,  man. I can't believe we're at the end of the show, but we will give you a final chance to make a pick  or a suggestion or tell people to go to usds.org, whatever that may be. Our picks of the week coming  up in just a bit, but I want to show you my pick. I'm getting ready. You know, we're going to Hawaii  in a few weeks, July 12th, and I'm getting the sport clothing together. Some people I know are  getting ready for going back to work, maybe getting some dressier shirts. Can I recommend  Untuck It? Untuck It shirts are exactly what you need to transition back to the things we've been  missing, whether it's dinner with friends, reuniting with family, and especially vacations.  Untuck It made its name designing shirts that are worn to be untucked because the untucked shirt is  a tough style to get right. My son hates it when I tuck in my shirt. And so he said, get that,  get Untuck It. It has that just right length, fits all shapes and sizes, helps you look sharp,  but also relaxed at your most casual. Now I'm wearing a performance shirt. They wick sweat.  They're very cool when it's really hot. They also have short sleeve button downs and polos that are  made to beat the heat. I have, I just recently discovered, I have a number, a lot of Untuck It  shirts, but I recently discovered they have linen shirts and I have bought a half dozen linen shirts  for the trip to Hawaii because they're so cool. They look great, but they breathe. I love linen.  They have all sizes and shapes all the way up to triple XL. They have slim, relaxed, and tall fits.  So it's really easy to get something that works just right for you, whether you like a  snug fit or you want something a little looser and relaxed. And let's see, what else can I tell you?  They are kind of obsessive about the quality and you can really tell when you get these shirts.  They really are well made. Untuck It tests every batch of fabric to ensure the best possible  quality and consistency. All of their button downs, polos, tees, hand lays and more have that just  right length. They fit perfectly. The material is fantastic. They have the highest quality control  in the industry. Every aspect of the shirts checked five times to ensure they retain shape,  color and strength. And they have outstanding customer service. So if you ever have a problem,  it's so easy to get it made right. If you're looking for shirts to return to the office,  I really love Untuck It's wrinkle-free collection. I take advantage of that because  ain't nobody got time to iron shirts. Whether you prefer short or long sleeves, you're ready to get  back to work. There are Untuck It stores. They're all over the place, 85 of them nationwide. But you  can also go online at untuckit.com. Free returns and exchanges, no risk at all. Great time now as  we get ready to go back into the real world to try out an Untuck It shirt that's just right for you.  We've got a great deal too. Our offer code TWIT gets you 20% off your first purchase at untuckit.com.  I am such a fan. Untuckit.com. Use the code TWIT. Everything I wear in Hawaii is going to be  Untuck It. Untuck It shirts designed to be worn untucked and they are well made and they look good  too. I'm a big fan. It is time to wrap things up with Stacey's thing. What do you got for us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This week's thing is not a thing. This week's thing is only for Android people and Google people.  But I figured this was the place for it. I tried out Google launched something called Pace Walking.  And basically this is a metronome for walking. You can listen to your podcast. You can do  whatever else you want. But it's like to help you set a pace. Yeah, it's a little less obtrusive.  And it's in the Google Fit app, which I actually had to go and redownload because I never use Google.  Oh, I use Google. Yeah, I love Google Fit. So if you use it, great. It's just a little widget or  a little card in the screen. I don't know what you call these anymore. So does it make you walk

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  fast? Because I'm a stroller. Lisa doesn't like it. I don't walk real fast. What you do is you set a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  pace. So it gives you the option to try Pace Walking and it says for you can go, I don't know  how low you can go, but the base is 100. And that's a decent. 100 steps a minute. Okay. Yeah,  100 steps a minute. I walk, I naturally walk about 110 steps a minute, 120 even. So I set  mine a little higher and you can figure this. I mean, just play with it. It's free. But I,  I walk a lot and I walk not necessarily for fitness, but I walk because I get stressed  and anxious. And this is a really nice way to like, do you have to wear headphones? I guess you do,  right? Yes. But you, like I said, you can still listen to whatever you want in addition to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you try to take a step for every tick or whatever. Is it a beep?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, it's a tick. Here, let's see. I don't know if I can play it over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Probably not. Yeah. Here. Three, two, one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh no, it's going over my, I'm A, not walking and B, I'm not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have to actually leave us to demonstrate this. So please don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So anyway, but like, I mean, again, this is not for everyone, but try it. I mean,  it's there. Try it out. If it works for you. I found it to be like, I listen to podcasts and walk  and it's helpful to keep my pace up and kind of feel. I can't be convinced that walking is  actually exercise. It is. I know it is. It is. Yes. For me, it's strenuous.  So yeah, try it out. I mean, it's, they say 150 minutes a week of walking or similar exercise

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  like that, according to the American Heart Association. I walk like more than that. I  walk like 35, 40 miles a week. At least it gets like 10,000 steps just like going around the house.  I don't know how she does it. I'm not, I like to walk, but I know I get a thousand steps. I feel  good. Wednesdays are not my walking step days. I'm stuck here with us. My pick this week is  something I, we've talked about. Brave is a browser before it's based on a Chromium, but it's privacy  focused. I'm actually a big fan of the Brave browser. If you need a Chromium browser, there  are a lot of choices these days, but I like Brave. But they did something interesting.  Most browsers still use Google or Bing as your search engine, or you can use DuckDuckGo,  which kind of still uses Google or Bing. Brave a year or so ago bought Clicks, which was a  third party search engine, and they have just released the beta of the Brave browser, search.brave.com.  Private search. I think at some point they might want to charge for it. I think that they're trying  to figure out a way to monetize without tracking and ads, which I commend them for. Let me search  for something I know intimately. My name, Leo Laporte. I think it does a very good job. It comes  up with, by the way, it also tells you at the bottom of the search how much of this it got with  an anonymized API call to Google and how much of it it generated on its own. It actually does a very  good job. There's even a button that says, find elsewhere on Google, Bing, or Mojik. So if you  didn't get the results that you wanted, you can do more. Notice YouTube videos are there. There is a  kind of a Wikipedia knowledge card, Google-style knowledge card. It has a lot of the features,  knowledge card. It has a lot of the features, safe search, you've got time frames, a lot of the  features, image, news, and video search as well. And then you can also get info about your search.  And I think that's kind of interesting too. I think this does a pretty good job. You want to

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  give me a- Leo, look. I misspelled your name. And then look, it knew it right there. It knew it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It could tell Leo LaPapa Purdy was actually that Leo LaPort. Look up Crispy Cream. I want to see  what it gives you. Let's see what we get for Crispy Cream. It's not Google yet. I mean,  God, it'd be amazing if we're even close. A map. It gets a map. It gets a local- you can choose  whether or not to give it location information. And it can be very general location information.  So that is a local map. And yeah, I think it's a pretty good result actually. Gives me Yelp reviews  and Wikipedia entries. So is that- I was actually impressed given how hard it is to create a new  search engine. This has done a pretty good job. I'm sure there's a way to make it the default in  other browsers, but I'm just using Brave and it's easier just to do that. Here's the information on  your results independence. Privately calculated in your browser, not tracked 89%.  Global results independence anonymous tally from all users not tracked at 87%. So you can really  see- you can get some sense of the privacy of how much was used- Google was used and so forth.  This is really good. I think this is a really interesting attempt to offer search in a private  form. And I think you should give it a try. I've been using it all through the show. Search.google-  I'm sorry, search.brave.com. You could Google it and just say Brave Search and I bet you'd find  it right away. So I'm sorry, Matt, but I know you've done many good things with the Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  search over the years, but- It's all good. It's good to have competition. Yeah. Yes. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jeff, a number. So I follow, as you know, Benedict Evans, because I often get numbers from his  newsletter, but this time it was his Twitter feed. He put up something from the Epic case  that is amazing here. Last year he said Apple took in about 15 billion in commissions from  in-app payments on iOS. On these numbers from 2017, which disclosed in the case,  half of that number came from a half a percent of the accounts spending more than $450 a month.  These are the whales. The Apple Store whales. Somebody said in response to Ben,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that plus does a lot of work. Well, that's really interesting. There are a lot of scam apps,  which Apple has had a hard time getting rid of that charge you like $30 a week and things. So  I wonder if how much of that comes from scam apps. Half the revenue. That's a lot of the revenue.  I fairly notoriously spent a lot of money on donuts in Simpson's donuts. They weren't as good as  the Simpson's. Crispy creams. This was the Simpsons tapped out game. I had a problem.  I might've been one of those $450 a month people at that time.  Nothing wrong with being a whale. You're a whale. I'm a whale. I don't get free drinks or stays in  the Apple Hotel, however. So I'm a little disappointed. You get calorie free donuts.  That's got to count. They are calorie free. They have no flavor whatsoever.  Matt, would you like to share something with us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sure. Would you prefer? Okay. So I have to say if you're a technologist who wants to make the  world a better place instead of working at a tech company, consider doing a tour of public service,  possibly at the U S digital service, USTS.gov. I have to say that they need people to do really  important projects right now. But I can do another thing. Would you rather have a book or a game?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Whatever you got. A game. That sounds interesting. You got a good game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there's this game called you think you know me. And it's really, it's not a competitive game.  You're not going to like slam down the cards and be like, boo, yeah, take that. I win.  It's more of a cooperative game where you try to know more about people. So for example, like I,  if I know if you became the president today, the first thing you'd work on is blank.  I like that. I know you think one of the greatest things ever invented is blank. And if you get it  right, then you get to get rid of that card. And the goal is to get rid of the cards. But really  the goal is just to, it's like a way to do small talk. You can do it with all kinds of people or  people that you know really well and get to know them a lot better. So it's called you think you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  know me. And it's, it's just a delight. It's kind of like the newlywed game in reverse sort of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. I like this. Couple number one. Do you keep it in your dinner table?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We actually do sometimes take them in baggies for a date. So like, if we're like, oh yeah,  we don't have much to talk about. Why don't we just whip out a few cards and try a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to order this right now. This was a Kickstarter. You think you know me dot cards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's really Amy Bayo, who you might know because of Andy Bayo or you might know just  because she's awesome. Is she related to Andy Bayo? I think they are partners. Oh, that's really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love Andy Bayo. Nice. You think you know me dot cards. Well, see, that's really cool.  And Pruitt wanted to put a little plug in ants listening. He's on. He'll be back next week.
