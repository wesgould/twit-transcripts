Joining me right now, Jeff Jarvis, who is home writing today.  Great to see you once again.  Always wonderful.  Thank you.  Blogging at BuzzMachine.com, the author of What Would Google Do?  He is writing his new book, Public Parts, which will hit the public sometime this year,  you think?  Next year.  Next year.  Books take so long.  Thank you.  Stephen Levy calls himself a slow journalist.  He does slow journalism.  Gina Trapani is also here.  Gina is the author of The Complete Guide to Google Wave, a completewaveguide.com, and  also a blogger, one of the founders of Lifehacker.  She's now blogging at SmarterWear.org and Points West.  Good to see you.  Welcome back, Gina.  We missed you last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thanks.  Great to be here.  I missed you guys too.  I didn't have my regular session.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My whole week was thrown off.  Our Google fix.  Our Google fix.  Actually, speaking of fixes, I asked you and you recommended, and I think it's probably  the right thing to do, I've been having my DroidX, which I love.  I still love this phone, but it's been hanging a lot.  It's been like, you know, I've launched mostly text messaging and it goes, and I just have  to wait forever and then I get the, would you like to force close or wait message?  I hate that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is like, that is the application like dialogue of death.  As soon as that happens, I'm just like, ugh.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I actually like it when that happens online because that's what, so when I screw  it up, it clears it up and it comes right back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I have screwed it up in some way.  Yeah, Nexus One, I didn't have that problem.  I think 2.2 is a lot better than 2.1 even, which is running on this DroidX, but I just  did a complete reset, so we'll see if that fixes it or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I saw that, I guess, Froyo came to the Evo, but it's not giving everybody all the  functions.  Oh really?  I didn't see that.  So someone complained they were going to get the keyboard and something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's coming to the Droid today.  It came to the Evo a couple of days ago.  2.2 is coming out now pretty rapidly to a lot of the devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is so great because I was so tired of hearing people crow about the fact that the  Nexus One was the only phone that had 2.2.  I think it was Gruber that was saying, ah, number of phones besides the Nexus One that  have 2.2.  Zero.  And I was like, ugh.  So now it's great that it's kind of out in other places.  So how are they handling it?  Like on the Droid and the Evo, the hotspot, the portable hotspot and those things, are  those things disabled?  Does it depend on the carrier?  Are they customizing the settings?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Depends on the carrier.  Depends on the carrier.  Yeah, I think, forget what I saw this, but yeah, that's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well and I think the other problem is that they couldn't really do anything until 2.2  was open sourced because between HTC Sense, Motorola Blur and whatever Samsung calls there,  I wish they would just throw all this stuff out.  I think one of the reasons I have trouble with the Droid X is it's Motorola's cruddy  SMS seems to be the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the same problem with bloatware of the old days.  They should give you the opportunity to just run Android.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is kind of like all the installware, right, that would come when you got a new PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The more I use it, the more I really feel like we are back to the days of Windows and  Mac.  Android and iPhone, iOS.  It really feels very much like those days and a lot of the benefits and negatives of  Windows are appearing on Android.  It's a very open, free choice marketplace and as a result, there's lots of crapware.  There's lots of dangerous stuff.  Most recently, you probably saw this story, a Chinese free wallpaper application which  gave it's, it was on the Android marketplace.  It's not anymore, but it was on the Android marketplace.  They say now over a million people downloaded it and it gave, it sent passwords, phone  messages, a bunch of stuff via email to the originating site.  It was more worse than spyware.  It was essentially a Trojan.  Of course, the same thing now coming up on the iPhone.  You probably saw jailbreakme.com allows you to do in the iPhone 4 or any iOS 4 device,  in the iPad, so any iOS 3.1 device as well, go to a website, jailbreakme.com and it puts  up a little slider that you slide in jailbreaks.  The reason you can do that is it of course violates Apple's security.  The reason you can do that is it takes advantage of now a well-known hole in Safari that has  to do with PDF and font rendering that allows any site to run arbitrary code on any iPhone  or iPad.  In this case, it's benign.  It's a jailbreak.  In fact, it's really benign because the jailbreak then allows you to go to the Sidiya marketplace  where Sorik has not kindly put a fix for the hole that allowed the jailbreak in the first  place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is the best story ever.  Is that meta?  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You want to fix your phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You want to be secure?  Well, Apple doesn't have a fix yet, but if you jailbreak it, you can then fix it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exploit the vulnerability to fix the vulnerability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now there is, according to Android Tap, and I thank the chat room for passing this along,  now there's supposedly this story of wallpaper has been debunked.  I don't really know.  VentureBeat had the original article that the wallpaper created by Jackie was sending  information to China, Chinese website imnet.us.  Wall Street Journal repeated it.  CNET, Fast Company, Fortune, PC World, Computer World, Gizmodo, Apple Insider, and Leo Laporte  all jumped on the gun reporting the issue.  But the developer has a response and he denies it.  Look out, which is a program I have run on my Android phone.  It's an Any Malware application.  It was the one that caught this program.  You know, I guess I'm going to just say, I don't know.  But it does remain.  That's right.  The fact remains that even if this didn't, it could easily happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This could happen, right?  And this is kind of my top wishlist for Android security is that when you install an app and  it says, hey, I need access to your network, your location, your contacts, your network  activity, I wish that there was a way that the app could briefly, you know, very succinctly,  just explain why.  You know, like you install the Pandora app and it says, I need access to your contacts  list.  Well, why?  Why would you need that?  It's like, it says, you know what, we want it to be easy for you to share a playlist  with your friends via email.  That's why we need your contacts list.  It's like, oh, OK, that seems reasonable.  I mean, I don't know if that would fix the problem, but if you're installing a wallpaper,  you know, are you going to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You wouldn't give it network resources.  You wouldn't say, oh, you're going to send email?  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, it doesn't fix it in the sense that they could ask for these permissions.  Most people ignore it.  And maybe it has a seemingly legitimate reason to ask for those permissions and you would  say, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  You can always fake the reason, right?  But I mean, as someone who is, you know, kind of aware and very paranoid, I like to think  helpfully so.  But, you know, I OK through those permissions and think, why does this app need this?  And I wish I didn't have to dig around to kind of figure that out.  Still, this could happen.  The wallpaper thing could happen.  It could happen on the iPhone as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It has happened on the iPhone.  I mean, in a way, that's what this jailbreak is.  And there was a case a couple of weeks ago on the iPhone where somebody was sending iTunes  passwords out and, you know, was collecting iTunes passwords.  Here's the thing.  I think we've been app happy, haven't we?  Let's blame ourselves.  We've been app happy.  We've installed anything we want, like crazy, hundreds of apps.  You know, I've got close to 100 apps on my Android phone, according to AppBrain, and  many of them are free.  Why not?  And so maybe we can't be so app happy now.  We have to be a little bit judicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe you go to the to the Jonathan Zittrain view, which is that you need a safe spot and  then a sandbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and we talked about this on the security show today.  And the point was made that, well, the problem is it's a false sense of security because  even with Apple's draconian protection, stuff got through.  So there's no way unless you have source code, and you spend a lot of time with it, and you're  really a security whiz that you can vet software.  So it is a false sense of security that we have this closed store.  They can check it, but there's absolutely no case where they can say they can give you  a guarantee it's safe.  They can't and won't, you notice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is our new world.  It's true with news.  It's true with information.  It's true with everything else.  We had a false sense of security in the past that you could buy a Toyota and it was safe,  or you'd read the New York Times and it was all true, or the Apple Store is all safe.  Caveat life.  But, Gene, I think your point earlier is important too, not just for software, but the Wall Street  Journal had this, I think, absolutely ridiculous story this week, saying, oh my God, there's  cookies.  You're kidding.  They discovered cookies?  Fekens and tracking things and horrible things.  It was just absolutely awful.  Who wrote that?  It's the reefer madness of online.  Yes, exactly.  It really was.  And the cynical me, though I don't really believe in conspiracy theories, the cynical  me wants to say that just as Murdoch has gone behind a paywall and abandoning advertising,  he's now trying to ruin everybody else's advertising business by making everybody, including the  Federal Trade Commission, freaked about cookies.  But anyway, we do need more transparency in the ad business.  And any site out there should put up an app that says, here are the cookies I have on  you.  Here's the kind of advertising they give you as a result.  Here's why I do it.  That should become our new standard of disclosure.  Whether you're making an app or making software or have a website, that should be the proper  thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you hear my droid noise.  That means my droid just rebooted.  I did what is kind of the response to this app overload, which is to take everything  off, start over, start fresh and see if the reliability comes back and then very judiciously  slowly re-add stuff.  One nice thing about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the equivalent to wiping your hard drive and reinstalling Windows.  Welcome to Windows.  This is back to the Windows days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Was that bad?  It was unusably bad.  Yeah, it would just hang, hang, hang.  Well I showed Gina before the show began while you were rebooting.  Yeah, it was unusable.  And it was to the point where I'm about to go on a week-long trip and I unpacked my Nexus  One in my iPhone because I wanted to make sure I had something that worked.  Thank God for Google Voice.  One number calls all three of them.  So I don't really need any particular phone.  I think this is, you know, this is, okay, I'm going to pull an Apple here and say, hey,  it's the same for everybody.  You know, we got problems with our antenna.  They got problems with our antenna.  We got application problems.  They got application problems.  We're in an app-happy environment.  And slow down.  And because it's just like the PC.  These are computers for crying out loud.  That's what's really happened.  These are computers and they're a prime target for bad guys because they're always connected.  There's lots of ways to make money on a cell phone.  All sorts of sneaky things you can do.  It makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is there a market demand for a, what the heck was the name of the company that used to check  all our appliances?  Huh?  Remember Uncle Leo?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Underwriters lab.  Underwriters laboratories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We need an underwriters lab for apps.  That's a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And who pays for it is the app maker.  I want my app certified with the UL cert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a really good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Interesting.  Not a bad business either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It scales well.  And you know, again, Leo, you're right.  Things will get through, but you'll be in a position where you can find out immediately  when that happens and deal with it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Of course, there's going to be a very, and this we're going to have to deal with as well,  a very small subset of apps that are approved because you just can't approve them all and  it's going to take some serious expense.  How much would you pay for a service like that?  Would you pay five or $10 a month for a service like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, no, actually that's what who pays.  I think the app creator pays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but there were so many free apps on Android.  That's not going to work.  That's the problem.  Yeah.  So you will pay.  You know what?  You will pay.  You'll be paying for every app instead of all the freebies.  You will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  But if you get a million downloads of an app divided by what would it cost?  I mean, I don't know what this task would be.  How would you underwrite an app?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think what you would have extensive testing, which means that you would have all the phones  and you have a lot of testers who would put every app on the phone.  You'd do Wireshark to make sure that the app wasn't sending data.  So you'd have to monitor the network activities.  You'd probably have to have lots of debugging.  Gina, you're probably more adept at this than I am, but there's debuggers that you can run  on the phone, right?  Can you watch a compiled app run?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can watch a log.  There's an Android log that you can watch on a compiled app.  Actually, that's a good question.  I'm not sure if a final release build app logs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what you could do?  You could demand source code.  You could say, look, you want to be certified by AntiWritersLab?  We will protect your source code.  We're not going to let it go, but you need to give it to us so we can vet it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would love to have a Wireshark.  I would just love to know when is this app hitting a URL and what is that URL?  What IP addresses and URLs is this app requesting and sending information to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Some of that could run on the phone.  I mean, I don't know what Lookout does and I'll have to look into this because I have  Lookout.  Every time you download an app, it scans it, but I don't know what it's doing.  Is it scanning for a virus signature?  Well, that's not very effective.  What you'd want is something that had some heuristics that was watching what was going  on in the phone.  I don't see any reason why you couldn't do this on an Android device.  You can't do it on an Apple device, but you could do it on an Android device where the  things aren't so sandboxed and you could watch every bit of activity and say, whoa, that's  something I don't want to have happen.  Can't you?  Or is stuff too sandbox to do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel like that should be possible to just monitor network, firewall, essentially.  There's connection requests going out, approve or deny.  Oh, I like that.  So I love it if I installed an app and it said, you know what?  Pandora.com is going to make requests to Pandora.com and also I'm going to steal your stuff.com.  I can disallow that.  You know what we've just invented, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  User access control, UAC.  That's why Windows has it.  It says, wait a minute, you got a strong firewall.  You have the operating system saying somebody's trying to modify some operating system stuff.  Are you sure you want to allow that?  And that's how you protect yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And wouldn't that work better too, that if that warning system were networked up so that  on the day when somebody puts out a new app and suddenly a thousand people downloaded  it, there's an uh-oh sign that goes out.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, okay, we've solved it.  We've solved it.  Yeah, this phone underwriters lab could get a lot of very great free publicity by not  only protecting its subscribers, but by allowing, you know, and announcing this stuff to the  world as it should.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it looks like someone on Twitter just told me there's an app called aSpotCat which  lists your apps by permissions.  There's some of this going on now.  People are writing apps to manage your apps and tell you which apps cost you money.  In fact, I got a really sad email from a twig listener who told me that he had Listen set  up on his mobile device.  He's in Ireland and it was set to download even when he was just not on wifi and he  had a forty dollar sell bill because it downloaded an episode of the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, that's pretty bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He said I could have bought so many copies of your book with that money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I said, yeah, I'll send you forty dollars, Gina.  Yeah, not like we made extra money, but I'll send you forty bucks.  So by the way, that was a Wall Street Journal article by Julia Angwin that you were talking  about, Jeff.  You actually have a good blog post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it was it was just filled with scare language.  I don't know the blog post right in front of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's just inside Ashley Hayes BD's computer.  A tiny file helps gather personal details about her to be put up for sale for a tenth  of a penny.  The file consists of a single code for C812DB9227 that secretly identifies her as a 26 year  old female in Nashville, Tennessee.  It's a cookie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The children.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The cookie that ate Ashley.  It uses all kinds of language like, you know, the Wall Street Journal has discovered surveillance  technology, tracking technology, intrusive, no warning, surreptitiously respond rich databases.  So powerful and ubiquitous.  And my favorite is targeted ads can get personal.  Well, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Have you ever heard of this thing called Facebook that knows far more about you than any tracking  cookie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And, you know, the discussion that gets then gets on is the memes that you can hear back  are the tropes you can hear back are well, no one knows they're being tracked.  That's stupid.  You know, and just everything should be private.  Well, like what?  It's one of the journal letters went after being said, well, I guess you want everybody  to live in your glass house.  No, I don't.  But I do want the web to be supported financially.  And if the FTC came along and the EU came along and outlawed all tracking, you would  have nothing but dancing monkey ads on sites.  Right.  And the CPM would be about two cents.  And then you really couldn't afford to do content online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do have to say say that some of what they're saying here is perhaps a little alarming.  A study found that the nation's 50 top websites on average installed 64 pieces of tracking  technology, probably mostly tracking cookies, I would think, onto the computers of visitors,  usually with no warning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Most of them, not most of them, but I got a lot of response from people who said that  some of that doesn't have anything to do with third party, doesn't have anything to do with  advertising.  It's, you know, tracking your site.  Right.  It's preferences where you stop reading.  There is a story to be done about how stuff goes off the wrong way and how it can go to  third parties and how it can be used badly.  But the irony here is that none of those sites they write about has personally identifiable  information.  The one site that does the Wall Street Journal.  Isn't that funny?  It has my credit card, my name, my address, my phone number.  Right.  And it sells advertising based on household income and tracking.  It offers all kinds of things.  It does combine PII with other data.  I don't mean to be a conspiracy theorist here, but I really think that it's suspect the way  they're doing this, oh my God, treatment just as Murdoch was in Australia saying that he's  discovered the new business model for the web and its paywalls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, so you think this is, oh, I hope that's not the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hope not too, but it just, it's just so wing nutty and strange.  Yeah.  And meanwhile, the journal did another story about how in the IE, there was a huge debate  and the developers wanted to put IE out with a default of absolutely no tracking.  And the business side went berserk.  Of course they own an ad agency.  They did a story, you know, a shock story the other day about, I think we talked about  this last week about RFID on your pants.  Yeah, we talked about it last week.  I found more since then.  The woman they quote believes that RFID is the mark of the beast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, it is.  Satan uses RFID.  We know this.  We know.  He's tagged all the demons in hell because it's a big inventory issue.  There are a lot of these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we've got a lot of this going on here that I think can be damaging to the economic health  of the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Somebody said in the chat room, and I think this is good, that sometimes all of this background  noise about privacy obscures the real issues about privacy.  We get concerned.  It's a witch hunt.  We get concerned about the wrong thing or there's so much of it.  We just tune out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I put up a video that was backed by the German government on my site that shows a guy going  through a store.  And this is the trope you got there in Congress or in Germany.  Oh my God, people are watching me shop.  Well, yeah, I can go to a store right now and watch you shop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm standing right here watching you shop, lady.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but you would agree, Jeff, that there are some things to be concerned about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, absolutely.  And that's the problem is that we go so wing nutty and so emotional.  We don't deal, as the chat room says, with the issues that are legitimately there.  And then the other argument that I'll make is that we also get so panicky that we don't  want to do anything anymore in public, even as much as we used to do on the street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I remember this lesson from, I think it was sixth or seventh grade when we went,  I mean, really a long time ago, because I'm an old guy.  No, Neil.  Just the 60s.  And we went to a power plant.  It was a regular cold burning power plant in Providence, Rhode Island.  I remember it was there because I lived near it.  And every morning there'd be this soot that had spewed out every night on my windowsill.  And everywhere we went in the plant, it had signs, you know, think it was ecology was  the word then.  Think ecology, think green, think the earth.  And I remember I had a very smart teacher who said, yeah, you see all these signs.  Why do you think all those signs are there?  I said, well, I don't know.  They have a commitment to ecology?  No, because they don't have a commitment to ecology.  They want to numb you to ecology.  So by beating the drum, you think, oh, yeah, good.  They're for ecology.  You don't pay attention to the soot on your windowsill.  And in a way, I think this might be the same thing by beating the drum about privacy over  the wrong things.  People like perhaps Rupert Murdoch are numbing us to the very real concerns that we should  be worried about.  Is that like what you're saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think that the other thing that happens is I haven't blogged this yet, but  you have the case of the BlackBerry being outlawed in the UAE and almost in Saudi Arabia  and India.  You also you have this odd relationship of government to data where in the EU, ironically,  the government is trying to keep search engines and such to keep personal data longer so the  government can get its hands on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're waiting for a news in just a couple of minutes from Google.  And I know there's an acquisition, but there's news, Gina, that you're going to be very excited  to hear.  You're seeing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I haven't said anything in the last few minutes because I am reading the news.  I'm very happy about this news.  It doesn't have anything to do with Google, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it has something to do with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does have to do with me.  I'm very happy about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I don't know if your marriage is considered legal.  It probably isn't in the state of California due to Prop 8.  Prop 8 has been overturned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We got married before Prop 8 passed.  So we're one of the 19,000 couples in California who are legally married.  But a judge just struck down Prop 8, which will allow gay marriage in California right  now.  This is the decision suspected to be appealed in the Supreme Court.  But I'm very, very happy that my friends can now have the same limited edition legal right  that I had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Huge news.  So everybody run out and get married before they change their minds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what we did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How long was the last window, Gina?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How long was the last window?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was June till November, I want to say.  So it was like six months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.  I think that's I know that there are people who think that's terrible news.  I think it's couldn't think it couldn't think of better news.  It's really wonderful.  Pretty happy about it.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's why I've been so quiet as I've been reading the news and quietly celebrating.  And let me guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Twitter.  Yeah, Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right?  Yeah, Jenny just tweeted that she was going to run out and marry a lesbian just because  she can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was looking for a boy anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's exactly how I found it.  Tweet deck is running in the background here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I just now it is a story for us because that really is how we get our news now, isn't  it?  It's not how you you know, I immediately then did a Google search and found a story in.  So let me see.  I didn't you know, I didn't even pay any attention to the source, the Hollywood Reporter of all  things.  But that was I went to news.google.com found the store.  I did a Google search and found out a new Google News story.  But your first notice is Twitter or in my case, our chat room, which got it from Twitter.  I think it's a huge sea change.  I think we see it again and again and again.  Twitter is the first line of news information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that true?  I actually had a hard time finding it in Google News and I just went to LaTimes.com because  you know, Google just had kind of like breaking, you know, or CNN just has breaking federal  judge.  But there doesn't seem to be a story that you can click on.  So yeah, Twitter is the way you get the news up to the second news for sure.  That's how I found that Michael Jackson died.  And I mean, major news events in recent times is all been about from Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's great tweets here to love wins.  Does this mean Tom Cruise can come out now?  I love this one was retweeted by somebody at Google.  Rubenville said if Prop 8 flips, I'm one step closer to marrying my dog because you know,  that's where it's going to lead to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course, of course it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sure.  Sure.  You know, what's wrong with marrying your house pet?  I don't think anything.  Love wins anyway.  Did you see we're going to wait for that Google News and we also have news of a just broke  of a Google acquisition.  Let me take a little break quickly here for one of our sponsors.  You're listening to This Week in Google.  Jeff Jarvis and just the three of us today because we just kind of want to get back to  basics.  We'll have some special guests on next week, of course, as always.  But I do want to thank our friends at Ford.  I was out of town over the weekend, Friday and Saturday to visit Detroit.  Had a great time actually truthfully Dearborn kind of outside Detroit where the Ford's amazing  Rouge plant is.  They call it the Rouge.  It is one and a half miles by three quarters miles at its peak.  A hundred thousand workers building cars and Henry Ford's conception was in 1929, I think  during the Depression when he built this, you build a plant that limestone iron ore  would go into via trains and cars come out the other end.  It's not quite that way nowadays.  Suppliers, of course, all over the world make parts for Ford cars, but it's still an amazing  example of human ingenuity, high tech.  We went down, we were able to, if you want, we have three twitch specials based on our  visit to the Rouge plant and the Maker Faire.  There's a Maker Faire visit because we had a great time.  It was fun to see the kind of the 20th century center of innovation juxtaposed with this  21st century innovation.  And I have to say, you know, the Ford plant we visited, the F-150 plant has a green roof.  Lots of solar.  When we went inside, it's open and airy.  You can eat off the floor.  It's really a very different experience nowadays.  So it's just fascinating to watch American industrial era stuff enter the 21st century.  And I thought the juxtaposition with the Maker Faire was great.  Four specials.  If you go to twit.tv slash specials, we have an assembly line special.  We've got very rare privileged access to actually go down on the assembly line.  I rode the line and we did that live and we've got great video from that.  Then on the test track where I rode a Shelby Cobra Mustang and took a ride in the F-150  Raptor over the bumpiest down ditch.  I mean, it was amazing.  And then of course I crashed a flex into a Fiesta.  But that's another story.  It's on the video.  You know, it has this automated parking thing where you pull up and it says, I can fit into  this and then you press a button and the wheel starts spinning and it parks you.  But I didn't realize you're supposed to put the brake on after you park.  And I just kind of sat there and the car is in idle and so it starts going backwards and  it hits a Fiesta behind me.  I'm like, oh, that felt terrible.  No damage, which was in a way a testimony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When you're riding the line, I have visions of you at South by Southwest.  It was like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was very much like crowd surfing.  Put a carburetor in my stomach.  It's moving.  I don't know.  It's moving.  It's really kind of a neat thing.  And the line actually, it stops sometimes and it moves.  There's a whole thing it's doing.  It's very fascinating to watch.  Not robots at the part.  We were watching the finishing stuff, but robots part of it.  Certainly not where we were.  We saw the Coke Mentos show at Maker Faire.  The Power Wheels Racing was something to see.  It was a lot of fun.  All of this brought to you, Ed.  I want to thank Ford and Voice Activated Sync, the in-car communication and connectivity  Mustang that I love so very much.  True hands-free calling so you never miss a call.  Turn by turn voice directions.  911 Assist, voice activated music, podcast browsing.  Even on, and I love this on the Droid X, when a text message comes in, a very nice, there's  a little bong and I press a button or I could say go ahead and read it to me and a little  female, a very nice female voice reads me my text messages.  On the end, amazing.  I love it.  Personalized traffic alerts, weather and a whole lot more.  It's like the car is alive and does your bidding.  Give it a shot.  You can go find out more.  There's videos there at SyncMyRightPodcast.com or of course, your Ford Lincoln or Mercury  dealer.  It's a standard in some models, optional in others.  My recommendation, if you've got a choice, get the Sync.  Thank you, Ford, for your sponsorship.  We come to this week in Google.  Gina Trapani, Jeff Jarvis.  Gina, are you watching the other news?  I know you're probably tweeting like crazy, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  So the Google news just broke.  Google is no longer going to update, no longer to develop Wave as a standalone product.  What?  Yeah.  Are you sad?  I'm sad.  I'm pretty sad.  I mean, the good news is there are tons of open source code out there that they can use  in other products that other people can use in their products.  They're going to keep Wave, the site, up until the end of the year.  And I believe there's going to be some good sort of data liberation features so people  can get their information out of Wave.  Oh dear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is a big capitulation.  Wow.  I'm sorry.  That's got to be hard on you, Gina, because you wrote this whole book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love Wave.  I mean, I love Wave and I thought it was super useful and I really was hopeful for its adoption,  but it just didn't see the adoption that they hoped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not an indictment of Wave.  I think it was an indictment of Google's execution of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a bit of a shock to me.  I mean, I can see that it wasn't taking off and that's pretty obvious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It wasn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's like Buzz, which is not really taking off.  And I have the same feeling about Buzz that you have about Wave.  I haven't written a book about Buzz, but I practically could.  And you just kind of don't want them to give up so fast.  It's just barely over a year old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's true.  It's true.  But you know, from what I heard, they had a million active users, which in Google's  world is not just not very much.  I mean, I think that when Google develops a product and it just doesn't get that adoption,  I think there's a lot of pressure for products to do super well.  And I think even though Buzz hasn't seen the uptake of a Facebook or a Twitter, I think  that it still has incredible uptake.  I mean, I'd argue that's because it's connected to Gmail.  But, you know, I think that they did some amazing things with Wave.  They really pushed the edges of what can happen in a browser.  And I thought it was I just always loved the project because it was so ambitious.  But you think it was too ambitious?  I think it was too.  I think that honestly, I thought that Wave was just, you know, I think that Wave is just  way ahead of its time.  Yeah, I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are they removing people and functions over to Docs or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I think that they're going to they're going to be incorporating some functionality  in other and other products.  But they there's no specific news about which features on which products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can I make a suggestion?  I think that what Docs is missing, one of a couple of things is a great project manager.  Plug it into Docs as the project management tool that ties into other Docs.  I think people would love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Interesting.  Yeah, if they kind of molded it into a PM tool, which they really could with the to  do list.  And that's a that's a that's an excellent suggestion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think where they turned wrong, frankly, was right at the beginning when they said  this is a replacement for mail.  And everybody said, no, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a project manager.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what it always has been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that was definitely a misstep.  I think even the wave team would agree that that that saying it's the next email was  it was a misstep.  I think the big problem with wave was what do I do with it?  Anything you want?  What do you want to do with it?  That's too freeform.  Yeah.  People need a very specific use case.  It needs to it needs to fulfill a need of a clear, specific need.  And it really didn't.  It did everything.  You know, it was whatever you want it to be.  But it was also just, you know, super complicated and had a lot of requirements.  And it took time.  It was a ramp up to learn.  So I mean, I'm bummed.  Obviously, I wrote a book about it.  I love the product.  I hope I hope the protocol doesn't die.  I hope we see some of the other features.  I mean, some of the most useful features, the features that had developers kind of standing  up in their chairs at Google I.O., you know, not this year, but last year was like live  typing, you know, live updates and being able to drag and drop images into a wave and see  them pop up, you know, as they load.  I mean, those are things that are all happening now and are possible in tools that we already  have, like like docs.  Docs is not nearly as fun as wave, though, as far as I'm concerned.  No.  So it's kind of a bummer, I have to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you think?  It was it was too freeform.  It was difficult to understand.  It was a little chaotic.  But I think the thing that I we've seen this before, products are just ahead of ahead of  their time. You know, it's not a real debt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People people didn't know how to use it and they needed to give it time not for users  to come on, but for developers to come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's very easy for a product to move too far ahead of you have to be just right.  You can't be you can't be old hat.  You can't be too new. You kind of have to hit in the middle.  And I think it was just it was maybe that's sad.  So you're on a roller coaster today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know it's like, oh, I get a salary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They set you up, they knock you down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they did. I mean, I'm sad that they didn't give Wave a little more of a chance in  Gmail. I would have loved to have seen some sort of good Gmail integration to give Wave  the chance that Buzz had.  I mean, you know, the original use case was like, don't you hate those group emails with  that everybody hits reply all and you get a stack of messages, you know, edit one wave.  So I would have loved to have seen. And that was my favorite use case was having a small  group discussion.  So I'm sad that didn't make it in a Gmail, but it didn't see the uptake.  And they and then you also have to respect a company that can look at a product that  isn't working and and and move on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess so. I mean, you do get you have to give credit to a company to do.  Yeah, you're right. I think so, because that's a hard thing to do, too.  It's I have that problem with shows that just dribble on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know? Yeah, it's tough.  It's tough. You got to be an editor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's not like they don't have 20 whatever it is.  Forty five thousand employees.  They could easily afford just to have Wave continue in the corner.  Why kill it? Why kill it?  What's the advantage of doing that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know maybe just a more perceived sense of focus.  Maybe I know was this past I know or every session was wave was kind of the last chance  for it to prove itself. And maybe it didn't.  I don't know. This is all, you know, just this is me just  thinking possibly I don't have confirmation of all this.  But yeah, I'm bummed.  I've got a book. I mean, limited edition.  Jesus. It'll only help you to the end of the year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everybody run over to the complete wave guide dot com and buy Gina's book

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  as a way as a way of saying goodbye.  Wave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, gosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can we think of another product that Google has has killed?  Has killed? Yeah. Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  they've neglected a ton of product.  I mean, look at Nol.  Notebook.  Nol's still there, but they could have they might as well kill it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the Jaiqu never took off, but isn't quite dead yet.  What's the what was the four square predecessor from Dennis Crowley?  Oh, dodgeball is not ball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Dodgeball was killed. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess that's a little different because it was an acquisition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. They just didn't use it.  But now still there alive and kicking.  And I guarantee you less.  I guarantee you fewer than a million people use now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, that's true.  Well, they probably had fewer people working on now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So notebook is notebook and  dodgeball.  It's an empty graveyard.  It's a small glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's probably went on to create some, you know, a huge phenomenon  because he couldn't do it inside Google, which shows you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, that's a failure of Google.  I mean, here here in Foursquare is fan is I mean, growing.  It's huge. There's huge commercial potential.  Everybody agrees it created it.  This kind of location check in gaming thing.  That's what dodgeball was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The danger here is the this is this is the danger they know.  And Schmidt has said it. You get too big, not too big to be right.  So you have to regulate it, but too big for its own good.  And I think this might argue that Google's, you know, heading there.  And so it's it's buying things instead.  Is it doing a good job of of integrating those purchases?  That's the problem.  You know, AOL and Yahoo sure messed up plenty of companies that way.  You know, you need some new strategy for having hit this size. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What happens to the Rasmussen's today?  Any any word there in that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's an excellent question.  There's a whole lot of talent on the wave team,  and that might be a good argument for killing it. Right.  They've got a whole lot of talent working on wave.  I don't know. I don't know what happens with them. I mean,  there was an interesting maps wave.  You know, they came.  You want to have from maps. Right.  There's some guys who start maps. Yeah.  It built maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's an article by the CEO and founder of Postras, Sechin,  this week that came out talking about Apple and Apple,  as opposed to say Microsoft, it came up because Engadget said,  you know, we love the the remote app in the on the iPhone,  but why hasn't been updated in eight months?  And Sechin says, I know the guy who developed it.  Let me tell you the reason hasn't been updated because it's one guy  who wrote this and Apple doesn't.  This is how Apple works.  It has it buys.  It gets the best both best minds it can.  And it moves them from project to project.  And and it unlike Microsoft, which builds these great big teams around  projects and they just, you know, they kind of become clunky and huge.  So the disadvantages apps might not get updated.  The advantage is they're brilliantly written apps.  And you've got these brilliant engineers that you can laser like target.  And I would guess that Google's in a similar situation.  There isn't an infinite pool of brilliant, brilliant people out there.  Google has more PhDs on its campus than any other company in the world.  But you got to figure the rest.  Moosens are a prime resource for that company.  So that must be really some of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Definitely. I'd imagine that's part of it. Yep. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, sorry to hear it.  Other acquisition from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They just bought slide from Max Levchin.  What a slide.  Slides, another game, another part of the game strategy.  Levchin, of course, one of the founders of PayPal, sold it for one eighty two million,  which TechCrunch says, Sarah, he says is disappointing.  Last valuation was at five hundred million.  He was hoping to sell this company for a billion.  But slide, I believe, is a game creation, game platform.  And so it fits into Google's new game strategy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, I think a hundred eighty two million seems completely reasonable.  I've never heard of this.  I don't know what it is.  It's if I go to the Web page, it doesn't even make any sense.  It says super poke pets, select a pet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was overcome by Zynga, right?  Way overcome by Zynga.  It was really was before Zynga.  It was a game platform.  It was a way to create the games on Facebook originally.  Right. It does look like Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  People because they say super poke.  That's a Facebook thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, that's where it was originally as I remember it.  And Levchin was, you know, creating a new platform.  And then take us came along and just mowed over this with  with Zynga.  You know, that's that's the that's always the problem.  It's the same as wave. Your first in.  Maybe you don't know exactly what it's going to the shape is going to take.  And somebody else comes along and learns from you and does it.  It's kind of the Calacanis or even for that matter, Gates way. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's good to be the second guy sometimes because if the first guy gets  acquired, then Yahoo or Google, whoever didn't get you,  hires the second guy. Right.  So I've just created a lamb named Gina.  And now I'm in a I don't know what's going on.  I have no I must be too old.  I don't what do I do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Decorate the last news is going to get shaved momentarily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just bought a super duper table for my lamb.  Now that I finished decorating, I can clean the lamb.  Gina, you mind if I shower you?  There you go. Go for it.  You know, so lovely, a fluffy lab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Today's been such a crazy day at this point.  Whatever, whatever, whatever you want to do.  Validated. My book got killed.  Oh, whatever.  God, I'm my heart is breaking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I feel I don't know whether to be happy or sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's cool. It's cool.  It's you know, there will always be more new fun projects to write about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what? There'll always be more of people trying to game Google Earth.  TCB, why yogurt?  You see this right next to the Google campus?  They cut into the grass a message.  TCB, why frozen yogurt?  We think the new Android 2.2 fro you upgrade is sweet.  Now, this is huge.  It's as big as building 42 right there.  So I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They think that much land and mountain view. Geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And and I guess the point is  that when Google Earth satellite passes over, it'll it'll it'll capture that.  And it'll become you know, this is viral.  I mean, that's smart, right?  They're going to get a lot of attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All I had to do is Google Earth this week on Long Island.  One of the towns is using Google Earth to find illegal pools in backyards.  I saw that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's nothing you can do either, by the way.  That picture has been taken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're taking it and it's perfectly legal.  You don't have a privacy.  You know, you can't cut off people from the air from seeing what's there.  There have been court cases to that effect. Really? Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess it's no different than flying planes to find  marijuana plantations or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just use Google's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She's.  We're seeing a lot of Android tablet talk,  and I think we're going to see more as we get closer to Gingerbread Android 3.0  because it's really clearly a tablet OS.  Viewsonic wants to do a 2.2 based tablet.  They do monitors, pretty good monitors.  I mean, really, if you think of it, a tablet really is just a monitor  with some electronics behind it.  Arcos, this actually might be kind of interesting.  It's eighth generation. It's been doing using Android for some time.  The Arcos Generation 8 tablet, 3.2 inch screen, a little tiny screen, 400 by 240.  It's almost like an iPod, not like a tablet device.  But it will support video.  It's 150 bucks and peg for H.264 WMV.  You know, this is an interesting thing where not only are we seeing  Android tablets kind of start to emerge, we're seeing  a range of prices like the Augen, which is $150.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, very affordable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but I don't know how good it's going to be.  Towards the user base, it's going to be much bigger than iPhone.  There's just no doubt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Already is, by the way.  In fact, it's not only already bigger than iPhone, it's bigger than the rim.  It's the latest news.  Let me see if I can find this story.  According to NPD, which is very reliable, Android passes BlackBerry  in the second quarter.  That is that means they're number one.  And I would guess it's in the US.  It does not include maybe this is this is why it's by passing BlackBerry  corporate or enterprise purchases where BlackBerry has a huge installed base,  as does Windows Mobile.  Pretty phenomenal.  Thirty three percent of consumers choosing Android.  Twenty eight percent BlackBerry, 22 percent iPhone.  Number one. Yeah.  It's you know, it was but the writing was on the wall.  I think it's very clear again, back to that analogy of Windows Mac.  Windows Android is going to be dominant and have, you know,  80 or 90 percent of the market.  Mac people don't care.  They're going to have their special unique niche device  that they think is better.  It's like being a BMW.  I don't think that there's anything wrong with that.  I do think it's very interesting to watch iPhone fanboys  rephrase the game that way.  For a long time, we're number one.  We're happy to be number two.  We're happy to be number three.  Well, kids, you're now number three.  Just I'm pointing that out.  I'll see now. I'm going to get the hate mail.  I love your step. I love iPhones.  I'm going to get the hate mail.  Number one. And I just and by the way,  just want to mention that reset fixed it fast, snappy.  So I had obviously put something on the Droid X.  Maybe it was that alternative launcher I was using that was slowing it down.  Everything now is fine.  I just sent out a text message.  All of this stuff is fine.  So lesson learned to stop customizing.  Just like Windows.  That's what people do on Windows.  The number one selling Android handset, Motorola's Droid,  HTC Droid Incredible, HTC Evo 4G,  HTC Hero and the Droid Eris fill out the rest.  This report, of course, doesn't include the Droid X, which just.  It's a changeable target.  It's a movable target. Very movable.  Fast moving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Speaking of OS is, if I may,  Tariq Crim's Jolly Cloud just came out as one dot.  What's that? It's a.  Tariq was originally was he's forgetting we did three before.  I'm suddenly I'm blanking chat room.  Tell me that instead of no net, there is I'll find out.  But Jolly Cloud is a net book.  I think OS very, very simple.  Clay Shirky says he just uses this and Dropbox.  And I think it's yeah, it's just kind of a, you know, it's a Chrome sense.  Very, very simple OS, very free or cheap  so that you can buy the cheapest net books and have a new

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OS on it. But Linux based, I guess.  So, yeah, it's a Linux based.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep. Tariq Crim was that vibes for Net5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I love Net5.  Yeah, Net5 is a is a Internet starter page that used  CSS and JavaScript to do an amazing like kind of app, web based app.  Net5 is fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I'm going to try it.  Yeah, I'm not very happy with Ubuntu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The netbook remix of Ubuntu, which is really excellent.  I think, as I remember in the new Ubuntu, they just kind of deprecated that  and said, just put Ubuntu on it. It's fine.  I might be wrong on that.  But the netbook remix was really nice.  Had big icons. It's very easy to use.  I have it on one of my little netbooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here I need some advice.  So if I buy a netbook to run this,  what's the safest choice that it might also run?  Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Also run Chrome on the net.  So so Jolly Cloud is a web based app.  I'm so confused about.  No, it's an OS.  OK, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll tell you, my favorite still is the ASUS seashell.  I think that's what it is.  They're really thin.  They're really attractive.  Asus invented this category with the EPC.  I had a 1201N.  It was it's atom based, but it has a nice big hard drive.  It was stolen from me. Two gigs of RAM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you want a dual boot Chrome OS and Jolly Cloud.  Yeah.  I think anything around Chrome OS, right?  Yeah, I think kind of.  Yeah, we have to.  I mean, I guess my best recommendation would be just to look at the  at the list of netbooks that run Chrome OS now, which is the,  you know, which is kind of the they're the most popular.  I think I really like I have an ace.  It's an ace ace or ace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Asus, I'm told.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh huh. But there's a large I get told a lot of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know if any of them are true.  All right, we're going to take a break.  Come back with our number tool and tip of the week.  Jeff Jarvis, Gina Tripani, Leo Laporte.  Coming up in just a few minutes.  Tech news today, I want to mention our friends at Citrix, though,  before we run out of time.  Go to meeting to be specific.  Go to meeting is that great software that lets you travel less, do more.  Replace the face to face meeting with a conference call  that is galvanizing, engaging, gets the job done.  You'll close more sales.  It'd be great for product reviews, for training, for collaboration.  The nice thing is your client doesn't have to have it installed ahead of time.  You just start a go to meeting.  You could do it in Outlook.  You could do it just by emailing a link.  You could just do it on the while you're on the phone.  You tell your client just go to go to meeting dot com.  Here's the meeting ID.  They enter it.  30 seconds later, the software is very quick and installs.  And now they're seeing your computer on their desktop.  They see your keynote, your PowerPoint presentation.  They see your spreadsheets.  You can work together on a document.  It's fast.  It's effective.  And it really is the new way of doing business.  Avoid the hassles of traveling.  Exceed your sales goals.  Get more done in less time with go to meeting.  And oh, by the way, try it free right now.  Go to meeting dot com slash twig.  Geo, T-O, meeting dot com slash twig.  We thank them so much for their support of this week in Google.  Okay, Gina, try your tears.  Actually, you knew before the show began, you were just embargoed on this, right?  So you've had time to compose yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe.  You can't even say that.  I'm trying to process.  I've had time to process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I'm glad the good news came in to cheer you up a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm really, really happy about.  I'm very excited to go celebrate with my wife about Prop 8.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I put up the link to the wording on the front feed list.  It's wonderful language, too.  It just makes it very clear this was unconstitutional,  that double sex partners should not be seen as superior to single sex partners.  And this is unconstitutional.  Period.  Done.  I like double.  And this comes from a worship party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Double sex.  Same sex, double sex.  We're like a double dip.  I love double sex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  You have two sexes?  Oh, my.  I think that's too many.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  An abomination, Leo.  It's an abomination.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If double sex were in the Bible, I think we'd know a little bit about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know what double sex is, but I don't want it.  It sounds bad.  What's the alternative?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff, if I were you, I would get the EEEPC, which is kind of at the top of the Chrome OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good.  I'm glad to hear that because it's my favorite netbook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it is mine, too.  It's the one I have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  And so I'm glad to hear it runs Chromium.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yep.  Also, one story that we didn't capture, Google is testing multiple logins right now.  I have been testing it out, and it works really well.  It's just pretty simple.  You just get a drop down on the top right of your Google account, and if you're in Gmail,  you just click the drop down and select another account, and it just logs you into that other  account.  You can see your Gmail inbox without having to start another browser or sign out and then  log back in, and it's working really well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can use it, Gina, with both your apps and with regular Gmail?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what you wanted so much, I know.  That's what I wanted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they've had it on the phone.  On the Android, you just click the right button there on Gmail.  And it went from account to account very easily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Yep.  But if you're a Google reader, you can have a personal and a work, RSS feeds, for example.  And it works with a few different products, not all the products.  But yeah, they're rolling out.  That's been rolling out this week, and so you should see it in your account settings.  You can check your account settings.  You should see it.  If you're not seeing it now, you should see it soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yay.  That's exciting.  Your tip of the week, was that your tip?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no.  That wasn't my tip.  I have another quick tip, which is a Gmail tip.  Really quick.  Attachments, you can drag and drop them from your email to your desktop now.  So they just launched it.  You can drag and drop into a message to attach something.  Now, if you receive an email with an attachment, the link that says download,  just if you hover over it, it'll say, click, you know, you can click and drag it onto your  desktop and it will download that file.  So you don't have to go through your browser's whole rigmarole, download, where, save, whatever.  Just drag and drop and you're good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good deal.  Yahoo.  Your number of the week, JJ.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  1.1 billion, which is the cost of Google's spending spree so far this year.  But of course, that just got changed by 182 million because slides not part of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They said at the beginning of the year, Eric Schmidt said, we're going to start buying some stuff.  And they have, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  AdMob cost a little bit less than the original 750 billion.  It came in at 681.  In stock and 26 billion in cash and not very exciting, but that's just as they are buying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's interesting though.  They've been frugal.  I mean, how much was YouTube?  It was more than it was twice that, right?  Or almost.  Yeah.  So they have been, they've got some good deals.  Yes.  Yeah.  Not spending like crazy.  My pick is something that I, you know, Android is all about choice, which means that sometimes  Android is a pain in the ass.  Choice and pain in the ass go together, don't they?  Let's face it.  You know, if Apple does it all for you, you're in the gated community.  You don't have any choice, but you just, they carry you along a little basket of cotton lined,  you know, batting.  Android, you get to do whatever you want.  And sometimes that means, as I did, for instance, you put too many apps on there and I was bogging  it down, I different launcher going on.  And one of the debates on Android is should you have a task killer?  I've yet to see a definitive answer to that.  I know from looking into the, you know, Android SDK, as I know you have to Gina,  that the SDK is very aware of this.  They say again and again, you're in a resource constrained environment in terms of memory CPU.  And all of the applications have built into them, you know, they can be killed.  They have ways to come back from the dead and so forth.  It's part of the environment, unlike a regular computer operating system.  So in theory, you shouldn't need a task killer.  The fact that multitasking exists shouldn't mean that there's a problem on Android.  And frankly, I have yet, I've tried it with and without.  And while I use the task killer, if things get sluggish, I've yet to see any repeatable  evidence that a task killer is of benefit.  I don't know.  What about you, Gina?  You have, do you think you have to have a task killer on Android?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't, I don't run one at a principle.  I feel like I don't want to have to run one.  I don't want to have to run one.  And honestly, sometimes I go into my managed applications.  If I'm having a battery run down pretty quick, I'll go into managed  applications and see my running process.  See what's going on.  Right. But no, I have removed my task managers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's the good news about it is that Android gives you plenty of ways to monitor this stuff.  So it's not, I mean, you know what's using your battery.  You know what's going on.  And so you can be proactive on this.  Robert McCauley, this came from Buzz actually, from one of our listeners.  Our last shows Buzz says, just finished twig 53.  Heard some talk about using a task killer once a day.  Could I suggest trying my app Watchdog or Watchdog Lite instead?  It is, I think it was in US, but dollars is 3.99.  I think it's a dollar, one euro 99.  And there's a Lite version.  I try, I bought the, I like to buy them.  And I have to say this does a really good job and probably does obviate the need for a task killer.  What happens is it monitors your phone for CPU hogs, for things that are locking the phone.  You could set the threshold and all it does is it notifies you.  I set it for a big buzzer alarm, but you can set it for whatever you want.  You can have it do a notification, whatever.  And so this is a way, if something is holding up the system, you get a notification and alert.  And then you can go on applications as you do, Gina, or if you want to do,  you could use a task killer and kill it.  He says the upside is in memory apps launch quicker than dead ones.  And you won't break apps and need to stay resident like Astrid.  And that is true.  That is one of the problems with a task killer is you can kill stuff you shouldn't be killing.  And it's nice to leave stuff running if you can.  So I'm going to continue to use this.  I've used it for a day and it worked quite well, I thought.  So I'll give you full feedback, but it's called Watchdog.  You can find it in the Android Marketplace.  There's a Lite version and a paid version, which is not too expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a dumb question, which is what I specialize in.  We should have a dumb question of the week for me.  I can't get anything to move to the memory card on my Android.  You need to do.  I have to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's app by app.  The app has to have that feature enabled.  Most app developers are starting to update their apps so that you can store.  I'm talking about storing an app on the SD card.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If the app can do it, you'll see a check mark.  Usually in the app settings.  Because Tutu is so new, I've only recently noticed apps starting to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because I ran out of memory on the thing.  Google Earth went wacky on me and filled up tons of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One big advantage, I think, of the DroidX, eight gigabytes of app storage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Google Earth is particularly big.  But yeah, DroidX sounds nicer and nicer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Eight gigabytes.  You've got 512 on the Nexus One.  And like you, both of you, I've run out of room on the Nexus One.  I just have no room for apps.  Maybe that's not a bad thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe that eight gigabytes is why I got into trouble.  Saving you from yourself, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Too many apps!

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis blogs at buzzmachine.com.  His book, so far, Google hasn't canceled Google.  So his book is still good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I'm so sorry.  Somebody on Twitter, Eli Center, said Google Drops Wave insert joke about Twitter's fail  well here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is all kinds of snarking going on about Wave.  Zellman tweeted, Wave is dead and two users are upset.  That's not right.  It's not right.  Mean.  That's not mean.  Ahead of its time.  Ahead of its time, people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're laughing to cover the pain, Gina.  They're laughing because the other alternative is crying.  Gina Trapani is the author of One Last Chance to Buy It.  Quick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
