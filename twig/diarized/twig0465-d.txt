Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We are gathered together to speak of the five billion dollar fine that was just leveled at  Google and I'm really curious  We had a debate. In fact, it got a little heated on Windows Weekly this morning because I  Think this isn't a really kind of appalling but I but I'd like to hear what you all think the European Commission says  There were three things that caused it to do this fine three things that Google must correct in the next 90 days  It's abused its Android market dominance all about Android in three ways  bundling its search engine and Chrome apps into the operating system  number one  Blocking phone makers. This is the one this one. I agree with blocking phone makers from creating devices  That run forked versions of Android if you so Google Android is open source. Anybody can use it  Amazon has of course Amazon is based the fire operating system is Android  But it doesn't have the Google Play Store or any of the Google services on it and that's legal  It's legit  if you want the Google Play Store you have to have Chrome and the default search has to be Google in the phone and  This is the one that I disagree with I think Google overstepped their bounds  They also apparently told phone makers if you want Google services on your phones  You can't make any phones with pure Android. You can't make a non Google phone  And then finally and this is something Google had stopped a few years ago made payments to certain large manufacturers and mobile network operators  To exclusively bundle the search app on handsets  Google apparently learned about the EU investigation three years ago four years ago and stopped doing that at that time  So really two things Google still does apparently they must stop in the next three days three months. Google says they will appeal and  Actually, I thought there was quite a good  Blog post by Sundar Pichai in which he said Google has Android rather has created more choice

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Amen, and and of course the Windows people are going to be in favor of all of this because  window this is this is comparable in many ways to the  antitrust attack on Microsoft the 90s  bundling Internet Explorer because of course it that  Guaranteed that Internet Explorer would dominate everything which was turned out to be well

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I put a story up on the rundown Mike that said that goes into why it's different. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we actually talked about this last week and why it was different and Leo I felt like you explained that pretty well

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wish I could remember what I said

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was basically along the lines of this is at the operating system  No, it wasn't at the operating system level. So the biggest of course Mike covered this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You were the chief of Windows magazine at the time. We covered it  It was exactly the the DOJ investigation of Microsoft started when we launched tech TV in 1998  And so we covered that for six years because that went on and on and then later EU's action  I actually I still don't think it's such a bad thing to bundle the browser in the operating

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's irrelevant, but the biggest difference I think is that the purpose of Windows was to be behave as a platform for  Other apps the purpose of Android is to get Google search in the hand people's hands that Android exists  Probably because Google wants to make the world safe for its search engine  And doesn't want just Apple taking over other companies because if there was no Android  Right and there were Symbian or whatever operating systems one could imagine for smartphones. They could all just say well  You know what Google's too dominant. We just won't have Google  We won't let Google on and so that's why they came out with Android

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like a world where there's no where there's iOS and Symbian is not a world

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's more than just getting the browser in hands  Though obviously from business perspective, but I think it was it was really about trying to create it was trying to create a competitive marketplace and  By making it free. I mean, that's that's the problem that anti-trust laws are so outdated  What what in other times would look like dumping is instead a great favor to consumers by making this free and getting more  Low-priced phones out there and I also think Google didn't do the wrong thing doesn't do the wrong thing in requiring  manufacturers to either do pure either do authorized Android or  Unauthorized Android but to do both is gonna be really brand confusing and all this talk we hear about fragmentation

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That would be even worse. I think Google's perfectly right Stacey. Go ahead. Oh, no, I actually agree with Jeff on this which is whoa  I  Had to say actually  Well, you know there are there are topics Jeff where we disagree but this one I'm with you and I remember last week  We kind of came to this conclusion. I think it's a good one, which is  we don't have the antitrust infrastructure right now or the rules to  To govern the way we build hardware software in technology  Or technology businesses today, so I think that's probably where we should take this focus in the US

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This isn't an issue because Android and iOS are roughly at parity about 50% each. So neither is dominant  There's no monopoly position. So it's not an issue apparently in the EU  Google has not only 80% of all the search it has 75% of all the phones  Yeah, so it is I don't know if that's a monopoly but it is it is fairly dominant and  The EU and Jeff you're the expert on EU antitrust law seems to fit it seems to favor  Competition among companies and so feels like that Google's dominant position makes it hard for others to compete  Well, I celebrate the fact that Google bought Android and kept it open source  Amen and they are a lot of people and if you would like the Google services  It doesn't seem to me unreasonable if you want the Play Store to say well, you got to include Google services  Which is quality of home. Yeah, and that by the way, that's driven by consumer demand  Consumers prefer an Android device with Google's Play Store on it then not so consumers are saying it gives them an easier

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean if you have to  Make a slightly different version of your app for like the Android App Store, for example  That's that's gonna eliminate choice in apps and make it more difficult for developers and quote-unquote innovation  If that's where we're gonna focus our innovation

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the way I look at it is there there are two big issues  One is market dominance and the other is kind of a lock-in the whole assumption about  Market dominance is that you can exclude others from the marketplace or use your dominance in one market to yes  Enter other markets and their other their other action against Google was very much like that in  Shopping exactly exactly, but here you have the two dominant  Operating systems iOS and Android and on the one hand you have iOS which is completely dominant, you know  you you cannot install iOS on a  Phone that is not Apple's phone. It's a chrome on iOS, but you can't get an app approved and as Sundar Pichai points out  1300 companies are running and right. Yeah, it is a very open system. There's a free version there  It's it's creating all this  all these other companies  Including the most direct competitor to Google which is which is Amazon  Amazon uses the free version of Android to basically compete directly against Google. So  Amazon has all kinds of alternatives to the Google Play Store  To to the content that Google is selling and stuff like that and Google just allows this that's how open they are their most direct  Competitor is basing their entire platform on Android on the free version of Android  Like if that isn't open, I don't know what is now if that isn't so generous policy  I guess for lack of a better term. I don't know what is an Apple  You couldn't imagine anything like that from now you could

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But sooner Pichai has on his blog post a gif that shows you can remove Chrome from  Android and install opera in under 30 seconds, right?  so I mean it's it seems to me the opposite of anti competitive but

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the browser doesn't really bring them huge advantage, right? They make their money

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but the browser is what gives them Google search

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I understood understood but search is only part of what they do now  They make their money from advertising and much of that advertising is off of search  Yeah, we still work on opera many or so  Let me let me go back to your point about about antitrust  Of course the key difference between the US and Europe is in us. It's about consumer protection in Europe. It's about company size and  You know you got too big and there's no there's no statutory definition of too big but there's there's kind of a belief  So last week I couldn't be on the show because I was in Europe doing a few things including going to the Gutenberg Museum  But I also met with the head of Keneel the French data protection authority and another 10 people that she brought in  for a conversation and then I met with  The head of digital in the German Parliament and then I just had a conversation with European with  UK regulators and it's an interesting shift in time right now where you know  I've been out there being very critical of EU regulation and now some way they're willing to listen interest to that viewpoint  And and I think that what we've seen in European regulation is that they're recognizing this protectionist Dorothee a bear the German  MP who spoke at this conference where I was the publishing company that throws the conference a DLD  An executive there did a speech beforehand and what she was trying to say we got to be innovative  We got to be reasonable and we got to be realistic like Jeff Jarvis. Okay, great  But then he defended the last two shots, right?  He defended the regulation they have but then she got up as a member of parliament and she's a conservative member of parliament  But she scolded the publishers and she scolded them and said  This is protectionist and it's not appropriate for the time and for the year so there's a time right now  There's a little window. I see where regulators may be open to different perspectives on this  And and in France, I had a reasonable discussion too  They were considering a fake news law that has you know huge problems in the UK as well  So so what we see happening is we see the courts with the right to be forgotten  We see the antitrust regulators with this antitrust effort  Which was really pushed very hard by publishers in Germany and then we have  Legislation going after things like privacy GDPR  And hate speech and all that so this is huge  My second point is regulatory reflex in Europe and they when I sat down and talked to them  It was kind of well, we're gonna regulate. How should we?  Rather than starting and saying was there a problem we should deal with can I just say parenthetically completely parenthetically how refreshing it is to hear?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Opposing viewpoints debated in a rational  And then a consensus attempt to reach consent you're a bow how sophisticated those Europeans amen

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Amen, brother. Amen

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was it was kind of great it's interesting so there is a little shift away from this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I sense an opening I sense it not a shift but an opening to have a different kind of conversation and  And I welcome that tremendously, you know, and and and so I'm not against all regulation  I'm for smart regulation that starts with evidence of harm and evidence of issues  So the issue back to back to that's a good question. Where is the evidence of harm? That's a very good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, there isn't any you can as soon as our Pachai does the CEO of Google point out there  It seems to be only benefit you've got choice 1300 brands 24,000 different devices at every price point

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All of that points to a diversity. Yeah that allows people choice and I I tend to I tend to support the concept of democracy  Whether it's political democracy marketplace  And the reason

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Marketplace democracy sure there is people vote with their dollars and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Love a free market. Yeah  Europeans love  Android and the Europeans love Google more than in the US by by long shot  More oh, they'd buy 75% That's right. Yeah, so it's like so it's like the  Giving people what European regulators are supposed to be representing the people of Europe  The people of Europe have spoken as far as I'm concerned. They love Google search and they love Android. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Never do how easy it is to change the search engine on Chrome trivial on the phone. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the point is where you've got iOS where there is no open source version  Only Apple can make an iOS device. You cannot uninstall the browser  You cannot change the default search that you cannot change the default browser

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's no problem with that Siri is completely locked in and and virtual assistants are the new search engine. Anyway, that's where we're

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is a choice I choose to use an iPhone most the time, but I'm just glad there is a choice for yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  like that's really important point to where where the  They keep on thinking that Google is a search company and then and so they regulated to that and then it became a phone company  They're trying to regulate to that and as you're pointing out AI and voice is that and there and there's so far behind  Yeah, that the battleground is way ahead of and that's exactly what happened

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  IE with Windows by the time they they cracked down on IE IE was pretty much dead in the water

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know it's that's the irony of lot of all of this is it takes so long that by the time they actually  Promulgate these rules. It's too late. Go ahead Stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I was gonna say if we want to start looking at AI we need to look at how you access different data sets how  You train those data sets to believe different things and act certain ways  That would be the new kind of antitrust battle and how do you limit your competitors?  Access to that data or can they get that data in other ways? It's true because the battleground has shifted now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google has a massive advantage in AI  Well over well ahead of Apple maybe not ahead of Amazon but but

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So maybe we should be looking at how they're bundling and forcing people to use Google Photos and the user agreements for I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They'll do about the EU will do that in ten years. It'll be I mean, it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  but  There there are plenty of ways you can get that data. It's the same thing with self-driving cars

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's those are the battlegrounds of the future. I agree and maybe the thing that we should be thinking about  I don't want to see I mean no one wants to see a single dominant  company in any of this and  That's the argument I would make and certainly the argument Pachai makes is that Android creates choice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not it's not creating so I hope Google fights the hell out of this one  Who do you appeal to the appeal to the European Court? Oh, that's a good question. There is a process

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They are appealing although  Unless they can get a stay I don't know I don't know how it works in the EU  But I would presume they have 90 days to make hold on here confirms. It will appeal

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's a European Commission ruling

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way Google's also fighting that other ruling that they got last year of several billion dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Forget the Google shopping the biggest difference is that if it's just a fine Google that you know  It's no big deal for Google to pay billions of dollars in fines in this case  They have to change how they do the whole business model for and it's principal to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I think they've got a okay. I'm gonna wave a little American flag for as long as I still can  Before we switch to the Russian  It's also about defending American technology companies  There's an anti-american  Flavor to this  Anti-technology and anti-american and I think Google has to defend both and has to point out the value and the benefits that it brings

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah when  You buy an Android phone in China, it doesn't have the Google apps on it by Google's choice, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google doesn't a bunch of the apps are banned in China. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you can download I think you could still download the Google apps if you want  But it doesn't come the Google Play Store doesn't come on there. It's like the fire the Amazon Fire platform  You could download the Google Play Store with a simple. Yeah change

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a little different in China that Huawei and a couple of the other major smartphone vendors actually have Google apps on their PlayStores  So like a Huawei Play Store, you can download several Google apps not Gmail  Not you know, some of the ones that are that the Communist Party doesn't like so Leo. I think this is the way it works

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that Google actually appeals to the Commission  And then it goes to court. So there's a quote here from European Commission saying the Commission will defend its decision in court  So I think that there's probably a process and then it does go to court. Okay, so they don't have to pay the fine or change

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Their business yet. I don't I don't know that yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I mean in the US however, however, says the Wall Street Journal. Sorry. Sorry, Stacey. Let me just finish this  Okay, Google's appeal  However won't stop the company from having to pay its fine or comply with other elements of June ruling  Which could if upheld have far-reaching impacts on Google's increasingly sprawling business, okay, so they do have to pay it now  Which is ridiculous. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is usually in the US if you appeal something you stop the clock on it being implemented if they pay and it's overturned

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do they get a refund?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  with interest

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good question store credit

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, and then there's this Bloomberg opinion piece by Alex Webb that you were talking about Stacey Google  It's not quite the same. What's going on with Google and Microsoft?  We did we discussed this quite a bit in during Windows Weekly  And I knew that this that this panel would probably be pro Google and I was  Microsoft fan shot in Florida there was there, you know, I would never accuse Paul of that  In fact, he used to dislike Google and he's even said today, you know that those that's the old Paul. Yeah, I  You know, he did point out that you know, Google's market share does you know make give reasonably give you cause for concern  how they may leverage that and  And I certainly don't think now that you've you've given it a justification Jeff  Maybe I'll change my tune on that notion of forcing handset makers to choose  You know either you're a Google platformer or not. You still can imagine the confusion Leo

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't buy a Samsung phone or you don't know if it's a good Android or a bad Android

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's brand protection a little bit last week because we talked about like the security implications like of having the Google Store the Play Store  On your device and if you in the sort of protections they've built into that that's a very good point

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's you're it's a Wild West if you're not using the Google Play Store when it occurs to me. That's why so so and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do you call them Amazon?  Couldn't have put out a pure Google phone when they did the fire the miserable fire phone  Well, they could have  but they were already putting on a  Bad version of a company  They tried to do a phone  They probably wouldn't have been allowed not that they would have they wouldn't have been allowed to do a good Android phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then what about this other accusation that Google?  Charges different amounts of money to different companies that they favor some companies that give them sweetheart deals  on on Android

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, are they charging them different amounts of money or they create or they having the same kind of value associated with things and in doing?  Different pricing. I mean it's one thing for me to say hey Leo because you're having me on the show  You know, I'll give you a discount on my time appearing on the show because there's a benefit to me, right?  So they could have that because your market share is huge and you're promulgating the Android name in India

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're gonna charge you less. Yeah, that doesn't seem that seems like a reasonable business

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's media companies do it all the time. Yeah, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  friends and family  Yeah, all kinds of things. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mean you're just going after dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and and it has to also be said and I'm always surprised by how little the f-word comes up  But fair search is basically an organization  It's basically Oracle and Microsoft and some other anti Google companies and they are driving all this stuff  They're the other ones who brings and and it's it's just I think there should be more criticism for an approach to business  That basically says let's attack them in every way we can let's you know, let's get them in the courts on stuff  It just it really fair search is a  It's a really annoying organization

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's their page fair search org and here's the press package on the Google Android decision  Wonder how they feel about it. Hmm. It'll foster competition help may help restore competition for apps and operating systems  Principles should apply to smart TVs as well as smartphones  Fair search said a European Commission decision on Wednesday will help restore competition and mobile operating systems and apps  Vital for the digital economy by requiring Google to end abuses arriving arising from its control of Android  Are they fighting to wrest Android away from Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What  What bothers me about I don't know what bothers me about fair search is that there are areas where?  Microsoft and Oracle compete directly against Google and they should you know be aggressive in all those different ways  But what they what fair search does is they go after?  Every aspect of Google is just an anti Google it's anti Google. It's not it's not yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's a really perspective. I hadn't seen the suit to each at Saitama, which is one of the big respectable papers in Germany  I just put it on the rundown on the on the chat. So your repeat Europe's billion dollar  Penalty against Google is a warning to Trump

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay  about I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Think about about fair trade and such. Oh you think it has to do with the trade war  Well, what's what's wrong with that perspective is that this started?  Three years ago five years ago. This is going on a while. Yeah, so this is this started in the Obama era  Yeah, I think that's a little stretch. Yeah, I think it is but it's quite a you know for this paper to do that analysis  It's fascinating. Well, tell us about this paper. What's its the suit to each it? Yeah, it's  You know, it's the Washington Post of Germany, okay, right there's two  The Frankfurt Frankfurt to augmented sighting and the suit to each it's item are the daily papers from north and south  And then deep site. I just looked there as I'm looking at the FAC  Because I'm curious what the what the reception is in Europe  Maybe you speak French  Then it's top story on the on fa fa said that net it's the top story  You know, we will appeal the Commission the picture of Sundar

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do they do with five billion dollars that they that they harvest from their Google ATM  Like do they do they do they lower taxes by five billion dollars? Do they buy more buildings in Brussels?  What do they do with the money? It's a good question and  Gosh, they give it to orphans. I think yeah, I don't think so. No  hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They definitely need money for both social services and if you think about my grant challenges  That's probably but I'm gonna go into that's not the plan. That's not where  Yeah, I mean it could fund the regulatory agency. Yeah, I mean what do governments do with fines anyway, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it's just you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well in the US it depends on the body that's finding

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So meanwhile the top story  The mirror is revealed Sam and Georgia the contestants who shocked to love Island by quitting after controversial recoupling

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's not taking over all of Europe love Island. Where's that and how can I get there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a cruise you'll be on

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kara Swisher, I love her lead  Yesterday, I motored my Ford Fiesta down to Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park to interview CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does she really drive a Ford Fiesta? Well, I just find that fascinating

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that to establish your credentials as a woman of the people or yeah, I don't it's an odd lead  But she did get quite the story Zuckerberg defending  Having  Holocaust deniers that was that was just so

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is why he needs to hire smart people like journalists and professors

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He hires journalists many of my former colleagues work at Facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but they don't work in a position to have policy and and this was just this is just naive and naive is too nice  A word it's ignorant

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is also a really good at her job. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Even if she still drives a Ford Fiesta, here's the problem with globalization  If you're Facebook and you want to be what Facebook is the the company that owns  More users than people exist on the planet who?  Rakes in all the money and has all the power and is the biggest source of news in history of mankind, etc  Etc, then you have to be in Middle Eastern countries  You have to be in countries where Holocaust denials the official  You think that's why absolutely  Absolutely, and it's a problem on every topic if there are certain topics where it's like  Oh, you can't as a company. You can't support that position in China as a company  You can't support that position in these other places  He's got to please everybody and so it's like you if the official line is to crack down on Holocaust denial  You'll you'll actually be cracking down on governments who are using fail, but he also defends

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sandy hook deniers. I don't know what government wants that. Why don't you Kara asks want to just say get off our platform  Mark responds look as a born as I guess I could play the audio but I'll read it  Look as a born as some of this content could be I do think it gets down to this principle of giving people a voice  Let me give you an example of where we would take it down in Myanmar Sri Lanka where there's a history of sectarian violence  Similar to the tradition in the US where you can't go on a movie theater and yell fire because it creates imminent harm  The principles that we have on what we were moved from the service that are if it's going to result in real harm real physical harm  By the way, this is the law of the United States as well  You you know you can say anything you want but as soon as you threaten somebody with physical harm if they're in fear  That's not protected speech right if you're attacking individuals then that content should be on the platform  There's a lot of categories that we can get into but there's a broad debate. So  Kara says okay Sandy Hook didn't happen. It's not a debate. That's false. You can't just take that down  Mark says well, I agree. It's false  I also think that going to someone who is a victim of Sandy Hook and telling him hey, no, you're a liar  That is harassment. We will take that down  But he doesn't mention we won't take the Sandy. Yeah, it's false. I'm Jewish  There's a set of people who deny that the Holocaust happened. He brought it up  I find that deeply offensive, but at the end of the day, I don't believe our platform should take that down  Because I think there are things that different people get wrong. I don't think that they're intentionally getting it wrong

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the problem. That's so far off. Yes, of course Holocaust. And that is getting intentionally wrong

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's Kara says that he says well, it's hard to impugn intent to understand the intent

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which is him talking about scale really yeah, he's talking about the degree of difficulty of the task  Yeah, what he's trying because he's matching two different things here. What is the question of principles on what principle?  So there's a lot of discussion last week and there was a press  There was press stories and I'm sure you probably saw them or maybe already discussed them about info wars and you have people saying press people  Saying why don't you just take info wars off of Facebook and off of YouTube and at an anecdotal level?  I agree but at a principle level you can't do that until you set the principle that says what's the ongoing?  enforceable scalable principle that you are  Proposing for what gets taken down and what does not well said Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's exactly the problem and and it's a it is a sticky problem for sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I agree, but we got to all be in on the stickiness here. Does this come down to whether they're a publisher a platform?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right related to that issue that is  In Europe is us but I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mean it is do you want to neutrally host everything platform or do you want to exercise judgment and judgment implies values?  It has to know I I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Think you can you can still have values and you can still you can be a platform and you can still make decisions and  So it's a platform doesn't mean you take everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Quality or the types of content because that is yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not that's not the definition of publisher that's not the definition of media to me and  And we in media tend to look at the world godlike and keep on thinking this about us  I had this I had this argument on Twitter today with Christopher Mims from the Wall Street Journal  Well, it's media and that's content and I said no, it's neither  It's not media and and for that matter it is not content. It is conversation and that is different  And so, you know, I think we keep on trying to put these new pegs into our old holes  So you're saying you've got platform  Conversation and then publisher. Yes, I'm saying no I'm saying we have old definitions and old concepts of  publisher and platform  Whether that platform is a full cover whatever and I'm saying these things are something new. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So yes about okay, so then let's talk about conversation and  What the rules of quote-unquote conversation are  if you are  Because Facebook is not are you saying Facebook's in on this conversation and part of the conversation?  Because of its role is a platform for hosting it not in that old definition  But just because that's the question that I think we should figure out  I mean, it's one thing to be like. We're a bar, Stacey, right? We're a bar

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, and in a bar you have the right to refuse service to someone like oh, I don't know Sarah Sanders  right and  You can refuse to service for various reasons right Facebook has the right to refuse service to people  Google has the right Twitter has the right to just say we don't like this for whatever reason they have same reason that a bar  And now in this country a baker can refuse service. Does that make them less of a platform and more of a publisher?  No, that's a conversation place it makes them something new and differently  Oh, and that's that's the issue  We keep on trying to find the analogs to a world of 50 and 100 years ago  And this is something new we don't appreciate it  We in media keep on trying to define things in our image as if we're God so let people want to be us  Yeah, so let me confuse things further

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's so we're talking about whether they throw info wars off or don't throw info wars off their solution  Actually their solution air quotes is they're gonna sort of deep our time down rank. Yeah, so what's the deal with that?  So they can just let me

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me go into that Mike and let me first do a caveat do a disclosure  important for every show where this comes up is that I  Raised money from Facebook Craig Newmark Ford Foundation and others to work on these issues a news integrity initiative  And I haven't announced anything yet, but I'm also gonna be doing a new project here where Mike  I'm gonna work on exactly that question. So let me just give a second's background on this  What I learned from Facebook and we have a group of people product development people in the news business  we had in and we had a Facebook person in about a year ago and  We asked that person what's news at Facebook? How do you define news and it was fascinating?  Because the definition came back  Well, there's social content and there's public content period and public content was one big  Bucket that included everything that wasn't created on Facebook. It wasn't social  So the New York Times and the Washington Post and  Vladimir's lying blog were all in the same bucket and Facebook had no concept no  Variegation of definition or quality in all of that. So when Vlad got him in trouble  That's when they down ranked and pushed off basically all public content  So now what they're saying is we're gonna bring back to prominence quality content quality news content  But they don't really know what news is there is no quality is and so I'm working on a project  Not just for Facebook but for Google Twitter ad agencies and so on to try to aggregate the signals of quality and  lack thereof so that they can make more informed decisions and  We do have the platforms just choosing to make decisions  Google has said they account for the reliability authority and quality of sources and search Twitter is accounting for the quality of the public conversation  Facebook is now accounting for the quality of news sources  But they don't know how to do it. They don't know what's there and we got to help them  So Mike back to the question there's there's basically three things that Facebook can do four things  One is that they can kick you off you are you are abhorrent and we kick you off and there is some  There are some things that meet that test but very few they can down rank  That is to say that they don't promote it if Leo shares it with you  You'll probably see it but Leo's your friends won't see it number three  They can forbid you to get monetization  either by by sub by by by receiving ad revenue or by placing ads and then  That was it. That's for right kick you off down rank you  Oh, and then four is they can put up note of notices to the user  That that give indication about this site. Hey all of our fact checkers said this is bunk. You want to look at it  Okay, but watch out its bunk. So those are the tools that they have at hand

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Then the question becomes this this is a lovely those are good distinctions  But then you're not really describing a bar nor a conversation because of the power imbalance and  true true, so so I feel like  We still either a don't have the right vocabulary or they still look a lot like a publisher and the thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think we don't have a right vocabulary. Stacy. I think I think the fact that you're open to that idea is  Key here. That's why we have to try to using the old analogies doesn't really work and bar doesn't work either

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I grant well, so the big challenge here is Facebook is  Their goal isn't to be a bar because no bar wants to be or no no current  Conversational hub aims to be the place for every single conversation in the way that Facebook  It's their goal and it's their goal  You know because they're actually creating a marketplace for users to like find and advertise to people right? That's their actual goal. So  We've got to break that down because you can't be a home for conversation, but then trying to sell that conversation  That's kind of like trying to say  Who says you can't?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Under one rule show me the rule that says you can't do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It feels icky which is not a new which is not that kind of thing are actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right that literally is a bar. Yeah, cuz they're selling the booze the difference

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that imagine  Mark Zuckerberg actually did own a bar  He would and he ran it like face what a fun place that would be who gets to sit with whom who gets to say?  What who gets to hear what he would control it literally everything. This is the thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He would also control the ability for people who want to sell different types of cocktails to people  Access to that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think let's not overstretch the bar now  Obviously

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Snap let's have a drink. Why don't you pop open that bottle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think it's not unreasonable to say well  Maybe there is this something besides publisher and platform that Facebook is and I think you if mark says  We have a rule the rule is as long as you don't promote harm to another person  Even if what you say is false

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're gonna allow it but that's BS because here's the thing that we should be talking about  Facebook wants to control what your relationships are who hears what I mean Jeff says that okay info wars  He gave the example that if you were D  Prioritized and you posted something maybe I would see it but nobody else would see it  That's not exactly how it works  Even the most innocuous thing only goes to like 10 or 12 or 13 percent who knows nobody knows nobody knows who sees one

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And one of the reasons marks making this PR tour  He also did some interviews with CNN and other tractors again is because Sandy Hook's parents are suing Alex  Jones of info wars and  That some this is also bled into the Facebook presence because both are on Facebook for lying  So there is harm if a pub if somebody in a conversation on Facebook says oh  Sandy Hook never happened those people who say their kids were shot are  Actors and they're pursuing a political agenda that seems to me harmful, but it's not good again

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The thing that the reason we have to have these complicated conversations is because Facebook we're accepting that Facebook must be in control  Of everything where we should be arguing for is a more Twitter like thing where the user is in is in control

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's all kinds of really objectionable things on Twitter. You can do that Mike. You can do that right now, and it's a crappy user experience

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they we should be pushing them to make it a good user experience if you go there that they are they are

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I try to find the things you like and prioritize that that's exactly what they're doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There should be no community guidelines anything should go on Facebook if you want anything and if you say oh  I don't want to hear about Holocaust in Ireland. I want to want to hear if you plant

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's do something a little less loaded breastfeeding pictures. Yeah  Why  Now they don't anymore right I think they allow that now  But it took it took a long time. How do where does it? What's the harm? Where's the harm there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jonathan's it train at of Harvard has argued to Facebook and I've been in the room when he's argued this that basically we should all get a  You know some some dials  Yeah, and that if we want to watch nothing, but Alex Jones then make that make that my choice and my responsibility  I agree with that right I  But I here's right and I see the point and I get it  And that's going more to the full platform aside  But I also see that look at all the pressure Facebook's under  There are things that occur on its brand  That they they either host or promote  That have an impact and I think they have a right to say as a publisher does if you want to go to the publisher end  Whether or not to have that the kind of pressure they're under is just they can't win which is where it goes  So if you go Leo the Congress on Facebook and the net it's a it's a Twitter  Thread about Facebook  It shows you the kind of so when when the other reason things are out there is because they had testimony before Congress once again  and the kind of pressure on them is  Ridiculous from each end so you have  One member of Congress say I mean you have the the was the diamond and silk and diamond silk, right?  So you have Steve King go why doesn't the gateway plan to get more traffic? You should be giving them more traffic  This is bad. You don't give more traffic, right?  And then they say that writ Lamar Smith accuses Google of blocking all searches for Jesus Chick-fil-a and the Catholic religion  And then you have Ted Deutsch say why is as is Alex Jones and Infowars on YouTube at all  And then you have Ted Poe representative denounces Snoop Snoops a left-wing organization, right?  That's so what they're trying to say is F you all  Right and Leo's right. We're gonna put a put a standard  I don't like what the standard is myself personally the standard is gonna be as you said Leo  Yeah, if you're trying to harm people then we'll take that down

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But there's a big issue because I think it is harmful to people to say your kid wasn't shot  I so defined harm the issue exactly hard thing to the phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think info wars harms democracy and I think that you can't be neutral anymore and you have to make some decisions here

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you would support one person saying such horrible things in a barbershop in some small town to another person

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have the right to do that. I were the barber if I were the barber

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I had someone in my office just this week. So how about I found rather abhorrent about Israel and Palestine  Yeah, and I didn't kick that person out, but I said I'm not gonna choose to deal with that person  That's my that's my right that's my choice

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Zero sympathy for the pressure Facebook is under they don't have to make 40 billion dollars a year  There's nobody says why are we all cheering for them to be just the most dominant powerful thing in the history of mankind  They should give up control and we users should be demanding control and and and stop  Trishing ourselves and not trying to make sure that Facebook has all the money all the control and all the users  How with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean the only control I have asserted is to leave Facebook  Right there an intermediate where I could stay on Facebook and have more control  All right, you want to be more like Google do you you can you can turn things off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can unfollow people you can unhide all that they have all these controls  But what you can't do is say yeah, I want to see I want to see things that violate the community standards  Why are there community standards and whose community does this? I have my own community

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mike Mike whoa whoa?  Why are there community standards because we because we're screaming about how we're living in a horrible  Uncivil world right now and there is some level of responsibility that these platforms have

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because Facebook's algorithm which controls everything is designed to make people glued and addicted to their screens

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's that now. No, they have said they have said they have said for example that yes  You should be more that we will get you to watch dumb cat videos and now they say we are going to instead emphasize  Meaningful interactions between people so they've changed that as a strategy and don't forget Mike that media's  Middle model is exactly what you just described  Yeah media invented that model media created clickbait media wanted to glue you to everything media wants to addict you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it ain't just Facebook folks. It's our business to part of the problem is that Facebook wants to be the internet  We would all agree that there shouldn't there's nobody running the internet saying take that down put that up  Yeah, and I think some of this problem is that Facebook wants to become your internet and for many people it is I had a  Call her on the radio shows told me that she got all of her news from Facebook  Yeah, and I said well you have to stop doing that and I suggested some alternate sources  But if but for many people Facebook is their internet. So is that?  We wouldn't tell we wouldn't say hey mister if there was some areas in yeah, there is an issue of confusing

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Public content with personal content in some ways and  We do this in the real world not just in the in the in the fake world in the inner on the internet  so we call our aunt Susie and some of us are like, you know, my  There are people in my family who will take anecdotal evidence from their friends as being far superior to  Actual fact and facts. So I had someone explained to me why baldness actually  was  Transmitted over the father side if your father's bald you're gonna be bald and I tried to explain how Jane  So I think there's that gets your evolution Stacy. You're probably gonna lose that too. I did I lost that  I actually lost that battle and you know, I was like, okay, that's cool. That's fine. That's a fairly harmless  So that's that's the thing. I think  Deciding that I think it's silly that Facebook's trying to make this distinction  I think it serves its own ends in a way  That's probably not helpful because given the scale and there was actually a really good article in Wired a couple weeks ago  It's called the complexity of simply searching for medical advice. Oh, that was so good. Yes  Yeah in it  They talk about this data void in this this  They bring up an example on Facebook of people searching for vitamin K shots for their newborns  Right and if you search for that on Facebook  So basically if you're calling your friends and family like you might do to say hey, they want me to do this  Did you guys do this?  what they got was a lot of information from anti-vaxxers and  Yes, somebody didn't get their shot and somebody's baby died and that is a tragedy that did not have to happen in  so that's an example where  You know, did Facebook cause this harm wired calls it the data void? Oh, no, sorry someone it Bing calls it the data void  Wired talks about the asymmetry asymmetry of passion here. So yes people doctors who are

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fact based aren't doing a lot of posts on the value of vitamin K for infants  But people who think it's killing their infants are posting a lot  Yeah, and that unfortunately gives a higher weight on the internet, which is a larger problem in society as well of

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Trusting science. That's the problem with Stacy's conversation is the person she was talking to wouldn't trust science

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think that's actually the issue. I think I mean, yes, that is a issue  But I think the big issue is these companies make it really easy to find things that someone really cares about  Promoting so there is it  Alex Jones doesn't just put his crazy ideas out there. He actively promotes them in a variety of different ways  Whereas the rest of us are like a ignoring it because it's crazy to think that Sandy Hook never happened  Why would we ever think that it or be?  there's only 20 parents who are really passionate about you know trying to change this and promote it and they're kind of hobbled because they're  like by the ideals of common decency and  That's that's I think a bigger issue that all of these things happen and that's something that Facebook isn't talking about nor is Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, so what are you in a way? What you were saying? What do you suggest? What is the solution then to that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's what's what's the solution is to start realizing so I think it's it's a bigger solution across all of technology  Especially as we move into AI. It's this idea of understanding  adversaries so  understanding who wants to  Who wants to promote different ideas?  Understanding that there are gonna be two or multiple sides to anything and some of them are not wrong  Which means you do have to say the Holocaust didn't happen right or sorry, sorry that the Holocaust happened

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stacey has made that decision right so Google says you should be able to find the Holocaust denier because they're out there  But if you ask is the Holocaust real the answer is yes  And as I talked about the show in the past if you now ask is is climate change real  You're gonna get science back not conspiracy theories first. So Google's made that decision  They saw I asked them directly this means you're signing with science and they said yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think Facebook actually has to do that in times where in in cases where there is actual like  We know Sandy Hook happened. There's no freaking doubt about that and Facebook should have some sort of disclaimer and I or  Shouldn't show it at all. I mean, so Stacey here's the here's the here's here's yours

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's your probe that for a second  So this is where we're getting to the difference though in your view of publisher and platform blah blah blah  Key difference here and what we just talked about is that Google deals with information whereas Facebook deals with people and that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's another distinction Google search doesn't  filter it ranks and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Facebook that's exactly what Facebook does Facebook Frank's it's all there right?  You know it all day you wouldn't see it all it is ranked. I I've tried

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't see it all I go to I go to the Facebook newsfeed and I go through and I see these  You know from like five people and then I go the next day and it's the same post I saw yesterday and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you keep going and going and going and going and going this is what they've said  I've been a rosemarie people people have asked  Yeah, they are ranking and then if you kept clicking next to next next next next  Yeah, you would eventually see it all or you can go to the feed where you see it all the other difference

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that you're ranking you can't search?  Facebook for content and get heavy results rapid search on earth  It's deliberate is obviously deliberate they don't want people searching Facebook on Google  Theoretically you search for some question you see the you see them at Facebook doesn't want you to search  No, why does not because that that's a way to actually use Facebook in a way that isn't mediated by Facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, but say Facebook isn't a search engine though Mike. It's it's it's different  I think I would get they do have a search box  They do have a search box  Why search for information on Facebook? It'd be awful

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But shouldn't we demand that face if Facebook is supposed to be a source of information instead  We're supposed to be just  Who says who says it's for people from source people get information from Facebook people get more  More people get information from Facebook than any newspaper any news publication, etc  Yeah, but let me finish the let me finish the point if a newsfeed spoon feeds you stuff is like here  Here's a here's a here's a crazy conspiracy theory like a company  Whereas searching for something if I were say well is that true and I should be able to search Facebook and see all the  Perspectives that are on Facebook, but why aren't we upset that they deliberately prevent you from searching that they have a search bar  They make you think there's search function Twitter has a search function Google Plus has a perfect search  All every place has a search except Facebook deliberately hobble search. Why aren't we upset about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because it's not a content site and I think what you would get back in search  I'm too frustrated by the search but but when I'm looking for a person it's crappy search, right? I should be able to find that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why are they but taking that agency away from us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think you're presuming it's something different than it's not you're trying to make Facebook into Google and it's not if

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's say let's say I think that Mike's right because I think Facebook wants to be the Internet  It doesn't want you to use Google. You can't link out of that's a good point  Live in Facebook and that's Facebook's goal  I mean this is to your point also of them making 50 billion dollars a year. They want to be the Internet, right?  So I think if you're if you're gonna make that your goal  Then it would behoove you to do some of the things that the Internet does or Google does for many people Google's the Internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. So let's say let's say you you have a you run a podcast network say for example, just grab

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's just so I don't anybody would want to do that. But go ahead. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're gonna get asked for mental illness and all that stuff, but yeah, sure  So somebody has a podcast network and let's say you want to find podcast enthusiasts, right?  You go to Twitter you search for a podcast fan. That's easy. Get all these people Google Plus Google search  You can go anywhere and find that you go to Facebook way  They are not gonna know you want to find the podcast fans. You better pay the advertising money and they'll tell you exactly  That's why they'll tell you exactly who the podcast fan you search for subject material  You can search for anything if you pay for an ad and you do but I can't go to Facebook and search for Sandy Hook  You won't get anything usable at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean and you think that that's because they want you to pay for that capability

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They want to control exactly what you know what you see who you connect with they want to control it all because that's where the money  Is that's what I'm saying. So that is directly

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is directly in opposition to the other thing they want which is to be the single and sole source of information

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They they want it both ways you can't you shouldn't get you can't get both  They what they really want is for you to spend all your as much time as possible on Facebook  They want you to spend as much money as possible on Facebook and they want you to look at what they tell you to look at  Exactly, and they want to know every is that not fair Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That sounds like a fair characterization of I think I know I think Leo your characterization before was better  It's about it's about you know going outside of Facebook. I disagree with my characterization that Facebook  The Facebook's goal is to be source of information  Facebook's goal is to be a place for conversation, which is my discussion with Stacey and that changes  I think that's their stated goal. I'm a larger goal is that you never leave Facebook. Yeah period. Oh, that's for sure  Leo I'm agreeing with that, but I'm not agreeing with the point that Mike is making that  The basis of what they do is to be a source of information

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm not saying that that's the basis of what they do, but I'm saying that in reality they are the  second largest source of information site probably and Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The source of information I'm just gonna take issue a little bit with you Mike here only because I just did it  so I went on Facebook and I searched for Sandy Hook and  I got  Links to a variety of like Facebook pages one is a an anti-gun effort one is the town itself  And then now related searches the top one is Sandy Hook's  Sandy Hook's hoax the second one is Sandy Hook summer concerts  The third and this is just related Sandy Hook was a hoax and then Sandy Hook National Park Sandy Hook Beach  So scrolling down I see posts from friends  So yeah, and that's part of the customization most of my friends believe that saying I'm sorry  I shouldn't even say believe most of my friends know Sandy Hook happened. So they're very like hey gun violence is bad blah blah blah  The public posts are CNN  Something about Park Rangers and Sandy Hook  and  another CNN story about Sandy Hook victims filing a lawsuit against Alex Jones and  then on the articles front  Again Mark Zuckerberg does not want to be and Holocaust deniers or Sandy Hook truthers  So I don't actually see anything except for the related  The related searches about Sandy Hook being a hoax you're getting you're right. I don't either. I don't either

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you're getting the word Sandy Hook in in page titles and in hashtags  But probably my friends I'm getting my friends statements, too. I'm getting journalists talking about

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Disagreeing with what Zuckerberg said and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And and decrying Alex Jones, I'm just gonna say I love it that I can't play this game  I'm not getting anything because I can't go on Facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And if I go to and this is an interesting thing  I think if I google just Sandy Hook a couple stories down  I actually get the Sandy Hook hoax by NY mag, right and that's actually not talking about it being a hoax  It's talking about the people who think it was a hoax  But then a couple stories down after that I get the Sandy Hook hoax  theories explained from HuffPo and  What's happening is the news coverage of these hoaxers are driving up that concept in these searches  So then what I'm doing is I'm it's actually taking these marginalized weird views of people and saying  In making them somewhat legit because they I could click on that and some people are gonna read that and be like, ooh, I  Never thought about that. What if that's actually true? Holy cow  especially people who are inclined to believe more these things because  they're promoting this is and they're not really promoting it as  To to opposing viewpoints to legitimate opposing viewpoints, but that's what some people are gonna look at it as I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not surprising that if you were gonna design Facebook  That  Maybe you wouldn't explicit explicitly you would say what Zuckerberg says  It's about connecting all the people in the world blah blah blah  But what you would end up with is something that is designed to be as sticky as possible to keep people inside of Facebook  looking at  The news feed because that's where you could most reasonably monetize. Yeah, you understand why search wouldn't be that good  And I don't I never used search in Facebook  I remember they promoted it for a while to find things. Yeah, but it would never really worked  Well, and of course, there's no one people. Yeah, there's not really people I can't find much of an incentive for them to do that really  I don't think this was Nate even necessarily a conscious decision  But if you want to be maximize the profitability and the success of a company of Facebook  You would say don't leave Facebook have that be your only page  Have the newsfeed be the thing that feeds you because that way we can feed you the most appropriate advertising  We'll monitor what you click on what you read what you spend time on so as to maximize that time spent  It's a it's a it's a feedback loop that seems to work that whether you say we're about connecting the world's people or whatever  That's what you would end up with right? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And and despite all my complaining about Facebook and doesn't very well it does it very well  And I think we'll look back at this as kind of a golden era because we're facing some real problems in the future  The first problem we're facing is you notice when Facebook was facing the Senate?  hearings and all that kind of stuff  Ultimately, the only real solutions you provided it was oh, we're gonna have AI take care of all of that  Dave's AI will take it. So that's all secret behind the scenes. We're not gonna see AI, right?  Choosing it's just like news. It's basically magic right?  It's gonna put it under the rug and when nobody will have access to what is being censored  the other problem with Google and all in Siri and all and  virtual assistants is in the future if I ask Siri or Google Assistant a  Question it's gonna give me an answer. I'm not gonna get a hundred thousand results ranked  I'm gonna get the answer same problem. It's a bigger problem because it's like wow, so  Somebody is gonna be deciding what the truth is. Yeah, which is  Which is really a problem and I don't know how we're gonna solve it and you forgot a third problem Mike, which is

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  AI is still really bad at interpreting and applying  Human common sense to inquiries and questions. I love how far we've come  But there is a reason that you know AI is still laughably bad at a lot of interpretive  Spots so before we get all freaked out about it. We actually have to make it decent

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I think this would be a good time to have a glass of water

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You the perfect segue by doing the bar thing  And you ignored it Leo. Is that why you did that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because yeah, remember we played this thing was it from Conan or one of the late-night shows if Facebook were a bar  Video oh I never saw that. Oh, yeah  SNL it was SNL and it was it was exactly what Facebook would be like if it were a bar  The bartender pushing of course, right all of these theories that keep people in in there cuz nobody you didn't want anybody to leave  I don't think mark. I would after reading by the way kudos to Kara Swisher good interview  She challenged him. She did as good a job as you can with a CEO

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She wears she wears sunglasses indoors, but she's a great interview

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think she did a very good job  And I think I would say based on that interview which is at recode.com  Mark is not a evil or malicious person. Although if he you know, I  Understand that one of the reasonable questions people might have is is he evil  Does he have an agenda because if he did he has the perfect evil genius power?  Yeah to to promote whatever that agenda might be no no no no he is evil

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He is evil because he doesn't understand his own privilege  No, he doesn't want to understand and he doesn't people are privileged rarely understand Stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're see that that that you're you're you're in a time where we're seeing a lot of evil. You're devaluing the term

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, there's even learn but I think it's I think it's irresponsible. I think it's a big difference  I think it's reprehensible. There's got to be a good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Rhythm and personal choice.

I don't know why I love white wine, but you know that about us Mike because you always bring us red  Yep, so so we did this you do the profile you subscribe every month  You're gonna get you can get more if you want, but the typical subscription is a bottle a week four bottles  Maybe two you have with a meal one you put in your cellar for later  When you bring to friends when you go over there's nothing nicer by the way  They're bringing a bottle of weak wine to friends because they have beautiful labels. They're their wines that are delicious  They're very drinkable and it's so fun every month when we get we just got our box today when we get our box  We get a little let there be wine delivered to your doorstep  There's the envelope describing the wines lots of background information and let's see what we got  Let's start with  Just at random  Now that's a good label baseline baseline. It is from Santa Barbara la and cantata vineyard  It's a 2016 pinot pick with conviction that sounds delicious

You don't have to send it back  They'll just send you another one. No questions asked. So sit back relax celebrate  Enjoy the summer you'll enjoy the winter just as much why settle for the same bottle of wine you always get we get we all  Get wine ruts. I'm but yeah, it was a big wine rut and then along comes wait

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you go to you go to the store and you face the wall of wine and you're just overwhelming  You don't know what's going on. And so you get the thing, you know, I like getting a different wine every time

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the beauty of wine is this is variety of flavors. They have a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  summer food  Oh  You can get oh some blender stuff. There's some there's some other stuff in here. This is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I am sad that I cannot try the wink wine, but I will be imbibing. I like oh after that Facebook conversation  I know that was you're on kind of vacation. Yeah, I am on vacation. I'm on this vacation II as I get that's nice  What you'll you'll still write while you're there, right?  You'll still write while you're there, right? Oh, I am writing the newsletter will still go out Kevin

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I recorded a show this morning. See this is why having a podcast is cool because you can do it anywhere  Internet school. I  like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was gonna go into mock horror at the personalization of the wine taste thing. Oh my god  They know what you like  Won't be allowed in Europe

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The spatch from super internet says Mike Elgin and computer world  Yes, there is a much better internet than the one you're using. Wait a minute. What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so Jeff and I were arguing before the show started about who is the bigger fanboy of the pixel book and  He tried to pull the old I've been a fan longer than you have therefore. I'm a bigger fan. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We all have the cr-48 probably yeah who's been using them exclusively

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exclusively

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exclusively I've been using this exclusively for two and a half months. How about that?  So here's the here's that you were iPad II for a while. I was I was in MacBook Pro II. Yeah  Late to the party. I'll go I took my MacBook Pro perfectly good  2015 which is the last good one and I just tossed it aside and I've been using this full-time  So here's the benefit that nobody talks about everybody talks about security and convenience and the fact that's in the cloud and nowadays with  Android support it's like it's great and I've made the point  in a column that now  Correct the pixel the the Chromebook platform the pixel book platform has gone from being the  The platform that has the runs the least number of apps to the platform that runs more apps than any

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely, so you've got you've got Chrome extensions. You've got Android Android and now I'm really excited about crustini

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can run my Linux there are two ways to run Linux you can run it through the through through the to the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, anyway, there's there's that's that make sure it's not I'm sure it's not but wait  This is the tradition of wine, right? You have to open it up taste it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow, that's fantastic. All right, baby and believe me even though it's an advertiser of it. I'm gonna give you a lease support

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So so here's the benefit  Instead of the study your boxing glove. I know what a straw

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nice color, so here's the benefit that nobody talks enough about so Chrome is great Chrome extensions are great  The problem with Chrome is just clobbers your performance. Isn't that it's a big bold thing. It's like delicious  Yeah, it clobbers your performance and now with the with the with the with the new edition of isolating  Each process within Chrome. The performance is even worse in Chrome 10% Yeah, but it's more safe  It's more safe and the security is fantastic  But with a pixel book and I have and whether it's the you know, the 8 gig or the 16 gig pixel book  You are what people don't realize is you are free from those problems I open 60 tabs at once  Without any significant why but I don't understand. What is it that makes a chrome?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stacey's got a headache for you and I and I run I run 50 60 70 simultaneous extensions

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I don't understand. What is it doing? It's so it's just Linux  It's a it's a it's a high powered laptop running a low low low powered operating  You're saying the pixel book the pixel book hardware. So in my version of the internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because they had a pretty good deal on pixel books on Amazon Prime day

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah in my version of the internet the internet that I use I don't use passwords  I don't have tracking every time I put in a password  where  That has been compromised and is posted on blackboard web. It says oh, they don't use that password anymore. That's out there Chrome  Does that Chrome extensions do that? Oh, I see. Okay  The point is it's in a subtle point and I think it's a very important point  Anyone who runs Chrome on Safari Windows, whatever can use any of the extensions  But only pixel book users can run all the extensions and when you run all the extent for example  I have probably 20 extensions that affect gmail  Wow, I can send SMS I can I can I can send mail merge. Have you published anywhere your list of recommended extensions?  Really should do that and and I think but I think I think it's a really powerful thing  But but literally pixel book and pretty soon about 15 or 20  Chromebooks will be powerful enough to run all this stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But when you make an excellent point, which is that basically a hardware designer manufacturer Apple Microsoft, whoever  Optimizes the OS for the tasks they expect to be done. Right? So the iPad is optimized for certain things the iPhone  You're saying that the pixel book is optimized actually Chrome OS optimized for lower power

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's optimized for the internet not apps not all the just just the internet  So I've I've been using computers since the 80s and every computer I've ever had no matter how much I've spent  It's always like it's too slow. I want it fat. I'm a speed freak, right? I it's always too slow  This is the first device I've ever had where I don't say that it's fast. Yes fast fast fast  I mean, it's like so fast. Did you get the base model? No, I got the I got the cattle  I got the most expensive a version of the least expensive computing platform  There is it's a bit basically 2k when I was done with the case and that this and that  That's what you'd spend for a regular laptop. Yeah, and if that's optimized for what you do, right?  That's the one that's right. And and just here's an here's an example  So I run I run an extension that takes away all the tracking it improves the speed by 43%  I know what's which one is it?  Ghostery or it's yeah, it's one of those. Let's see. I got it right here in my files

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want a list of all your extensions because actually I agree with you and that's better to Kevin for is about Chromebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, Kevin. You should you should talk to Kevin disconnect. It's called disconnect

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that'll disconnect will also run on your Android phone and your iOS phone at your iPhone  so anyway  that the point is that if you if you you're free to go and run many many many extensions and when you do the  Extensions you're in another world. You're in a better internet all the complaints people over the internet. There's too much tracking  There's an extension for this the passwords blah blah blah  You can get rid of every complaint you have about the internet all at the same time if you run enough extensions  I'm thinking I should buy an upgraded Chromebook. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Was confused about your column like I read it and I was like tell me more about this supposed super internet  And I think it's because I was looking for a macro theme that would affect everything  But what you're really just talking about is this optimization around  Chrome in the pixel book and what Google's doing for fuchsia

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I don't know I fuchsia is not part of the internet and how it operates. Yeah, so here's the so just from my own personal experience  I've been using a MacBook Pro and have a user of Chrome and every time I'd add an extension  I'd be like, okay  I got a D commission another extension because it's like it not just slows down the browser slows down everything  It's just really bad and when I move to the pixel book, I just quadrupled the number of extensions and with no performance penalty at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, so then you're talking about basically an internet that's customized towards you around extensions, which is your super internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  operating system that's  Optimized for the internet. Here's the confusing part

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I mentioned fuchsia in the column and here's what I was the point  I was making in the future with fuchsia and probably other operating systems. I'm talking ten years from now  You won't have an apps that contain features you'll have features that apply to all the apps  Features will be separated from I was excited. Yes, and that's what extensions do  Extensions take features and they apply it to everything. So for example, I use that's interesting. That's a neat perspective  Yeah, so so for example, I have this fee  I have so websites don't just reveal all the all the web addresses  I on this show I one of my picks of the week of a couple months ago was hunter  Which you go to any website and tell you all the web email addresses associated with that website  That's a feature, but it's not a feature of one site. It's a feature of every site  it's a feature that's applied across everything and  This is this is the this is why chrome extensions are kind of a glimpse into the future of all operating systems  Where features are separated from apps and this is one of the reasons why the whole internet is transformed if you use enough chrome extensions  Nobody has any respect for chrome extensions  Because it's a problem because of the performance issues, but again on the pixel book and pretty soon a dozen or twenty  High-end chrome books will be able to run many many chrome extensions. They're more high-end  Equivalents. Yes. Yeah, there are many

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  1649 if you max that out with an i7 a 512 gig hard drive. Do you use the hard drive at all though?  I guess the extensions live there but documents I I have like I have like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  480 gigs free. Yeah something like that. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Know what I use it for is I download movies and shows  so I use Netflix and Showtime and Google Play and all of that and and  This is my tablet as well. Yeah  So I used to carry it kind of a you know  Both in a sense and now I just flip it over when they yell at me on the airplane turn off your laptop  I just flip it around and it's now a tablet  Yeah, yell at me and I watch a show. Oh how funny that's where I'm using are you allowed to do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They tell you any device below a certain number of inches is what the last couple flights I've been on  They're like any small computing device. They're wise to that true invention

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  People would scream if they have the large tablet knows the tablet laws. They don't see the keyboard. They're fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But here's another thing that's this amazing so you can run mobile apps full-screen on a laptop. For example, I love snap seed  Yeah, right, but I run it full screen

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because it's an Android and because it's from Google they've optimized a lot of apps are not optimized for your but a lot of them are

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A lot of apps are on full screen and it's so good because sometimes mobile apps are the best thing out there  We should have had so much on this show. He would be so happy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, one problem is that  Netflix and often Amazon video do not run well they get confused  It's not optimized well for  Problems still whereas Google Play is optimized for it and what operates beautifully but showtime  Netflix and and Android stuff is really difficult to have to restart often to get it going or it gets confused

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's that's the only problem I have there are other Google apps that are not optimized for the pixel book and do not even run  The Washington Post and there are other problems  I mean the MacBook Pro the fit and finish and the all that stuff is superior for sure and the  The the pixel books performance is kind of a mixed bag  It's everything's on a hair trigger like you think about touching a key and all of a sudden you see the letter on your skin  I didn't even and so that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually Mike it knows what you're going to type. Yeah, you've witnessed the next internet and the next Google. Yeah, exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right telepathy, you just don't know. Yeah, but anyway, my point is that people talk about  You know that pixel book is  Inadequate because it's not a business machine like Windows Windows is optimized for business  It's not a content creation machine like a Mac  The Macs are optimized for content. How about the internet is the internet important because this machine is optimized for the internet  I would agree with you on that actually well

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's optimized for business too  The grab and grow program the Google's pushing that's on the rundown. Yeah, it's kind of fascinating  It's you you're hoteling not just your desk your hotel in your computer  Mm-hmm, and you just go in and pick out a Chromebook who cares what Chromebook it is  Yeah, I do like it doesn't matter. Yeah, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  had I did a  one of my favorite horror stories in business is that I I did a  Presentation once with this executive of a major company  And he had his he was a middle in the middle of an acquisition and had all the details locally on his hard drive  On his laptop and it but he was like holding on to it. It was he wouldn't check it  Yeah, you know, he carried it on cuff bracelets and the airline lost his carry-on luggage  How let that sink in for a second? They there was no room the overhead compartment  They said don't worry. We'll take that for you. Yeah, you never saw it again and the whole time we're doing this this presentation  He was like distracted. He's sitting there going. Oh my god. What have I done? His career was over  He had I mean so this grab-and-go is an example of the fact that so act doesn't matter what happens the hardware they have

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google employees can go up to a kiosk and  They just take a fully charged Chromebook and they log into it. It's got everything on it  It's it's their Chromebook. Then they bring it back. It erases it and they're done

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they're extending this to the to the world so this has been

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I remember when they were for education when they were pushing Chromebooks. They were a little kiosk the airport  You could borrow a Chromebook and then get off the plane, which is a great idea  I wish they would do more of that essentially this is a program that's been dog-fooded in Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where else you're gonna see this enterprises? It's it's now a program that they're rolling out to enterprises

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Have you seen like the the HP X2 which is the separable screen? Yeah. Yeah. I have the Windows version of that  And it's nice  But but you know the problem is that is what Mike's saying about about the level of hardware  It only goes to four four gigs on it and I want at least eight if not twelve so I can run the sixty  Tabs about as many as that Stacy. Don't worry  and  So so we need more competition at the high end of this everybody thought the world the Google was crazy  Making a high-end machine. Yeah, and I think that and I'm seeing all the tech guys now all coming late to the party saying  This is why you can actually give up your Mac and this is no boy the Chromebooks actually, okay  What's funny is a lot of?  burning bush late  conversion to my religion  Well within a year or two

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mac OS and iOS are the only platforms that won't run on the on the pixel book flawlessly  I mean we run Windows you'll run Linux you'll run all this stuff Android  And it's just gonna be in virtualization or in  Virtualization one in the case of Linux school is working on it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've been using that and I really like its command line only but it does help me a lot because I can run some basic

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Programs that I really there's an enormous amount of energy around around making these things work at high performance

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The idea putting windows on this just makes me feel ill my friend build  I deal lab buys a top Mac laptop, and then he converts it to Windows which just

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Throws me yeah, it's good hardware, but I don't know if I'd want to run Windows on it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wouldn't either but the point the point is that if you're a developer or something like that you want to or a web developer  For example, and you want to see how it looks on Windows  You can just flip over to Windows check it out go back  it's it's it's it's the point is that if you're if it's your main machine and you're a professional and  Especially if somebody else is paying for it you definitely want the Cadillac  you know what I'm saying you you want to max out on memory and and and and and  Storage because within the next couple of years there's gonna be a lot of stuff you can do with it  Even if you can't necessarily do a lot with it now

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Stacey are you converted to the religion you ready to go out and get a pixel um no I just

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I am I am wishing that  Like I want to edit your story because I think take you miss go for it  I'm like  You underplayed this you focus too much on the Chromebook extensions when it's really about the future of the internet and  That's just an example of where you could go with this  Because I think you're right with the where it could go I do think extensions are really pretty complicated for most people  They're basically a harder version of apps in a lot of ways people haven't learned to trust them the same way so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm trying to change that I think I really think extensions are one of the most underappreciated things out there  So fantastic I want you to make a list somewhere, okay, I will Elgin publish it somewhere and just say yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You've got to do your list like yeah, yeah, seriously just send it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean should you want it Kevin has about Chromebooks calm so you could even send it there or you have your own site

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  Here's the other problem Mike here's oh, I have to yeah  I would kill kill kill kill kill to be able to run Skype on it for this show yeah  Well, that's a mic here. I have to borrow a Mac in the office  I have to take it my Android tablet  Run Skype well because it's native and I can use that and I've fooled Leo and Carson a few times run it from the tap

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  But

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, I try to run it from my pixel book for my pixel

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we just need we need to find a pixel book analog for Skype we could use that wait wait

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What about the Microsoft surface go for Skype because didn't that just I don't want to carry another machine

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll have that next week if we could talk about it, but but I I think Mike's right that Windows is probably  Over is a little too bloated. It's designed for business applications. It's not the right answer right  What I think we need is a Skype analog that's a Chromebook extension. I don't know if that's hangouts  I don't think it is hangouts Google Duo Duo doesn't even run on the pixel book

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, isn't that odd for Android doesn't run so it's one of those Google things that doesn't run

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the drawback and this is you're a little bit dependent on Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I am anyway, so right yeah, I live lovey to Google. Yeah, it's fine follow the light

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Come use your pixel come

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Was a great everything's okay Amazon went down during prime. I didn't know they had so many dogs

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you what about the dogs when you get a failure they show this is one of the Amazon dogs  And there's I haven't seen there's a cock-a-doo  There's a lot of or whatever and yeah, there's a lot of them. I didn't know that before

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I kind of like Stacy avoided Prime Day. We feel like it's amateur hour  Yeah, but there were some really good deals they sold a hundred million products in 30 hours  Consumerism is still alive. That's crazy alive. It also made Jeff Bezos briefly the richest man ever to live in the world  One and a half billion to two billion dollars in revenue estimates gross merchandise value topped three and a half billion  This is according to RBC capital markets analyst Mike. I'm sorry Mark Mahaney  Company did not provide sales figures some pretty good deals including a  $750 for the base model pixel book yep  But the number one device sold as we would expect was the Amazon fire TV stick people love the fire TV stick  mostly because they

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry go ahead what fascinated me about about this was how it brought up other retailers competitive retailers

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jeff that's just amazed me. They've made a new holiday. It made Christmas in July well as I as I as I pointed out in a blog

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  post yesterday, I think  If you have a chrome extension every day is Prime Day. There's a there's an extension called camel camel camel  You've heard about this. Yeah, I love it  There's there's several others that will basically when you're on Amazon  With the extension you just click a button when you're on Amazon and says well  Here's where you should buy it go buy it over there. It's like half price and so I gotta start using all this stuff. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Prime day boosted other this is what Jeff was talking about other large retailers sales by 54%  So easy what happened?  you know what I think this is this is probably you can thank the wire cutter and  thrifter and other sites that when Amazon Prime had a deal would say oh, but there's a better deal at Walmart and  I bet you that's where some of that traffic came from is people just saying all right. I want to buy it  Let's see where else I can get it. Maybe they use camel camel camel

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it gave people an excuse to shop and what happens is you're like, oh this is a smoking hot deal  And then you're like is it and then you're like, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Walmart slashed prices, but also it also

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Motivated the other retailers to put on great deals. Yes, so the consumer won all around now watch  They're gonna go after Amazon next in Europe. I predict  Next American company huge American company richest man in the world. They're gonna say Amazon's evil Amazon and  And  Amazon's really no not yet, but they're gonna watch you just watch Henry Egan's you just watch and and  It's helping  Yeah, it's helping

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  consumers one time we landed in Venice and we started driving north and  Along the side of the highway you see this building start and you're driving and just like well, there's still built building is continuing  Keep driving Bill Mike. That's like an Amazon building got to the other end Amazon Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Massive actually Amazon workers struck in Europe during Prime Day. So this is the problem  European workers this is Europe. This is Europe because of course conditions in Amazon warehouses are not ideal  And they decided to take the advantage of the big day to to have a two-day strike in the screws  Yep  I don't know how that affected Prime Day

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It probably can't be worse than Amazon site going down which apparently was fine so no so

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe this is pure Alex Jones, but  Do you think it's interesting that during the biggest day Amazon has a more bandwidth than anybody?  There's no reason Amazon couldn't anticipate and handle all the traffic they got that their sites  Went down I'm I gotta say if you're gonna hit America you hit it where it counts

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're not gonna take your shirt off. Are you Alex?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We had heard last week that there was a lot of chatter about the Russians attacking the United States  Of course the president's so what's the harm?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean I get that people could not shop for their stuff and Amazon is sad, but that's not it's probing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's what they did Ukraine. They took the power grid down for a few hours. What's the harm? It's a probe  What you know, that's actually harmful. Yeah, it is harmful. But I mean, honestly, it's not as harmful as it could be  What you want to do if you're if you're weaponizing hacking tools is test them  Yeah, figure out what capabilities you have that isn't the final result. Absolutely  But if you could take Amazon down if you could take not just Amazon  But all e-commerce down if you could take the internet down if you could take the grid down  You could do some serious harm on the other hand

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean it basically teaches your foes to figure out how to  Protect themselves against those kinds of that's true, too  and so, you know, this is this is why I think that the  Russian hacking is often ill-advised because they're essentially training you they're training everybody how to protect themselves against you know  Because when they really want to bring everything down  Everything will be patched fixed etc. So I'm not sure the worst deal on Prime Day according to CNET

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  $2,630 52 cents for a used paperback  Apparently some Amazon sellers took advantage of Prime Day to hike the prices

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, because if something ran out you might automatically grab it you might not pay attention

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, Andrew actually has done a lot of research into this because he's been looking at doing that sort of business model  So if you ever want to know more about this, we are we have long

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you want me to hook him up with my friend because he has a lot of anecdotal stories. Oh, yeah  about ways Amazon  Helps and hinders. I think it's why I got this book last night raw capitalism. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do believe that meditation in a group with people is more effective than being alone  Yes, what they are people, but I'm not sure that transmits over the internet via  IP does it it's not really a group is it no, I don't think I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's one that'll just piss Stacey off the case against teaching kids to be polite to echo

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's gonna here's another column. She's gonna want to edit of mine

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You didn't you didn't make me mad I just was like I feel like you're saying something, but I wasn't sure Mike

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, man, you really have the editors had on get this woman a blue pencil. I'm sorry Mike  You're talking about this one or the other one. No the other one this one about this one the case of against teaching kids to be polite  Alexa, I'm sorry echo when parents tell kids to respect AI said assistance  What kind of future are we preparing before I happen to have been saying this all along really? Yes, I think you both are silly

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I  Think it's important because we're already  Anthropomorphizing these guys right? Yes these assistance  I think it's very important because kids can't distinguish between them to have them learn how to be polite to them. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Think it's very important to teach the kids to distinguish between yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not arguing. I don't think it's a false argument to say that those are  Opposite sides of the thing opposite sides of the fence or argument  It's but especially when they're young. I do think it's important for them to have empathy for things everything even dogs cats  You know, how about the toaster?  Even the toaster. I mean like they should not  How often is a child a toddler got mad at something and slapped it and you're like no no

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the reason for that is that it's property that belongs to an actual person  It's not because there's anything about the toaster this can be offended. It's not handling that distinction until they get older when they get older

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We can have yeah, okay. You got a point Stacey  I kind of agree with you and at the same time though  We really do one of the things kids need to be taught because they're gonna enter a world where this is gonna be an issue  Is the distinction between humans and machines?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. That's been well understood up until now and also when when if your daughter is typing in Google Assistant  For example and just says what's the weather?  You're unless you're unlikely to say say please, you know  You you know this is but if she's if she says the exact same thing to a Google Home device  You might say oh you should you should say please. Thank you all that stuff because it has a human voice exactly  We're already waving the white flag basically by teaching our kids to to number one treat  virtual assistance with respect  Possibly deference and even to a certain extent obedience  For example Mattel was working on this project that was canceled because it was so offensive  Where it wouldn't it was like a virtual assistant. It was like an Amazon Echo for children  But it wouldn't do what the child asked unless the child said please in other words  We're teaching we they were they would teach kids  That it's appropriate for machines to to judge and scrutinize human behavior and to decide whether the human behavior was  Acceptable before it would do that's what we were teaching kids with the Mattel thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I think I canceled that and that was yes  The goal was to teach kids to not be little jerks  It was the same reason you have toys for children that say, you know that reward not  Whacking like the turtle toy that you know, if you beat up the turtle toy, it stops for a while  so I would argue that  Forcing a child to say please in order to make something happen for a mechanical object is not great  But teaching kids not to be jerks to things that were already anthropomorphizing is probably an okay thing, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the future of these devices have cameras. So will will we insist that the kids?  Say hello and they walk into the room  Do we want these devices to tell the kids to take their elbows off the table?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Where does it end I say depends on what you want them to be taught  Like if I want my child not to put their elbows on the table and enforcing that through a camera enabled device  Maybe and maybe it would be like oh your mom says not to put your elbows on the table. Yeah, no see

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Know what it's also like the escalator telling you how to go down the escalator

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sick. Here's here's what Mike points out in his article and I think it's really a good thing  Why do we have manners? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tell us Mike. Why do we have me we have manners because people?  Because we're guarding the feelings of people and we're showing respect for other people and I think that it's very important that we should  Tell kids that it's okay to talk to Alexa in the same way that they talk to a jar of peanut butter  In the same way that they talk to the refrigerator  Throw it across the room exactly just because it's simulant. So here's the here's the biggest point that I think I think I may get you  on this one, Stacy  We have to prepare kids for a future that includes being polite to other people  But we also have to prepare them for a future where everything is fake. They're gonna have virtual reality  They're gonna have they're gonna have real fake videos  They're gonna have fake Instagram celebrities. They already do actually  Yeah  And and so the kids have to be prepared to understand the difference between the things that simulate humanity and the things that are humans  That's gonna be harder and harder and so this is a teachable moment that Amazon Alexa is basically identical to a toaster  It's a thing. It's a property. It's not a person. It doesn't have feelings. You can't hurt its feelings  If you want to be polite, that's fine. If you want to be rude, that's fine. It doesn't matter. It's an appliance  That's the lesson we should be teaching kids

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, what this conversation in the story though is missing is the a perspective from someone who's aware of developmental stages in kids at a certain age  Kids cannot tell the difference between fantasy and real life up until about the age of five  So trying to teach them that lesson before then is useless  So making your kid or asking your kid to treat, you know  Your robot civilly and not whack it like a kid is supposed to do or a kid does is fine as  They get older  Having that in play. I think having those discussions in distinctions between real life and other things I think is important

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you're right. I think before five you're teaching them a habit

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  After five you're just teaching understanding. I agree. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you. Leo. That was a very succinct way of putting it  I think that's so yes, it just depends on your kid and how old they are

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And where they are in the Piaget stages of comprehension. I think that's reasonable  You're teaching them the habit of saying please and thank you before five. It's just a habit where they say it to mr  Moon or they say it to you. It's just a habit. This is one of those rare things that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There seems to be a sort of universal  Belief that kids should be polite to virtual assistants other than Leo pretty much  Everyone was saying that yeah, you should be polite. No, and I'm just trying to say wait a minute. Wait a minute  What are we what else are we teaching? That's it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This came about because some people saw that their kids like the two at their two and three year olds were like Alexa  Give me this. Yeah, and they were like, I don't want to trade that then they started treating their mom and dad like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not good. Oh, but they made it is given the distinction. The other thing is  Maybe children need somebody that they can bully  Maybe that's just something they know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a dark side

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Kids do have they have I mean like I'm sure we all had imaginary friends and some of us have imaginary I had  Yeah, I had twins one was the good twin and one was the bad twin and it was Cindy and dindie  And I can't remember who was which but like one I was free to treat like a total non-human  I think she ended her life being pushed out of an airplane  And the other was like you're good friend. So you needed that right? You needed you needed I had cakey and Della Rina and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And  And cakey I don't remember which was evil or not because I was too little but yeah, I think you need that there's a  dark and light side right and you need somebody that you can

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Express your anger to say now that's Google. Everybody just yells at Google. We just yell at Google. God. I love you guys

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, you really I I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's great to have you on the show today. Was it illegal once upon a time to drink while on the air in radio?  Yeah

Transcript:  He went the whole way got the license and all that you had to learn more as code all the stupid

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and our engineers in the studio have  There this is just to know we're illegal. Wow, this is John's Federal Communications Commission radio  Telephone third-class operator permit his restricted radio tell I've seen him operating radios  With the broadcast endorsement very important Wow, I I don't have mine I wish I had mine still  This is expired in 1982 John  I say we are not in compliance  No really was you were you oh wait a minute here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Big deal. No idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Anyway, you guys speaking of the FCC just for a little thing real quick is object pie seeing the light  I mean, he's he's got doubts about the Sinclair Tribune purchase

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Explained to him that he was he was just writing I'm writing a dead horse. No, he was

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He was sodomizing the dead horse whatever it was he should have done it  The horse was not happy. The horse was unhappy and the rest of us were just appalled  So really he's saying that I'm I think that that's blip service

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We shall well this summer saying it could put the it could put the deal off entirely  That's what amazed me because pie does all this Sinclair, which is a big local television

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Holding group is also famous for requiring its anchors  to spout  Trump propaganda and all sorts of things. They're trying to buy. What is it the Tribune papers? What are they trying to buy?  No, no, they're trying to be TV stations. Okay, and  and  They've adjusted their bid  So one of those would be the giant KTLA in Los Angeles  it's a three point nine billion dollar deal and  Wednesday Wednesday today Sinclair said that plan to back off part of its proposal  To satisfy rules that forbid a single company to own airwaves on such a dominant scale a good law  I think a good rule. Yeah, I think so too  Sinclair previously proposed selling off 23 of its TV stations after the deal was completed  But several of those stations was still effectively fall within its operational control on Monday  I jet-pie said he had serious concerns with those divestitures on Wednesday. The company said well, okay  We'll sell two of the stations one in Dallas one in Houston  Through an independent trust not enough not enough  Yeah, you really don't want a concentration of especially local media power in one or two hands  That's nice. We saw it happen in radio and it just killed radio. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's not video killed the radio star that sorry. I'm so sorry podcasts killed

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the video star  Venmo I like this story because I've been I've been complaining about this for years when you set up Venmo all of your transactions are public and  This is obvious but a Berlin based researcher analyzed more there are 200 million public Venmo transactions from 2017 one year and  You know with the API you could see the names of every user you could see everything they spent their money on  She said they you were she was able to learn an alarming amount about them  Now the key is that Venmo is public unless you set it private  So the reason I bring this up is just to remind everybody if you're using Venmo  Just there's a setting you have to go in and do it. I don't know why it's public by default  It's really you don't know why why what is your benefit? What is PayPal get it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  More information. I mean well they get the information

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why are they publishing it maybe they say look at all the people doing fun things with Venmo

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They can use that data. They probably can sell that data if you haven't made public they can do anyway, though  Well, I don't know I mean if you opt a lot of them say if you opt in we can do the following with your data  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But when you open Venmo the very first thing you get to is a Twitter like public feed of all the things people have spent

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Doing on you know, yeah, it's it's that gamification angle and I would say remember when Fitbit there was a while  Probably a couple years back maybe 2013 when everyone freaked out because their Fitbit trackers could tell when they were having sex

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, so this is what I want to know is why Eric paid Daniel for lip service and  That's all I'm just saying, you know a lot of people use emojis now  Kiana played Tammy for Ken's accident charge  apparently Jesus was at the club with Chris and  This has helped pave the bottle service  Weston paid Elizabeth I'm on that sugar daddy type stuff. He says

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a whole there was  fun  just fun  Transactions people tag these it is fun to read it is fun to read I like reading it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But maybe you want to consider the sugar daddy stuff should be private

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not really what they're buying it for they're just I mean some people yeah, you're right they play with it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I did that. I do that too. I make up stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because it wasn't there a while back there was like the story about people's  Venmo accounts getting shut off because they would be like this is for the anthrax and  We're tracking terrorism in banking transactions kept shutting them down

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So according to courts hackers account for 90% of login attempts at online retailers  Well, I don't need to say more that's it that's the story

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Percentage of successful

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Okay, actually, I don't know if it was an iPhone  It might have been oh, you know, she basically she gets whatever I'm not using  This is my pick of the week and it's kind of an oddball pick this comes from a Stanford research study  It's called almond and you can download the app on  Android you can run it out of the website. It's a virtual assistant that knows odd things like get a cat gif  It'll do that. There's actually a whole list of commands  You could tweet the latest NASA astronomy of the day picture  You can auto reply to my emails you can do some if this than that stuff like when a file changed on my Dropbox  Email it to me or when I've used more space in the Dropbox. Let me know  Holidays I cal events. They're trying to I think the Stanford group. Oh, by the way, and one of the things I really liked  It works with LG web. Oh s TVs, which includes my TV at home  So I can use almond to turn the TV on to mute it to undo  But what's interesting this is an academic  Project using thing a pedia. It's an open virtual  Assistant and crowd sourced because thingpedia is crowd sourced  so  for instance  When the Bitcoin price reaches $20,000 search for a Bitcoin picture and tweet it with the caption. I am rich  Huh?  Now how much would you pay?  Isn't that cool  You'll find it at almond dot Stanford dot edu  It's a creation of the computer science department at Stanford and they're obviously very smart  People trying to do some interesting things with natural language. It's nuts. Yeah  Thingpedia itself is part of their they call it the Moby Social computing laboratory at Stanford University. Hmm. Oh  Who is it? Which one of you guys is the one that's doing the research?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Who is it? Which one of you guys I think it was Jeff  Doesn't believe in gamification on social social media or sorry psychological manipulation on social media. Yeah, was that you Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought I in what way I don't know that I or that it was an issue

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe it wasn't okay. I'm in favor  You're in favor of manipulation on social me. No, I just someone someone was arguing that it wasn't a big deal really  On one of our shows

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it wasn't Jeff. Okay, never mind. I don't know who would not sound familiar. God knows what I say

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  On the show  Ladies and gentlemen, I think everybody has a pick everybody has said their say  This was a really fun show not the least of which because we enjoy to find Pino bottles not  Shows not over to the bottom space line and you can have some more if you'd like I'll let you pour  Okay  Just get all over the place.

Yeah, most recent that will sound great. It'll sound great  And you know, it's I've always said if podcasts were as easy to listen to as radio  We'd have a shot and I think they are now.
