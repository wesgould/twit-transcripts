Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I missed you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Were you gone again last week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, Leo.  You and I were the only ones working hard.  You know, the two of them just take off.  I see y'all missed me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess I really missed you too.  Anyway, welcome back.  I want to know that I was here.  I was working.  Jeff Jarvis is here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Just disappear.  And he's still here.  Well, don't feel like it today.  We try to get rid of him every week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We can't.  You don't. You can't.  No. He is officially the Leining Tower Professor for Journalistic Innovation at the Craig Newmark  Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.  Hello Jeff.  Hello.  And Pruitt is also here.  I know you had the week off.  Yeah, I was in here last week.  Was it your birthday?  No, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just for fun?  It was just for fun.  I'll just put that in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, that's right.  You lied and said it was his birthday.  And we all believed it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It was not my birthday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anytime anybody takes vacation here at Twitter, I say it's their birthday.  I guess.  It sure wasn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Next week is my birthday.  Yeah, see?  So should I take next week off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Take next week off because actually I think you are anyway.  I think that was the plan, wasn't it?  Yeah, that sounds right.  Because I think Kevin Marx is coming in next week.  No, I'm out next week.  Oh, you're out next week.  Okay, that's right.  Kevin Marx is coming in next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was going to attempt to see a track meet with the hardheads and a little weirdo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kevin is unhappy about the edit button and he'll explain why next week.  Well, I can do a little bit of that this week.  He's also going to be on Tech News Weekly tomorrow to explain that.  But before we get into that, I want to just congratulate you for listening to this show  because did you know, according to The Guardian, podcast listeners are likely to be more curious  and less neurotic?  This is research, folks.  What about hosts?  Hosts, yeah.  No, we're the opposite.  We're neurotic so they don't have to be.  This is from a study at the Queensland University of Technology, I guess in Australia, survey  of 306 people from more than 10 countries on their podcast listening habits.  Of podcast listeners, those who scored more highly on the trait of agreeableness were  more likely to form parasocial relationships with their favorite podcast hosts.  I think that happens right now.  Parasocial relationships associated with listening for longer and listening to podcasts by known  hosts.  The more you listen, the more you socially engage and feel like the favorite host is  a friend.  Also, I should point out, podcast listeners less likely to score highly for neuroticism,  the tendency to experience negative emotions.  And oddly enough, that's quite different from social media use.  There's a positive association between neuroticism and social media.  Of course, negative emotions.  That's what social media is all about.  Of podcast listeners, though, much less neuroticism, much more perceived intimacy, finding that  people felt more empathetic and persuadable when hearing podcasts through headphones  or through speakers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's why our podcast listeners are our dupes themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they're not dupes.  They're more curious.  Stop it.  And more open podcast listeners, people, people who listen to podcasts.  This is the headline.  Our life and have to have one curious, more open to experience and less neurotic on average.  Thank you very much.  Congratulations, because you're listening.  Maybe you didn't know that to a podcast right now.  So you, yes, you used to be a netcast.  Yeah, that's why I changed the name so that you could be less, you could be more agreeable,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  less neurotic.  I wonder if there's a conversion of the folks that are super, super active on social media,  and then you get them into listening to podcasts.  And they do less social media.  Well, they do less social media.  I hope so.  They become less neurotic.  I wonder if there's a study in place for that.  You have people you hear.  I don't, I can't listen to podcasts.  I don't get it.  They rather watch Netflix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They can only handle 140 ideas at a time.  140 words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would rather watch Netflix than listen to a podcast.  Really?  What's on Netflix?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, nowadays on Netflix, it's mostly shows about podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oddly enough, or hustle culture or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was about to say, no, I've got, I've got Bridgerton.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  That didn't come from a podcast.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Shadow and Bone.  I had Dave Weiner in our class this week.  Sorry.  Oh, nice.  Yeah.  So Dave was speaking to our class this week.  We had him go through the history of podcasts.  And of course it started with Adam Curry.  Thank you, Adam Curry.  MTV star.  And Adam was talking a lot about it.  Well, star's a big word for that.  Radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everybody didn't have MTV.  He's a VJ.  He looked like a star.  He did, though.  He had that long hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So Dave said he almost missed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He was a VJ.  He had that long hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He said he almost missed it.  He wasn't listening enough to Adam.  Adam said, I want radio on.  And Dave was saying, you know, you can't get sound.  The Internet's too slow.  No, it's not going to work.  And then he thought about it and thought about it and thought, oh no, I get it.  You can download it and then you can listen when you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh.  Yeah.  Adam was encouraging Dave, who was one of the authors of RSS, to add one little feature  the ability to include a binary file in the RSS feed.  So instead of normally what it is is the text from your blog.  But in addition, one little thing that said, oh, and there is this binary blob associated  with the RSS feed.  That blob is this show.  Congratulations.  So yeah, thanks to Dave Weiner.  We have that.  And Adam Curry, who is often called the pod father for this.  Adam wrote a very early podcasting client that read RSS feeds and downloaded the audio,  which was superseded because it was just a kind of experimental lab effort.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Dave also said it took time.  Interestingly, he said what he wanted more than anything else was users because people  weren't doing it.  They thought, oh, Adam Curry, he's a VJ.  He knows others professionally.  And a few things that were out there were like that.  And so Steve Gilmore was kind of podcasting in a sense before then.  And then he said that Dave said he just went on and just kind of turned on a mic and just  started talking and wanted people to realize anybody can do this.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, how does he feel now?  Did he ask about today's standard?  Because everybody's still on podcasts now.  As long as you have a following.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, the students did.  He didn't.  He's I think that he says that I don't want to quote Dave here.  I'm sorry, Dave, if you're watching.  We'd love to have you on so we can quote you directly.  But just to answer your question, I think that that he cares about the structure of  it.  You can listen anywhere.  And that's why Spotify and Rogan, in his view, clearly is not podcasting at all.  Good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nor is YouTube.  But they're they're complimentary.  I don't think it may not be podcasting.  But it's the idea to me.  And this is why I never never liked the word podcast.  The idea really is just its content over the Internet.  Audio, video, text doesn't really matter.  It's Internet distributed content.  And it is important that anybody can do it.  You know, shortly after that happened, that happened in, I think, September of 2004.  In October of 2004, I put my radio show on an RSS feed as a podcast.  And I think Dave's right is that because it was it would tend to be, you know, professionals  initially who had the gear and the, you know, the content to put out.  Although, you know, I have to say, Adam's show was he sounds professional, but it wasn't  a radio show.  It was the daily source code.  It was just, you know, him talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He said one of the first people to do it was Chris Lydon, who was at WGBH in Boston, who  really who always sounds like he's NPR, even if you're just sitting with him in the conference.  Yeah, NPR.  Yeah.  So that kind of intimidates people.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think Chris actually was one of the very, even before maybe RSS, he was doing  that and there was IT conversations.  There were, yeah, the early days.  But it didn't take long before.  Well, it did.  It took a decade, truthfully, before people really caught on to it because it was hard.  And that's why it was called a podcast.  You had to have an iPod and a program to download it and then put it on your iPod for it to  be a podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it preceded the iPod, right?  I mean, podcasting preceded the iPod.  I think the name.  No, it did not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hold on here.  iPod came out in 2001.  Podcast in 2004.  It was one.  Oh, okay.  All right.  So it did not.  And that's why it was called a podcast.  And you'll see some people doing kind of a retroactive play on demand is what POD stands  for.  That's not what it stood for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It stood for putting it on your iPod.  It stood for that iPod device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know I was there.  But yeah, yeah, yeah, good.  I'm glad you had him in.  I think that's a really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was he was really, really enthralled the students because this is a guy who's built  so much.  This is a class Doug Rushkoff and I are doing in redesigning the Internet.  Oh, neat.  And trying to get the students to understand that they have the agency and responsibility  to do so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  We have just so you know, we invite Dave on pretty much weekly.  And I've known Dave since the very beginning.  Dave said he'll do anything for you.  Yeah, he's a great guy.  So the big story of the week, though, is none of that.  None of the above.  Tick tock.  Turns out, no, there's no tick tock.  Starting in January, Elon Musk quietly started buying up shares of Twitter and it finally  became public last week that he had bought nine point two percent of Twitter outstanding  Twitter shares, becoming the biggest stakeholder in Twitter by far.  Jack Dorsey, who just left as Twitter CEO, only has two point something percent.  So two point nine billion dollars later, Elon Musk has 73 million shares.  This is a filing that was made March 14th.  Since Elon has updated the filing, which is kind of interesting, maybe I don't know, maybe  he thought maybe it was a little sloppy.  I don't know.  He's reclassified himself in the filing as an active investor.  And I, you know, of course, shortly after this, the CEO of Twitter, Agrawal, announced  that Elon was going to have a board seat.  He took a seat on the board.  Now I think there's a reason why when you're on the board, you can only buy up to four  point five percent.  They prohibit you from becoming an owner.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, he's limited to 14.9 percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  Did I say five?  Yeah.  Fifteen.  He already has nine percent, limited to 14 and a half percent.  So because I think this is a bear hug.  I think that what this really was, was we don't want him.  We think he might be actually angling to buy Twitter.  He has the money easily.  Oh, yeah.  Hundreds of billions.  So and by the way, he's already made money.  Twitter's stock price went up 27 percent after he did this.  If he were just interested.  And by the way, that's how Elon Musk used Twitter.  To pump stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pump it up and dump it.  If he were interested in just making money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, he could have dumped it, but he didn't.  And I honestly think this is on the whole on the heels of Elon's saying, well, I think  Twitter, you know, free speech.  Should we make a new Twitter?  Because there's not enough free speech on Twitter, which is ironic because no one's  healed him.  But I guess maybe he's thinking of the former president.  I don't know.  Then on Monday, he put up a poll that said, do you want an edit button?  Although it was tongue in cheek, because as you might notice, the poll misspelled yes  and no.  So in a way, it's like, see, if we had an edit button, I could have fixed this.  But look at that 73.6 percent.  Yes.  Four million votes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This followed Twitter having said on April Fool's Day that they were working on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, in fact, they said, no, it wasn't an April Fool's.  We've been working on it for a year and we're going to do it.  So this is a big week for Twitter news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can you go over the timetable again?  Was the board seat offered?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was after he bought after he announced he bought.  So what did somebody say yesterday?  Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.  Giving him a board seat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This dude should not get any.  This pisses me off so much.  I'm like, this is just a person who behaves badly, who behaves unethically.  People venerate him.  It drives me absolutely up the wall.  Just from a standpoint of what does he really have to offer?  Do you want someone on your board who is going to possibly taint your brand and do  things that are illegal?  I like Twitter. I wish they didn't bow and kowtow to the sort of play  acting and bad behavior disguised as I'm just kidding.  Like, ah, ah, how soon do you think we'll see some SEC investigation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm sorry, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know what. What did you ask?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was saying, how soon do you see an investigation happening from like the SEC  or someone, because it just seems weirdly time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm sure the SEC is going to do something.  Elon is doing a great job showing how little teeth the SEC actually have.  Or maybe it's just their willingness to go against him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I don't think there's any law he's broken at this point.  You don't think so?  No, prep is just is just on Twitter.  You're allowed to buy shares in a company you like.  Yes. Warren Buffett eats a, you know, at McDonald's every morning, has an egg  McMuffin. He is also a major shareholder.  Not illegal. Right. I like McMuffins.  I think I'll buy some stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that's that's his M.O.  But from a ownership perspective and when some of this was reported,  I believe there are questions about that.  Oh, really? That's the securities issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, and he'll dash agrees with you.  He said when he saw the tweet from Prague Agrawal saying that  Mr. Musk is on the board, he said, yeah, that's bad.  Wish they would have taken any of the many other suggestions of active users  who could have been added to the board over the years,  including those who are developers or experienced creators of healthy communities.  Anil, who's great, has a point, which is Twitter has had a very checkered  history of developers, mostly negative.  And yet it's the developers and users who have pushed the platform along.  If it weren't for Chris and his hashtag.  Oh, right. Chris, what's his?  I can't remember his last name now.  Who invented the hash. Sorry.  Messina, Messina, right?  Chris, Chris Messina, who invented the hashtag.  It was users who created the ad reply.  That was an ad hoc solution that Twitter eventually incorporated.  Twitter would be very different platform.  So I think Anil's is absolutely right.  But money talks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I think I think Stacey's really, really right here, too, is that it is.  I think I think Twitter was kind of stuck in a bind.  And it's a bear hug. And that's all true.  But it doesn't look good for the company because they do this.  And they're going to allow someone to bully them.  Into I.  But my fear about this is that is that it's this fake free speech  cancellation talk where they're going to be compelled to carry noxious speech.  And and that's going to create an environment.  You think the problems on social media now.  Imagine if they were forced by a billionaire or by right wing government,  either one, both of which are talking about this, of saying you must carry hate

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  speech, you must carry. According to Mike Isaac at the New York Times,  Twitter was already discussing having Musk be a more active participant,  according to two people with knowledge of the conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I believe that. But why do you believe that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, because he has 80 million followers and tweets several times,  several dozen times a day.  That's not the real Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, the real Twitter really uses their platform to break the law.  And he also seems to embody what is most noxious about the platform  and the terms and the way he uses it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Casey Newton calls calls Elon Musk a mischievous trickster god.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A low key. I mean, in a way, he is puckish, puckish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, in fact, Casey says, I likened it to Loki buying an ant farm.  That's exactly what it is.  Yeah. So it's, you know, so this is interesting because Casey Newton  on his platformer newsletter talks about the timeline, which actually,  if you need this timeline to take it all in the context.  So you remember that Elliott Management, which was an activist investor group,  took a four percent stake in Twitter two years ago.  And at that time, they were very unhappy with her with how Twitter was doing.  And they wanted Jack Dorsey out  because the stock price was stagnant.  User growth was stagnant.  Elliott, the activist investors, left the board a year later,  according to Newton, apparently satisfied with Twitter's progress.  But as a condition of leaving, set aggressive goals for the company,  grow the user base by 100 million people, accelerate revenue growth,  gain market share as a digital advertiser,  none of which Jack Dorsey was able to do.  Casey thinks and I think this widely agreed that that's why Dorsey left  is that he could not make the changes Elliott wanted.  And of course, he put a Twitter's CTO in charge,  Parag Agrawal.  And Agrawal has done nothing to, by the way, hit those marks either.  In fact, it lost money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But he's only been how long has he been there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, more than a quarter, a couple of quarters.  He's lost money in the last quarter and added six million new users  during his tenure, not 100.  So that's Casey saying Twitter remains vulnerable  to activist investors who might work to force out Agrawal.  Or once again, we get into this attention economy and what

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  what do you want to build?  So if Twitter wants 100 million users, the easiest and fastest way to do that  is to engage people with trollish behavior, right?  Is to piss people off.  It's kind of the Facebook playbook.  So is Twitter saying with this, they're planning on going down that playbook  because growth at all costs matters.  That's what it looks like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, again, quoting Casey,  Musk's presence on the board will help them fight off activist investors,  because now he has such a big stake and he's on the board.  You know, he can if single handedly say to the shareholders,  I will beat Elliott's offer or anybody else's offer.  So his status is both the platform's largest shareholder  and most influential board level member will likely give him soft power  that exceeds his technical authority.  It did help the stock price up 27 percent.  So shareholders will like that.  And by the way, it's continuing to go up.  It hasn't. It wasn't just a bump.  It's continuing to go up.  They Casey thinks that he might be right that Musk is a supporter  of the decentralized platform that Dorsey was talking about before he left.  And Agrawal still wants to do kind of the Fediverse.  That is what makes me.  Oh, that would be interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If the blue sky happens.  Yeah.  Then that makes me very happy.  And that would be one way to answer that criticism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, censorship as well.  Just as on Mastodon, anybody can.  Beach is is a body layer.  Yeah. So in fact, Gab is on Mastodon.  Truth Social is running on Mastodon.  It's not part of the Fediverse, but it's running on the Mastodon software.  So the most important thing, though, is that Musk's really kind of  first official act as a board member was to put that edit poll button up.  And and and and Agrawal is a supporter of the Fediverse.  Agrawal said, OK, we got an edit button.  So the edit button will roll out, I think, over the next few days.  But there's been some complaints about that, too.  In fact, my wife asked me, well, I know you're going to play devil's advocate on  Twig today. So what's your real opinion on the edit?  It comes.  And I'm going to wait and hear what you all say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm Twitter's going to start.  Twitter has always pointed out that the edit button makes it hard for people.  You can go back in and change what you said, which is anathema to kind of what the  platform was designed to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Lisa said Facebook's got an edit button.  My blog has an edit button. Why shouldn't Twitter have an edit button?  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sort of half and half on this.  I like the premise of it not being editable because of context and things of  that nature. But at the same time, I use Twitter Blue and I enjoy it.  I enjoy that aspect of, oh crap, I have a typo in there.  Let me fix that real quick and then hit send.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Well, and that's not really a...  Lisa has that too and I do too.  Yeah, it's just a wait. Look at it again.  You got 30 seconds.  Yeah. But that's good.  I think to me that's a good solution.  I dig that.  Agrawal said that the Twitter Blue folks will get the first shot at the edit  button. So keep an eye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Am I the only person still using Twitter Blue?  I still like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I still use it.  We're all Twitter Blue members.  We're all Twitter Blue subscribers.  We're all blue.  What about you, Jeff?  Edit button, pro or con?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So a few thoughts.  One is I think that an edit button with no record of it is a mistake because it's  another tool for disinformation.  But an edit button that shows you clearly what has been changed, I think, has real  benefit. It could say I made a mistake.  You can say I'm stupid.  I made a typo.  But here I am. I recognize that.  I think that would actually improve the ethic.  How would you show that?  Same way you would...  Same way you do it inside.  Same on Word.  You can do a cross out or you can do a different color for adding in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So maybe I would argue that that's kind of what Twitter has right now.  You just do another tweet saying, sorry, typo, and you do another tweet.  Yeah, but it has to be in your real tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You have to change your real tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In context.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So let me keep going.  Now, I wonder if you could do an alt text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you could do a cross out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Would that work, Jeff?  Yeah, I think it would.  I think there's a few options here.  So another thing that I...  A product guy at Twitter came on today and said, give me suggestions.  So I wrote like four tweets suggesting things.  I think another way to look at this is as an update, not an edit, that I could  attach something to a tweet and say, oops, I made a mistake or here's a fix or whatever.  The problem I think that they're facing here is the architecture of it, that RSS.  The tweets go out and they're out of the control of Twitter.  They're on somebody else's reader.  Now, Twitter got rid of a lot of that, but it still hasn't...  I think that essential RSS architecture, not calling RSS, not exactly, where it's  out there, and especially if you go to Blue Sky, things are in a federated world where  they're stored in a hundred places.  Are you going to have to update it in a hundred places?  That becomes a technical challenge, I think, which is really interesting to consider.  So there's one is there's the transparency and truthfulness challenge of not being used  for misinformation and trying to fool us into thinking somebody said this, but they  didn't say. I think that's critical.  But the second, that is the technical challenge of how would you implement this?  And I don't think it's as easy as people think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like the edit tag showing up on there, just as if I were looking at Slack and someone  typed something to me that they had a typo and they go in and fix the typo and it shows  edit right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I get it.  The thing Twitter would tell you is that it's not designed to do that.  It's exactly as you said, Jeff.  Once a tweet goes out, Twitter in effect loses control of it.  So any edit is going to be imperfect because we can't fix what's already happened.  So even an update would have to go back, get that tweet and amend it.  And that's just not the architecture at all.  I think there's also the sociological issue, which is what is Twitter?  It's not Facebook. It's not a blog.  It's real time.  And so when you say something, you say it and it's out there and it's done.  And it's not editable because it's in effect live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, so you said it's not a blog, yet there are many people that try to use it.  Well, maybe they're misusing it.  Micro blog with that whole threading feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. I think the real issue is kind of comes down to how you think of Twitter.  And I think because, for instance, politicians use it, which makes it a matter of record.  You can't have that's really a big problem with this editing the past.  The official account.  It's an official account, whether you like it or not.  Companies do, actually. Yeah.  It's become an official account.  So I am dead set against it.  I think it's a huge mistake.  It's not what Twitter is all about.  And if you want that, put it on Facebook, put it on LinkedIn, put it somewhere  where you can edit. But Twitter is it's about being live in real time.  Now, Kevin Marks, and we're going to have him on next week,  and he'll also be on TNW tomorrow.  So I'll let him speak for himself.  But on his Kevin Marks dot com blog, he raises another very interesting issue.  Over time, Twitter has changed the way you embed a tweet on your blog.  In the past, people would copy and paste or they would take a picture,  a screenshot of it and put it on their blog.  Twitter doesn't want you to do that.  In fact, probably says somewhere deep in the terms of service,  you're not supposed to do that.  What they want you to do is embed, in effect, a JavaScript linked back to Twitter  so that that and in a way, it's a good thing to do because it authenticates it.  It says, no, no, here's the tweet.  You can see it's the same. I haven't modified it.  But but Kevin says, with all the fuss about Twitter's promised edit button  and how they might design it, we're missing a disturbing development.  Twitter is using its embedded JavaScript to edit other people's sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So this is different from an edit button.  This is a whole separate problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but an edit button would, in effect, require it.  That's how it's implemented. But it could. Yes. Because otherwise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, if it implemented, so it didn't tell you that it's been edited,  that would be a problem on your site if you did it to prove something. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And if people are using copy and paste or screenshots, edit all you want.  It's it's not going to change on those websites.  So Twitter's strongly encouraging you not to do that, to use the JavaScript,  which would be kind of a requisite of having an edit button.  You can't edit it unless you can get Yank Bank all of the  versions of that tweet that exist out in the universe,  fix them and put them back out there.  And that's the only way you can do this is with an embed, not with a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Does a tweet have a URI? It does.  So in that case, I could imagine implementation where to go to Ant's point  about the the you know, hey, this was something was changed here.  But there's an update to this sense.  If you could attach that, then you'd have to require clients to show that.  But for a given URI, there is an added piece of data that says,  you know, a bit that says on off.  This has been updated or not. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there's a long article on Kevin's blog, which I recommend.  And this is this is I'm going to show you the screenshot from his blog,  an example of why this is a bad thing.  These are tweets from Donald Trump. If you show my screen.  These are tweets the war on.  So this is an article from Vox about  the the war on James Comey quoting tweets from Donald Trump,  except that that's a blank box because those tweets are gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It used to come with plain text above the embed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is what the embed looks like now from Kevin's.  You get a block quote.  You do get this text, but then you also get the href.  And then the JavaScript renders it.  There's the JavaScript there that renders it.  So the href is that link, as you said, to the canonical actual tweet.  That's important, too, by the way.  If you don't have that link, then there's no one to verify  no way to verify on the Twitter site that what you're saying is true.  Yeah, true. If you use the embed, though, you get these embeds like this,  which are pretty and most sites use them now. Yeah.  But but it has the negatives, you can see, of disappearing  once that tweet is disappeared.  And by the way, it doesn't just have to be Twitter,  you know, banning somebody.  It could be just Donald Trump taking those down, which he did, in fact.  So now, by the way, this is the cited text.  This is how that article could look, which is the original tweet content.  So I think if you're going to consider Twitter,  Twitter, an important part of the public record, that's another reason

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  not to allow editing because it's your real opinion or your.  This is what I told Lisa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I said, OK, I was maybe a little salty.  We confirm that, please.  I was a little saltier.  I don't want Leo and his opinions.  I said, edit, edit tweets is a terrible idea.  I understand why users want it because there's a typo or I said,  it's typos. I feel like an idiot. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You look like an idiot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why I would want this because of the typos. But I get it.  I'm thinking about people that are harassed and they need that record  to show saying, hey, I was harassed by this person on Twitter.  And if they go to delete it, that's well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Interesting, because who would like that best?  The harasser, right?  Well, would you say Elon Musk might be somebody who would benefit  from editable tweets?  Hmm. All right.  And what is the SEC is investigating those tweets?  And there's no record of those tweets, right?  The the effect has already been felt.  He says, you know, I'm going to I'm all in on Dogecoin.  Dogecoin goes up. He sells his Dogecoin.  And then they go to the tweet. It's the tweet.  Yeah, it's gone.  I think Twitter should be a permanent record.  It's it's a it's a live just like our live stream is a permanent record.  It's live. Now we edit.  Actually, we had it.  I'll give you a little inside baseball because we had an issue last week  where one of our hosts said, can you cut that part of the show out?  Because I said something  I wish I hadn't said.  And without asking me, our editors, because they respect him, took it out.  And I hit the ceiling and I sent them a number of links.  Jeff, back me up on this.  And you to Stacey, you're both, you know,  trained journalists. We've said no, you're trained journalists.  Journalists.  I said once it's part of the public record, you can't just amend it. Right.  At the very least, you have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can't you can amend it. You just can't erase it. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you at the bottom, you have to say correction, right?  Something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I will say so with blogging, it's changed a little bit.  And even like venerable publications such as Fortune,  if you do like what is an accepted typo, you know, like so  not a misspelling of someone's name, but if you put like.  I don't know, you just like no, instead of wrong.  Yeah. Or yeah, those kind of things you can correct without.  Like we would correct typos without making a fuss over it.  But we never like if that type of wasn't someone's name,  type was a little different context.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what I did is I sent  I sent the staff this from the University of Southern California, Annenberg School,  their online journalism review, an article rewriting history.  Should editors delete or alter online content?  And I think it's kind of a very good example of what happens  and why it shouldn't happen and how it should be handled appropriately.  It's a very good long piece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So do you do you think the right to be forgotten is is wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, so so that's an interesting question.  Yeah, I mean, it's wrong.  I'll tell you why I think it's wrong, which has nothing to do with this,  is it doesn't go to the source.  It doesn't go to the original article that you're trying to get rid of.  It goes to Google.  Why is it Google's responsibility?  They're just the search engine.  It should be the if you don't like what somebody said about you in the past  and or you want to bury it, you've got to go to the source.  You don't go to the search engine.  So that's what's wrong with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm curious to hear what Stacey's Pickery says about this, but all of you.  There was a discussion on Twitter recently with journalism ethics people,  believe it or not, they exist and about the idea of basically  doing right to be forgotten with newspapers.  As someone comes and says, listen, I was arrested 30 years ago for something.  It comes up in search.  I want to go to the source.  I want to go to the newspaper and I want this taken down.  What's your and I've lived a perfect life since then.  I made a stupid mistake 30 years ago.  No. What do you say?  What do you say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No. OK, so I actually think this is actually one of the things  that I think is really important.  And I would love to see legislation actually on this, which is under a certain age,  maybe 18, maybe 21.  I think you should be able to do it.  And I say that because I feel like that's enshrined in.  Hold up. I know, but it's but it's not on social media.  It's not the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if I was among law and the law, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. So I think that's OK.  But 30 years ago, if you ran over someone's cat and someone wrote a story about it  and you now want to work for the SPCA and their your name comes up as a cat killer.  I'm sorry, but very elaborate there, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was like, I was quite a yard.  You just told I didn't want to do it.  I didn't want to be like, you know, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was just trying to think of a crime that wasn't I mean, it was bad.  But it's why you have a dog, not a cat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Stacey, you were a bit.  Well, you know, you can confess to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, there's no history of cat murdering.  I just I don't want to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree that. Sorry, sorry.  This is minors is something completely separate.  But minors is something completely separate.  Yes, of course. But what if you and by the way,  the law does have also provisions for expunging your record even as an adult.  But not the newspaper. That's the law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But not a newspaper law can't tell a newspaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And there is there is a category right now about mugshots.  So if you get arrested and have a mugshot, those can be published online  and follow you forever, even if you're not convicted of crime.  So then the burden becomes on you to explain what happened.  And there are people who are like, is that really fair?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I honestly think the public records, the public record.  But I I think they're also extenuating circumstances.  And there's history.  Maybe there should be a statute of limitations on social media posts.  Honestly, every social media network lets you delete stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And some people go through and delete all of their tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just as as a matter of hygiene, I do that.  I deleted everything, you know, except for the last two years or something,  just a matter of hygiene, not because the problem is that looks like a guilty action.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So in journalism, your lawyers will tell you, like for notes, for example,  whatever note taking strategy you have, actually, they're like, if you  you have to have a strategy and stick with it so you don't write, you're guilty.  So my strategy is to keep my notes for two years and then dump all of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. OK. And you have to be consistent that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Yes. And so that I mean, if you're consistent, yeah.  With your tweet deletions, then you're fine.  Here's from the suddenly wake up one day and here's what I also sent our staff

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  from the Globe and Mail, which is the big Toronto newspaper.  The Globe and Mail generally does not unpublish content  or remove details such as names from our websites and archives  other than for legal reasons.  But it does correct and update articles as necessary  if there's a significant factual error.  And there is, though, and interestingly, there's an appeal process  and you have to make it in writing to the public editor.  And then a committee of editors and lawyers will review the request.  And they'll be response.  I think it's probably a good idea to have some sort of appeal  process, you know, because there are there are cases where you shouldn't.  You know, there's there's stuff you did when you're 20.  Maybe you were a legal adult.  But you're you know, you're 65 now and that cat would deserve to be killed.  And what?  No, just being oddly specific once again.  Here, I'll give you an example of something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We actually on on my blog,  we unpublished a story for the holiday weekend not too long ago.  That was Presidents Day weekend, I believe.  And we had published something.  It went up on the site.  And then I got in a frantic email from the CFO of the company.  I was like, Stacey published this is so wrong.  You could burn someone's house down.  So it became a safety issue.  And I was like, OK, well, I can't I can't just.  Yeah, I can't delete the story because we don't unpublish stuff, right?  He's like, I was like, so I need to fix it, but I need to know how to fix it.  So and he's like, I'm getting on a plane and I can't.  And so what happened was for there, I actually unpublished the story  for like a day while he got back to me with and I hated doing it.  But I was also like, you don't want to I don't want to burn anyone's house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you don't want to cause house fires either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And it's fully in your in your power to do so. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. But it was I mean, it's it's an off use case.  And, you know, we we basically rewrote the entire story  and then had to append an update that was like, hey, we screwed this up.  Blah, blah, blah.  And it's horrifying when those things happen because you're like, oh, I screwed up.  But at the same time, you. Yeah.  Got it.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, Patrick Delahanty, who was our engineer here  and our coder and knows these things, says you can delete it.  But all you're deleting is this is in the discord.  All you're deleting is the public record.  Twitter can still see deleted tweets.  So if the law enforcement wants to see them, they're still available.  I do think the fact that Twitter allows deletion is that's a form of editing.  I mean, that's just deleted.  So, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But they also tell you that like you'll see that the response to this has been deleted.  So they tell you that something has been deleted. You can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not so not a full tweet.  So if I just do a tweet.  There's no one response to it. Sure. Yeah.  But oh, yeah, if there's a response, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, to say this has been deleted by you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's probably why Twitter keeps a copy of it.  Come to think of it. Yeah, you're right. That's right.  But if there are no responses and I delete something,  if a tree falls in the forest and there's no one there to hear it.  It doesn't. It's gone effectively, except for Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, except for the.  And I just want everybody to know that I have never murdered any cats ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dogs. Me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have never murdered any cats.  I did once run over a turtle while driving to Austin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you for burying your soul on our show for that.  That's good. Yeah.  So if you. Yeah.  So now, actually, now that people are mentioning this thing,  uh, if you allow deletions, why wouldn't you allow editing?  Well, because I think you shouldn't allow deletions.  Come to think of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't the theory of Twitter is this is a live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, you have to allow deletions, like,  because if I can't credibly edit something,  like if I put that tweet, like my my burn your house down story,  I had done that at a tweet.  I can't edit it in the tweet.  And so what if someone retweeted the inaccurate information?  That's why you have deletions. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And OK, it's interesting question.  Still an edit.  So it really is. Is Twitter.  Kind of a special kind of social media.  And I've always thought of it as kind of a real time social media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But but OK, let's look at Facebook.  Facebook is still pretty daggum big and active all day long.  Yet they have these edit functions and people put all kinds of outlandish  information on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the reason is that your Facebook post lives only on Facebook.  Right. Yes, it's a lot easier.  Really? There's no third party clients.  There's no Facebook doesn't allow you to like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So they don't have you have to go back to Facebook.  Oh, I didn't put a link to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Didn't know that. OK.  I don't use Facebook either, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't either. But I think that's the right.  So that's the and that makes sense, because that means  there's no cost to it.  There's no. Yeah, there's no cost.  They you know, they change it and change it.  And that's changed forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's an interesting thing.  Kevin's problems raised to here, which is that if these things are going to disappear,  I saw journalists say, well, what's going to happen is newspapers  are going to stop embedding tweets and instead they're going to do screen.  Grab. Yeah.  Screen grabs. Right.  And and that's an ethical problem people have because it doesn't include the link back.  You can't see the original.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you could make it a link.  You can make a screen grab plus a link.  Right. That's easy.  There's no. But that's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You'd have to go to a lot of effort to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no more effort.  A lot of effort.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is. Journalists are notoriously in a hurry and lazy.  I'll give you that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I have to.  I was just looking to see how far back my Twitter stream goes.  I did delete the first six years, but it started.  But 2012 is here.  So I guess I better get I didn't.  I'm not consistent.  That's my oldest tweet.  Now I kind of regret deleting my first tweet.  Yeah. What was your first tweet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's in the Library of Congress.  That's the other thing.  Oh, yeah. That's another thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It lives forever, doesn't it?  As in the public record.  Internet Archive.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We I wrote about this in public for as long ago as what we have to do  as a society is learn to be more forgiving of stupid mistakes.  We're not there yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  Again, I still think about like the harassment side of things,  and especially when it comes to  teenagers or whatever that are using social media  and they get some harassing message from another teenager  and they go to report it and other teenagers like, well, this doesn't exist.  I deleted it.  But yet I have a screenshot of it.  It's there's got to be a line somewhere where we can keep this stuff  and keep people safe, too.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Indeed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now I want to delete all my old tweets.  Oh, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I thought you wanted to keep them like 20 seconds ago.  You said you wanted to keep them.  That's until I read them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then, oh, geez, how do you go about how do you go about mass

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  deleting tweets? That's that's such a script.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have to it's a script because there's no built in tool to do it.  Oh, OK. So in effect, it has to load and delete, load and delete, load  and delete. It's not a very good system.  Yeah, Twitter does not give you any way to do that.  Isn't that interesting?  Yeah, I know it's hard to like delete.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Direct messages. I have direct messages that I try to just clean up.  Yeah. Yeah.  But it's a pain in the butt. Just delete those.  So can I ask a question?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No. So come blue.  No.  Yet you started anyway.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You're canceled, Jeff.  You are just can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You are so canceled.  Sorry, Mr. Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not sorry.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm not sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go ahead, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Killer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you have that's a chilling effect, I think.  It is. I'm chill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Censorship.  Come on, Jeff, go ahead.  Question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So architecturally, if you think about Blue Sky or you think about discord or mastodon  and you want to kill something, you're going to get in trouble  for it. You were wrong.  Whatever. Is it is it harder?  Is it impossible?  Do you have to kill in 100 places?  What is the architecture of these of these federated distributed things look like?  Just the things that we already have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If it's truly federated, you can't get rid of it.  I don't know if Twitter still has that architecture, though.  So like when you were talking about that, I was like, oh, man, do they still have  that? I really thought they were architected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So isn't Tweetdeck a client, separate client?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but you can I mean, you can control things like is it truly federated or are  they just serving up an API?  Well, there are third party.  They're serving up an API.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tweetdeck is a bad example because it's owned by Twitter.  Yeah, but let's say a third party client.  Yeah, they're getting I don't know, because, you know, one of the reasons I like  third party clients is because I get the chronological feed and I don't get ads.  So, yeah, I guess they're using the API, but they're just getting the tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because once you reload the API, once it's deleted, they would get it because  that's not actually an API isn't federated.  So that's I just don't know, though.  So I can't really say anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Otherwise, it'd be like just theoretically of what's the world we want.  I may ask it differently here.  Do we because Leo's Leo's arguments, renuously for the it's the record.  You said it in public.  That's it. Live with it.  It's there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then you would want to put it on something like the blockchain.  And I'm not always the blockchain is no deletions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's what I'm saying.  So, well, and if you try, like even if you deleted it on a client side, you would  have a record of it being that's still accessible.  Right.  So that's scary.  Even if you made it harder to find.  I don't know.  I mean, it really depends on the tool sets that we have available to access it.  Right.  Because in some cases, it'd be like the equivalent of saying, hey, like, like if  back before the Internet, if I murdered a cat and the newspaper wrote an article,  eventually that article makes it back to the microfiche section and nobody really  looks it up right on the Internet.  That's not the case because the microfiche is just a search away.  So if you had something that was like on a blockchain, but not accessible, it's  still be available to people who knew how to look.  It just wouldn't be available to like someone, some random person who's  Googling your name.  Does that make sense?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's, but these are, these are important.  This is to your point often, Stacey, about, we got to talk about it before we do it.  Yeah.  These are important decisions to be made, design decisions to be made about what  we think of the public record.  And as a journalist, I generally agree with Leo that it's out there, it's out  there and I don't like right to be forgotten for that reason.  Um, but you know, you have an exception for young people that could be an  exception for the, you know, a mistake being made, it could be an exception  for being found innocent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Honestly, if you're on Twitter, I think I would like to see it be part of the  deal that if you're on Twitter, you know what you're doing and you're  handling a loaded gun, we've just given you the loaded gun.  If you shoot yourself in the foot, you shoot yourself in the foot.  Not my problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Then there's the same aspect of Twitter giving you the option of protected tweets  too, like what is, what are the, what's the word?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um, it's you can't, can you protect a tweet or just your whole account?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't.  Well, it's your whole account, but I mean, you're still using this public platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Only people mention this tweet.  Oh, that's only they can respond.  That's reply.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's for replies.  But I'm saying if someone does, does an account that's not public anymore, they  just totally lock it down.  Which I have done.  And so are they allowed to delete their tweets?  Are they allowed to do the tweets?  And what's, oh, that's interesting.  I mean, there's a lot of different angles.  That's a good point.  Cause the protecting it because they want it to be so-called private.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think Twitter should allow private accounts.  See,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  well, maybe Lisa has waited by the way.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's been on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is Lisa tweeting?  Yeah, she's tweeted.  Am I being sub tweeted now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  She waited and she said, if you can delete a tweet, then you should be able to edit  just show the before and after limit it to one edit.  That would work for me.  I think that's a good idea.  Oh, that's good.  One, one edit with a record and, and show the before and after.  So yeah, I was an idiot.  I made a typo or I learned a lesson or I was wrong or I don't want your  cat house to burn down or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good for Lisa.  That's the right answer.  So better believe it says, says her husband.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I love

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love the, the tweet and response from the VP comms at sub stack.  Did you see this whole story?  I've put that up there.  So Lula Cheng, I'm a survey who is the vice president of comms at sub stack  tweet, sub stack is hiring dot, dot, dot.  If you're a Twitter employee who's considering resigning because you're  worried about Elon Musk pushing for less regulated speech, please do not come work  here to which on sub stack, Alex Perini, I don't know if you've seen this  responds as VP of comms for the newsletter company, it's really important  that make sure everyone associates our brand with being a huge, unaccountable  dipstick.  So this is obviously a parody post on sub stack.  Well written by Alex.  He says, and this is saying is in her voice and not to brag, but I think I'm  pretty good at my job, which is why so many people understand our company is  about conflating the conflict of the concept of free and open debate with  being a brain jackass all the time.  One way we get this message across is by having a bunch of brain jackasses  on our platform.  But as a comms professional, I assure you, this is not enough.  There were a bunch of brain jackasses on blogspot, but no one ever thought of  that as a platform specializing in brain jackasses and making my job even harder.  Our platform is not exclusively home to brain jackasses.  Lots of thoughtful, intelligent, conscientious people use our platform and  even rely on us for their livelihoods.  My job is to make sure no one in the broader internet using public associates  the work of those people with our corporate brand.  Every day I log in with one mission to ensure that people understand that we  here at the newsletter company do not just provide a platform for dipsticks  and trolls, but that dipsticks and trolls are an essential part of our corporate  culture. Anyway, it's a very funny parody of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And Neil Dash killed his sub-stack account because of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because of the tweet, the Lulu Cheng original tweet.  Yeah.  So why did he kill his account?  What is it?  So why is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He kind of wouldn't say because he just he didn't even he referred to it only as  a sub. He subtweeted it.  They didn't give the full rationale.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think there's always been a lot of criticism of sub-stack because of the  kinds of people they intentionally pay to be on sub-stack.  They like Twitter apparently seem to have this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hank Green responded to my tweet.  I said sub-stack reveals its essence layer by layer.  Hank Green responded.  Disagreement is not tolerated on our pro-free speech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Honestly, if Elon Musk really does start to direct what happens to Twitter, I  think the real risk is that it will be the end of Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so, too.  He could ruin it.  And maybe that's his desire.  Maybe it's maybe it's Peter Thiel time.  Maybe this.  I mean, that's the other thing about this.  This is this is very rich people.  This is part of what Stacey said earlier, too.  It's rich people, rich boys who can throw around their weight.  And I just finished an amazing book called The Newspaper Axis about the six  press barons, Hearst, McCormick, Rothermere, Patterson, Patterson, and one  other I never forget who supported Hitler.  Who supported fascism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was going to ask, was that a swastika I just saw on there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yep.  This is about World War II and supporting, in some cases, supporting Hitler, in  some cases, supporting fascism and in most cases, opposing entry into World War II.  Terrible anti-Semitism out of the New York Daily News, for example.  So those were rich people who could own the barrels of ink and could do what  they wanted to.  So the issue here, I was called by the Financial Times about the story today.  The issue to me, too, is not so much about censorship, it's about compelled  speech.  What we're going to find is if Elon forces Twitter to carry things that Twitter in  its own ethical standards would otherwise not, under the guise of free speech, then  it's compelled speech and it's not free speech and it's going to ruin the  environment for all of us.  That's what I worry about.  What did Dorsey have to say about all this?  And so we go also to Jack Dorsey.  I'm sorry, Anthony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, I was going to ask, what did Dorsey have to say about all of this?  Because he was tweeting here recently about the platform and how he seems to  have a part in all of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I wonder if he knew what was going on here because what he regretted in that,  it's a good question, is he regretted helping to create a centralized rather  than decentralized Internet.  I thought that was such an interesting weakness of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We talked about that on the Sunday.  Do you think he kind of knew ahead of time what was going on?  He must have.  Had to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think this is the problem with the centralized is you can take over  centralized.  You can't take over decentralized.  Yeah.  You can fill it with crap, but you can't take it over to our prior.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So do you think one of the things Musk might do, for instance, is reinstate  Donald Trump's account?  That's what I fear.  Be good.  You know what?  It'd be good for business.  That's why the stock went up.  Yep.  Be good for business.  That's probably what the market was thinking.  All right.  Well, who's next on the board?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Rihanna.  She's got 80 million followers.  She's going to be on the Twitter board next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would enjoy that actually.  She'd do a better job, honestly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's take a little break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Rihanna versus Elon Musk.  Bring it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'd like to see that.  Rihanna versus Donald Trump.  Bring it.  Oh boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  More to come in just a bit.  Oh, let me just, before I do that, let me read the, because we referred to it.  We didn't say what the tweet was from Jack Dorsey.  This was on April 2nd.  So this was four days ago.  By the way, he by then might well have known that Elon Musk was buying up  stock because that was reported on March 15th.  The days of Usenet.  That was the, the kind of the open message boards in the early days of the internet.  IRC, we still use that by the way, is our channel.  The web, even email with PGP were amazing.  Centralizing discovery and identity into corporations really damaged the internet.  I realize I'm partially to blame and regret it.  It's kind of an elegy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It really is.  It really is.  Wow.  Wow.  Power to them.  It might be a message, Leo.  I just noticed you have a message that could be very important.  Where, where's her?  I always read those messages.  Is it my wife?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My wife calling me.  Oh my God.  Wait a minute.  Hold on a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do you see, what do you, what do you mean a message?  How do you see that?  I don't understand.  How does the toolbox says message?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It had one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He told me I should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  As someone sending you a direct message.  That's very important.  Leo.  It could be, it could be you winning the lottery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no.  Lisa wanted to know what we're going to have for dinner tonight.  All right.  All right.  No, she does not message me on Twitter, by the way.  We don't, we're not that, we're not animals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, she just comes and yells at you from about 20 feet away.  Just right over there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hey, she's home working from home right now.  So my joke interrupted.  Do you think, do you think that the Jack's right?  That the centralized internet was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think there's a lot, you know, we talked about this on Sunday.  Uh, I made a good panel on Twitter for this.  There's a lot of nostalgia about the good old days.  I look, look back, I look back with the, or at the early days of Twitter  with great nostalgia, but then I realized it's kind of elitist.  It's because it was just me and my friends.  And you were number one on Twitter.  It was a small group.  It was just, you know, that's why it was fun.  It was, it was just us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, we haven't gone to the ad yet.  Miss Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know I'm like, what is happening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  This is an ad for truth social Stacey.  We're talking about,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, y'all are just terrible.  I'm like, okay, go, go.  Did you get a waffle or not?  I did put it in the toaster oven.  Nothing important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nothing important happened.  Do you remember though, Jeff, uh, I don't remember if it was 96.  The, they, was they called the summer of AOL where we had the internet to ourselves  and then America online announced that they were going to give everybody an AOL  access to the internet.  And, and all of us were going, Oh crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, we don't want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Real people are coming.  So I'm going to stop.  We were all stopped.  So there's a certain amount of snobbery when you say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  and again, I'll recommend this last week, bamboozle with the revolution, which is  kind of the story of that is big media coming in and invading the internet,  ruining it.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But let's face it, any, uh, social group is best when it's small and it's,  it's friends and people you like.  And it's always going to be better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I remember they said that about Instagram coming to Android.  Oh, wow.  Right.  Yeah, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That was a classic thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's exactly right.  That was, you're right.  I forgot about that.  Our show today, go get your waffle.  Our show today brought to you by Stacy, not the rest of you.  You stay right there in your chair.  Crap.  Brought to you by Melissa to ensure your business is a success.  You need to have good records, right?  Records of your customers, records of your suppliers.  You need to be able to contact people with the right phone number, the  right email, the right address.  Well, here's the bad news.  You're that data is withering away.  Even as we speak, people move addresses, change names, change emails,  change phone numbers, change.  That's why you need Melissa, a leading provider of global data quality  and address management solutions.  37 years they've been doing this.  I think that's probably means that they go back to the zip plus four days.  You know, remember you'd enter the zip code and they would tell you,  well, what's the plus four, something like that.  Or even maybe just zip codes.  But over the time they've become much more than just zip codes.  You can verify addresses, emails, phone numbers, even names in real time.  With Melissa, it's a global address verification service that works in  240 plus countries and territories.  I think it's kind of amazing.  More than 10,000 businesses call Melissa the address experts and a renewal  rate of 92% says, yeah, people are pretty darn happy.  Maybe it has something to do with the fact that the typical return on  investment for Melissa customers is 25%.  By the way, big year last year, they had a record at Melissa.  They capped off the year by reaching a milestone 30 billion with a B  North American address lookups in the year.  That's the most in its history.  I bet you the bill beat that in 2022.  Melissa can also eliminate duplicate customer information or database.  That can be almost as bad as having the wrong information.  Send two catalogs at the same address.  Uh-uh.  Waste of money, wasted time, and frankly, it annoys the clients, your customers.  Melissa's data matching helps eliminate clutter and duplicates and it  ensures the accuracy of your database.  They can do batch address cleaning.  In fact, you can even upload it to their FTP site and then download it.  That's one way, one of many ways you can use Melissa.  You can also do it on prem with your own client right there on your own computers.  There's a web service.  There's software as a service.  They even have an app on iOS and Android to do address name and other lookups.  It's good.  A good name for it is lookups, lookups app.  So go ahead and get that on your device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I am doing a strip.  Waffle.  See in a second.  A layer cake.  A fun fatty cake.  Protein cake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Love our new June oven by the way.  Protein cake.  Protein cake.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're like Kodiak.  Pasty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You'll see it a second.  They're going to come.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm getting a delivery once it's finished.  I used to get a perogies every day before work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So somebody said you're starting to look like a perogies.  No, I immediately cut off all perogies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is the best carb loading option there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, it is the best carb loading option there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, when you put it that way, maybe not.  Like potato.  Potato.  Pasta.  Wrapped in pastries.  Jose Andres, who is in Ukraine right now, I guess to help.  In Poland, I think.  Oh, he's in Poland.  Okay.  But he's helping out.  Maybe he's been in Ukraine too.  In training people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He was in Ukraine, but I think he may have left by now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He was using Apple Maps, apparently.  He said, Apple Maps keeps sending me into a Russian controlled territories.  No, I think that that's asking a lot, given the changing status  as they come back, go back and forth to say Apple Maps, you should know  that you're routing me through Russian controlled territory.  You might want some better intelligence than that.  Yeah.  Apple did not immediately respond for comments or comment.  He did say that he likes the translation technology built into WhatsApp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Google's is even better, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, actually, no.  You know what?  That's it.  He says he wants to see language translation built into WhatsApp  so he doesn't have to keep going back and forth with Google Translate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I've been reading Telegram, the Ukrainian government  Telegram account, which of course is not in English.  I wish it had Translate built in because I just have to do paragraph at a time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I actually really like Telegram, but I don't know.  I don't know.  It's this message.  You don't know what?  They don't have encryption except for group chats and you have to know  how to turn it on and it's not very good.  And then there's also this issue of it's a Russian, you know,  Pavel Dorofe was Russian.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Yeah.  I mean, he's living in Dubai now, but in fact, you could make the case  that he's anti-Russian because they forced him to sell his prior company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was going to say, you might be, I mean, don't paint Russians.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just because he's from Russia doesn't mean he's pro-Putin.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I kind of can't tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's the thing about.  I can't tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fortnite, good on them.  They raised $144 million for Ukraine relief by pumping all their profits  for two weeks into all the proceeds along with those, by the way, from  Microsoft to humanitarian efforts following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  $36 million the first day alone.  That's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Power works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is amazing.  League of Legends developer Riot Games raised 5.4 million by selling a, I  guess in League of Legends, probably DLC and stuff, a bundle of nearly a thousand  games on itch.io.  That was pretty amazing.  I saw that they ended up taking in more than $6 million for Ukraine relief in  24 hours, $10 minimum donation, but you got a thousand games.  That's pretty cool.  Um, humble bundle, $20 million.  They've always sold stuff for charity.  And humble bundles.  How long have they been doing that?  They're cool.  They're pretty cool.  Wow.  Yeah.  They've been around a long time.  Yeah.  Um, so everybody's pitching in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The story above about, about the emails I found fascinating is that, that, um, uh, a  psychology professor tied together with a Norwegian computer expert to get 550,000  volunteers who have sent 60 million emails providing details of the war into Russia.  Oh, wow.  Trying to get around the blockade and, and, and with help about how they should be  written to convince people, this is real.  Now, of course they could say those damned Americans are spamming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It might look like spot spam.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Um, but it's an interesting way to say, okay, if you're in a completely media  blockaded country, can you use the internet to get around it?  Russians do it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You think this will be a case though of people who already believe that will believe  the email and people who don't won't.  Probably.  But that's life.  That's life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Um, but that's also why I was 60 million of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you, um, if you speak Russian, I guess, I guess you'd probably want to speak  Russian, but you can go to mail to ru.org now 75 million emails sent.  Jesus.  Um, wow.  Mail the number two ru.org.  This service is built to send messages from your own email account.  That's how they can keep from getting blocked to a batch of Russian email  addresses with the help of thousands of volunteers around the world.  We're urging Russians to learn about the war in Ukraine and get  access to independent news.  So you could also do it with messenger.  With messenger.  Um, and then they have, I guess, a list of Russian emails.  Uh, so that, but they also say if you get bounce backs, let, let them know, let  us know so we can take them out of the list.  Good on them.  Yeah.  Somebody asks, are we putting Russian people in danger by sending them these  emails?  Nah, we're just sending unsolicited emails.  They may take some risk responding if their outgoing mail is read by the  Russian government, but they can't be blamed for our email simply appearing  in front of our eyes.  Right.  Their eyes.  Uh, that's a good point.  Yeah.  I don't know if, if how the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Would they be blamed for opening them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wondered, I wonder just how many people actually, um, seeing them, because  it's, I think you and I don't let people to even use email nowadays, right?  I barely.  Oh, wait a minute.  Just me.  Just you.  I think it's just you, big boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um, this is a little triggering, so, uh, close your eyes, but I thought it was  a really interesting use of technology.  You may remember that Russia, uh, was in a, um, uh, Ukraine town called  Butchia for quite a while, and then they got beaten out of it.  And then of course, Ukrainian soldiers found a lot of bodies of Ukrainian  citizens, some of them bound at the wrist.  Some of them apparently tortured and showed that to the world.  The Russians said, ah, no, no, they weren't dead when we left.  They, they, this is all propaganda from the Ukrainian government.  So New York times examined satellite images and was able to find many of  these bodies weeks before the Russians left.  Thank you technology.  So I, I won't go any farther than that, but, uh, an analysis of satellite  images by the times rebuts claims by Russia that the killing of civilians  in Butchia, a suburb of Kiev occurred after its soldiers left town.  Not so we've got the pictures.  Not a hoax, not a hoax.  And, uh, let's see, let's move on because I know you can't wait to see the  unofficial Bridgerton tick tock musical that won a Grammy Grammy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is crazy to me.  A Grammy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What?  Beating out Andrew Lloyd Webber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, it feels really good.  Les Miserables.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.  Stacy, the girl from the North country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it really good or is it just, well, let's hear it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It won a Grammy.  Just hip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Or we'd put it here.  I knew you'd ask that ant.  So I put in some music so you can hear it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's a little, just a little, just a little, this is a version.  This is I burn for you.  You ready?  Music video from Bridgerton.  By the way, Stacy, you watch this show.  Maybe you explain what's going on.  Wait a minute.  This is too good for tick tock.  This is super professional.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It is.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There are high quality people on tick tock.  These are like, this is a pro studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's in.  Maybe not.  It's a, it's her house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Norman in there.  Listen to her voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It looks like it's all synthesizer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it sounds like an orchestra.  It sounds like a damn good orchestra in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who wrote this?  This is like Broadway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are they going to get kicked off of tick tock for?  Not being within the spirit of tick tock.  No, this is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  That's impressive.  It's great for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And they win a Grammy.  No, that's not a Grammy.  It's just unbelievable.  It's wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That sounded good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I just don't like musicals.  It has the seal of approval.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just don't like musicals, but I always respect talent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, Barlow and Bear.  You can listen to it on a variety of services.  It's all on YouTube as well.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they just use tick tock as a place to get their stuff out.  I mean, what's interesting to me is they're building on content.  I mean, to me, this is like what fan fiction or the point of remix culture is.  Right.  So in Bridgerton is Shondra Rimes.  I have no idea how she feels about copyright.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everything should be thrilled.  I mean, in no way really is this.  It doesn't use.  No, no.  Anything of hers.  So she should be.  It adds completely to the story.  Yeah.  But remember, Lucas always hated fan fiction.  Here's the official, the unofficial official music video.  So they spend some time.  They get some places to shoot.  They got this is a steady cam.  This is some pretty serious stuff here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But it.  Wow.  You could do it going around the gatekeepers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you you introduced us to the Bridgerton, the tick tock musical some time ago.  I think so.  Yeah.  But I didn't realize how good this was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, there was also there was Ratatouille.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ratatouille.  The tick tock.  Ratatouille.  They did not win a Grammy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They did not.  They were on Broadway.  But now now tick tock is funding the guy behind the creative force behind the  Ratatouille musical.  They're funding him to make another new musical now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, good.  Artists getting paid.  I have no problem with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So, um, you can see the, the, the, he talks through the plot and some songs and other  things that we can still Emily Bear and Abigail Barlow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um, Emily Bear said Abigail and I, this is, I think in her thank you speech have seen  the power of tick tock for years and decided to invite fans to watch our writing sessions  in real time and give their suggestions on the creation of the unofficial Bridgerton  musical Barlow ads.  The immense success of this project was definitely in the fans hands.  15 songs put together for the album.  And they win a Grammy award.  Yeah.  That's fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This could be the future of creativity.  This is, it's possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm really curious how Shondra Rimes feels about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the only, you know, I mean, they use the Bridget, the word Bridgerton is the only,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  and I guess some of the characters, the name of the woman who wrote the books, the  Bridgerton books is, maybe she should be upset.  Books.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, is Bridgerton a modern series?  No.  I mean, the TV show is the books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The books are, I think it's Julia Quinn, Julia Quinn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you're right.  Yeah.  Julia Quinn's novels.  But when did the Julia Quinn novels come out?  Oh, like in the 90s I think.  Yeah.  She's, she was born in 1970.  So, huh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  So these are not, the Duke and I came out, which is what the first one was based on.  It looks like that came out in 2000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I, I mean, I remember George Lucas for a while was really upset by  actually, I don't think it was George.  I think George probably liked the fan fiction, but the owners of star  wars didn't Lucas, it was kind of notorious for suing and putting out a  business people who did fan fix stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We have these conversations about YouTube way back in the day.  I guess that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, YouTube, this has a bit of structure to it, doesn't it?  This you've got to, you've got to work within a creative limitation,  A and B there's an expectation of collaboration in it and C there's  the social piece to it.  So it just, it adds a few layers, which is interesting.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My, my brother has a cat.  His name is, what's the cat's name?  She will occurs.  No, will occurs.  And he is, he's taught it to fetch.  And I love that cat.  My parents had a cat that they rescued.  Yeah.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a cup of muffin.  Oh, Kodiak cakes.  Okay.  Yeah.  It's a power cup.  So it looks like it's a cup of noodles, but really it's a cup of muffin.  Did we see a piece of it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They have pancake.  Yeah, sorry.  No.  And you, and you might grow it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Make it in.  You might grow it and it turns into a muffin.  If, yeah.  If you've ever had like a mug cake, it's that consistency, but I like them  because I have a lot of food.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You make fun of my Kachoi Pepe.  I would just buy a mug.  Just get a mug and you can put, make a mug.  Buy a muffin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Boy.  But a mug cake requires much more time.  This is, and this has 12 grams of protein.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I make my mug cakes with almond flour and it has a lot of proteins.  Quite good.  Yeah.  Okay.  Mug cakes are pretty easy.  That's the whole point of a mug cake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I know, but like it's, it's not as easy as a full ad basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um, Oh, I beg to differ.  I think I could make a mug cake in a full ad.  Look, here's a funfetti mug cake.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My daughter made those last, or like a few nights ago rather.  Wow.  They're, they're fine.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I need to get better mugs because right now my cups are the only thing that  really get hot in the microwave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  And now a picture of John's cats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, they run the house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are they run, are they watching the show?  It looks like they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They say there's cat killers in there.  Yeah.  Washington post opinion piece.  Da Dana Milbank tried Trump's truth, truth social.  So you don't have to, he says, I don't know honestly how he got in.  It's, it's still waiting listed.  So here are a few of the things you missed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cause because, because they're depressed, the, um, members of the press, they  may have gotten an in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe.  Yeah.  I endure weeks on the waiting list for the Donald Trump created Devin  Nunes run attempt at a Twitter killer.  And I suffered through a series of technical glitches, writes Milbank,  but eventually I gained access as a result.  I've come to be in possession of the following new pieces of information  about the war in Ukraine.  Hunter Biden is involved in building and running bio labs in the country.  The CIA and the national Institute of health are both deeply involved in  the Ukrainian bio labs.  The Russian invasion of Ukraine was set in motion by a CIA false flag operation  funded by George Soros.  The COVID-19 pathogen originated not in China, but in Shpilchnya, a village in  Ukraine, the bio weapons developed in Ukraine specifically target the Abrahamic  bloodline on, on and on and on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What is the Abrahamic bloodline?  Jewish people, Jewish people, Jewish people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, you might say it's not a tech story.  It kind of is, but I have to say it just shows you, I mean, remember before this  was launched, everybody said, boy, if Donald Trump ever launches a Twitter, it's  going to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They need libs to yell at is the general theory and they don't have any  libs to yell at, so it's no fun.  Nothing, nothing to yell about.  Plus people are leaving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Plus.  Oh, I see.  So it's more fun in Twitter because you've got people to yell at.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They get up, they get frustrated with you.  They interact with you.  Right.  And echo chambers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No fun.  It's no fun.  They've lost the only technical people, as far as I can tell, who worked there  are both gone, Josh Adams and Billy Boozer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sorry, but that is, that is a name you have to escape the company's chief of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  technology and product development.  At least stay William Boozer is Billy Boozer.  He's really leaning into it, isn't he?  Yeah, he is.  Yeah.  Um, yeah, both have resigned their senior posts at a critical juncture for the  company's smartphone app release plans.  They only have an iOS app.  They're trying to get an Android app.  Of course, uh, that's a huge part.  40% of the U S market, um, Boozer declined to comment and Adams did not respond to  request.  So we don't know what's going on, but it's not been good.  And of course it wasn't going to be a SPAC and they had, I think close to a billion  dollars in pledged investments in the SPAC.  That's almost all disappeared now.  People going, Ooh, maybe not.  Maybe not.  Are you ready for drone delivery in Texas?  You better be.  Alphabet's

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm not there anymore, but yes, Dallas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Alphabet's wing is bringing drone delivery to Dallas.  Actually, it's near, it's near Dallas, Frisco and little Elm.  They're in the Dallas Fort Worth multiplex Metroplex metro area.  Yeah.  Walgreens is the primary partner.  Drones will be picking up health and wellness products.  Pet meds from easy vet, uh, first aid kits from Texas health and ice cream.  It's raining ice cream from blue bell creameries.  Oh, hot for that.  I dig it.  I want to set clear expectations says the CEO.  Not everyone who lives within the range of our drones will be able to order on day  one, we're going to invite customers and groups to make sure everyone has a good  first experience with drone delivery.  By the way, you could already do this in Virginia, Helsinki, Canberra and Logan  Australia.  Ooh, 200,000th delivery was last week.  Do they drop it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do they land?  The Amazon ones drop it.  Um, I don't know if the Google ones drop it.  I mean, Texas makes sense.  They're really well laid out, planned communities with open space.  You know, you're not dealing with alleys and inner city kind of issues, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or anybody of the Abrahamic persuasion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I'm just pretty sure there are Jewish people in Dallas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I really want to see a video of this alphabet wing delivery.  Let me see if I can find one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm curious how they do it.  They're dropping it is doable either way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you, YouTube.  Here we go.  Tech from tech first.  We're not going to replace the majority of ground delivery.  That's an interview.  I won't, but I just want to see a picture.  Here we go.  Here it is.  I see a muffin.  Here comes a muffin.  I think they wish that we were in more.  You know, it's all B it's all stock footage, B roll.  I'm marketing.  Oh, wait a minute.  Here it is.  Here's a fake delivery.  Some toast.  I'm going to turn off the sound so I can narrate this unhindered by facts.  Um, here's a guy.  He's got some toast.  Okay.  He's run out of Marmite or posar me.  Veggie.  My, this is an Australia three, three, three minutes out.  So he drops the toast.  Here's the nice clerk in Canberra.  I know it was empty.  It was an empty and you know, Oh, look at that.  It drops it on a string.  Wait a minute.  What?  Oh no, that's the drone coming to pick it up.  It picks it up.  The clerk puts a bag on the string.  The drone goes around and then a small child runs out.  Yeah, that's exactly what you want to do.  And then gets a thing of Vegemite dropped on his head.  Here it comes.  No, it comes down on a string.  So you gotta be ready for it.  Cause the drone is not going to just going to wait for you.  Or maybe it is.  Oh, it released it.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It unhooks it.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nice.  And the small child runs out and dad has his Vegemite.  This poison for the child.  Oh no, don't eat that Vegemite.  It's beer byproduct.  Okay.  So you can see it's obviously was launched first in Australia.  Coming to Dallas, it won't be Vegemite.  What will they be delivering in Dallas?  Queso.  Barbecue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Barbecue.  Rotel.  I mean, so not Queso.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Rotel peppers.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Breakfast tacos.  That's what I want.  They don't have those in Dallas.  Well, they don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's just an Austin thing.  It's not just an Austin thing, but it is.  I don't, I mean, we're going to be in Dallas for a podcast expo this summer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How's Dallas in August?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm going to be in Dallas in May.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it's not too hot.  It's hot, hot, hot.  So I figured that the podcast movement is going to be in Dallas,  August 23rd, because hotels are cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was about to say it's cheap.  Yeah.  But you know what?  You don't actually have to, the nice thing about summer in Texas is you  never actually have to go outside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't go outside.  Right.  In fact, we're going to stay at the hotel so we don't have to walk in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can say hi to Andrew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is Andrew going?  I'm sure he is.  Oh, how exciting.  He goes to podcast expo every year.  Or I'm sorry.  I keep calling it podcast expo.  It's a podcast movement, right?  Yeah.  He has a podcast business?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's got a whole site called podcast guests where you sign up to be an expert  and you can find guests for your shows.  Oh, that's cool.  I didn't know that.  Yeah.  He's all entrepreneurial and stuff.  Y'all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I've heard of podcast guests.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How many different things does he run?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, he runs the business side of my business.  He runs his domain publication.  He runs podcast guests.  And then at any given time, he's probably experimenting with something else, but I  don't pay attention to them until they become like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Until there's money to be had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That trifling working on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, no, I mean, because, you know, he comes up with stuff and I mean, for as  long as I've known him, he's had a side hustle.  So like when we met, he was selling old beer signs.  He'd go to like flea markets in Texas and sell these tin beer signs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to hang with Mr. Andrew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Was this his first business when he was in college?  He sold beer, old beers, rusted out beer signs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, when he was a kid, he used to bring candy to school and sell it.  You know, he'd buy it at the candy store and sell it to his classmates for.  Yeah.  He's, he's, he's entrepreneurial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's neat.  I want to hang with him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you called an Uber in San Francisco or New York and a yellow cab showed up,  would you be disappointed?  Yes.  That's the future.  That's the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Uber is the worst of both worlds.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  This is, I mean, this is really interesting.  This is exactly what Uber was created to avoid.  They signed a deal in New York city to put all New York city cabs on the app.  Now they've signed a deal with yellow cab, San Francisco and flywheel technologies.  Bay area passengers.  This is the blind that kind of confused me who summoned an Uber ride might see  one of the city's taxis show up to ferry them in the coming months.  So I assumed when I saw the New York city on the app that you would have a choice,  black car, you know, cab, but it sounds to me like Uber is just going to send  whatever is nearby and it might be a cab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know about that.  I, I, I actually liked my Uber experience, even though most of the time I just use  Lyft, but I liked that experience of an actual person just casually doing it.  You know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um, so this is probably in response to the pandemic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, they can't get enough drivers.  Can't get drivers.  Yeah.  Uh, and it also, well, plus the cabbies are enraged and they own these medallions  that they can't get the value of.  So it's a way to pacify that fight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  However, the difference is it will not be a metered rate.  Cabs usually, you know, you can drop the flag and you get metered.  Uber is going to be a flat upfront fare.  So that's interesting.  Little more than a dozen cab drivers spoke out against partnering with Uber  during the San Francisco municipal transportation agency board meeting,  while four drivers and four cab company owners spoke in support of the idea,  saying it would generate much needed new business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if this hadn't have happened, what would have happened with, with the Uber?  Because you said there's a driver's shortage going on and it's probably a  driver's shortage because of the dag gum fuel costs.  Nobody's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or that could be, or yeah, people don't want to drive for Uber.  I wouldn't blame them.  So, yeah, I don't know how this solves it, except that a cabbie, I guess,  is already doing it.  Taxi rides through Uber will cost the same as an Uber X ride.  The more expensive ones, right?  No, X is the cheap one, which is calculated on base fare.  Yeah, right.  A base fare plus trip time and distance taxi drivers will know in advance which  rides come from Uber and what they will be paid and they can accept or reject it,  reject it without consequences.  I could, I mean, it's good for cabbies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's good for them.  I don't know if it's good for Uber though, in the long run.  We'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It might be maybe Uber had to do it, right?  They couldn't get drivers.  I don't know.  It's a good question.  What would have happened if they had done this deal?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Speaking of San Francisco, you may remember a company called Fast raised $120 million  to do a one-click shopping.  They're gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So the most interesting thing about this story to me was Dan Pramek over at Axios  now, he wrote in his newsletter that he says, it's like this story in and of itself  is a surprise.  It is too soon yet to have the death watch for these companies, but he feels like that  time is coming because the story is one about, you know, basically blowing through your  money to gain market share and then not being able to raise more money.  Yeah.  I'm so familiar.  Yeah.  We've lived through this twice now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Remember the wonderful site F company?  Yep.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All that.  Pud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's Pud started that.  He did something else after that.  Oh, he did a lot of stuff.  I remember.  He did a lot of stuff.  Yeah.  Pud's an interesting character.  Philip Kaplan.  So fast, I guess, despite raising $120 million only made $600,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's interesting.  I guess this is the logical conclusion of having so much free money floating around  that, you know, at some point you're going to have to do something with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's kind of like a game of musical chairs.  Like, if you're not doing great, you can sell to a company great.  But at some point in time, you do actually have to create value.  I know it's so old school of me to think that, but it's still true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Old school.  Old school.  Like pudding in a cup.  We're going to take a break while Stacey pops another muffin in the micro to talk about  our sponsor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There was enough time to finish writing my podcast post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wow.  Wow.  You're that good.  Huh?  She's fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's no, I just, I just had to write one more paragraph and got it done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Multi-tasking.  Thanks to a ScooterX in our chat, actually in our discord chat, this tweet from Christina

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Warren.  All right.  I'm going to need you all to help me get a few more questions.  All right.  I'm going to need you all to help me get a fast hoodie.  Guess she collects the, that'd be, that'd be a collector's item, right?  Hoodies have failed startups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That and shoes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I used to have a bunch of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Who doesn't?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you did a review.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're all real old now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  You did a review of the Olive Pro earbuds last year.  Did you like them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  They're really, really neat set of earbuds because yeah, you can listen to your music  and phone calls or whatever, but if you're someone that have issues with like hearing  impaired issues, you can hear things better in a loud environment.  Like I tested them out.  I went to the casino and just popped them in and I can hear things.  I can actually hear conversation next to me versus all of the rumble and hustle going  on around me.  They're really, really, really nice.  Nice set of earbuds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're going to have to get a pair of these.  These are the successor, the Olive Max 2-in-1 hearing aids.  They're actually calling them hearing aids.  They double as earbuds.  They look pretty cool.  Oh, they call them hearing aids.  I think, well, you know, the...  Because they didn't call the...  Yeah, the FDA doesn't want you to call them.  There's no, they're still not over the counter hearing aids yet.  Okay.  Even though they were supposed to be going back four years now, five years.  Hearing helpers.  Hearing helpers.  Assistant.  Hearables is what they call them.  Hearables, yeah.  So the Olive Max, they say it's an FDA Class 2 hearing aid.  But now while my hearing aids cost $6,000, and that's pretty typical for hearing aids,  you go to an audiologist, you get them fitted and all that stuff, and tuned.  These started $299.  They'll start shipping in the fourth quarter.  I bet you they're figuring the FDA, which has delayed the rollout of over the counter  hearing aids for some time, will finally say, all right, all right.  Just do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think they did set it.  I think they set it.  So hold on.  Let me give you the accurate information.  Yeah.  So Biden did an executive order last summer that said we need to get on that.  Because the regulations were already there.  This...  Okay.  So yeah, they implemented a rule in October that basically says there was a law, the  Over the Counter Hearing Aid Act that was in 2017.  The order, Biden's order from the summer did a timeline for action.  And now the FDA has issued the proposed rule.  So now it should be doable.  That would explain it.  That proposed...  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is the first, expect a flood.  I wouldn't even be surprised if Apple at some point starts to say, hey, you know,  AirPods Pro can be used this way as well.  With the whole kit and all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or health kit, whatever they call it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Once you get the hearables turn into hearing aids, you can also put a lot of really cool  sensors in there, like galvanic skin response for stress.  You can put body temperature.  You can track heart rate.  You can actually track a lot of stuff in your ears in a way that might be interesting,  especially for people who can't afford an Apple Watch.  Sleep tracking.  Well, you're not going to sleep with your hearing aid in.  So you've got to think of things where it's intermittent and you would want...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And these only give you about eight hours of...  So you're going to take them out after eight hours, put them in the case where they'll  charge some more, just like AirPods do.  Anyway, OliveMax.  Sounds like it's kind of like the pros that you reviewed.  Maybe it looks cool.  They have the auto, a voice auto focus feature, which will focus in on the voice.  Automatically.  And a new sound engine, they say, that lets you detect voices better and is better at  reducing and filtering background noise.  How did the pros do when you had that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was ridiculous.  The app has pretty much the EQ on it and you can tailor it to fit even better than what  their AI is already doing.  Nice.  You know, we would have the hardheads running around and the dogs running around and I  could still listen to the television clearly, even though there's all of this mess going  in the kitchen and things like that.  It was really impressive.  Nice.  And it didn't look like hearing aids.  It just looked like, you know, earbuds that you'd listen to music in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google, like many companies struggling with the return to office, they are now bribing  employees with free electric scooters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Not a scooter, but a scooter subscription.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you don't get the scooter, just the subscription.  You quit, you lose scooter.  Oh, it's called a ride scoot in which most of Google's US based workers can get  reimbursed for the full cost of a monthly subscription to a Nagi's stylish model one  scooter.  If you were to buy it, it would cost $990.  It's a dual motor scooter.  It's top speed of 20 miles an hour, range of 15 miles.  I guess this is smart, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, more scooters.  Scooters are apparently a big thing right now because of the gas prices.  So people are turning to scooters.  Oh, this could get you.  Oh, I know.  I'm having a hard time staying awake too.  That's so nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, I don't understand what's wrong with bicycles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No one wants to sweat.  You know, oh, yeah.  Well, get an electric bike then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I have an electric bike.  I wouldn't say.  You can't fit them all on Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You still have to pedal on the e-bikes too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but you don't have to pedal hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  These will fit above you on the, on the, on the Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's true.  You scoot to the bus and get on the bus.  Oh, that's the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's the idea.  And then you scoot once you're off or on campus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google has just built a lake house.  Well, that's not, that's kind of a misinterpretation of this story,  but I kind of prefer it.  Google cloud just built a data lake house on big query.  No, I'm less excited about that story.  Google has banned apps with hidden data harvesting software.  Well, duh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Um, from governments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, catch that part.  The consumer facing apps are tied to the U S national security contract.  Oh, a Panamanian company wrote the code.  It's linked through corporate records and web registrations to a Virginia  defense contractor that does cyber intelligence network defense and  intelligence intercept work for us national security agencies that code ran  on millions of Android devices, dozens of apps on the Google play store,  including several Muslim prayer apps, a highway speed trap detector.  What do these have in common?  A QR code reader and a number of other popular consumer apps.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Our government measurement systems paid developers to incorporate its code.  Uh, surreptitiously collecting data from the users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Stacy, this was old.  The, we knew about the Muslim prayer app collecting data and then  selling it to government officials.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Getting rid of it as new, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I thought they did get rid of it, but maybe.  More.  Like this feels very familiar.  So I'm like, Oh, I feel like we've covered this, but okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Two, uh, two security researchers shared their findings in March last month with  Google, which initiated an investigation resulting in the ban, the apps containing  measurement system software removed from the Google play store as of March 25th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wonder what's the procedure for Google to go through its store and, and see this  stuff because I mean, there's a gazillion apps out there and how are they checking?  Oh, they know.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and if you've already installed the app, it doesn't matter.  They removed it from the store.  You've got it on your phone.  It's working.  Yeah.  Hmm.  Wow.  I guess, I guess all you could do if you're Google is to monitor outbound, uh,  traffic, right?  Cause it has to upload to some server somewhere.  I don't know.  That's not great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I feel like it didn't, I can't remember how they got, but nevermind.  I can't remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So we're all terrible today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wish I'd had a cup of muffin.  Yeah.  I need to do some squads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  About ubiquity, the router company suing Brian Krebs, a security journalist for  425,000 in dollars in damages because ubiquity says that he misled intentionally  has to be intentional, right?  Intentionally misled the public about a data breach on ubiquities, hardware,  and a subsequent blackmail attempt.  Ubiquity said, Krebs said they covered up the cyber attack.  Ubiquity says, no, we, we send an email out immediately told customers to take  additional security protect precautions.  Then we noticed notified the public in the next filing it made with the SEC.  They claim Krebs intentionally disregarded.  That's not true.  Not true.  Is there proof?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or saying that, oh, we told the SEC is not the same as telling the public.  I think they should not have sued Brian Krebs.  That's just a dumb thing to do.  Yeah.  For a bunch of reasons.  Because I mean, he's not a bad actor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  His only, yeah, I agree.  He said, they said his only source was the company employee who leaked all  this information in the first place.  He was later charged with stealing confidential data and extorting ubiquity  while posing as anonymous hacker.  Ubiquity knew the sole source had been indicted for his criminal involvement in  the attack, but he published it.  Krebs published a story on the blog the next day.  Krebs knew doubling down on his accusations against ubiquity.  Um, doesn't matter.  You have to prove malicious intent in a lawsuit like this, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  Uh, still as long as Sullivan stole the case and the libel suit.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Um, it's just a bad look if you ask me for ubiquity, but I guess they  feel like they've got a case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If they can prove they actually did that communication to the public.  I think they did send out an email.  Yeah.  But did they send it out three years later?  No.  Some other company.  They didn't wait like wise did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They didn't wait.  Did they, did they clearly, I mean, like, I guess I would like to see the  email they sent out to me.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have it somewhere.  I can read it to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, that's right.  Cause you're a ubiquity customer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, it was, it was kind of, um, and kind of an anodyne email that said, you  know, it'd probably be a good idea if you were to change your password right now.  They weren't too clear about, uh, exactly what had happened, but doesn't matter.  They did do, I, you know, I, that's the question.  Does, does their notification?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Cause think about, I think if you tell someone, Hey, lock your, if you send  someone an email that says, Hey, by the way, you may want to lock your door,  you know, versus, Hey, you may want to lock your door because we have noticed  that there is a robber roaming around trying all the door locks in your  neighborhood.  Those are very different emails.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  As the emails that I've seen from other vendors that say suspicious  activity on your account change.  Here's the password.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We've had a data breach.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's the, uh, so the data breach happened, uh, December 5th.  Uh, no, wait a minute.  Uh, so the justice department, uh, indicted a ubiquity developer for  causing the breach December 5th.  Um, ubiquity on March 31st of last year said, it's security experts identified.  No evidence that customer information was accessed or even targeted.  Um, and then in January 11th, so about a month later, they sent an email.  And this is what the email said.  Dear customer, we recently became aware of unauthorized access to certain of  our information technology systems hosted by a third-party cloud provider.  We have no indication there's been unauthorized activity with  respect to any user's account.  I remember getting this email, but as a precaution, we encourage  you to change your password.  We recommend you also change your password on any website where  you use the same ID and password.  There's a button that says here you can change it.  We apologize.  Deeply regret.  That covers it.  This is kind of.  Ironically from the brand Krebs story of which came out March 30th of last year.  What Krebs, according to a ubiquity did not reveal as his source for  these stories was the hacker.  And that Krebs should have known it was actually the hacker, but did not reveal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, did, did Krebs know?  So they're suing him because they think, or because Krebs admitted  that he knew it was the hacker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I guess that's what the, what, what the trial will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Cause I mean, like if the hacker comes to talk to me, then as long as I don't know it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, the complaints said only one source propped up Krebs story against  ubiquity Nicholas sharp, the ubiquity employee behind the cyber attack, by the  way, we'll never, we won't get Brian's side of it and I have huge respect for Brian.  We, we use his work all the time on the shows.  Uh, but he, his lawyer on advice of his lawyer, he's not commenting.  It's just the right thing to do.  Smart.  Uh, so on December sharp was charged.  Krebs allegedly ubiquity said Krebs allegedly reviewed the press release knew  that his sole source had been indicted, but the indictment said Krebs published  a story on his blog the next day, doubling down on his accusations and  intentionally misleading his readers into believing his earlier reporting  was not sourced by sharp.  So that's, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is like defamation basically, but they're going the key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Correct me if I'm wrong, Jeff and Stacy know the rules, but the key is you have  to show knowledge that it was wrong before you published and you have to have malice.  Okay.  You have to, it has to be intentional.  And that's, so that's why the, the, the lawsuit says, look, he knew  intentionally published it anyway.  Okay.  We'll, we'll see.  I, it's a bad look anytime a company sues a journalist over, uh, stories  that don't make it look good because it makes you look bad.  It's even worse.  It's the Streisand effect.  Yeah.  So anyway, I, I kinda, I'm gonna, I'll have to see more.  I'm gonna, my, my tendency would be to just say Brian did nothing wrong, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  we'll see, just sounds like he reported.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but it sounds like he reported based on a source that he knew was the bad guy.  You would, that would be wrong, right?  Or no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, not necessarily.  I mean, if he's reporting that they're still an issue, I mean, just because the  person, I mean, it's not ideal, like, but if someone called me up and it was like,  I murdered my family, I would still publish a story about them murdering their family.  Is this sort of a cat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is this sort of like Snowden?  Right.  You know, cause a lot of people consider Snowden the government bad guy, but yet  what he reported was stuff that the public needed to know and that  deserved the right to know.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  But his sole source here is the guy, the bad guy.  Maybe Krebs was fooled by that.  Oh, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I really don't know.  We're, we're going to have to wait, I guess.  I don't have enough information.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm not willing to be a pundit that doesn't know on this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can't like, I mean, as a journalist, I'm like, I want to be, I want to be  like, he did nothing wrong, but I also know that this could be confusing.  But I, I don't believe he was malicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Get ready for this baseball opening days tomorrow.  And the major league baseball officials are saying pitchers and catchers can use  a new anti-sign stealing technology during the regular season.  This has historically been a problem.  Catchers would signal to the pitcher using fingers, what pitch to throw.  Now they have a little thing on their wrist.  It looks like a little black barrier calculator that goes to an earpiece  of the pitcher's ear that tells him what pitch to throw.  You watch this video, you could see the catcher is entering in the pitch.  You know what's coming next.  There's no way, no way to steal those signs.  Man in the middle of the tech.  Oh yeah, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what's coming next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What technology is it based on?  It's called PitchCom using a pad with buttons on the wrist of the  gloved handed catcher could signal pitches, type and location of the  pitcher through a listening device.  Up to three teammates of the pitcher and catcher will also have access to the  signals available in Spanish and English, which helps the fielders position.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It can be hacked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dude, these team owners have billions of dollars that they're disposing.  And you got to use encryption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got to use strong encryption.  Just text them.  Just take a phone out of your pocket.  It's kind of like they're texting him.  Yeah.  It's a big problem, sign stealing.  And it is illegal.  No, no, no, no, it's illegal.  No, no, no, no, no.  You shouldn't cheat.  Normally the only person who could see that is the picture.  Unless you've got a guy in the outfield with binoculars or, you  know, a camera trying to steal it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Even a guy in short could potentially see it, but he would have to yell back.  Hey, get ready.  Right.  Right.  Well, he could have his own signal.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm un-American.  Baseball is just the most boring damn sports.  I am so with you, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't agree on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So in the 2017 World Series, the Houston Astros, your team.  Well, your team, you're from Houston.  They're your team, officially your team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You must own them.  They're like the second most hated team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're determined by the baseball commissioner's office to have used a  sign stealing system through the use of a TV monitor set up behind the Astros  dugout.  As a result, general manager and manager of the team were suspended and then fired.  The bench coach was suspended.  So it's a, it's a fairly serious charge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The New York Times had, I think it was New York Times, Washington Post, one of  them had a ridiculous op-ed this week saying baseball is failing and the  government should take baseball over.  What?  Why?  Oh my God.  I, it's, it was absurd.  You know, that's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's crazy talk.  I am very happy to say that the company that owns my radio show is building a  new NFT network for podcasts.  But this is just for you.  I thought you'd be getting your FDMG.  I heart media is pouring several hundred thousand dollars into purchasing the  rights to roughly a dozen NFTs to create a new NFT based podcast network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Have you been saying on your show that NFTs are BS?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You knew that was coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I heart media currently talks to make 10 to 15 investments in crypto punks,  mutant ape yacht club, world of women.  It's eyeing work from emerging NFT creators such as Quirky's,  cryptodes and Lute for adventures.  You know, I remember when they hired somebody who was an expert in this, I  thought, oh, this, this is not going to end well.  But I don't understand how you turn it into a podcast.  Oh, here we go.  Conal Byrne, who is the beloved CEO of I heart media's digital audio group.  That he came to I heart media when they bought how things work, how stuff works.  The idea is to combine IP from the various NFTs it acquires into a  content collection, it will call the non fun squad universe.  Can't wait to join that one.  The non fun squad.  Conal says we can world build for them, creating narratives around them and  bring those stories to life via podcasts.  World build?  No one will listen to the first commercial manifestation of that  universe, a podcast network called the non fun podcast network.  Boy.  With what?  Made up monkeys?  What's it going to be?  The podcast will be hosted by voices that pro portray the NFT characters.  Hi, I'm a podcast host.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know where they're going to go with this, but you knew this was coming.  Oh yeah.  Right.  Totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I heart media has invested, invested aggressively in building out its podcast

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  business.  Yes, I know that we tried to sell to them.  They wouldn't buy us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's spent hundreds of millions of dollars on people other than Twitter.  Acquiring the right to various podcasts.  It's a podcast that's been around for a long time.  It's been around for a long time.  It's been around for a long time.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's been around for a long time.  It's been around for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's been around for a long time.  Right to various podcasts and audio ad tech companies.  In all seriousness, like Spotify, like Amazon, I guess like Apple, YouTube,  Facebook, these companies really want to own podcasting.  So they're spending a lot of money buying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If you just had NFKs Leo, it would be okay.  You'd be snapped up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is really pushing the envelope to pressure test the assumptions we have  around what is IP, what is a host and what is talent, said Conalburn.  What is our company?  What are we doing here?  Am I a host?  No, you are an NFT.  Oh, okay.  Are you talent?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thanks for clearing that up.  Jeez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, wait a minute.  There's more.  Bern says iHeartMedia plans to test five to 10 of its existing podcast shows as IP  for DAOs, a kind of crypto driven community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know.  Ah, so the podcast will be a democracy then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  You can't buy a DAO for this show.  No.  And I wonder why they never bought us.  How about this?  This is all my fault.  This is right up your alley.  This one is interesting.  Street photography.  It's a new book of street photography, but it's not of people.  It's of the screens of their smartphones.  I like this one.  The nun said it's okay.  Here's one.  This is from NYC courtesy of Jeff Murmelstein and Mac, Mac 2020, a fatty tumor.  I'll take him Wednesday when I get home from a run that I have.  Question for you.  I had sausage links in my fridge and the door didn't close all the way Sunday.  So they basically got room temperature by the time I realized to close the door.  If I then close the door and they got cold again, can I cook them for soup or would I  vomit?  You know, this is why it's probably good not to read over people's shoulders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, with street photography, there's a lot of controversy because people are  concerned about their privacy and so forth.  But depending on where you are, you know, a photographer can literally just walk up  and snap your photo.  Ah, but yeah, but this is happening.  You're smart.  How do you define street photography?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Pardon?  How do you define street photography specifically?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anything out in the public, whether it be people, whether it be buildings, anything  out in the public.  OK, but what gets me with this story is it says right there at the top, they took the  photos of these smartphones up close and personal with an iPhone.  I presume with permission.  Right.  So I'm assuming there was permission there, but what if there wasn't?  Can you imagine just walking up to someone and say, hey, I'm a photographer.  I'd like to take pictures of you texting right now of your phone, that is.  I don't know if I could get away with that.  That's a big question of methodology here.  I'm pretty charismatic and charming, but I don't think I could pull that off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to say, though, there is a certain voyeuristic appeal in these pictures.  I can't stop looking at it.  They are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They are good.  That's the thing.  They're great stories when you look at it.  First, you look at this completely out of context.  The text that's on there.  Yeah.  Then you look at the actual device itself.  Yeah.  Then you look at the screens.  Are the screens clean?  Are the screens chippy?  A lot of them are cracks.  Cracks.  Then you look at their hands.  Are they manicured?  Are they female?  I love this, but I'm just bothered by the aspect of someone literally walking up and  just snapping the picture of my phone without my consent.  No, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I had a guy once in Chicago who came running up behind and then he came by and he snapped  up a picture right below my face and then went going.  I pissed was off as hell.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And in a lot of places you can legally do that.  You know, it's totally fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they because they didn't contemplate that you would be holding a phone with all  of your life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Does it say anything about permission in there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All of the photographs themselves taking a very close range with an iPhone, which the  photographer, Jeff Murmelstein, has been shooting with exclusively since 2016 after  decades of using a Leica.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I saw nothing about consent when I read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just you know, you don't have to.  You could do this surreptitiously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dude, those are pretty sleazy.  Those are in focus.  Yeah, those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know.  How could you do that?  Like, is that a reasonable?  How far would you have to be to take a picture like that?  I could get that picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can get that.  OK, standing two feet behind.  Two feet.  Hold up your phone.  Again, that is in focus.  That's the thing.  You know, let me see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to.  So we're two feet away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, I would need to.  I can zoom in, but.  But that takes an effort.  I'm still pretty close.  Yeah, you would know that I'm taking a picture of your shoulder.  I mean, I was able to get that.  So, I mean, I'm able to get.  Stand behind his shoulder.  I mean, I was far enough, but I was able to.  That's pretty much the camera.  Where's the camera?  Where is it over that shoulder here?  I got it, John.  Go ahead and do it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, no, no.  I meant stand literally stand behind and shoulder and see what it looks like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but but this is what I was.  John, what is that?  John, John, push the button.  You had it a second ago.  John's sleepy, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If we're sleepy, John's having fun.  He's like, I got to liven this up.  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can you get this shot over here?  You had it a second ago.  The PTZ.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that was over here.  Wasn't PTZ.  OK, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, anyway, I was suggesting Leo, you stood up so behind and you can.  You can.  It's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's pretty much the same quality as the image on the screen I'm seeing.  So let me do it over his shoulder.  All right.  So two, two feet away, by the way, with my Samsung S 22.  No problem.  I got 10 feet optical zoom.  Oh, fancy.  So it's a little harder with an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, and is there on the street concentrating on sending a message to his mother?  And you walk up behind him.  OK.  And we see an X on the floor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Show the shot.  I'm pretty far behind him.  All right.  You wouldn't.  Would you if I probably if you were if you were doing a text and you weren't really  paying attention, that's pretty good.  That's the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the same quality as you're seeing on the.  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This book.  Oh, boy.  That's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And that's that was a couple of feet back.  So, yeah, I would submit you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought it had been a lot more difficult to get focused that clear.  But well, you got to be as good as I am.  You got to be hell of a street.  If you're a real report, this is no problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Computational photography, especially if it fills in.  That's actually a pretty good picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's pretty good.  I got to say, the other thing is, it's kind of an interesting picture with your hands  and there's a certain feeling to it.  There's an immediacy.  There is a voyeuristic.  So this would be actually not so hard to do with an iPhone and with a with an S 22  would be a lot easier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there's a lot about me just looking at that screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All it says is a VPN is on VPN connected to Los Angeles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's one story.  But then there's my background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Which is looks like fireworks going off after some sort of event.  Can you see that?  Anything else?  There's your fingerprint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Weather.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The weather.  There's your.  I don't know.  There's a lot.  What is the event?  That's Clemson.  Of course.  I see orange.  Of course.  So this is Clemson winning the world, the U S championship two years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that was actually in death Valley.  Oh, okay.  Nevermind.  But it's still, it's a story there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a story.  I guess what I like about that.  This is actually, that's why I like, that's kind of a cool street photography article,  it's a little out of focus because of our camera, not because the shot is out of focus.  Shots actually.  There we go.  Yeah.  Zoom in zoom center.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Your camera is on the other hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mr.  Jamerby's back there.  Hey, let's make another picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A picture of me holding the picture of him holding fingers on fingers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Recursion.  Now that tells a story.  Boy, that is sharp on your fingers there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not hard.  These are good.  These phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We also know that ant has clean fingernails, which is very nice to see.  It's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can see a little bit of blood from when he punched me, but that's okay.  How's that at that workout?  Oh, there's, there's the zoom in.  Yeah.  Honestly, I think those are good images.  What?  You just took a picture of me taking a picture of you.  You didn't know it.  No, that's good.  See, I didn't even notice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Even though.  Yeah.  Even though you have cameras all around.  That is just a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I normally have my head on the swivel when I'm out and about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I, I have very mixed feelings about this.  I think this is, these are great photos.  It's fascinating.  Yes.  And I think it's a total invasion of privacy, but you get the book.  It's hashtag NYC from Jeff Murmelstein published by Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you can always put a, what are those called screen reflector thing on your  phone so people can't see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you could see it, they can see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And again, the photographer's not out of line.  They can clearly do this.  I, I just wouldn't do it.  It tells a story, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's interesting is they made them all blue, which I don't know if I agree with,  but the stylized.  Yeah, it's a style, but I just love to see the broken screens and it totally tells a  story and fingernails.  Yeah.  So this is a great one.  This is hysterical guy sends a text saying this, there isn't much of a future in this  country.  Everybody is stupid, lazy and fat.  The world is leaving us behind.  And the response the guy's typing in is strawberry.  I think that's hysterical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love it.  This is hysterical.  This is a great commentary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love this book, but I'm still a little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So would you buy it and thus support the author and it's a good question.  Privacy invasion techniques.  Well, give the title in case somebody else wants to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I did.  Hashtag NYC published by Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff Murmelstein.  I forget where I found that.  I put that's a really interesting story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We talked about street photography on my show hands on photography with Miss Chris and

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Johnson and she was in New York and she pretty much spoke about that experience of being  in New York.  You can just do that willy nilly even to the point where some of the folks are like,  okay, they're used to photographers walking around.  So maybe that's the case here or they're like, okay, yeah, go ahead.  Just go ahead.  Honestly, if I'm doing this, it doesn't look like I'm taking a picture of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nope.  Sure doesn't.  It looks like I'm looking at my phone.  So what did Bill Cunningham do?  Did he ask people's permission?  Yeah, I think Bill did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Was he just so well known?  Yeah.  And but the other thing is he had a camera.  So his camera, you know, he had a Leica.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it looked like he got it up to your face.  That's a different story.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is really, this is really kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I await the moral panic privacy violation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Presumed privacy and public stories that'll come in the New York Times and the Washington Post.  It's coming.  Oh, no, it's art.  Nobody cares.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And now, ladies and gentlemen, it's time for.  The Google change log.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  We'll make this quick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got a muffin and a cup waiting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google Maps is adding toll road prices, toll road prices, more map to the world.  Apple Watch improvements is more big, big update to Google Maps, especially if you're on iOS.  They announced this yesterday.  A new pin trip widget on your watch.  You could pin a trip.  The option to get directions on Google Maps directly from your Apple Watch.  This is a feature really Apple has owned up to now.  One of the reasons I only reason I use Apple Maps is because I can have directions,  walking directions, my watch or even while I'm driving.  I know I have the map over here, but my watch will buzz at me and I know I'm going to make a turn and stuff.  I love that.  That's a really nice thing to add.  I guess I thought it maybe was Apple keeping him from doing it, but maybe it's just Google didn't get around to it.  You'll also get toll prices for the first time on Google Maps.  That's cool.  The toll prices will be provided by local tolling authorities.  But you can even see, so now instead of just the mileage of a trip, you'll see the cost of a trip, right?  This will be nearly 2000 toll roads in the US, India, Japan and Indonesia.  More countries coming soon.  You'll also see there'll be features that will make it less stressful to drive on unfamiliar roads.  They're going to add traffic lights, stop signs, building outlines, areas of interest.  So more details as you're driving down the road to help you kind of understand that this, yeah, that's where I am.  I see that new iOS updates to make it easier to use maps on the go.  I mentioned the pins trip widget so you can pin your trips into your go tab right from the iOS home stream screen.  You'll see your arrival time, the next departure for your transit trip and suggested route if you're driving.  Oh, I see this is for the widgets on the smartphone, the iPhone.  I get it like that.  Oh, that's nice.  So now you can have a widget for school, going to school.  Nice improvements.  Google has Google Maps.  You know, it's nice to see them putting some effort into it.  And Google Docs now.  I know you've been waiting for this.  Can have emoji reactions right there in the Google Doc.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can you see editors with this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Someone I knew was so excited by this.  What are you doing in Google Docs that you're like, yes, emoji reactions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, I just added color emojis to my Emacs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So there I can use it for my students now.  Yeah.  When I do their stories.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, that's true because they think good grammar sometimes is aggressively angry.  Right.  So now you can put periods in, but you can also put a smiley face.  Happy face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Happy face.  Remember, Google was going to cut off legacy G Suite users and make them pay.  Google is going to put that off.  And there'll also be a waiting list, a no cost waiting list.  So Google announced in January G Suite legacy free edition accounts  will have to start paying this year, but that's going to be slightly delayed.  You will have until May 1st to select a new workspace plan.  That's not going to go for very long.  Yeah.  Well, if you don't, billing won't start until July 1st.  After that, your Google Workspace subscription will be suspended until you set up billing.  So you have in a way until July, right?  It was June.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not a big difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay.  That's my fault.  I put that in there.  That's not worth it.  That's not up to the standards of change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google said it would offer a no cost transfer option that moves users to a free Gmail account.  So that's good.  Nice.  That's good.  They were talking about it last night and all about Android.  Pixel 6 April update is out fixes some camera problems on the Pixel 6.  Wireless charging issues.  If you've got a Pixel 6 phone, update it now.  Got mine yesterday.  Woohoo.  Google Translate can now auto switch Gboard to the appropriate language.  So you can type back in that language.  And Google hardware gets unified security reward program.  That's for Pixel Nest and Fitbit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's like a bug, a bug bounty.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They've always had a bug bounty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Now brings Nest and Fitbit into the fold with Pixel.  So I guess they didn't have it for Nest and Fitbit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They had a bug bounty program for Nest devices, but I guess now it's just the same program.  Maybe it's a different one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe they're all united now into the Android and Google devices security reward program.  Anyway, these are good things.  This is something that keeps us all safe.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Moving right along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And if Wyze had had this, maybe they wouldn't have been three years.  Three daggum years.  We had an insecure camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We talked about this on the show and I have a question about that.  So I know that people are outraged over this, but the exploit required you to be on the person's  actual Wyze high network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's what I thought.  And that's what Wyze said.  But I asked Steve Gibson this and he said no.  Oh.  So all I know is...  Say more things.  Like .8080, right?  It's not clear.  It's not clear.  Steve understands this better than I do.  I think what happened, I'm guessing what happened is the initial exploit was in fact  open to any and then they made some slight changes that made it that you would have to  be on the network.  But Steve said no, it could be launched from the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Originally?  Or if they changed that, they didn't fix the...  I'm unclear.  Okay.  Because this was...  So The Verge wrote a story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wyze rebutted and The Verge had an update that said, oh yeah, but I'm still upset about  it.  But yeah, it had to be remote.  But I think that may not be the case.  I think Wyze may not be completely clear about this.  So as I said, I asked Steve and he said, no, you do not have to be on the victim's network.  Which is bad enough.  That means you could have an evil maid attack or somebody could sit on your curb on your  Wi-Fi.  But it does mean it's not as bad as it sounds.  Somebody would have to connect to your home Wi-Fi.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and there were...  I mean, we had the...  What are those called?  The Wi-Mo devices for years had...  Was it a security flaw or was it their design?  I mean, they argued that it was their design that did this.  But if you were on the person's Wi-Fi network and had the app open, you could actually control  their devices.  And that was by design.  So I kind of looked at Wyze treating this kind of like that because that's what it sounded  like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And in fact, in an update to his article, I'm done with Wyze.  Sean Hollister quotes Bitdefender saying that it is unlikely that somebody outside your  network could get it.  The remote from outside the network attack requires an initial camera ID that can only  be acquired if present on the same network as the device.  It's completely random and a non-predictable string.  It's kind of like a really good password.  It's random.  So somebody would have to get on your Wi-Fi, get the token, and then later, now that you've  got the token, you can go.  So you can drive off with the token in hand and then get it to your camera after that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, but that assumes they had access to your network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They would have.  According to Bitdefender, that's the case.  Okay.  That's not as bad.  Right.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's possible, but that's a pretty targeted attack.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right.  So maybe I should have gotten Steve to clarify.  Sorry, you were actually talking about something totally different, but it was a tangential

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  that I was wanting to explore.  No, we hadn't really talked about it.  This broke literally a minute or two after we ended the show last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we hadn't talked about it on the show yet, and I think it's an important thing to talk  about.  In my mind, there's two questions.  Why did Bitdefender sit on it for three years?  Because they knew about it.  And normally, in responsible disclosure, you tell a company, look, you're going to have  to get a new one.  In responsible disclosure, you tell a company, look, you're going to get three months to  fix this.  And after that, we're going to tell the world.  Bitdefender apparently was told by Wise, we can't fix it.  Wise says there's not enough memory in the camera for us to patch it.  And Bitdefender decided, well, since it's unfixable, we won't force them to disclose.  And obviously, because as soon as you disclose, you're telling hackers how to do it, in effect.  So everybody decided, well, since it's an unfixable thing, we'll just be mum about it.  Nevertheless, Wise continued to sell those cameras.  Sure did.  For three years, they shouldn't have.  In my opinion, if they can't fix it, they should have told everybody of the flaw and  said, we'll give you a discount on another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It doesn't really design the things themselves.  They just buy them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's a Chinese camera.  Wise does do the software, though, so they are responsible for the flaw.  The other problem is it's a $20 camera.  So what do you expect?  Yeah.  And Wise probably could not easily afford to replace those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's the Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a good point.  Thank you.  We left that hanging, didn't we?  It's like a hanging participle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know if there was more in the Google change.  I was apologizing.  We were done.  I was like, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, we were done.  I thought the brakes on the train just went...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I really have to quiz Steve then more.  It may be that he, when he said, no, you don't have to be local, he meant after you get the key.  But he was, my sense is he was of the impression that you were vulnerable  even if the hacker was not on your curb, which would be a very different issue.  Yeah, I thought I heard something like it was someone trying to go after an FTP server

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  pretty much the same way.  Right.  And it was open.  So the main points still stand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was a security flaw.  Wise knew about it.  Bitdefender knew about it.  Both conspired not to tell anybody about it for three years.  Wise really didn't want to tell anybody about it.  Three years.  Wise replaced the camera in January without saying much about it.  This is the message they sent out.  Hey, friends, it's a new year and it comes with some important updates.  Protecting you and your security is always top of mind for us to do that.  We need you to update your Wise app to at least 2.27 and update your WiseCam firmware.  And for those of you with WiseCam version one, they didn't say anything about that.  Burn it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, they've been waiting for version one to go.  I mean, they update these things every few years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They can now, by the way, they can now update the firmware.  So Wise says these vulnerabilities require some form of local network access.  So you would have either had to open your network.  Maybe that's what Steve was talking about.  If you put your cameras on the internet, then somebody could attack you.  But you'd have to put your cameras on the internet.  Most people have their cameras inside a firewall.  Right.  And let the Wise software share it.  Hopefully.  Yeah.  Despite extensive efforts stretching into 2022, we found that WiseCam v1, again, this is Wise talking,  last sold in March 2018, could not support the necessary security updates.  The limited camera memory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So they didn't keep selling it then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They stopped selling it in March 2018.  That's right.  But still, there were a lot of people, including me, that had v1s.  Yeah.  That's why they created the WiseCam 2, because we couldn't patch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We were transparent with our customers and disclosed our inability to continue to offer  the necessary security updates in an email announcing the end of life for this product.  So they said, we can't update it.  What they neglected to say is, even though there's a serious flaw,  for security reasons, we again chose to remain prudent about the specific reason why until now  to limit the risk to all of our affected users across the affected models.  Does that limit the risk?  That's the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, what might be more interesting is if you're on that version 1, you can't actually  subscribe to any of their subscription services.  So maybe they were just trying to push people from using those cameras anymore.  Right.  If I'm being my most cynical self.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it isn't as bad as we initially thought.  I think that's correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay.  All right.  Carry on, my friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Carry on.  Well, I'll tell you what we're going to do right now.  We're going to take a little break.  There is much more to talk about, but we just have run out of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  More steam.  I feel like we're all a little laggy today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Y'all are.  Not me.  I'm good.  Oh, I feel good too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I just did a hundred pushups before the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  Let's take a break.  And when we come back, picks of the week.  And you shamed me into having one this week.  So there, it's all your fault.

We started with them.  We were just audio.  I remember when we started video and we had this confab saying, should we tell Cashfly?  At the time, when we first started, we were spreading out our bandwidth all over the place.  We're asking people to use BitTorrent.  Cashfly saved our bacon.  But here they were hosting our audio.  And now we're going to host video.  But you know what?  They're great.  We put the video on.  We greatly increased the amount of data we sent through the Cashfly networks to petabytes a month  without a squeak, without a whimper, with nary a quail or a qualm.  They have been fantastic.  And now Cashfly is offering ultra low latency video streaming.

We really appreciate it.  Time for Stacey's thing of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay.  It hasn't arrived yet, so I can't show it to you, but  I just purchased something called the Turtle.  T-E-R-T-I-L-L.  It is by the CEO of the company is the former co-founder of iRobot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  Let me guess.  Is it a garden tilling robot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is a weeding robot.  Weeding?  It's a solar powered Roomba looking robot that weeds your garden.  With laser?  Please tell me it's laser.  It is not laser.  So each of those wheels has...  Oh, this is fantastic.  It's $349.  There are some limits to know.  So this is not for...  This is for someone who likes to play with things, and they know that.  It's got the sensors on it so it won't bump into things.  Basically, the wheels on it disrupt the soil enough  that it's going to prevent the weeds from popping up.  If they do pop up, it has a little...  It looks like the Roomba little spinner thing.  It's a weed whacker and it just chops down the weeds.  It avoids things that are over four inches high.  So if you've got seedlings, you're supposed to put physical wire barriers that come in,  that they have that come with it, or you can build your own.  So it'll bounce right off of those.  And anything taller...  So if you've got weeds that are four inches or more high,  you need to pluck those and then let this live.  It only weeds for about two hours a day.  Oh, here's the little weed whacker thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Little is right. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it looks like it has solar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It does. So it's solar operated.  So it basically lives outside.  It runs, it whacks, and then it goes and hangs out and charges for a minute.  So it only can do 200 square feet, which is kind of a small amount.  It's so cute.  So there are lots of caveats here, but it's adorable and I can't wait for mine to arrive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like it's kind of a little bit like a toy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is, but so back when Roombas first launched, they were also kind of like toys.  So to me, this is like a pretty...  What is the one that gets me in the early folks?  Yeah. Well, I feel like it's my job to do that.  And if you have, if this is of interest to you,  it's probably something that you might like to play with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What kind of garden will you be turtilling?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I have a raised bed herb garden that I also plant my tomatoes and stuff in.  So I'll put it in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, perfect.  It's pretty cool seeing the little weed whacker on the bottom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's cute, isn't it?  I know, isn't it so cute?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's pretty little.  I mean, our weeds, it's not going to do much with, but...  Well, you have to weed one more time before you put it in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then it'll prevent them from popping up.  And if they do pop up, it'll whack them.  And it'll just keep running throughout the season.  And so the idea is you won't have to weed again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, do one last flush and clean, if you will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Proven as effective as hand weeding by the Cornell School of Architecture.  There is an endorsement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wow.  The School of Architecture or Agriculture?  Well, that's the problem I was going to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's Agriculture. I got it wrong.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was like, great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Approved for use and weeding by the military cadets at West Point.  At West Point.  Tur-til, T-E-R-T-I-L-L, like...  It's pronounced turtle.  It's got a little turtle logo.  And it looks like a little green turtle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It looks like a turtle.  It looks like a rumba, a green rumba, based on the solar panels on top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apparently it fertilizes as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, that is a separate product that they have.  And this is actually really useful if you're into that sort of thing.  You can send them a soil test.  They'll send you back an appropriate fertilizer for your particular...  Completely unrelated in effect.  Oh, that's interesting.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Turtle weeding robots and soil testers.  And now it's time for Jeff Jarvis' number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I'm going to do something special in a second,  but first with a little late breaking number here.  So Washington Post reports that Elon Musk was 11 days late,  publicly declaring that he'd amassed more than 5% as is required by law.  And as Stacey said before, he doesn't much care.  So he was able to continue buying stock from 5% up to 9.2%  at $39 a share versus the $50 a share that came out when the news came out.  Meaning that he made just from that delta there, $156 million.  So who else got paid at the SEC?  See, this man is dodgy.  You know, we got to kick off the board for this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why isn't the SEC fining this fella?  Somebody getting paid.  So the law, which by the way is an old law,  requires that as soon as you go over 5% stake in a company, you have to notify.  March 15th he reached that, but he only made the public disclosure on Monday.  Well, that seems like a big deal.  That is an SEC violation.  Especially since you could see how he made money because of it.  Yes. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  On a lighter note.  I bet nothing happened.  Leo, don't, I'm going to go to pictures here,  but don't show the last picture until I come to the end of this fascinating story.  Okay.  But while you guys were off, you know, taking time off, leaving the show, Leo and me here alone,  you know, trying to do our-  I was at a tiny machine learning conference.  I went out, I went out and I decided to do a reporting trip for the sake of the show.  Oh, good man.  I said I'm going to go in.  Some enterprise journalism happening right here.  Exactly.  Exactly. I read a story and I found out it was this thing that was technology based,  was nearby in Jersey City.  I left Manhattan, I drove to Jersey City, I went to look at it.  There is a Robo burger maker, a burger vending machine.  Stay on, stay on this picture for a second.  Oh boy.  And so you see this box here and you can put in the money and decide your condiments  and get your- you're the next one now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One more.  I got to give you a clicker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here's their story.  It's based in Jersey City.  The founders did this.  I thought this is wonderful.  I'm going to go because I want to do a video of this for the sake of the show.  So I go and I try to find it.  It's in the food court.  No, it's not in the food court.  So I asked the nice guy, one of the things, not selling burgers himself,  selling something else.  Can you tell me what this Robo burger thing is?  He said, well, yeah, on the record, it's over there.  Off the record, it sucks.  They've been working for 16 years on this.  15 minutes.  And you go over there right over there to the BK, the dollar menu, it's better.  But I said, no, for the sake of the show, I'm going to sacrifice my stomach.  I'm going to go.  So I go over and I find the machine.  Now the third picture.  It's closed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It looks like it's got Billie Eilish's head though, which is interesting.  I know.  It's only open to 3 PM.  Oh, it only works 11 AM to 3 PM.  Monday to Saturday.  There's a guy in there.  Obviously, there's a person inside the robot.  That's so obvious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ground meat is pretty persnickety.  So maybe it's a food safety.  I assume it's a food safety.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, you're so nice, Stacy.  You're just too nice.  Oh, I have a friend who literally all...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know, but once you start touching it to other things,  unless the whole thing is refrigerated to a certain level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think somebody has to come out like a McFlurry machine and adjust and tweak it  and clean it every day?  Otherwise...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I tried, guys.  I tried to go report on the Robo Burger for the show because I knew it would be...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I want you to go back Monday through Saturday, 11 AM to 3 PM.  I've done my thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So one of my good friends actually covers food robots.  He's familiar with this.  So if you have questions, Jeff, I can give you his information and he will tell you.  Does he know about salad bot?  He does.  He knows about all the bots.  All the bots.  Ramen bots, pizza bots, all kinds of bots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, that's quite fair.  I used to go in San Francisco.  I loved when I lived there.  I would go to Moscone.  It's not about Moscone.  I said before that it was the Civic Center.  And they'd have all these industrial shows.  And my favorite was the food industry show.  And I'd go find things like sausage extruders and all this great stuff.  I love food technology.  It's wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, let's take a look at the video of the Robo Burger when it is at work.  I just want to point out it's big enough to hold a human.  I'm just going to say...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, just say it.  Just say it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Robo Burger is a...  See how big that is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Took it easily.  Look, he's going in.  He's going in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Refrigerator.  All in just a 12 square foot format.  Now you can get a freshly grilled burger.  Somebody wasted a lot of money.  In less than six minutes.  They're six minutes?  The guy said it was 15 minutes.  Seven ninety five.  Similar to what chefs use in a restaurant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The bread looks good.  Oh, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a human in there.  Why did they choose this narration voice?  This is the worst.  Because it's an April Fools joke.  That was like American Wagyu.  It's an April Fools joke.  I honestly think so.  I'm going to say that again.  This is so good.  I'm going to say that again.  This is so good.  This is so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm going to say that again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is so good.  This is so good.  This is so good.  April Fools joke.  I honestly think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now everyone can have a delicious, freshly cooked, restaurant quality meal.  That's not a restaurant.  Where's the lettuce?  Tomato?  Onions?  Hospital waiting rooms.  Or at 1 a.m. in the airport.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, not at 1 a.m.  Because the damn thing closes.  The vending machine closes at beverages more conveniently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The ATM.  Money on the go.  And now.  Robo Burger brings us access to hot and fresh food.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They need a Rody Maddock right next to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Anytime.  Anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or the taco truck with the taco stick.  Oh yeah.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Whatever happened to the taco truck on every corner?  I'm mad we don't have that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's what we got now is Robo Burger, son.  Well, I tried, guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I tried.  Wow.  Okay.  Surprised you with a nice video.  I thought you had a little hilarity and then nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was excited, but no.  Nope.  I want to show you real quickly, and we were talking about Twitter earlier,  and you know I'm not a huge Twitter fan.  You?  No.  But there is a new Twitter thing.  It's going to be a buck a month.  You can try it free for the first month.  Bare Tweets.  B-A-R-E dot T-W.  The idea is it doesn't have pictures.  It doesn't have...  It's just any tweet with a lot of text.  No media, no URLs, no social media engagement.  The boring stuff.  It's just the boring stuff.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually, it is just the boring stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Point taken, sir.  All right.  Thank you.  Who wants to read?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, this sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is this from the same guys who brought us the Robo Burger?  God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I really thought this was going to be a good pick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's so boring.  Horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I'm glad I had a good pick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're terminal.  It's been a good pick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You did, Stacy.  Yes, you did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just a lot of Bernie Sanders tweets, basically.  Okay, what do you got, Ant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Not going to be hard to follow that, in fact, Ant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, go on, Ant.  You'll do great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Twitter, just the bad parts.  Oh, just the boring parts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Holy cow.  That is so bad.  My pick.  I'll try to do these quickly.  The first one is a book.  A guy I know who knows the author that wrote this book, Little Steve.  And I quizzed him on it.  I was like, look, it's cool that people are writing books about  Steve Jobs and his journey and whatnot and trying to teach kids about  the beginning of personal computing.  But hey, is Wise mentioning this?  And he was like, yeah, I totally get that.  So there is another book coming out on the same aspect of this Little Steve  that's going to be dedicated to Steve Wozniak as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Little Steve didn't like to play ball.  Instead, he invented big and small.  Read along and you'll surely see how the Apple Company came to be.  The story of the Mac, iPad, and iPhone reimagined for kids to bring into your home.  Entrepreneurship is quite a big word, but with the Little Founders series,  it will surely be heard.  Such a great narrator.  They should have given this to Elizabeth Holmes.  Such a great name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Little Steve.  That's Little Steve and then a Wozniak version is coming soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it sounds like they're going to do a lot of entrepreneurs.  It's a series of Little Founders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Next up, we have Freedom LUTs.  If you watched hands-on photography last week where I was talking about shooting in Log,  L-O-G, that is a flat profile when you're shooting video.  And you need to apply a lookup table, L-U-T, LUT,  to help bring that image back to life based on the data that's provided.  Well, Skylum, as we've mentioned previously on the show, is in Ukraine.  And they make a great piece of software called Luminar for photography.  And they are selling LUTs to help support them over there during this time,  as well as offer up some support for some of the charities and things over there.  And I think they start at $30.  This is really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So these are essentially filters you can apply to your photos based on cities in Ukraine,  which is there's a Mariupol Odessa, Kyiv, Sumy.  That's really neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's pretty cool.  And it's in this photos or video you can apply it to.  And today, Platypod, I just saw this this morning because I use a Platypod.  They announced a new Platypod and it's already a diagram success on Kickstarter.  So I use one to help get shots in the landscape that's really, really low  and keep the camera steady.  Or heck, I've hung it up on a tree a time or three to get some photographs.  But now they added some extra tools with it to make it a little bit more convenient  and more portable.  And heck, they've already fulfilled their Kickstarter.  So it's a tripod for the ground.  For the ground.  Or if you want to do like I've put my camera in the refrigerator  and set it on a tripod where it looks like I'm opening the refrigerator  and you see me, you know, just creative uses for it.  Cool.  The Platypod.  The Platypod.  And lastly, this comes from the show.  I don't remember having this conversation, but apparently you and I did.  You and I did.  We did?  I guess you were looking at some shoes and I said, do they have a size 14?  And apparently they did.  And they sent me a size 14.  What?  Yeah, it was so nice.  What?  I was like, I don't remember this conversation, but thanks.  Adams Sneakers.  So Adams, thank you so much.  And I did a little photo of the shoes since they were kind enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But yeah.  Adams, A-T-O-M-S dot com.  So it's just like a little tiny, you know, mom and pop sneaker maker.  Kind of.  Do you like them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they're pretty nice.  They're actually really nice.  They're really nice for me.  I'll say that because I'm not that style.  That is really.  I set up a little photo in the garage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, they're really, they're kind of, they're not like athletic shoes.  They're like casual shoes.  Casual lounge.  Yeah, they look good.  They look really comfy.  And they have them in your size.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they have a size 14.  They feel good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is this your shoot?  Yep.  That's what I.  Oh, wow.  They deserve that.  You should send that.  That's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do you get it to fly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's called fishing line.  Really cool.  I tied it to fish and line onto a sea stand and I stuck a light behind it and just played  around with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you ever done a hands-on photography and product shots?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We will soon.  I hope you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You've done.  You've done gadget shots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've done.  I did food and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I swear you did.  I watched your thing about shooting.  Yes.  That is so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, thank you, Adams.  Yeah, thank you, Adams.  Appreciate it.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A-T-O-M-S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I told him, let me know if they want to do something because I know a model that are  really also known as hard heads that would really help those shoes.  Because he likes to model.  He's all into fashion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They need you to give them some product shots is what they need to do.  That is really neat.  Oh, good job.  They're from Brooklyn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And when I dug into them a little more, they support creative artists.  They've been trying to do a lot for helping out other creators across the industry.  Neat.  Good stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good pick.  Did I show you the only the good tweets thing?  Oh, yeah, I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay.  It's time to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Boring tweets.  Only a dollar a month for just the boring tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think I'll just keep my Twitter blue and leave it as it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's Twitter blue and Twitter bore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Twitter bore.  It's bare, but it's pretty boring.  They call it zen-like, but I guess that means you're sleeping or something.  I don't know.  Stacey Higginbotham, stacey on iot.com.

Transcript:  It's Termination Shock by Neal Stephenson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I love Neal Stephenson, but I haven't read that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I've already started it.  Yeah, you're going to need the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's not too late if you want to stack it in favor of the shorter story.  You can help add out by going...  It's not going to happen.  It's for club members.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think Termination Shock was all of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, why did you put it on the list?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because I wanted to give everybody was so excited about...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jammer B, you were talking about...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Cryptonomicon was a terrible book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
