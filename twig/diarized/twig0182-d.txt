Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  News we did we did we knew okay new

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google did alright not as well as Apple  But they they did eight dollars and sixty two cents a share in the fourth quarter  2.8 nine billion dollars  in  In is that revenue or profit no that's in profit  Compared to 2.71 billion in profit in the year to date a year ago  but that  That's on revenue of eleven point three four billion dollars, so that's you know  They don't have the same revenue, and they don't have the same profit  They don't have the same profit margin as Apple  Shares up five percent and after hours trading to  $736 and 40 cents

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you can see they were trying to avoid what we were just talking about with Apple you missed by even a little right  You know the street penalizes you because they had X estimates, so they were guiding them

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

I guess you have to  Or you want to yeah Apple had a great quarter the record revenue record profits and and after hours trading of the stock is down  considerably  Because it has cooties they missed there the analysts estimate by a couple hundred million

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  John Schwartz in the USA Today does point out one thing that could be a cause for concern the  Click rev click price cost per click dipped 6% and has it now it's fifth straight  Fall and cost per click prices. That's of course how Google makes money and for the most part is through ad clicks  So their ads aren't as valuable as they used to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's the same with everybody that's because a mobile right  Yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know he was the typical CEO thing where he talked about all of Google's you know  Successes over the past year he talked about knowledge graph  he talked about  Chrome and he talked about focus right about Google has to pick the products that they really have to focus on and  He also and I really like this he talked about sort of how we're all living this like  Multiscreen life right now and that this is kind of uncharted territory  I think he called it how we all have a phone and a tablet and a laptop and I assume he didn't say this  But I assume it you know we're all gonna have glasses soon, too  right and we have to make experiences that are that that that sink across those things and  And it work well sort of the multi the multi screen life. He talked about it's a multi screen life for us

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  multi screen life for us

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He talked about how there's a lot of room for innovation with these screens like how that you know we drop our phones  they shouldn't crack in half and  A lot easier to have these small devices easy, you know they're all work walking around with supercomputers in our pockets, and there are a lot of  innovations opportunities in that and absolutely agree right mobiles mobiles a big thing wasn't anything too  Crazy like a talk almost yeah, I mean that's was it that's his that's his job  Isn't it right to talk about how great the past year was your leaning and cheerleader? Yeah?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Although I think the analysts are pretty smart. I would think that they would want to hear open and frank  Conversations about challenges and things like that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean he's  He said biggest challenges focus right that Google has to put its energies in the right places

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then I don't know do we agree with that right that's been his big message more wood behind fewer arrows  focusing paring down

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yep, he did say that they have some supply chain issues that they have to work out  The Nexus and he was referring to that the Nexus line how it's impossible to get  the Nexus 4 or the Nexus 10 at this point and  So that was that was a little bit of an admission  Clearly there's work to be done managing our supply better as well as building a great customer experience  And that is a priority for the team so okay good to hear that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, that's that's kind of the real issues is they underestimate  Estimated and by the way LG said it's not our fault. It's Google's fault

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They told us how many to make each other in a way pardon me. They both seem to be blaming each other  I mean Google seems to be saying it's LG  LG's saying it's Google. I guess that always happens

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I would think that LG has the capacity to manufacture enough Nexus 4s that it really comes down to  What it's Google say, yeah, yeah, yeah, right  Maybe they just underestimated yeah, that's what happened is Google. I mean you it's a you can't blame them  That's it there. This is not their business hardware is not their business

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's definitely better to underestimate than over. Yeah, you don't want to make too many

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is what this is what he said about the multi-screen opportunities. He said think about your device battery life is a huge issue  He shouldn't have to worry about constantly recharging your phone when you drop your phone. It shouldn't go splat  Everything should be a ton faster and easier. There's real potential event new and better experiences  So he might be talking about glass there. Maybe just talking about you know, Motorola and what what maybe they can do there  We were talking about all about Android all about Android yesterday  The rumors about the the Motorola Google the Google Rola X phone that may be I don't know the Google I o giveaway this year  That'll be interesting  But yeah, the rest of this just really did kind of seem like cheerleading and nothing nothing really new

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Interesting though when you it sounds like he's taking a little bit of a pot shot at Apple  When he says about the breaking although Android phones break too, but it sounds like he's really aiming it at Apple. I  Don't know why he would even need to do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know. I mean I buy double batteries for my Android phones. Yeah, that's yeah, that's what are the chief advantages, isn't it?  Yeah, yeah, but but the fact is that you know his nerds were like well we can change out the battery  But you know his point is like you shouldn't have to recharge your you know  Recharging shouldn't be such a such a pain again with you know, right?  It's a stopgap solution just having a second battery, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hmm we're still trying to get Jeff Jeff back I blame Bill Gross  Did you see that before we started Jeff showed us the pile of  Wild wires. It was not did not look sensible  Look safe.

What do you hear Jeff? What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm back. I think it really does affect it. In fact, I you know, I was talking to somebody from Google today  I've been talking to some publishers  I think the exchange of value that should occur with Google is about data about the readers who come to them and  If there's something shut it off it cuts off another part of the negotiations that we'll see later in the list  Means that  Google's kind of trapped in dealing with publishers in Europe

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the way, I just bought three of those beanies  They come from the UK though, I'm never gonna get them  You did find them. Yeah, they come from the UK on this Google Store.

There it is that looks like yours doesn't it it's got the eyes  How come Sergey wasn't wearing one? Yeah now that's how you get anonymous on a train.

Oh boy  Anyway continue on change the law continued part two use Google Maps Street View now includes Israel

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So lots of new pictures of Israel and I would list all the cities where there are pictures available  But I don't want to I don't want to totally mangle the names  but go over to Israel and Google Maps and check out Street View lots of new imagery there and  Finally Google's integrating Google Plus profiles into its company jobs board  So just got named best company to work for in the US fortune magazine fourth year in a row if you want to work  At Google go to jobs Google com and if you're signed into your Google Plus account or your Google account  It will prompt you big blue bar right across the top of the screen  Hey, do you want to connect your Google Plus profile if you say yes?

Transcript:  But I give it I can't handle away  There's  A picture of it. Oh no here comes. Oh my god. I guess the FT's behind a paywall  Yeah, how would you like to give us some money before you read this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's two different things the cookie policy is you okay you EU regulation requiring you to sign off that it's okay to have these evil things  Called cookies sent to you the paywalls a different matter

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm agreeing that the they're they're allowed to see the  Pieces of text that a browser puts on your hard drive at every website shocking shocking  I'm consenting to the act of browsing

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You are leaking information, but this is what happens. This is what happens if you don't pay the paywall  Yeah, I get a flesh-colored box

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, you must have reached the limit because I was able to oh really there's a limit

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Times does it's totally if you've registered you have to actually register. I'm not registered. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have it either. So that's what I get. So thank you Financial Times for that useless article  We were talking a little bit about this on the security now Google has declared war on the password

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, what did Steve have to say about this? This is kind of interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's excited because one of the devices  That they're talking about that they're testing is something that he has been a fan of and  For a long time the Yubico YubiKey. Have you seen that? I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Have not played with it myself. But yeah, I've kind of I've heard about this

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We've had Stina the design the founder of a Yubico on the show several times  It's a little USB device now the current YubiKey. That's about the size of it as the image  I'm showing right now  The current YubiKey is is a very odd device because when you plug it into the USB port  It doesn't it appears as a keyboard because all computers understand keyboards and it types a long  Password like really long like I don't know  so wow, I know it's very odd so if you if you have a  Text editor up it will actually just type your password in the clear. That's not what you want  That's not what they're talking about with the Google idea  But the Google idea is there would be a redesigned Yubico that Chrome  Would be aware of and it could be this on a keychain  it could be a literally could be a ring they're talking about a ring on your finger and  Then if you're using this new Chrome, that's all you need and it's kind of a frictionless login

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I really like this idea of an object being the thing that lets me in, you know, like like the two step off  You know you having your well, I'd want it to be I'd still want to be two-step, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You still want a password because otherwise somebody steals your ring. You're you know, right? Yeah, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right exactly right because the concept of a key like your car key is useless to someone if they don't know which car is yours  Right, but if everyone has a Google Chrome  ring  Right, you just have to pick up steal someone's and plug it in. You know what it is, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, but the thing I like about the phone is you know, I always have my phone  Yeah, yeah, you know they need to send me a code they just send it to the phone right

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google Google is  It is not a one-time password  SJF and in the chat room. It is a the same one each time you plug it in  There's no there's no smarts in the Yuba key. It's it's  Boom, that's it  However, the authenticator is a one-time password. I think that's a good solution for second factor authentication  but as we know the Google two-step authentication only the  Authenticator only works when you're logging into Google if you're giving others access to your Google account  You have to use a much less secure generated  second step password

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, why why not eye scans or fingerprints?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How come that's never really expensive too expensive yeah too expensive to do to do well anyway  I mean we have had fingerprints for a long time, but they're pretty it's pretty bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well if I always figure that it's guy I can't imagine it's not gonna screw up  You know misread the figure well look at every time you got a barcode the misreads or a QR code the mystery the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Fingerprints a complicated finger read I I'm sorry the Yuba key does in fact do one time as well as a fixed password  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'd just be afraid of losing it. I mean a tiny little dongle  I was just talking about their Fitbit and how they've bought three of them because they keep losing them because they're so small right

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  These are really small

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, my Fitbit just disintegrated last week. I was I was so proud that I had had it for so long and  The Fitbit is tough because it's kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's so small. That's why you'll see security jewelry right you'll see security jewelry  I love the ring and then we'll have my obvious story the ring you're in idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're cut off or a no or or you where is necklace could the ring use I guess the ring could use NFC

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The nice hotel where Bill Gross stayed in Munich my room here those of you who are on the show now don't understand  I'll explain later  It's an NFC key room key that also the elevator gets really else what cool he he walked away  With it that's descended back, but we won't tell on him

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He walked away with your bandwidth to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's got the key  The game I just won't move this time because it'll take the image will get all confused

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, what if you had you know, we just mentioned Fitbit's what if you had what if Nike fuel band?  Had the ability to log you into things go chunk

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah  I think that's where we need to go. I do think it has to be two-factor though. I think it shouldn't be just that's the whole thing  Yeah, what's that? You're showing us?  That's the key for this by a Rischer Hoff. Oh, wow that that Bill Gross dick  He stole but it's NFC. It's NFC. Well, those are cheap to replace  Both both Google with its authenticator and Facebook now have  Basebooks app has a built-in authenticator Blizzard uses an authenticator. I guess I think these are getting more and more common  I wish everybody just used Google last pass uses Google's authenticator as long as well as Google  So I just run that on my phone and it gives me a one-time key. I  love that  But you'd have the same problem you have with two-step authentication that only Google products would be you know key aware  Yeah, so you'd still have to you know, there's still be that hole and by the way  You know, they always use Matt Honan as the example, but he got hacked by social engineering, right?  It was social hacking you can he could have the best password and all two-step authentication he wanted  But he just called Apple and said I don't know my password and they said well, let's send you a new one  I guess if he had two step that would if Apple had two step that would have worked  Except that you could always on all of these you could say oh, I lost my key, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's yeah that was at the time  Was Apple or Amazon that the bug or the problem was with the basic started with it was both

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What was both because they went to Amazon first thing they do is a who is to get your docs, right?  Now they have your address  So then they go to Amazon and they add a new credit card  Which you don't have to do any verification to do and by doing so and it doesn't have to even be a real credit card  Get they get the last four digits of your credit card and your address now  And by the way, these holes have supposedly been patched now and by the way  It's no passwords yet  Now they go to Apple and say I forgot the security questions  But here's the last four digits of my credit card and my street address and Apple said oh no problem  We'll just reset your password there for you, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean that was a question of what secondary information do you use to verify somebody when they've forgotten their password, right?  Two different companies use two different

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was that was awful. I was I didn't use anything. They just you just add a path you they don't even verify it  Good you want to add another credit card. We're glad to take it right there like right we'll take your payment right exactly  It's really apples. The hole was an apple and they say they're not doing that anymore  So I believe them  1998 this is somebody just sent me a link in the chair my love this  This is from the Java one conference in 1998 a Java ring  That contained an i-button chip with a Java virtual machine that could act as a token for access control  e-cash data logging  This is from this is from 1998 to 14 years ago. They had this  That's cool. So I guess this is there's nothing new under the Sun. Yeah, there's nothing

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, right. What's it gonna take for people to actually start using?  Sadly password. That's the question  It's it's Java your fingers gonna fall off

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In case I go away. All right, so for the davos report, I needed to do this of course since  I wear my davos hat. I wear that. I can't wait to get my hat  I have my my davos badge here the official davos badge, but I shouldn't the video because it messes the bandwidth up  Uh, i'll stop moving now. Uh, it's i've been here since um, uh, uh, when we were here yesterday last night  Went to the tech pioneers dinner, which is an amazing thing to go to because they really do bring in technology pioneers people who are growing  Leafy green vegetables in car sized warehouses with no light and hardly any water  uh people who are putting flexible  chips into things that uh  affect your heart  Uh people who just are doing amazing things all around and so that's what that was does is brings those people in  Um today I had I had to do two events. So I don't really have a lot to report here. I think that  I went to a uh  Social session this morning where i'll take the hat off now  Where uh, you know what was interested me was we had people from  um, uh excel and uh  MIT and a chinese journalist and uh, ushihide  And there was a lot of talk about about the internet not just disrupting business  But now disrupting truly government and and that surprised me to come at this point from from here, but it worked  Uh, I think it's an important discussion to have I think there's a realization now that that as somebody said we're  renegotiating the social contract with government as somebody else said  data allows citizens to  Go around politicians because citizens know more often than government does and that's highly disruptive to government  So that was all very interesting. It's kind of a davosian discussion  And the other news here is there is no google party this year  And no excel wine party the excel wine party to start with that one was incredible  Uh, they they brought they flew in saliers and unbelievable cases of unbelievable lines  and I managed to sneak into the damn thing twice, but um  joe shorndorff  uh said today that uh  That they did kind of look at the list at the end of the night and they saw 400 people there and 300 people  They didn't even know who managed to get invitations  Uh, but I think the other truth is that the world economic forum is trying to make things look a little less  Um, it's a little elitist. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so, uh, uh, the google gave up its party  Reports that I believe have it that they were not pressured but they were suggested that they really should stop giving the party  And google I think was fine with that because it was a major thing and all the parties are the same  They're just very loud with you know sprockets playing and all that  Um, so that's going on yahu. However, marissa meyer is now here for the first time  She's a she's a denizen of of davos, but she's here for the first time for yahu  And she is instead going to have a party. So marissa meyer, uh reports have it is taking over  The party beat  Meanwhile, they always had on saturday night this big gala where you're supposed to wear black title. Okay, so that's dead  Now people are going to go up and eat a brunch on this on the snow  It's pretty much the same thing. It always is it's the mockers of the world coming here  The bankers are are unapologetic for how they've screwed up the world  As always and they're out there saying that we have david cameron talking tomorrow and angela merkel. I think is talking this time  Uh morse is talking so you have all you know, these heads of state and big important people coming  It's kind of fascinating to be here at the same time. I don't know how the hell I got in  But what the heck i'm here so i'm staying the other thing if I may bill i'm going to introduce you all to my roommate  Uh  Uh, there's there's the famous bill gross awesome  It's your hot bird whore who's now you might wonder why we're here because that's what it's like  This is this is a typical davos room in eight fancy folks. That's spartan. I will put the camera back with murphy beds and uh,  but um  it's because we um  It really is spartan. It really is we have we have one plug  Going to see if I can show you my i'm going to show you my electric situation now here there is I have a a um  british i mean uk extension cord into an american extension things into yet another one over here  If if we go off the next time, you know, it's because bill plugged in  um his um  His shaver. Yes. Uh, so so uh, the rooms are so tight here  That when bill, uh got his invitation here they were going to put him halfway  to hamburg  So, um, I uh volunteered for him to bunk with me  So i'm staying with world famous entrepreneur bill gross in this horrible, uh, little little room, but that's davos  So it it's elitist. It's the powerful. It's the mockers, but we're in crappy hotels and we complain about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As it were slobs who organizes this who who is who is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is a doctor professor claus schvab who has the greatest accent you've ever heard  First year I was here claus schvab. Uh, he's he's german and swiss  Uh, he was at a party thrown by burda, which is tonight i'm missing for your sake folks  Oh, wow, and he got up on stage in the days of uh of second life  He got up on stage and he said  I have an avita  And uh, so schvab is this amazing guy who decided to do this 42 years ago and put it together and now it's this  No greater collection of bochers. Can you imagine that what he put together and he's just he just does it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's boy 42 years of state heads of companies technology has really changed this. I mean a lot more i'm sure a lot more entrepreneurial  a lot less governmental

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Incredibly, so listen you you can knock the forum for being  Uh the elite and the establishment and that's certainly true and the bankers are here and the government's here  But they also I I have to give them a lot of credit. They do do a good job of trying to bring in  Technology pioneers what they call young global leaders some people I really respect greatly young people who are under 40 every year  Now they have a new group called it sounds a bit science science fictionist, but they come the shapers the glung global shapers  Um, it sounds like they change shape when they will uh, but they're under 30  And so they try to what i've said about davos the last three years is that i'm among the disrupted  I'd prefer to be among the disruptors, but they try to bring in some disruptors as well  And you know, so you can give me crap for coming and I would deserve it  But I figure I have the chance to come because I helped them with blogging seven years ago  And they they've forgotten to disinvite me  and um  And so I get to come and I get to hobnob and and do amazing things  I got on the way down here. We went to the dld conference in munich and I had a dinner there  Uh with arthur seltzberger of the times, uh, who i've gotten to know better because I come here even though we're next door neighbors  And uh alex ross from the state department and um max levchin  And uh, just amazing people that's what what happens is you end up with these, you know  Lunches and dinners and car rides with some amazing people and so I can't pass it up.

Transcript:  Uh borda which is a big german publisher holds this conference always right before davos and so they get the davosians to come there  And it's wildly overcrowded  Uh, and mark zuckerberg spoke there. Uh, a what in 2006? I think it was that's in munich he bragged  In munich and he bragged then that he had that facebook had just gone. He was so amazed  I watched this happen from 1 million to 2 million users  And now joe joe shondorf that was there from excel who invested in facebook of course and who said, you know now  They're over a billion. This is this is pretty much amazing. Uh dld is a good conference. It's it's it's it's wildly wildly overcrowded  But the hallway is great. I did a session with luftonza there, which is how I got over frankly full disclosure  uh  Imagining with a whole bunch of entrepreneurs in the room what it would be like to turn an airline into an api  And it was actually a fascinating kind of conversation you could have there  And then I was on a journalism panel where I caused some fuss because you know what I talked about folks  You know what I talked about what I get ready to chat you ready to cue it here  Lice should threat  Lights did you do it to a reggae beat jeffrey?  Oh, I did tell the germans not not in the panel  I didn't say this but I did all the germans off stage, but that had been put to a reggae beat they giggled  Um, and then there's one schmuck in twitter, which was a very nice guy. He always tries to to correct me  So I know it's lice dumb should track  Right, you know what's the rest I get  I get them and i'm american is a hub in there  And then a poor friend of mine a very good friend of mine brilliant brilliant editor and publisher named katarina bonkert  Works for a big publisher. I talk about this very very controversial thing in germany with publishers  It's in front of all these publishers and then the moderator asked her what she thinks put her on a horrible hot spot  Uh, but this was actually very controversial here to talk about that  So it's been it's been an interesting week  I fly back on sunday and i'll be glad to be back and then go back into class on monday  Did you my report did you ask?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, no, I didn't but I have my own little donald trump story leo since he happened to bring him up  Okay, so here's my donald trump story so so you remember that uh, uh  Deadspin had the big scoop about the nordia player who had the apparently imaginary girlfriend, right?  And donald trump came online and and said, oh, this is a funny twitter twitter battle. Yeah  So I guess there's another chapter you probably know about so so trump comes along a line and he says kudos to reporter reporter and  And I think he was spelled wrong their names or something and deadspin and deadspin in in true gockerish denton style  Responded in full and i'll abbreviate it  fu  yeah  so  And and this lasts for a little while going on people treat treated like saying but of course i'm in this politeness gig lately for the internet  And what the heck jeff come on  No, so I wrote this piece and I just said, you know  For once i'm actually sympathizing with donald trump, which of course brought the wrath of the net down upon me  And so to excuse myself for this. I said well, you know folks i'm not a fan of donald trump  When I was sunday editor of the new york daily news. I did a cover  Uh that donald trump was uh, the great has been  So that sat there for a few days then suddenly out of nowhere  I get a tweet from donald trump saying you were a lousy editor and you were fired my god

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're on the enemy's list because i'm more important than donald trump. I'm here and you're not donald

Transcript:  So it sounded like maybe I misunderstood this that was donald giving him a backhanded compliment when he said my bandwidth, didn't it?  Yeah, no, he was complimenting. He was complimenting him. They said fu  And then he says deadspin's disgusting response will teach me and others not to be nice anymore  A sad lesson and then he hasn't said enough. So he says  Deadspin guys are total losers. It is they had their story stolen right out from under their bad complexions  other other media capitalized  Yeah, they got 80 billion paid views i'm following the real donald trump this guy has something to say  Holy cow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But trump doesn't have enough money the times is valued at over a billion dollars. I don't think trump  Is going to spend a billion dollars on an iffy proposition like the new york times

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it was anthony de rosa of writers who said on twitter and he was right  He said, uh, well we cover the I the the the the uh,  The chance of donald trump becoming president and buying the new york times is equal, but we like covering it anyway

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is trump he you know, he looks for the places where he can get attention and uh,  And plant stories i'm sure  I mean his most recent tweet almost every television network wants me badly, but I stay loyal to nbc

So you'll be you'll see it. Uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When you get it. So what was your first search? Did you do anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know you click in the box and it has this kind of auto suggest  So, uh the first you know, the first things that it suggests are these like basic searches my friends photos of my friends restaurants nearby games  My friends play so I just started typing, you know photos or a name of a friend  Uh, and you can do things like things that's leo laporte likes let's try so you just start to i've experimented with it a little bit  And this suggests is actually quite quite fast  Uh, and you keep being like, oh, yeah, you know, show me a chinese restaurant in san francisco that my friends like  And uh, there was it's actually pretty useful. I have to say it was I  More useful than I thought that it would be now that I have it  I'll be interested to see if you agree when you get it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh, do you feel encouraged now to put more data in there do more liking?  Uh tag stuff more elaborately in other words make it more useful to your friends

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I you know, I use facebook. I i'm kind of on the fence about facebook  So it actually makes me want to draw back a little bit  It made me want to change my likes, you know to make kind of get them up to date  And uh, i'll think more when I like things. I don't know  Do you want to hide any  I don't think that there weren't any that I want to hide. There's just some that are just sort of out of date  You know, i'm just not as into battle star galactica now as I was when it was airing that that type of thing  Uh, just you know, just just updating stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know maybe more cautious

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe a little more cautious  The the one search that I really like are photos that i've liked which is just basically a list of my friends  You know, this is a bunch of photos of my friends like kids and pets  Um, but before I like a photo i'll probably think about it a little bit more because now I know that's a sort of public facing view  um, but for the most part it's pretty it's it's pretty useful

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you see the um the tumblr blog actual facebook graph searches?  Yeah, it's kind of disturbing actually because one of the first ones is  Uh men interested in men who live in tehran  Um, there's another one. Uh, yeah, so that's dangerous  Well in the so the mothers of jews who like bacon

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's not nice married people who who like ashley madison

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Married people who like prostitutes. How about that?  current tesco employees who like horses

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Current employees of people you get that one, you know what that no, what's that?  Yeah, there were tesco burgers in the uk that were found genetic material of horses horse meat. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Current employers of people who like racism

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The u.s. Air force racism like apparently you can't like racism

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So at some point somebody set up a page that was like racism or I mean, you know, there are pages for everything  There's pages for sexism and pooping my pants like there's all kinds of crazy pages  And if you like them as a kind of a joke or whatever at some time  Then it shows up in this new context which kind of seems a lot more

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's you know, I mean the the tumblr blog is kind of a joke, but it's sort of disturbing  Yeah, but you'd have to be an idiot if you're married to like ashley madison, which is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Site where you find people to cheat with  You're doing that publicly. Why would you like it? I mean, that's stupid

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I think you lots of people don't see it as public they see it as somewhere in this gray area between public and private  Yeah, be careful what you like

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mm-hmm, right. That's the lesson. Yeah people who like focus on the family and neil patrick harris  That's funny by the way they they um  They just show that there's results

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They black out the the actual results and you can see how you can target even more closely on the right hand side

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, right gender refine this search and there's all the geographic. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can do friends of my friends who like racism. Sorry. There are no results for the search  Good job friends of friends good

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The friends of my friends is interesting. Isn't it though because now you're getting a little deeper into the weeds

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's how randy zuckerberg's photo got exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly, and I think that's the single biggest data leak point on facebook friends of friends of friends. Yeah  Single women who live nearby who are interested in men and like getting drunk

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There was also one getting the single women drunk

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a search i'm going to make a note of  This is funny. It's uh actual facebook graph searches dot tumblr.com tom scott  He says don't worry. We'll all be used to this in a few weeks time  Yeah, I mean, you know on the one hand you you are doing this publicly  With your likes and all

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sort of it is it is the question, you know, I I think generally you're right  If you've said you'd like something that that ends up there and people are going out of the board  But but there is a question of presumed use and that's where  We're always going to end up with a syncopation problem with data. Gee, I never thought that it would be used that way  Um, and and a lot of times that's well  Geez, you shouldn't put it up there. But a lot of times that's also. Oh, yeah, you got a point that looks bad now

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Steve cheney who's uh, can you think of that later bizdev at groupon wrote a blog post  He calls them dirty likes likes that  uh  You know you didn't you know at the time they didn't have any import, you know  I wanted a coupon so I liked you know chipotle  But now all of a sudden because of the search they have import

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's a good point  Like I think his what he's saying is the signals that those are those likes or whatever are transmitting  Aren't as valuable as they seem to be because you don't know the context in which you liked it  You know, you might have had to like something in order to get access to a site or you know, like like gating or whatever  So you don't really know why that person clicked on that thing and now it's just  Part of that construct that virtual you that facebook is creating

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm gonna give jeff jarvis a number because this blog post has a he's he's gone again, unfortunately this blog  This blog post has a kind of surprising a number in it. So when we get it back i'm gonna tell him  I'm gonna give you a gift jeff jarvis  I'm gonna go down and i'm gonna link  From petaluma to davos from petaluma to davos. It's amazing. Could we do this if it weren't for the magic of the internet?  We couldn't  No, would we want to?  No  So i'm gonna put a i'm gonna give you a  I'm gonna give you a number jeff. I'm gonna put it in the  I'm gonna put it in the uh, it's i'm putting it. I I just thought of one. Oh you thought of one good  Then i'll use it use this  This is from the steve cheney article facebook has convinced a lot of advertisers spend a lot of money to generate likes  Did you know for instance according to steve cheney who?  Is biz dev a group on so he probably does know this fact  Over the past several years american express has spent about half of its total ad spend buying likes on facebook  tens of millions of dollars  That's how important to them and they knew because you know what they're right  That probably was good money well spent  In fact he says across the board big advertisers were told by facebook to spend about half of their ad buy on fan acquisition  Not just by facebook, but by agencies and experts  Well, I think yeah, especially now because of the graph search that like has some value doesn't it not that anybody's gonna search for restaurants  That my friends who like american express like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the question is how much value I mean how much value does a single like have?  um  Because you don't know  What that person meant by clicking like it's really it's a blunt instrument. Yeah, sometimes you like stuff you hate

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sometimes an ironic like sarcastic right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I like that or sometimes, you know  Somebody will put up a tribute, uh or say something about someone who was killed or something like that and you like what they said  But it makes it seem like you like the murder

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  right  Exactly that happens all the time  There's new nuance. It's just like

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just tried credit cards my friends like and that did not work. Ah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Interesting  What do you think about john bettel? This is one for you jeff jarvis john bettel who says twitter is actually  a media company  And what about that too? Yeah. Okay matthew  That sounds reasonable it's a little disturbing to me, but uh, because i'm a media company and i'm twit  And uh, we kind of had a gentleman's agreement. I wasn't going to do a social media network  And twitter wasn't going to get into media, but I guess it's too late now  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I hear they're starting a tv show

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they're doing a tv show  But really the contents of twitter and twitter's moved in this the point I think of this article and others is that twitter  Through the use of its embedding in into the twitter stream and so forth is turning the twitter  website  Into a media stream

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I think john's point was that all of that content and this is actually related to facebook too  Depending on how you look at it facebook is a giant user generated content media company as well  And the point he was making was all of that data  Billions of tweets, you know half a billion a day  All of that information is is data that that  Twitter can use to show you more relevant content show you more relevant ads  All the things that media companies are trying to do and theoretically if they can figure it out  I mean my point was their relevance needs to get better facebook's relevance needs to get better  How do they determine what signals to look at and what not to look at?  There you know if you look at the discover tab or or even the emails they need to do some work on  Making that stuff really relevant  Um, but that's clearly where they're going

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One of the things betel suggests is that twitter will add to the twitter's content  To its trends a happenings  Page or or section where you can see hurricane sandy the world cup, you know, whatever's going on right now  and and then it really is I mean it's and it's true when when a celebrity dies where there's a  Storm like sandy, where do we go? We often go to twitter to get the latest direct news

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And this this happens on tv all the time and I feel like there are events are going on. I mean  They go to twitter like new year's eve, right like the ticker at the bottom is just tweets  I mean clearly curated edited tweets, right?  But they say hey, you know cnn did this like hey use this hashtag  And then there's somebody behind the scenes saying yeah, let that one let that one go. Let that one go  Uh, so you really could see twitter just doing that having a sort of actually news sure i've noticed even with events

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They'll just read tweets like yeah, you know just read tweets this happened and then just read tweet. I know it's so sad  It's so pathetic. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's so pathetic. I can read the tweets myself. Thank you

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll just go to twitter now, I guess I mean we've talked about like that's what andy carvin does right? I mean he's just like  master curator of tweets for various events  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so  Go ahead. The only risk to me at least is that you know twitter is a single entity, right? It's a company  I agree they they control this giant sort of user generated media entity that we're all contributing to  I mean that has risks as well as benefits

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, somebody in the chat room said twitter's not news. It's gossip  I don't know if that's fair. I think it is news when it's the uh, arab spring or it's hurricane sandy  Yeah, and lots of news is gossip. Let's face it rumors about apple's earnings. What's that? Right?  It's it's unfiltered more. I mean, I think if you're going to say well, here's the problem  It's not that it's gossip, but that it's unfiltered right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so twitter's trying to come up with filters, right?  Just like facebook's trying to come up with filters and it's partly for you and it's partly for advertisers, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, the better it does this the better it can target ads  Um any trust action going on it's been going on for a couple of years now against google as well as apple intel  and others  Uh, it's apparently illegal and if you think about it, there's good reason for it to be illegal for companies to agree with one another  We won't poach your employees  Um, it's being heard right now. In fact, uh apple chief executive tim cook is being deposed  Even as we speak  uh, the problem is uh that um  In fact, there's there's steve jobs even apparently threatened  And palm saying if you don't if you keep poaching our employees we're gonna we're gonna sue you for patents  You know bringing out the big gun  Uh, so these all these silicon valley companies agreed and the reason it's not it is in fact part of antitrust law  It is it is illegal  And the reason it is is because it disadvantages employees if I can't go across the street and get a better job  you can keep my  Compensation low

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, uh, this is a this is a huge and continuing story

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Intuit ebay google apple adobe  intel pixar  All involved in 2010 those companies agreed to a settlement  That they won't do it anymore. But the uh, but the potential for a class action lawsuit continues

Each phone is six dollars a month  So, let's say I have a family of four or a small business i'm gonna have four phones  I'll give you an example  Let's say a thousand minutes  nationwide calling  Text messages a thousand a month. That's probably plenty  Uh three gigabytes. Let's go for all the data. We can eat that plan per month for a family of four a hundred seven bucks  Barriered for not each for the whole family  That's probably that's probably less than than you're paying right now for one phone  Ting's got other great features day of hot spotting and tethering included three-way calling free call forwarding caller id voicemail  I love it that you can do, you know hot spotting on the phone for free  And by the way, they've got great devices to choose from all the way up to the galaxy note 2  The samsung galaxy s3 they have less expensive phones as well  Um, they have the optimus g if you wanted a nexus 4 you can't get one the optimus g basically is  Kind of the nexus 4 unbound  And when you go to twig.ting.com and use the twig offer code, you're going to take 25 bucks right off the top  Now it's unsubsidized prices because there's no termination fee.

So it automatically all my photos from  From the phone are are sent up to open photo. It's got a great  website and so it it reproduces a lot of what I liked about photo stream and

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's great. You can also use dropbox for that and you know, google plus does it automatically with the google plus app on android  Just turn on the instant uploads and everything gets uploaded makes it easy to share

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I I really like that feature. I do too and they actually have a great built-in editor too at google plus  I've been using that a lot. So if you're they get auto uploaded and then I go and tweak them there. It's good for that
