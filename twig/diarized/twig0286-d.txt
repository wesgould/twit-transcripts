Next week? Next hour?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me take a look at the schedule. I believe it is next week.  Hey!  Yay!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff and I miss Gina. But don't worry, we've got great people in her place.  Jeff Jarvis is here, professor of journalism at the City University of New York.  He's got his Chromebook Pixel. He's padding it because we've compelled him to use an unnamed computer for his Skype.  Liberal Commie computer.  But boy, doesn't that look good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, rub it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's okay. That's okay. Just think of this as a dedicated video conferencing device, not a computer.  And you never have to use this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look, our TriCaster runs on a Windows machine. But you never know it because it's the TriCaster.  Exactly. We're running Windows 7.  Cooties!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  Jeff is the author of Public Parts, What Would Google Do?, Gutenberg the Geek, and his latest Geek Sparing Gifts, Reimagining News in the Modern World.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ain't that exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ain't that the greatest. BuzzMachine.com is his blog.  Look who's here. Mike Elgin, our news director from TNT. Mike is the most popular man on Google+, practically.  Yep. Me and Lady Gaga. We're the most popular men.  Also a writer at Computer World and other magazines. He's an expert in the cloud and Google. We should get you on more.  I just don't want to overburden you because you have to do TNT every Monday through Friday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This show is like a vacation, a tropical island.  It's dessert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is dessert. And boy, is it going to be a filling cereal.  Let's start with the FCC. Tom Wheeler in an editorial published on Wired, clearly reaching out to us, to the geeks.  It's interesting. Dan Gilmore wrote an article apologizing to Tom Wheeler for mischaracterizing him as a shill.  That's very Dan. That's a very neat thing to do.  I guess Oliver was going to have to say, I'm sorry for calling you, what do you call him, a dingo?  John Oliver is going to have, he's off the air right now. He's in hiatus. But when he comes back, he's going to have to say, I'm sorry I called you a dingo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the devil is in the details. Let's see the full language. But so far, so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, now I'm scared. We got what we wanted.  Tom Wheeler has agreed to use Title II of the Telecommunications Act of 1934 while tailoring it for the 21st century in order to create a competitive network in order to prevent fast lane prioritization.  And you know, it's actually interesting. He refers to, and I had forgotten this, a startup that he did in the 80s called Naboo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the most fascinating part to me is that what happened is that he tried to do high speed back in the day, but it required working with cable companies and cable companies effed him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it came home to roost. And AOL beat him. He said we were delivering 1.5 megabits per second back in the 80s. That was amazing.  Steve Case was dial up. And Case, Wheeler says, Case told me at the time we used to worry a lot about Naboo, but Naboo went broke while AOL became obviously very successful.  Wheeler writes, Why that is highlights the fundamental problem with allowing networks to act as gatekeepers while delivering better service. Naboo had to depend on cable television operators granting access to their systems.  Steve Case of AOL was not only a brilliant entrepreneur, but he had access to an unlimited number of customers nationwide who only had to attach a modem to their phone line. The phone network was open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because the FCC made it open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the mobile networks were closed. End of story. For Tom Wheeler to say that kind of to me gives him a lot of street cred.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. Well, you know what? He's like a sleeper cell for the EFF. You know, it's kind of great, right? We thought that he was going to be a sellout because he worked in the industry and all that.  But this experience early in his career, the permissionless development, the ability to reach people on an open network, he got it in his soul and it came back. And God bless him. Let's just hope it stays this way.  And the old companies, you know, and the cable companies, you screwed yourselves, guys. You know, you put yourself you could have been nice. You could have had a sign up that says don't be evil. You could have had a sign up and said, just because we can doesn't mean we should.  You could have had a sign up and said, let's not treat our customers like prisoners. But you didn't. And so it's all come home to roost on the big old companies and they're all going to sue the FCC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  AT&T has already said it is. Oh, yeah. They say if they do this, we're suing here. We're going we're in. Here's an interesting thing. He's actually gone farther than some people, including Google, wanted him to go. He says, using the authority of Title Two, I am submitting to my colleagues, the other commissioners of the FCC, the strongest open internet protections ever proposed by the FCC. These enforceable right line rules will ban paid prioritization fast lanes.  And the blocking and throttling of lawful content and services. But here's where he's going to come here. This is really interesting. I propose to fully apply for the first time ever those bright line rules to mobile broadband.  And that's a huge deal. Huge, huge deal. Even Google acknowledged in its amicus filing with Verizon that broadband should be treated differently on mobile. Right. In Google's devil's deal with Verizon. That was I've never been more ashamed of Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I remember that at that moment, and I screamed about it in the show. It was it was a it was a moment of prostitution to try to make nice to phone companies. It was never going to yield anything. But Google said, we'll apply that neutrality to wired line, not mobile. And it was wrong. It was evil. And God bless Tom Wheeler is less evil than Google right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Two for now. Two two things to look out for. One of them is coming up to the your punchline of of them embracing mobile was the fact that it says that any sort of legal.  We have legal content. Yeah. So that that is determined by lawmakers. Yeah. And the lawmakers are going to be the fly in the ointment here. That's Congress and a minority of Republicans in Congress are going to want to attack and destroy this.  And of course, the lobbyists, Wheeler's former colleagues are going to be attacking Congress in all this. And so so that's risky. Secondly, Wheeler said specifically that what what I have giveth the future FCC chairman can take it away in a couple of years.  And so that makes me nervous. The precedent is huge, though. It gives it a lot of weight and gives us a good shot of having that neutrality going forward. But you have to realize that if we didn't get net neutrality right now, we would never get it.  And most countries are leaning toward no net neutrality, because once again, as as is, you know, the case in the United States and everywhere, the companies, there's so much money to be made in screwing the consumer and and and probably Europe to a certain extent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And so the US regulatory credit is going for net neutrality all around. I saw the new digital head in Europe, and I'm scared of what his lives wouldn't do. I think he's going to do a European wide. Get ready for it.  Leistung Schutzrecht. But but they sing the song of net neutrality in Europe. I think that we were behind on that. And this might put us back to where we ought to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got the feeling that they started to go strong with net neutrality early in last year and in spring of last year. And then by the end of the year, they were saying, you know, on second thought, maybe we ought to just kind of tinker with it a little bit.  And that's that's the risk. Yeah. And so that's problematic. But I mean, it's it's it remains to be seen. I think the biggest thing is that people can't relax now, though. Everybody who wrote letters right to your member of Congress. Exactly.  Because now is when we win it or lose it. Now he did do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I first when I read the headline, I went gulp because we got what we wanted. But now I'm nervous about what the other side has said all along, which is you don't want the federal government, especially the FCC regulating the Internet, because there's all sorts of stuff entitled to this gives him power to do.  He was very clear that he intends to honor President Obama's notion of forbearance, not enforcing everything. He says he wants to create incentive for broadband operators to invest. So he's going to modernize title tool, for instance, no rate regulation.  This was something everybody was a little worried about critical for them. No tariffs. No last mile unbundling. What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's in Britain. I think this one means tell me if I'm wrong chat room. But in Britain, BT puts the fiber or puts the cable into your house. But but it's like your power line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Others wouldn't want last mile unbundling. I think we would. But I think that's a big stop to the cable companies. And he's saying if you spent the money, the capital investment to get the last mile, you're going to continue to own that last mile.  And that is true that me and the FCC decided this the last time this came up many more than a decade ago. They they gave a monopoly to the cable companies in every region saying, look, you're going to invest a lot of money in infrastructure. You need to be able to monetize.  That was what they saw as necessary to incent investment. He said over the last 21 years, the wireless industry has invested almost 300 billion under similar rules, proving that modernized title to regulation can encourage investment and competition.  I have to say last mile unbundling has happened on the wire on phone companies. AT&T and others have to unbundle. Right. Yes. So I'm not convinced that that's what you mean.  What do you mean? What do you mean? They have VNOs? No, no, no, no. They well, not mobile. But in in landline and DSL, it's unbundled. The last mile has been put in by AT&T or Verizon. But you can get it from Sonic Net or DSL Extreme or some other provider.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. Right. Which is not the case here. But I would like to see that on cable. Yep.  The other important decision, which was which was a few days ago, which is the administration saying that they're going to fight. Yes. The limitations on towns over building and competing with cable companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Municipal Internet is the right answer to all of this. Right. Right.  Well, so this all sounds very good. In fact, the EFF writing today said today we are celebrating Chairman Wheeler's announcement signals the FCC is at long last making real progress on net neutrality.  But they do agree the battle is not over. We need to ensure the FCC rules will actually do what is needed to protect the open Internet and no more.  And I think that, Mike, you're absolutely right. This is now it's time to write your Congress. Yes. And say, you know, good. Now let's promote competition. Let's promote investment.  I don't think unbundling the Last Mile is a bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that this is going to be made, if it hasn't already been made, into a left right issue with with people on the right being told that this is a government regulation. There is a government regulation thing to a certain extent.  And so those reflexes are being exercised. And this is not the issue to exercise those reflexes, in my opinion, because the alternative to so-called government regulation, where there's a level playing field essentially.  And where all traffic has to be treated equally, is that Comcast is in charge of determining these things. And Comcast has demonstrated that it just will screw customers over for a buck at every chance it gets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree, Mike. That's what I was saying before, too. I think that the telecommunications industry could have avoided this.  They could have shown that they weren't evil. There really is an attitude is, if we can, we will. We'll charge you for every little thing. We're going to screw you over. We're going to treat you like prisoners.  It's a prisoner business model, like an airline prisoner business model. And they brought it upon themselves. No one trusts them. No one trusts them. They have to buy their friends in Congress.  And that's what will come to bear now. We'll see what the power of the lobbying is. But Wheeler clearly heard the country speak and heard Silicon Valley speak and then listened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  AT&T warned that Title II is far from bulletproof.  Boy, they didn't pull any punches. Hank Hultquist, writing on the AT&T Public Policy blog, said, Today we made a couple of filings at the FCC disputing its authority to reclassify ISPs as common carriers.  He says this decision is driven by political considerations. We think they're going to do it, but we ought to warn them we're going to court and we don't think it's sustainable.  We think court will overturn it just as Verizon won court with the FCC's open Internet regulations.  I have to point out, though, that that court told Verizon, or told the FCC, if you were to pursue Title II, we might be able to support you on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why they went against them, because Title II was not the law of the land.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they're quoting Justice Scalia's dissenting opinion in a Supreme Court decision. Brand X.  Of course, a dissent has no weight in law at all, but they, I think, hold out hope that maybe Justice Scalia will support them if it goes to the Supreme Court.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not worried about AT&T's lawsuit. I'm worried about AT&T's buy the Congress budget. They give more to campaign contributions and other financing and the other company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and here's their argument. So let's see. This doesn't sound completely wrong to me. And again, they're quoting Justice Scalia.  He said ISPs are not merely an information service. They're a transmission service. He compared them to pizzerias that offer both a combination of pizza and home delivery or a pet store that sells dogs but includes the leash.  I'm getting a headache.  Scalia is notorious for this.  We disagree with Scalia's view that ISPs simultaneously offer both information and telecommunications service, says AT&T. The FCC has long adhered to an interpretation of the statute under which these definitions are mutually exclusive.  You can't be both a telecommunications service, a transport, and an information service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't understand that analogy. In what way does your average ISP, you know, I mean, obviously the Comcast and so on are serving up both content and bandwidth. Is that what they're talking about?  I don't know.  They shouldn't. They shouldn't be doing that.  I'm trying to make sense of this.  You shouldn't get your puppy from the same place you get the leash or whatever. We want dumb pipes. The dumber the better.  Right.  The bigger the better. That's what we want. And that's that's what we need in order to compete with the rest of the world economically.  That's what we need in order to retain our status as an economic superpower.  You know, we need these things. We can't be nickel and dime to death by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. So, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Dumb pipe. Dumb pipes are a commodity and they know that.  And the value will come in the unique content.  And we're going to buy that from Netflix, not from Comcast.  And that's exactly what they're afraid of. They know it. They know this is happening. They know it's inevitable.  This is not a big surprise to them. They're just trying to fight to the last rather than saying, hmm, this is where the world's going.  Why don't we start our own damn Netflix and compete like crazy on the basis of quality?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to think this public policy blog is aimed at congressional staffers and if they understood it, members of Congress.  And it's essentially laying out the argument.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is what we paid you to say. Here it is.  Yes, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is this is what you should be saying now.  So, not only are we talking a lawsuit, we're talking a severe lobbying along these lines.  We'll see. Tom Wheeler, I apologize.  You're not a dingo or a shill for the telecommunications and cable companies.  You are a free man and you did the right thing, I think, so far.  Yeah. And I think did it in a very nuanced way that protects a little bit the people.  You know, we did a great debate on Twitter a few maybe a couple of months ago with two Internet service providers on different sides of this.  And I think that he's saying the things here that will reassure the the ISP from from Larry at Wyoming, who was very concerned about getting a heavy handed government regulations in his business while protecting the Internet.  So it seems like he's done a good job on this.  Let's hope so. You wrote a good article, Mike, on Computer World.  Thank you. Seven smartphone rules that changed this week that kind of kind of ties along.  Was was this was before the FCC?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was. It was. But the FCC lately has been the month of January changed everything for smartphone users.  Yeah, exactly. So just quickly going through these carriers, if you recall, the the well,  the FTC actually and the FCC are both working together. But basically, the FTC said that the track phone, they basically ordered the prepaid mobile provider track phone to pay a fine of forty million dollars because they throttled an unlimited data plan.  Wow. So essentially that established the rule. This isn't these aren't laws. These are just rules basically.  But everybody has to adhere to these precedents where you can you can sell unlimited data plans and you can throttle data, but they can't be the same plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you see was clear to say this is not a rule against throttling. This is a this is a false advertising. Exactly. You can't say unlimited in an advertisement and then throttle. Exactly.  And actually, that's I think that's a little controversial because unlimited means as many bits as you want. Throttling just means we're going to give them to you slower. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But taking to an extreme, you can imagine, oh, give you one megabyte. And after that, it's it's the speed of a 300 baud baud motor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is clear. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. But but here's Mike, the one the eighth rule that's not there is that hotels can't sell high speed when it ain't high speed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. They should be held to account for what they sell. Right. And this was the the the second change that they made, which was the FCC declared that true broadband.  They upgraded it used to be four megabits down, one megabit up. Now it's twenty five megabits down, three megabits up. What does that change? This new definition of broadband?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It changes the idea that they're going to be selling a four megabit per second connection is called broadband.  Yeah, everybody uses broadband now to be synonymous with just Internet connectivity. We see we do it all the time and we journalists do it all the time.  Just call it mobile broadband, for example. Well, you know, there's a lot of data connectivity that's super, super, super slow.  And we're calling broadband broadband used to be a distinction to to separate fast Internet connectivity with slow Internet connectivity.  And still, I mean, twenty twenty five megabits per second, I don't think for for downloads, I don't think is that fast. It's a pretty low hurdle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The standards have changed over the years. I would have been thrilled with a megabit and a half 15 years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One of the co-anchors on on Tech News today is Elise Hugh. She's moving to Seoul, Korea, and she's going to become the sole bureau chief for NPR.  And she was saying that they they they essentially define broadband as one hundred meg megabits per second.  Right. And everybody's got it. I mean, it's but isn't the government providing it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Private industry or is it a government run? I think the government is squeezing the subsidized.  But it's that's the issue. I mean, we hear a lot about Sweden and and South Korea and other countries where they have very inexpensive, very high speed Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But in almost every case, it's subsidized. Yeah. And I don't see anything wrong with that. No, I'm not a big like, you know, government should be taxing and spending.  But I saw a study I think was last year at some point, somebody calculated how much it would cost to give everybody in the United States Google fiber level speed.  How much? It was like a couple hundred billion bucks. It's basically what we spent in Afghanistan in like two weeks or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it's yeah, exactly. So I think I have an unintended consequence because by redefining broadband, you suddenly make Comcast fifty six percent of of all the broadband market.  They have more than half of all US customers. Yep. And that's actually ours. Technica made that point.  But but a great point. And I don't know if that was an intended consequence or not.  But now Congress has to grapple or not the Congress, I guess. Is it the FTC who has to rule on the Comcast Time Warner merger?  It's an antitrust whoever's regulating that has to really now say, oh, well, you really do have a lion's share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I think what's happening here is I in general, I think we're finally getting the president we were waiting for.  And I think this is the WTF period of Obama's administration. What the hell? I'm going out. I might as well do something good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what's happened with these regulations. The FTL find the legacy segment of the administration happens every year, every year presidency in the last remaining years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A couple of years of the president. But it's especially stark with President Obama because he did so little in the first six years and yet said he was going to do so exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what? OK, I don't want to get political here. Yeah. Just a little bit.  I think he deserves more credit for the health care. Yes, he does. I think that absolutely.  And I know it's so Obamacare and, you know, and Fox News thinks it's a really bad thing.  But I have I have to say that that was a that was something I never thought I don't think anybody ever thought would become the law of the land.  And while it's not single payer health care, which is clearly what needs to happen, it's a huge step in that direction.  Yeah. And millions of people who are not covered by any health insurance are now covered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And he also deserves blame for the website and the political. Yeah.  But the in terms of technology in particular, I think there's been a lot of movement in Washington, both from Wheeler and from President Obama in the right direction.  Yeah. Whether you're left or the right. Personally, I hate it when these things get sort of owned by the you know, the propagandists who want to divide everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can we can we credit the Internet population and all the comments for this?  Do we get credit for this? I think there's a lot of credit to be given to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, because essentially these are the people who are paying attention, who have a lot of money.  Silicon Valley has a lot of money. And we set up and we said we want this. Yes, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think maybe Wheeler and Obama said, oh, and these people vote. Yeah. OK.  And they give money and they give money, which they need to. And they love the lobby.  Item three on your list, hotels, Marriott gave up. Yes. Hotels cannot block your Wi-Fi hotspot.  Marriott said, OK, all right, all right. Again, credit the Internet community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wasn't there some fine print to that, though, Mike?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not that I mean, essentially the Marriott actually implemented only one hotel.  They were fined six hundred thousand dollars for that.  And this is not this hasn't been formally established yet, but in separate speeches,  the FCC Commissioner, Jessica Rosenworcel and Tom Wheeler both said in very clear terms that blocking should not be allowed.  Basically pointed out their intention to not allow it.  And what was really refreshing was that Rosenworcel actually said that we need a lot more unlicensed spectrum  that can be used for things like personal Wi-Fi hotspots.  And so the FCC, at least those two on the FCC, those are I think those are the two most influential chairpeople.  They are very much in favor of no clamping down on personal use.  Like, you know, a Wi-Fi hotspot is essentially where you go and you plug into the hotel's network  and then you turn it into a Wi-Fi hotspot that five people can use in your room or one person can use with five devices, whatever it is.  And they're basically saying we're all favor.  This should not be restricted in any point either by the amount of available airwave frequencies or by the policy of whatever hotel you're staying in.  So this is really a really great direction for the FCC to be going in because it was unestablished.  I mean, it was essentially something that was an open question.  Can companies who provide Internet connectivity as one of the benefits or services that they provide  force you to pay for each device that is on that network?  And now the answer is no, they cannot, which is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So item four, you don't have to die needlessly.  Thank you, FCC.  Oh, wait a minute, because emergency personnel can't locate you indoors.  I didn't even know about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I didn't either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The FCC approved new rules that require carriers to within two years start using technology.  So they're essentially giving benchmarks for the carriers.  Within two years, they have to be able to provide the location of a 911 caller within 50 meters in at least 40% of cases.  That means it's all going to be mushed together and they're going to have averages.  And that requires lots of indoor location technology.  And so they have to allow this in order to make sure that people can find, you know, emergency workers can find people who need help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which also means, tell me if I'm wrong, that that's where the Wi-Fi address sniffing stuff comes in handy, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sure it does. And I'm sure that all the technologies for indoor location.  I wonder how they're going to do that, actually.  All that has not been been hammered out.  There's obviously a million ways to do indoor location, but they're basically throwing it at the carriers and saying,  you have two years to really make indoor location work for emergency workers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Within 50 meters. In 40% of the cases.  You still have a 60% chance of dying needlessly. But hey, that's better than nothing.  Airplane Wi-Fi. We talked about this with Nick Bilton.  Nick was on Twitter on Sunday. You can give Nick a lot of credit for Sky Mall going bankrupt.  Because he, by rattling the cage and using his bully pulpit at the New York Times,  managed to convince the FAA to allow airlines to leave your device on during takeoff and landings.  And that's why Sky Mall went bankrupt, they said, because nobody read the catalog anymore.  Because they could just continue to stare at their iPad, their iPhone, their Kindle.  So Nick takes credit for putting Sky Mall out of business.  Now Nick's got a new campaign. Slow overpriced Wi-Fi on airplanes.  And he said, I know, I know. I've heard the Louis CK bit.  We should all be insanely grateful. We're flying seven miles high through the air at 600 miles an hour.  And gee, the Wi-Fi sucks.  But, but, there is a technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right. The FCC recently approved a new service from GoGo called TuCu or 2KU.  And that's going to be installed in a thousand aircraft.  Now most of airplane Wi-Fi, you're beaming it down to the earth, to towers.  This beams it up to satellites.  And it's much, much faster, up to 70 megabits per second, which is almost certainly faster than our homes.  It's really fast Wi-Fi.  Jeff Liu is rolling this out right now, right?  Yes. And GoGo says that it'll be available to airlines in the second half of this year broadly.  And so this is going to be, there are going to be lots of airplanes in the sky where you log in and it's going to be way faster than your house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I saw a video from, I think, United that showed the retrofit for a plane to put in Wi-Fi.  I can't believe how hard it was. The amount they had to tear out to put the Wi-Fi in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. I understand why they charge. I said this to Nick. I said, I understand why they charge so much.  The fuel surcharge alone, I mean, the hundreds of pounds of new equipment they have to put in must cost them some money to offer this Wi-Fi.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they can use it themselves as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wish I could just use miles for it. I would buy it more freely with miles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I notice that hotels are increasingly offering free Wi-Fi. I wonder if that will happen on airplanes too.  If you were the first, if JetBlue said, look, free internet on all our flights and it's this new 2KU, I think that I would absolutely be more likely to buy a ticket on JetBlue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Plus, look at the money you save on providing content. You'd have to show movies and all that kind of stuff. Of course, that's their marketing opportunities.  Well, that's already happening on United, Mike.  Yeah. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not on United. And I am Global Services on United. I am the highest level.  Wow.  I'm that a-hole who gets on the plane first.  Yes.  All of you be damned.  Do you have to sit in a stroller to do it or are you a letter-warmer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm a senior type.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know. Excuse me. Are you Global Services? Oh, excuse me. I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You go before babies. He gets on before babies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I get on before the pilot. It's my plane for two minutes.  But I think that Wi-Fi would be a great benefit for the very frequent flyers. I think it's a benefit that you can use and the cash they get is limited.  And you're right, Mike. You now can download the United app and then when you get on the plane, when it's equipped with Wi-Fi, that's how you can watch movies.  I actually enjoyed not getting online on an airplane. I just put on my headphones, listen to music and relax. It's one of the few places I get disconnected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Days are numbered.  I guess so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But now you can use the Wi-Fi to watch a movie without having to download it to your tablet because it's provided by you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No. I know it's 70 megabits. Remember, that's 70 megabits shared among all the passengers on the plane. You're the one, you, Mr. Global Services, that's going to ruin it for all of us.  You'll be Skyping, streaming, watching a movie.  There'll be no net neutrality for you.  Number six, the entertainment industry can't use emergency alerts in movie promotions anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right. A movie called Olympus has fallen. They had a trailer or commercial for this movie on Viacom, on ESPN.  And the FCC fined Viacom and ESPN $1.4 million because this movie trailer used the official emergency alert tone.  So with the action heroes and stuff running around on screen, the tone was going and then they said you can't use the tone. You can't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm a bad person. I turn off Amber Alerts on my phone. I don't want to know. I don't care.  Too depressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What are the odds that you're going to see?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what happened? Can I tell you what happened here? When we were flood, like last month when there was flood warnings, every phone in the place went off with a flood warning.  Yeah. Like what? I mean, we just, what, everybody jump and run because the flood's coming?  Yeah. No, I turn it off. They can't turn off presidential alerts.  But I figure if I'm getting a presidential alert, the end of the world is imminent. Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The flood warning happened. We were doing TNT live and it was, you know, it's like we're pretty dry here. We're kind of on a hill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't. I mean, I understand the need. Tornado's coming.  Run for the cell, huh? But I just turn it off. I'm a bad, I'm the bad man who's not going to help find your lost child.  I'm sorry. You have to dig to find that emergency. I think is it cell broadcast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I actually think the fact that Facebook is putting Amber Alerts selectively on people's news feeds, I think that's the right place to do it.  You're focused on the content. What's happening in my area?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't. What am I going to get in the car and look for a beat up Dodge minibus? I don't. I'm not going to.  So so extreme threats. I have that still. You know, I don't want that either. Severe threats. No. Amber Alerts. No.  But you can't turn off the presidential alerts. So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But but definitely let me know when the cupcakes come out of the oven at the bakery.  That I want to know. Donuts are ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want to shark NATO alert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry. Such a bad man. You don't have to jump through hoops to complain anymore. Item seven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they have a new website. They have the kind of website that we need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Won't break down if they get more than a million comments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The fact is that the new website is OK, but their old website was horrible. It was like from the 90s and it just was steam powered and stuff. It was horrible.  Steam powered. This is much, much better.  And you can go and complain and whine about any company that is providing services that the FCC is involved with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There should be a checkbox, though, for a zombie apocalypse. Yes.  That I would like to know about ahead of time. Right.  We're going to take a break. Come back with more. Jeff Jarvis, Mike Elgin, Leo Laporte talking Google and the Googleverse and NetNutrality.  This is the one place really I find when I bookmark news, I bookmark a lot of stories for this show because this is the catch all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We can talk about anything on this show. And even if we didn't, Google itself is a massive generator of news stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It all has to do with Google. Actually, I did want to mention and I'll probably mention this on Twitter as well.  But Monte Ohm, who worked at Rooster Teeth, who was an animator. You've seen his work on Red versus Blue.  He was doing a new animated web series called Ruby. Very tragic. Thirty three years old.  He passed away, fell into a coma, had an allergic reaction during a medical procedure and never recovered.  So very sad. Thirty three years old. Monte Ohm. And you may not know the name, but you almost certainly know his work in Red versus Blue.  And apparently Rooster Teeth is going to continue Ruby RWBY and continue production of that.  So I thought I'd make a mention of that. You can't turn these alerts off. Sorry.  But you know what else you can't turn off? You can't turn off the snacks. Snacks just keep a coming.  Ladies and gentlemen, it's nature. Oh, new one. Ah, Nature Box time.  Osceaga. Look at that. Osceaga and cheddar cheese crisps. What is an Osceaga? Osceaga cheese is a fabulous hard cheese.

I don't think this was such a big, huge deal.  We talked about Apple earnings last week. That was a huge deal. Largest profit in history of any company.  But people are saying Google did not have a great quarter. They missed the analyst estimates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. They're doing well. People expect a lot from them.  I think that they had a lot of when the clarification of Google when Larry Page took over, there was a big push.  They were kind of in the doldrums and then there was a big push of aggressive cutting of dead wood and then, you know, launching new products and so on.  And that seems to have fizzled out a little bit.  The problem with Google is that they seem I think that the investors are worried about is that they launch all these different.  They're in everything. They're curing cancer. They got self-driving cars. They have blimps and balloons and all this kind of stuff.  And yet they're completely dependent upon advertising online. And it's such a market, such a dangerous place to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, Mike. But I think YouTube and Play are now up to like is it eight billion dollars, four billion dollars each year?  You know, it's still the percentage is shifting. I think the bigger worry is that the price per ad is going down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Price per click, too.  But not going down as fast as it was. It slowed a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A little bit, a little bit. It's down three percent versus Facebook.  Pardon me for a second here is up three hundred thirty five.  Now that was low, but the momentum Facebook has momentum as the Mo on mobile.  It has it on on price per ad.  And that's really the issue that I think is worrying. Google's still an incredibly large, growing, profitable company.  It's just I think a little bit of worry about the Mo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's everybody's eating, eating into their business.  I mean, they're losing market share in the United States slowly, but they're losing it to Yahoo and Bing and others, believe it or not.  Yahoo's growing. And it seems like no matter what Google does, other companies are aggressively getting into it, even areas where you thought nobody else would get into that.  I mean, we just we just had a story on tech news today this morning that it looks like Apple might be having might have Street View cars and it might even be launching a product called Apple Search.  I think that neither of those things are 100 percent.  There may be 50 50 at this point.  But if you go through each of of Google's traditional businesses, what they do, whether it's search, whether it's email, whether it's any of the things that they do, there's a lot.  There are a lot of powerful companies getting into that business and potentially chewing away at their market share, not not going to replace them as the leader in some of those areas.  But, you know, just gnawing away and eroding their dominance.  And I think that's one of the things that some are worried about.  I mean, of course, you know, these are good problems to have.  They were talking billions of dollars.  But but again, I think that the investors are right to be nervous about the heavy reliance on advertising.  It's still 80 something percent plus percentage of their of their revenues from from advertising.  And it's like that that can just dry up and change overnight.  I think one of the biggest success stories and biggest areas of potential is YouTube, of course, because everybody's trying to get into this is what Facebook is trying to do with all the video.  What what Twitter and others are trying to do with video.  They're all trying to compete with the attention grabbing power of YouTube.  Right. Because it's just so many hours spent with eyeballs on that.  And, you know, it's it's yeah, they're going to continue to be a super successful company and they could they could be on the brink of diversifying their sources of revenue and profit.  But so far, I don't think they're diversifying it fast enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, by the way, I don't think that's a street view car.  I think it's a self-driving car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You really think Apple would be in the self-driving car?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know why they would, but I just feel like it is.  Look at the stuff.  Yeah, it does.  You're right. The way it stops.  You can't tell the way it accelerated the minute that car pulled away.  It keeps exactly the same stopped distance.  I think it's a self-driving car.  It doesn't look like a street view.  I trust I would trust Apple and Google to make a self-driving car a lot more than I would trust Uber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why would? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Uber is apparently in that business, too.  I don't know why Apple would either do Street View or they have Apple Maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  And they don't like Google.  They don't like to depend on Google.  I don't think I really can't see Apple getting into the transportation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If they were doing a Street View, you'd see a lot more of these.  Well, I think...  You've only seen two in the wild.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think, you know, we talked about, I talked about this with Katie Benner this morning on Tech News today.  I think that there's a strong possibility that they're dipping their toe in the water.  They've got billions to throw around.  Why not just check it out and see what it's like, see how this might improve Maps.  If it works in San Francisco, maybe we'll, you know, throw a billion dollars at it and go nationwide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But the difference, Mike, I think, is that Google's in a better position to monetize local  because it has the advertising structure for a huge mass.  Salesforce.  Apple's really not there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Google has $64 billion in cash, good position for acquisition.  Their tax rate significantly lower than Apple's.  The effective tax rate was 16%.  Apple was somewhere around 26 or 27%, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but all those Irish sandwiches and all that stuff, that's all going to go with that.  Google's doing good with that.  Yes, they're very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's going to go away.  No, yesterday on MacBreak Weekly about the fact that there are two motions afoot to tax these overseas earnings.  President Obama has suggested a 14% tax, and then Nancy Pelosi has suggested, along with Rand Paul, of all people,  has suggested a lower, I can't remember what it was, 4% tax, but a one-time only tax that would allow repatriation at no cost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which is not going to make the Europeans happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Well, and that's what we had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because what they'll do is they'll just declare all the revenue to be American revenue.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And combat it.  We had an actual foreigner on the show, Rene Ritchie, who's from Canada, and he said,  that sets a bad precedent for a country taxing income from another country.  And so I think that probably this is a non-starter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is going to be a fight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anyway, so those are the...  Let me just say this about Google.  In full disclosure, I own Google stock.  I ain't selling it.  It's going to do amazingly for a long time to come, I still believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Would you buy Facebook stock?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I wish I'd bought it long ago.  Right.  Yeah.  I think the thing is about Facebook, that as a user, I'm not as engaged as I wish I  were to fully understand where Facebook is and it's going.  You know what I mean?  That's my issue there.  I'm engaged in Google+.  Mike and I are the two wackos in the world who are.  With Facebook, I delve in all the time.  I just am not as into it as I think I should be to understand where their business is going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But Facebook.com is not where their business is going.  Their business is going in a million different apps and they're really aggressive and they're  being successful.  And I would definitely buy Facebook stock.  And I think their monopoly on everybody is growing to the point of no return.  Nobody cares how bad Facebook is.  That's where everybody is.  And so you've got to be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What about the argument we hear, though, Mike, all the time, oh, but my kids aren't on Facebook.  Now they're on WhatsApp and they're on Instagram.  Is that the answer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they're also not using email, but they will.  They'll come around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They are using Snapchat.  I know it for a fact because Nick Bilton told me so.  And if you haven't seen Nick Bilton's Snapchat instruction to me on Twitter on Sunday, you  got to watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you really know what the kids...  I'm a believer.  The kids use Snapchat.  You'll know that kids are using Snapchat when Facebook buys Snapchat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Didn't Facebook try to buy Snapchat?  They did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They did.  But maybe they'll throw $20 billion at it or something like that.  That's a lot of money.  A lot more than WhatsApp.  The thing is that Facebook is, whenever they see a category that is threatening where people  are going, they'll go and snap it up before people can go there, essentially.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Look at WhatsApp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The kids aren't as dumb as they look.  And they're also very fickle.  So they're both smart and fickle.  And I talked to my son, Henry, who's 20.  You have a young son, two young sons, so you kind of know, too.  But I had Henry over the Christmas break and about six of his friends, all the same, all  college students.  I said, you use Facebook?  No, that's what our parents use.  Do you use Twitter?  We use it to message each other for fun.  It's a hoot.  They don't use it the same way we do.  Do you use WhatsApp?  No.  One guy used it with his French girlfriend.  That's it.  What do you use?  Snapchat?  All the time.  A little bit of Instagram, but mostly Snapchat all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But Snapchat is the social network for fickle people, as you said.  Yeah.  And it's like once they have kids and the kids...  Maybe they'll come to Facebook.  Facebook is the inevitable.  That's where the gravitational center of the black hole is.  I mean, it's like people get sucked into it one way or the other eventually.  Most people do, not everybody.  And so, yeah, when you're like Henry, you're in college, you've got a bunch of young friends,  probably half his friends he met within the last two years.  There are no baby pictures.  You're right.  And it's like that's a place where you can come and go.  Next year will be something else.  I guarantee it.  There'll be another platform that they will have left Snapchat for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's what I mean.  They're fickle, so you can't really predict...  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do me a favor and just go to snapchat.com right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think there is a web interface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There is.  There is.  And what's striking about it is the big media brands that are there.  Oh, yeah.  This just happened.  Yeah, this is phenomenal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you seen Katie Couric and what she's doing on Snapchat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A little bit, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's very intriguing.  Let me show you.  She's doing news on Snapchat.  So they just added on Snapchat a...  I've been logged out.  I'm not going to log in.  Well, so what she does is you only get...  How long is it?  Ten seconds per snap.  And they die, by the way, after 24 hours even if nobody looks at them.  She's doing one story, very nicely produced.  In fact, there must be a tool, like a desktop tool for these brands.  Because there are people doing content on Snapchat.  That's what you're seeing here.  Yeah.  So, okay, let me go back into Snapchat.  Yeah, they're using YouTube stars.  Yeah, here's Snap...  You press the discover button.  These are all the different brands.  CNN, Comedy Central, Cosmopolitan.  But here's Yahoo.  Watch what...  I don't know if you'll be able to hear this, but watch what Katie Couric is doing.  It's really...  Or I guess Yahoo is doing, we should probably say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A TransAsia flight carrying 58 hits a highway bridge before crashing into a river in Taiwan.  23 are dead, 20 missing, but there are survivors.  That's a new story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's going to repeat.  But then if I want, I swipe to the next one.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  ...the suburbs of New York City strikes a car on the track.  Geez.  ...the communists are forced to flee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A commuter train in the suburbs of New York City...  So that repeat, and then I swipe again, another story.  Now, I don't know what value, I don't know if they can monetize this.  It's obviously, I think...  Certainly branding, I mean Katie...  I asked Nick on this because Nick has just wrote a New York Times piece singing Snapchat sprays.  I said, are these brands wasting their money?  He said, absolutely.  Yeah.  This is great for Snapchat, but I got to tell you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not for Katie Couric, here's why.  Because I think that Marissa Meyer hiring her, I expected it would draw audience to it, but people just know she's there.  Right, yeah.  And once she's there, I think that's branding that's important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you really think that anybody who uses Snapchat goes, oh, there's Katie Couric, she's on Yahoo News now.  Well, here's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, let me do another full disclosure.  Is that Katie is in fact an indeed an extremely nice person, and I imposed like crazy on her for her to speak to my daughter's school about women in media, and she agreed to do it.  So I love Katie right now.  I do too.  Katie's absolutely sweet as can be.  She's as nice as she seems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did she ever find out what internet was though?  That was the greatest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's part of her.  She's willing to make fun of herself, and I think she's trying very hard to be innovative.  And so I think there's an audience of people who, really young people, didn't watch Katie Couric on the Today Show.  They didn't watch her on CBS.  So if somebody knew, you know, Yahoo News, who knows, I think it's worth the shot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was telling Mike, I think we should do TNT this way.  Yeah, exactly.  We should take the top five stories on TNT and make little Snapchats out of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it'll take us five minutes.  So that part of it is interesting.  The big brand, the big names, all that kind of stuff, ESPN people, Vice and so on.  That's the part that's going to fail, I think, on Snapchat.  There's another thing that I think is really interesting, which is that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can see my son watching this because this is just highlight clips, and this is about his attention span of six seconds.  Yeah.  And so...  Why did you choose Auburn over Florida?  Actually, this seems to me... the ESPN thing makes sense to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It does make sense.  I'm not sure... the big problem is that people approach Snapchat with a mindset about what they want to do with it.  And it's not... it's a communications medium, and so they have an uphill battle convincing people to embrace that as a content...  you know, passive content reception, you know, medium.  But Snapchat is also launching something called Snapper Hero, which are YouTube celebrities like Shonduras McBride and Freddie Wong and others.  And what's interesting about that is that these episodes will run for about two minutes.  And what they're doing is they're trying to... when you see these YouTube celebrities, they're almost like one of your friends sending you a goofy video.  So they're trying to train users to use video a lot more because video is the most powerful medium.  It's the most eye-grabbing medium, eyeball-catching and attention-grabbing medium there is.  And so everybody's trying to get people to use video, and they're using these YouTube stars to get people to sort of train them into this behavior of sharing videos.  Wow, this is just...  Which is different from Katie Kirk. People are not going to launch news programs when they see Katie Kirk.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What was Nick's argument about the wonder of Snapchat and why Snapchat's... I'll watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's using Snapchat's stories, which I find interesting, which is really kind of the individual's way of doing this,  which is doing short little stories that are all linked together.  So if I... I could actually do one, if I could figure...  The other thing that's weird about Snapchat is I don't... the user interface is bizarre.  I don't even... I don't know how to get out of anything.  All right, here we go.  So I can record something. We'll do something real quickly here.  Put the camera around.  It's another Snapchat story from Twitter!  And then I can add... I could add text or whatever.  And then you add it to this, and now it's part of a story which anybody can watch. You can have lots of pieces in your story.  Just very much like the Katie Kirk thing or the ESPN thing.  People can subscribe to you. It's not, you know, messages from friends.  So Baratunde's doing that. Actually, I wish I could show you Bilton's yesterday, but it's gone.  The other thing that's weird is that it goes away, right?  So this is Snapatunde.  He's using a lot of text.  I don't know. I just... there's something interesting about this.  Nick really feels like this is a communications medium for a new generation.  And that they... the kids... it's the kids.  And of course, as you know from being in media, Jeff, for years, everybody wants the kids.  Yep.  How can we get the kids? What are the kids doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why would anybody want the kids?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. Screw the kids.  That's why I turned off Amber Alerts.  We're going to take a break.  I've decided my new persona is going to be grumpy.  We're going to take a break, come back with more. We've got a good panel, I tell you.  It's always great with Jeff Jarvis, Mike Yelgin, talking to Google, talk about stuff.  But first, let's talk a little bit about LegalZoom.com.  If you're starting a business, if you've got a family, legal costs can really eat you alive.  In fact, probably it's enough that it's kept you from getting that will  or the healthcare power of attorney or a financial power of attorney.

It's a really great idea.  Project Tango. What is Project Tango?  It's the phone thing, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is this the era?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  3D mapping.  Oh, it's 3D mapping.  Oh, that's the 3D mapping. That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a physical hardware prototype device that has powerful chips in it that essentially can instant, very quickly, 3D map indoor spaces, which can be used for a million things.  For gaming, for augmented reality.  Maybe E911.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So spinning it out means it's still part of Google, but it's just no longer going to be in the advanced technology group. It's going to be a little bit more real, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When this happened to Google Glass, everybody said Google Glass was dead. When they said, it's a real product now, everybody said, see, it's dead. No, it's a real product now.  They're going to sell this?  Yes, absolutely. Well, this is a device that is something of a reference platform.  Could you put it on a smartphone?  It looks like it's something.  Yes, it is. It's a modified phone that has graphics chips in it that until a year ago or two years ago only existed in very powerful computers.  So it's high end, kind of expensive, but you can imagine unbelievable.  When Microsoft rolled out the HoloLens, everybody said, wow, this is the future. This is amazing. Yes, that is the future. That experience is going to be a massive platform.  Just like you said, Leo, on several shows, that this is a whole new platform, but I'm not so sure that Microsoft is going to own it.  This is going to be enabling that sort of device. You'll be able to plug in a headset into this thing and walk around with this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just think that the opportunity for sight impaired people is unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you can use this not only to map, but once mapped, you can use it to navigate around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, take me to the bathroom. Just right there. The power of that. And then put in things like Internet of Things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it would give you, it would say, okay, walk three steps and turn left, that kind of thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It will not only know where the hall is, where the door is, it'll know that there's a toy truck right in front of you.  Don't step on that. Walk around the dog. The dog is walking right. I mean, it's real time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's seeing as well as something that's already recorded. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah. And it's constantly mapping and recording and seeing all at the same time. It's not instant instant, but it's relatively high fidelity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's in a mobile phone. So you think this will be involved with the leap motion technologies that Google also has invested in or is that a separate kind of thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm pretty sure that that's a separate kind of thing. I'm actually this is all the stuff the investors said. Get out of this stuff. Stick to your knitting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they were wrong about spending money on this. What are you nuts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I actually think that I have a feeling that the leap motion is probably a little bit ahead of Microsoft's HoloLens.  But and I don't think this is related to leap motion. This is this is all about making a sort of indoor mapping like highly mobile.  And I don't think your Galaxy S7 is going to have this technology in it. I don't think this is going to be a looks like it's a dedicated thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it'll be a higher end device. But maybe it will be something like a Galaxy S7. They've got to find ways to put stuff. That's a good point to make to distinguish the next generation of phones.  We've already kind of hit the the wall and what new stuff you can do. Yeah. So there's still project era.  But Project Tango exits the advanced technology and projects group to become perhaps a real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's interesting too is not now imagine Street View. Right inside fully mapping the inside world. Right.  And you know, a mall that that then you start to map to merchandise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As long as we're talking blue sky, this is another project out of Google's X projects. Google is making human skin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. So that so that they can cure cancer. They have a cancer. They're working on a type of tech cancer. Detect cancer. Yes, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which, wait a minute. So they've been making synthetic human skin to create a wristband that can detect cancer or heart attacks or other diseases.  Right. This is a little creepy. This video from the Atlantic shows two disembodied arms. It's the beginning of Google making human beings. That's what it's about.  Wow. They they use nanoparticles. Wait a minute. They use net. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.  This these synthetic skin strips are using nanoparticles to search in my body for disease. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, the skin strips. That's what it says here. The skin strips are being used to test this technology that uses nanoparticles to detect cancer.  Well, they don't have the nanoparticles yet. Right. But they want to be ready with the skin strips.  They want. They want. So the condensed version is that they're working on technology that will enable a bracelet to detect cancer using magnetic nanoparticles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you would swallow the pill containing the nanoparticles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the arm and the skin are they have the same light sort of absorbing properties as human skin and other qualities of human skin so they can test it without doing something weird to some real human's wrists.  So the artificial skin, the artificial arm part of it is is it is it's a test dummy for their technology that would detect cancer with a bracelet. It's a search engine company. Of course they're doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Of course they're doing it. Google. Google is going to replace you not with a robot but with an artificial human. That's it. Let's let's just be honest. Advertiser support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what we feared and it's happening. I'm kind of thrilled that is this is Larry or is it is it Sergey Sergey.  I'm kind of thrilled that Sergey has decided I got more money than God. What should I do with it? I'm going to you know blue sky stuff support blue sky stuff.  And better yet instead of just leaving Google and you know having a secret lab in a mountain volcano somewhere. I'm going to do it inside Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's more than that. I think it's Bell Labs. Yeah I think it's the role that AT&T had once in this country where we're going to do things about space and we're going to admit the transistor and was Bell Labs stuff as goofy as this.  There was not not quite as goofy but there was pure research there was absolutely pure and Unix came out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See came out of it much of what we use is modern computing came out of Bell Labs as you said the transistor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I think that what Bell Labs did was all about computing and electricity and that sort of thing.  What this is all about is I think that Sergey and in particular and Google in general tend to see Google as the experts in using massive data sets data creative things to solve problems in a way that used to require a lot more money a lot more people and a lot more time.  And so you know I think that they see this is identical to the search engine business because you're basically doing lots of data crunching and figuring out all these things like you remember Sergey's wife.  They're still married runs 23 and me and I'm sure that they have had many conversations about how you could use big data number crunching to figure out all kinds of correlations about health.  Oh people who are left handed and also live in Utah you know never get cancer whatever I mean whatever the you know these unexpected and they're right about that he's right about that you can make some you could do so much good in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right and by the way there's probably some profit in all of this too.  I mean I'm sure there is I think one of the things Google does recognize we've talked about this before that the search thing isn't going to last forever and you've got to have the next thing and I'm sure that's what Bell Labs is up to.  So here's an interesting thing you can be your own technical director Jason Howell has always dreamt someday of being able to watch video and switch the angles this is a YouTube performer named Madeline Bailey she's the first to have switchable angle so right now we're on this angle.  But let's say you'd like to see a side view.  Wow, does it have the same that is the same video.  And now he's talking so let's go look at him.  But you wonder what she's thinking while Arnold is talking or let's get all of the.  It's too bad it's wasted on such horrible programming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah well imagine the back there.  What is just three cameras.  Imagine the 30 cameras you have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would love to be able to do this.  What do we have to do to get into this project we actually have content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We almost already have this with the drop cams.  Yeah, we do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We have six drop cams you can just switch from.  But not as I like how fast this is.  This is like you know I've always thought this would be kind of interesting.  We actually have dreamt of doing this for a long time at Twit since almost day one.  We're 10 years old.  But I realized I had to have a separate stream for each camera.  And I was thinking of a user interface where you could do that where you could cut back and forth.  Back and forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Then you got to have a website.  Yeah but you can't afford a website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I had to bring that up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Please.  Sorry.  Switchable angles says computer vision or CompuVision or Charm Switchable Angles was a part of the DVD standard 20 years ago.  Just nobody did it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Huh.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I remember that.  I don't remember that dimly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Before the DVD what was the big the big disk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Laser disk.  Yeah.  And Blu-ray also has angles.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean I don't know.  I feel like.  Don't most people just want to watch though.  I feel like this is your job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Whatever happened to the lean back experience.  Yeah it's my job.  I do it as a job.  When I'm at home about to put on a concert I suppose it's neat to be able to do something like this.  But am I really going to sit on my couch or at my computer and watch an hour long video and switch camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't want to replace your remote control with a TriCaster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well but imagine how you could create programming that would be made for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Totally.  Totally.  Well I think porn could benefit from this.  Oh yeah.  This is interesting.  There it is.  All right.  There you've seen it.  It's an experiment.  Madeline Bailey is doing it on her YouTube channel.  YouTube Music Night performance there.  And that's how you switch around.  It's cool.  I mean it's not a hard thing to do.  I think Alex Lindsay did something like this as well.  What is smart lock.  Should we do this story.  What is smart.  This is driving me nutty.  What is smart lock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Smart lock is so that you don't have to unlock your computer when your phone is nearby.  If you have Android 5 and if you have Chrome.  Oh I like it.  I like it.  OK.  So you think you would think you would think that I have all people will be able to do  that.  Yes Mr. Picson.  No no no no because guess what.  What.  Google Apps accounts get screwed again and you got to march through all kinds of hoops  and light them on fire and I still haven't been able to make it work.  I Google fanboy have not been able to make this friggin work.  And while I'm at this something else has changed.  So that now even though I'm signed into my apps account every window is my apps account  it's all apps accounts when I open a new a new Google app it defaults to my Google plus  Gmail account.  So I try to I try to open something in Docs.  It opens it up in the wrong damn account because Google can't figure in this out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  But that's in other words this is actually a really cool feature that that gets screwed  up when you have multiple accounts because as you said Google can't figure that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It gets incredibly screwed up and I still have not been able to to get this going because  there's there's complicated.  You have to go in into the ad apps admin account.  There's the Chrome thing which is hidden in other apps.  Then you have to go in there and find the place where you say OK OK you can use this  neat new feature and then you need to restart and then you need to find it.  I still can't find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't understand how this is like super different from the feature that you know the  member.  I think they first introduced it on the Moto X where you had the Bluetooth thing and then  you also even have a little magnetic.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But you could also do with your phone or whatever.  They do that now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In fact Moto X if you're you know it's a trusted Bluetooth network it just unlocks it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then of course this concept is going to be huge in the Internet of Things and home  automation because this will unlock everything turn on lights turn out that it'll be like  Bill Gates's house.  We were going to wear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think you were going to wear your electronic identity.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it should be your smartphone.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think it's your smartphone.  I think your smartphone is just another accessory.  Did you ever get into Bill Gates's house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No never did.  I always tried to but the guards security.  Yeah.  Because I remember when he built it and this was 10 15 years ago.  The idea was you would walk in a room he would already know what painting he was going to  know what paintings you liked what pictures you'd be issued a pin of some kind of device

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that you could sense you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And the paintings would change on the TV screens in the room to match your your your needs.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm afraid that I'd walk in to be some Thomas concave horrible crap.  Jeff Jeffers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have no taste.  Painter of light.  I think that's kind of I wonder do you think like it's been around as it was they put it  in 15 years ago like it's kind of dusty and faded and it doesn't work anymore.  It's like in the corner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It'll be like tomorrow land at Disneyland.  Welcome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Welcome.  Welcome.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I feel like what do you think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think I would like to get into Bill Gates house now.  Yeah.  And like just see how much of that crap they've just turned off.  Yes.  Like yeah that was not a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  I'm sure that's true.  It's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's it's it's actually not so much the guards it's the wall and the dogs.  Yeah.  But if I'm I'm working on it.  Yeah.  I shouldn't say that because then they're going to come to Microsoft.  Microsoft police.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No it's Apple that has the police.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think Microsoft probably has police.  Just just get with the program.  Use a drone like everybody else.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One of Bill's books had a virtual tour of his house says Fred Flintstone who has a mighty  nice house himself.  I might add he has to do everything with his furry feet.  Google's secret weapon in the battle for the Internet of Things.  Speaking of IOT academia according to this article in Fast Company.  Tina Mirtha.  Google's not adverse to using university brain power for a lot of what it's doing.  Maggie Johnson Google's research Google research is director of education and university relations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They have a grant program called Open Web of Things to attract talent to the company.  You know they they they've already hired a huge number of academics.  They're kind of it's almost borderline brain drain.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Situation and they've always had more PhDs than any company in America.  Right.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well you know there's there's an interesting precedent set just today that I'm forgetting  his name a former Guardian journalist who does visualization at Twitter is now also  in addition to that and contributing editor at Vox.  He's going to keep his Twitter job but also be a contributor to Vox which is interesting  because I wonder what other media companies will think about that.  Well you know you're working for Vox.  Are you going to give us the nice stuff or not.  Yeah really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google's giving we mentioned that Intel is spending how much was it three hundred million  dollars million yeah to encourage diversity technology Google not to be left behind and  said we'll give seven hundred seventy five thousand dollars.  Million no thousand million yeah thousand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep.  They're giving a grant to code 2040.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Intel gave three hundred million dollars.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that I believe is for gender diversity.  This is for diversity to get more minorities into technology.  I think Intel does that does it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  But yeah.  Do they.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well this is my memory but code 2040 has free training programs for black and Latino  college is great students.  Great.  Right.  And I think this is this is this is the kind of thing.  Although it's surprising how little it is for in terms of Google dollars Google bucks.  But they would love to hire more women and minorities and it's a it's a systemic deep  cultural problem right that is more than just hiring people who you know.  And so this is a little part of it.  You know boosting engineering students at the college level is is one tiny way to do  it.  But there's it's it's it's barely going to touch the issue as far as I'm concerned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well same in our industry Mike.  You know yeah.  CUNY prides itself on being diverse and we are highly diverse but we can never do it  enough.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The problem with journalism journalism journalism has a special problem in that the education  that you need in order to be a journalist can you can make a lot more money not being  a journalist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Amen.  That's exactly the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so and so if you if you're if you're from if you're from a family you're if your parents  immigrated from another country or something like that and you're the one person to ever  go to an American university and you go through it all and you have all this education.  Everybody's going to be disappointed if you take that vow of poverty and become a journalist.  They're going to want you to go to Wall Street or going to you know do something where you  can make a lot more money.  So that's a big big problem.  Not so much in technology but that still exists as well because people think that everybody  in Silicon Valley makes a ton of money.  They don't really.  You know you're you know good good engineers make pretty good money.  But when you have to live in Silicon Valley and pay the cost of living it ends up being  you know you barely middle class.  So it's a it's a it's kind of a big problem and you know at least you're doing something  I guess that's something that can be said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But this is also an argument to say that you know break up the Silicon Valley technology  ghetto and do development all around the country which is happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes it is and it isn't.  It's there's a lot of that stuff going on but there's still there's still no substitute  for that intense kind of incubator in the air kind of feeling in Silicon Valley.  It's there's there's a lot to be said for that.  And there was a study recently that looked at the degree to which that sort of synergistic  quality of the culture of Silicon Valley actually had material benefits for the success of  companies and stuff like that.  It is good to see it being diversified and every week there's another article that like  this is the next Silicon Valley and it's you know Des Moines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well I guess speaking in New York and we're going to we're going to do good stuff here  soon I hope.  You know we do now have a robust technology and investment scene in New York and it does  feed on itself and there is a critic there's a point of critical mass but I think we have  it now in New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think what's really happening that that's kind of skewing the picture is that a lot  of what we talk about in terms of technology is writing an app right and writing an app  you can write an app if you specialize in something very highly special you can do that  literally anywhere and you can get you know you can get rich.  You know a tiny minority will get rich doing it.  A lot of the technology though that isn't writing an app you know sort of deep enterprise  software or real hardware that that has to integrate with other things or you know get  into the biotech that's happening a lot of the food technology that's happening in Silicon  Valley.  That stuff is harder to do when you're I mean New York is you know Silicon Alley is of course  is a hotbed of technology.  Massachusetts a lot of areas like that but if you talk about outside of the major cities  that's something you really need to go to a place like Silicon Valley or New York City  or London or someplace like that where you can find lots of support and infrastructure  and where you can hire people.  You know a lot of a lot of it is where are the universities that specialize in certain  things.  I mean so if you look at New York one of the things that New York is just amazing at in  terms of the population there is the number of people who are in science especially oddly  enough science journalism.  All the science journalists are in New York and half of those are in Brooklyn.  They all work for the New Yorker.  Yes and it's like and they're very hard to find in Silicon Valley.  That's interesting.  It really is really kind of odd but again where are the universities.  You know they're going to you're going to find clusters of certain types of people in  Massachusetts near Harvard etc.  And MIT and so on.  And so and so you know and let's face it I mean Silicon Valley exists because of Stanford.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What did you think of this editorial from the New York Times yesterday against the right  to be forgotten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's exactly what we've all been saying for several months and it's nice to see them  sort of saying it now finally.  But but yeah that's the that's the basic argument.  Once there's a precedent set where governments can say you can't say this on the search engines  everybody's going to want a piece of that.  So China and Turkey and Iran and everybody's going to want to say well here's our version  of the right to be forgotten.  We want people to forget the Armenian genocide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Times editorial board wrote this position is deeply troubling because it could lead to  censorship by public officials who want to whitewash the past.  It also sets a terrible example for officials in other countries who might want to demand that  Internet companies remove links they don't like.  There's no doubt the Internet has made it harder for governments to enforce certain rules and laws  because information is not easily contained within borders.  But that does not justify restricting the information available to citizens of other countries.  It's a free speech issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know back from back from Davos the media council of which I'm a member had a important  discussion about freedom of speech starting with peril to journalists.  But also this is right after Charlie Hebdo.  It's sobering when you get into a truly international audience how few people around the  world hold to the free speech absolute as few that we Americans have.  And I think that that's that's part of where the right to be forgotten comes from even even in a  very progressive land of Europe.  This idea that there's a balancing of speech and and I don't buy that myself.  I think it's very important to say there's a right to remember.  It's very important to say you can't control knowledge.  You can't rewrite history.  I think the times a little overdoing it but I'm really glad they wrote that wrote the editorial.  Now at the same time Google had a frankly handpicked group of people studying this and  without any particular surprise they said that right to be forgotten should stick to Europe and  should not be worldwide.  At the same time the EU is going to try to impose their will on the whole world.  And I say to them the hell with you.  You're not going to affect my speech here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No I have a theory about that Jeff.  You talked about the idea that Americans tend to be more passionate or more absolutist about free  speech than elsewhere including Europe.  And my theory is that that's not entirely the case.  I think what's different is that I think Americans take the Internet more seriously as a  bonafide source of content and information than other places.  I think I get the feeling that in Europe they would never ever try to impose the same kinds of  restrictions in novels, in academic studies, in other types of content, other media.  But the Internet, oh that's just a confection.  It's just this like superficial thing that's annoying that's you know it's not real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's exactly right and I think it's not just the Internet.  It goes back to when I was a TV critic.  I would try to defend television and people would restrict television in a way that they would  never consider doing to books.  I even objected, I even got into a tiff with Ed Markey on a TV show many, many, many years ago  about the V chip that's in cable boxes by government regulation.  And it never came to pass, my worst fear is, but the worst fear was that if you're the so-called  Parrot's Television Council, the Howard Stern enemies, you'll just get every show that you don't  possibly like with a scarlet letter with a V on it so that it can be blocked across the market.  And technology would be a handmaiden to censorship.  So you're right.  I think that we hold books to be holy in every other medium, pretty much every other medium.  If you consider the kind of censorship that's occurred in movies over the years and television  and the Internet is seen as less, but it's all speech or as the Cloutier Manifesto would say,  it's all conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  And we see this type of attitude all over the place.  For example, there's a video game called Hotline Miami 2, which was banned in Australia because  there's a rape scene in it.  And so there are a lot of people talking about this, the chattering classes are talking about this  and saying, oh, well, it's good because, you know, but apply that to novels.  Should we say that it should be illegal to have depictions of rape in novels?  What about books?  What about scientific studies about rape?  Should those be banned?  I mean, what is it about video games?  And this, by the way, is a this video game is a satire or a criticism of violent video games like  Grand Theft Auto.  That's what the game is.  It's using the video game format to sort of expose to ridiculous extremes what these games are like.  And to ban it on that basically says, OK, this is not a legitimate art form like painting.  You would never you would never put such restrictions on painters or photographers or any of the older  existing communications media.  And this is just an ongoing issue that we're going to have to grapple with.  Eventually, I think that, you know, the kid and by the way, it has to be said, I mentioned that  Europeans tend to not take the Internet as seriously.  I don't think that's the case among most European populations.  That's not the people.  That's the bureaucrats who are that and were entirely different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is comedically bloody.  Yes.  Yeah, it's a ridiculous.  We probably shouldn't show it.  I mean, I don't want to get banned in Australia.  It's almost 8-bit.  I mean, it's it is a bit from top down.  It's very it's it's obviously tongue in cheek.  But but I think you read is an excellent point.  I mean, I think that comes from a out of date notion that video games are for kids.  Yeah. And that's obviously out of date.  Right. So speaking of kids, Google has bought TuneTastic, a storyteller app created by Launchpad  Games and asked it today.  They didn't say how much, but they have made TuneTastic free.  I'm not familiar with it.  It's for the iPad.  It's a modern day puppet show.  You can record them and share them with others.  And Google's working, I guess, on I don't know what.  Maybe this is for the new children's YouTube.  I don't know what this is for.  Actually, that might be an interesting thing.  If they have been rumored to be working on YouTube for kids, maybe let kids make their own videos in this in this kind of context.  It's not the only acquisition.  Microsoft, according to TechCrunch today, bought Sunrise, which is a calendar app we've used and recommended.  We really love on iOS and Android.  Earlier, they bought you may remember they bought a complete.  They've turned that into Outlook for iOS.  It sounds like they're Microsoft is acquiring other mobile developers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's so weird to see Microsoft becoming a company that doesn't have a problem about other mobile platforms.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think this is a new Microsoft and I'm welcome.  Rolling Stone has teamed up with Google Play.  To monetize their archives.  So Google Play has a magazine stand, which I'd forgotten because I never use it.  But they're going to take, I guess, archival articles, issues, says three to four major stories from each archive issue for free on Google Play.  And then I guess all the be kind of fun to get old Rolling Stones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I use Google Play news all the time.  I use the news, which is really great little app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't replace current, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I think it's actually very good.  I don't know.  That's the thing.  I don't.  I was just thinking I used to I used to buy magazines by the pound.  Yeah, I love it.  I started a magazine and and the magazine stand I used to buy the most from in Jersey City was near my old office.  I just saw they tore down and it's gone.  You can't find newsstands anywhere.  I don't buy magazines anymore.  I walk by newsstands now and think I don't I don't even go into them anymore.  Yeah.  So I don't have the reflex to buy them on an app.  Yeah, I'm the same way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We it's all about deep links and going article by article, not even site by site, but article by article.  Yeah.  Which it really kind of is a problem, I think, for the long term health of article aggregators.  We used to call them magazines.  Yeah, I remember that.  Yeah.  You know what I just did that we had so much fun on our vacation reading the New York Times newspaper every morning.  I read it every day.  I just subscribe to the daily delivery of New York Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a joy.  I really like it.  Yeah, I got today's isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then I get this is what I used to do when I was a radio talk show host.  I would cut take a razor blade cut out articles, put them in a folder, bring them to work.  Yeah, morgue file.  Now I keep clicking on the article trying to share it.  Nothing happens.  I keep telling people this and they don't believe me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I look at a screen 12 hours a day and it's like it's the most digital, the most technology obsessed people who need print reading material like the New York Times.  I don't.  Is a better interface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can scan more articles faster.  It seems like there are more articles in the print edition than I mean, I've been reading the New York Times and Wall Street Journal online for years.  It seems like there's more stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the benefits that the online and digital versions of articles, they always pitch as a benefit.  The idea that you can find what you want, which means that you don't find what you don't think you want.  There's less serendipity.  The New York Times on print forces you to go.  Yeah, I can.  You know, I can I can talk intelligently about all kinds of conflicts and issues around the world that are happening that nobody else has even heard of because they're never for especially international.  You're exactly right.  That's right.  Especially internationally.  We get we know all about the plane crashes in Taiwan.  We know all about the big splashy stuff that has crazy video.  We don't know about the little the little conflicts that are really shaping the world.  And it's it's a real problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff, we're trying to support this whole journalism thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I think you're holding up that you're extending the past.  Needlessly.  The New York Times that we subscribe to the New York Times.  The reason we do is because it's cheaper than subscribing to New York Times digital only.  Yeah.  Because print subscribers are worth more.  So they're artificially pumping up the print.  And New York Times has now hit.  They say they're going to hit a million digital subscribers this year, which is very impressive.  I must say it would be much higher if they didn't if they didn't have that that that's artificial support for print.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Well, you know, but it has to be said that I think that the real solution that is needed here is not that everybody like start reading a black and white newspaper.  Again, and getting a home delivery and all that stuff.  The solution is that we need to figure out a way to make digital devices do what the New York Times does, which is expose you to sort of serendipitously to all kinds of things that you are not thinking of at the moment and aren't necessarily related to the kinds of things that you're normally interested in.  I mean, one of the crazy things about the New York Times and I've been subscribing since I was in college is that you flip through it and you're seeing stuff that you just would never even think of.  Well, what's happening in stage performances in London?  You know, every once in a while there's there are articles like that that are incredibly interesting and very enlightening and related and relevant to other things that you're thinking about and doing and so on.  You'd never in a million years see if you were using Google's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, so so you're arguing for serendipity and editors like to think that they are the sole proprietors of serendipity.  But I'm going to go to your favorite service.  I was on a plane coming back from Davos and I and I opened up Google Plus on the plane.  I had no Wi-Fi, but I just looked at the page that was already loaded there and I opened seven new tabs of interesting things that I saw that when I landed, I wanted to look at Twitter.  You get serendipity from that.  I think it's interesting that the plane newsstand versus Google News and Google News is an overload and it's everything.  And I don't think they've thought through what Google News can be.  And play is so brand oriented.  There's something in the middle that will do a better job of giving you serendipity across brands.  People have tried that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Twitter people have tried that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, flip board.  That's Google News, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't Google News all about serendipity, you know, across brand serendipity?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's trying to be kind of everything.  And it doesn't you know, the irony to me is that Google News doesn't personalize much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You guys are overlooking something very important.  The New York Times print edition is very soft and absorbent as well.  Yes, it is.  You can use the clean windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Try that with Google Play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Try that with my tablet.  Oh, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  Use flash here.  The wait is over.  My.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ah, five oh two as well.  Miracle.  Now, wait a minute. Now, is that a Verizon?  Is that a LTE one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, no. Verizon is T-Mobile.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it is LTE.  I got it on my Wi-Fi Nexus seven months ago.  So good.  I don't know why I had to wait so long.  Now you can unlock your Chromebook with it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Don't get me started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to talk to you about websites.  You're not nice to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, they've already said Android 5.1.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm already behind.  Is on the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's going to ship on Android One phones.  What is an Android One phone, Jason?  I don't even know what that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the cheap one in India.  That's in Indonesia?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the low cost Micro Max devices in India.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They get Android 5.1 lollypop before everybody else.  Are they trying to piss us off?  I like that.  That's just.  Are they trying to get us angry here now?  Then Nexus devices.  When is it going to come?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if we have a date on that.  It's out in Indonesia.  There are devices running 5.1 right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who's been doing that a lot lately?  They're launching their Aura smartphone in Puerto Rico.  That makes sense.  From what?  From food trucks.  No, you're kidding.  Food trucks are the distribution mechanism for Aura.  No, you're kidding me.  I'm not kidding.  I'm going.  We should bring Padre and everybody down there.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You mean you get some fried plantains and an Aura phone?  I hope so.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hope so.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, I'm done.  I don't want to talk about Sanogen.  We kind of talked about it before.  Microsoft has invested money in them.  There is one note.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  From last week's show, it was after the show, I think,  when we mentioned that Microsoft was investing in Cyanogen.  I was wondering why Cyanogen was so hostile to Google.  I have to say that does eventually...  Maybe now you know.  Or the other way around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Microsoft said, hey, we like these guys.  They said they're going to kill Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Should we have a five seconds of silence for Radio Shack?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This has been the longest goodbye in history.  It's like a Hollywood death scene, isn't it?  We knew they were running out of money.  Now they're talking about selling some of their stores to Sprint.  Amazon.  Amazon wants to buy a handful.  For what, distribution centers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Distribution centers to also as little mini Apple stores  to show off their hardware devices.  But also mostly pick up locations instead of having lockers,  which they tried at 7-Eleven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They have one test, and I think it's in Indiana,  Purdue or someplace...  Both have...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they're not tests.  They're full in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I actually think this is kind of terrible.  Radio Shack was...  There were thousands of stores,  and it was the one place in many areas of the country  where you could get electronics parts.  They kind of got away from that.  I think that's one of the reasons.  We talked about this like two months ago  when we first heard they were in trouble.  But I feel like they missed the boat.  If Radio Shack had said,  no, we're going to go after the maker movement.  We're going to become an electronics center,  a hobby center.  They might have survived.  Becoming another place to buy a smartphone  seems like a bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The problem is that we're familiar with Fry's out here.  And Fry's is like...  Imagine a Radio Shack that's the size of a Costco.  And this really works,  especially there's several of them in Silicon Valley.  They're packed to the gills.  They also sell electronics and vacuum cleaners in Washington.  Even in areas where people are smart enough

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and wired enough to buy online,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  they still go to brick and mortar.  Exactly.  The problem with Radio Shack  is that they existed in an era  where to have an electronic device  was to tinker with it in some way,  or program it, or whatever.  And nowadays, people just want to buy this appliance  and forget about it,  except for the makers.  And the world is so much more complex now.  A store that would really serve the maker community  would have to be enormous.  Maybe, yeah.  And Radio Shacks are tiny.  They have all these retail outlets,  more than 4,000 of them.  They used to have a lot more.  4,000, wow.  But these are tiny little stores  that can't really serve.  They can have soldering irons and batteries  and things like that.  But really, a real maker person is,  Radio Shack's not big enough  to hold all the things they might need.  Unless they were 3D printing it,  in which case that might make sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe this is the right end.  They sell it to Sprint.  They become Sprint stores, about half of them.  The rest, Amazon, Amazon Shack, they could call it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why not sell it to Google?  Google, you got the money.  Buy these.  I've lost all of my hardware devices in there.  They were going to build barges.  Because they're doing all these weird things.  No, just go the straight way.  Get Radio Shack, put all your Nexus in your Nest  and all your whatever in there,  and people can actually play with them.  Who needs the food truck?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's an outside chance that some of these stores  may become co-branded Radio Shack.  And remember, Radio Shack's not going out of business.  They're declaring bankruptcy.  They may co-brand them with Sprint.  So they become Sprint Radio Shack stores.  That's the dark horse outcome.  But that is one of the possibilities here  that has to be mentioned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Brookstone is also evaluating, right?  Brookstone's thinking about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a high-tech company for you.  Get the massager.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Brookstone is like the next to go.  Exactly.  Out of the frying pan into the fire.  Let's take a break when we come back.  I've got a cool tool.  Jeff's got a number.  And we're going to let Mike find a thing.  Look for your thing, Mike.  It's got to be here somewhere.  Where'd you see it last?  You don't want to know.  Our show today brought to you by lynda.com.

I think it really is tough times for brick and mortar right now.  Really tough.  But who was it?  Was it you, Jeff?  Somebody was saying that the future, if you really want to look at the future of retail,  it's in high touch, high service.  It's not being a place where people go to buy stuff.  It's marketing.  Yes, it's about marketing.  It's about training.  It's about creating a relationship.  There's so much you can do with it.  And I think about the independent bookstores that have survived.  They're not trying to compete with Amazon.  They're not putting every book on the shelf.  They have book signings, author speaking.  They have smart clerks who can help you find the right book.  I mean, it's about service.  And I think there is an opportunity still for brick and mortar.  I don't see every store closing downtown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When was the last time you were in a Best Buy?  Ages.  Well, go to a Best Buy now.  You're going to be amazed.  Huge, gigantic space solely limited to Samsung.  Huge space to Microsoft.  Small space to Google.  Huge space to Sony.  They buy that space to stores.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's all co-op marketing dollars.  It's co-op marketing.  That's what it is.  We want to buy to 150 square feet.  That's what it is.  And Best Buy says if you want to get your products sold,  you can either put them with 18 other products in a dusty shelf  that no one's paying any attention to,  or you can set up a store.  Apple did this.  The gold center is Apple, for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's the other part of the business model.  So if you go into Best Buy and you play with the Samsung phone there,  Samsung doesn't care whether you buy it in Best Buy or not.  Samsung says this is our marketing,  this is our touch opportunity to show you the thing,  show you how wonderful it is.  And I've talked in the past,  I'm involved with a retail genius named Sean Sampson  who has this vision for the future of retail.  I mentioned it in public parts briefly.  And he's a visionary about this stuff,  and I think that's where retail goes is toward marketing.  And we're starting to see the beginnings of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But retail as a whole, as an industry,  becomes much smaller, far more efficient.  I don't know about you, but I get frustrated every time  a retail space opens up.  What goes in? A bank, a bank, a bank.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And in Petaluma, it's antique store, antique store, antique store.  Even the bank has an antique store.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I now work in the center of the universe,  if we do say so ourselves,  Times Square.  Times Square.  I've got to walk 20 minutes to find a bookstore.  I've got to walk 20 minutes to find the Best Buy.  That's sad.  There's nothing to browse.  I used to go out at lunch hour when I was pissed off and angry,  and I'd call myself out by browsing.  Record store and a bookstore and an electronics store,  all gone, all gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's really sad.  It's life.  But I think that's maybe because of the short-sightedness  of the retailers who didn't understand what business they were in.  They thought they were in the business of selling goods.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  Which, by the way, was a really awful business.  You had capital risk.  You had pilferage.  You had all kinds of awful things going on in retail.  Low margins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, Jeffrey Jarvis.  Number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have I done something to anger you, boss?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Jeffrey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's your middle name?  Alan.  Jeffrey Alan Jarvis.  You get in here.  What's your number of the week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  524 million scolded bad ads killed by Google.  What?  Last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Half a billion.  524 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What was bad about them?  Okay, I'll tell you.  That amounted to 214,000 advertisers,  which is interesting to me.  That means basically on an average of two ads, Google kills you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's because these people weren't real advertisers.  They were malware vendors and things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  7,000 promoted counterfeit goods, down from 14,000 the year before,  down from 82,000 the year before that.  So they say they were making progress.  Malicious Software was 250,000 sites doing that in general.  And then things like weight loss schemes.  You mean those belly fat ads?  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got it.  Belly fat.  I can has it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And so it's pretty amazing that Google is the cop of the world  and has to constantly worry about killing bad ads  because it's bad for the Google brand.  It's bad to rip off the users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but they've also set up a system where you can anonymously,  without any human intervention, buy an ad.  So they've set it up so that bad actors have easy access.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they've also been taken to task and fined for bad medical ads.  And so they have an obligation to do this.  But it's a cost of doing business for them.  That's something I wonder whether Matt Cutts has been involved in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's kind of like spam, but I bet you they have a whole division dedicated to this.  Oh, sure they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But there's a science of saying how are the bad guys going to act.  That's my number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's his number.  Do you want to do a tip or should I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Either way, I can go.  Go.  Okay.  Go, go.  Epicurious, of course.  Love it.  So they've got a new version of the app.  And it's called Foodie Magazine.  And they just a week ago or so updated their website.  And now they have updated their apps.  Oh, I wonder if I have the latest.  Well, the Android app has not yet been updated any minute now.  I've been using it for ages.  I love websites for a fact.  But that's from 2010, that version of the app.  The new version is absolutely spectacular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's get an iOS.  Let's get a real phone over here and see what it looks like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they've got a very contemporary design, very high performance.  All around search.  Very fast.  That's exactly it.  It's a search that's super good.  It's Google-like search.  It's not Google.  It's not the engine behind it.  But the quality of the search.  Is this Condi?  It's Condi Nast.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was there.  I was part of the team at the original Epicurious years and years ago.  A woman named Joan Feeney and Rochelle Udell did brilliant work starting Epi long ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the idea is it's a search across a variety of Condi.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if you hit the hamburger, not the actual hamburger, yeah there you go, and go to home,  you'll see that it has this, okay so.  I'm at home.  Yeah so there's an interface.  If you hit that thing right below the search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Browse by Cadagory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  There you go.  Oh, kid-friendly, quick and easy, healthy food.  Lots of stuff like that.  Choose a main ingredient.  What's in season in your area.  So the usual occasion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What can I make with bourbon?  No available recipes.  Wait a minute, here we go, 32,000, wait a minute, bourbon, there's 185 bourbon recipes,  chocolate fudge with bourbon, trouble in paradise, peach, ginger and bourbon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now what's great about this too is that the cooks rate them, but they also modify them.  They make suggestions about this.  So these are the user reviews then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you can, when you, every single ingredient you like, you can save it to your shopping list,  you can get alerts on your shopping list when you're near a store that has those things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Next time you're at the store Mike, get a tablespoon of bourbon, would you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I will do.  Yeah, you can make.  And it also has voice commands so you can interact with the recipes by voice because  you have like stuff all over your hands because you're cooking.  Yeah.  You can talk to your phone to interact with the recipe and it will tell you what's going  on with the recipe.  Lots of different categories like you saw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is going to be used in the Elgin home to a very good end.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this brings the recipe specifically from Bon Appetit, Self, Random House and others.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or May, May at Rest In Peace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you can comment and sort of interact so that it's like a social network for people  cooking, which is kind of a cool idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are lots of recipes.  I've been using Big Oven, which is a kind of recipe aggregator, has millions of recipes,  but the problem is you don't know what the quality is going to be.  These are all from, these are all published recipes at least.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and here's a little story from the early days of Epicurious.  So we had the right to use all the recipes from Gourmet and Bon Appetit.  How could you beat that?  They were all just in print.  So we had to get them retyped and we hired a, well, I didn't know this at the time, but  there was this Honest to God, As Padre, there was a service with monks.  Oh, yeah.  Rather than making fruitcake, they were typists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or illustrating Bibles.  In the monks, they had a scriptoria, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly.  So the monks retyped all the recipes that created Epicurious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This spicy upscale popcorn combines two international ingredients.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Since we're on foodie stuff, have you gone to, do you use foodie, Mike?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's foodie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Foodie is from Glam, my friends at Glam, now known as Mode.  Is it a website?  Yeah, it's an aggregation.  It's a website aggregation.  And it's just people saving recipes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like the Pinterest of calories.  Exactly.  And it's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's amazing.  Oh, oh, signing up.  Yeah, look at that.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just want to start eating things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, this can't be good for a diet.  No.  No, it's not.  I should have a diet button.  Right.  It says, I'm on a diet, only show me food it looks disgusting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It should tie into quantified self stuff, and it should, if you're already over, it should just not show you this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Give me a break.  Samoa Cheesecake.  This is a cheesecake that looks like a Girl Scout cookie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hasselback Sweet Potatoes with Parmesan and Shag and Sage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it named after David Hasselback?  This is from a site called gimme some oven dot com.  I like it.  Yeah.  Homemade marshmallows.  Don't you love foodies?  F-O-O-D-I-E dot com.  This is nice, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Isn't this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And what this does is send the traffic.  If you click on a recipe, you'll go to a page that's still foodie that mentions some of the ingredients and stuff, but you don't get the whole recipe there.  You only get it when you go to the creator's site.  So it's a way to send traffic to the creator's sites along the way.  And Glenn will be doing more of this in the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I am now a foodie member.  I signed up.  Look at that.  Nice.  Do they have another companion site called Nudie?  Because I would go there too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a great site.  You can go there and not buy clothes.  There's a commerce model that isn't really working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to make this white chocolate covered Ritz crackers.  Nope, nope, not going to make it.  Not going to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  Packaged food like Ritz crackers is not an ingredient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not an ingredient.  I see.  I'm starting to somebody said, oh, you would love this restaurant.  They had a dessert made of Nutella.  And I said, you know, I don't go to restaurants where they take the dessert out of a jar.  Thank you.  On the other hand, chocolate chip cookies in a jar.  Maybe I do that.  That's a gift.  We got that.  You got that for Christmas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the whole thing, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everything you need to make chocolate.  It's all the ingredients.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  And it looks all nifty in the jar.  We haven't made it yet.  We need to make it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's so clever.  It comes with everything you need.  It's kind of like a blue apron for chocolate chip cookies.  Look at even the, did they, did they put the measuring spoons?  I didn't get, I didn't get the measuring spoons.  Cookie jar.  I'm going to have to talk to whoever gave us that gift.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're supposed to put measuring spoons.  That's okay.  We have tons of measuring spoons.  Yeah, that's the last thing you need more of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  My tip, I, this, there's a genesis to this story.  We have, we had talked before about Google's app inventor.  This was a system that Google had created to make it very easy to write Android apps,  not sophisticated Android apps, but children and, and people like me, hobbyists could learn  how to write software and learn how to write it for Android phones and actually package  their software up not only for their own phone, but for sale on the Play Store.  It was a really great thing.  Google gave it up.  They gave it to MIT.  MIT has released app inventor two and I've been looking to write an app for a, a, a,  a, a, a Nexus seven tablet that would help me with the radio show.  And I started, I downloaded the new Google, you know, I integrated development engine  and all this stuff and it was just like, Oh please.  It was way over my head.  I said, I don't have time to learn all this stuff.  So, so I, I downloaded this and this is the coolest thing ever.  And everybody's got to try this.  It's called, it's free.  If you go to app inventor.mit.edu, you create new projects.  I'll show you.  I have a few projects.  They have pretty good tutorials.  In fact, this is the first tutorial.  It's called, I'll show you this one.  It's called talk to me.  And the first thing you're going to do is you're going to connect to your phone.  I don't know why my, but, but here, if you, I don't know if you can see my phone.  So I'm going to connect to my AI companion by, you're going to have to follow me on this one.  It's a little complicated.  Now go to my screen.  There you go.  This QR code.  I scanned the QR code into the phone.  Now it's given me a code.  We're both on the same wifi.  The app appears on the phone.  And as you modify the app, it is instantly no, no USB connection.  Let me, this is the designer.  So you design the UI here and they've got a lot of tools.  They've got buttons, check boxes, layout tools.  They've even got Lego Mindstorm tools.  If you have Lego Mindstorm storage, social sensors, you can use the accelerometer, the barcode, this clock, the location, all of the stuff on your phone.  Then you go into blocks.  Look at this.  This is the programming interface.  So I put on the screen a text box.  These are all the commands I can use for the text box, a button and text to speech.  Let's, let's set this up.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm going to write.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, by the way, if you saw that message in there, just ignore that.  I was showing the 12 year old how to do this and he decided to put profane messages in here.  So, so that, but that's cool.  Right?  What better way to get a kid into programming?  So this, I know your son, Kevin, does a tinker, which is a similar kind of system on iOS.  So I have now written this software.  It is on the phone instantly.  And watch, I could do a couple of things.  If I shake, let me turn up the volume here.  If I shake the phone, I've told it to say something.  Stop shaking me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stop shaking me.  But I can also enter some text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is an actual Android app.  This is some text.  Text took me about three seconds to write, honestly, and I can speak it.  This is some text.  But the point is you now have an app.  And as you modify the app on your screen on the app inventor, it will immediately go over to your phone through the Wi-Fi.  You can prototype, turn it around very quickly.  It's got a great programming interface.  Show the screen again, if you would, Jason.  Stop shaking me.  I know, I'm shaking you.  It's got all of this stuff built in logic, math, text, and they're all snappable.  So, for instance, if you put something in here, if you drag it onto the interface, it'll show you puzzle pieces.  And only things with that shape can go into there.  It is spectacular.  I was able to get the accelerometer sensor working in such a way that when the accelerometer starts shaking,  call text to speech and then speech this message.  That's just a text message which snaps on there like a puzzle piece.  Folks, if you've been interested in kind of programming, if you have an Android device and you'd like to learn a little bit more about it,  if you want an easy way to create your own apps or even, believe it or not, the ability to package these up,  apps that you can sell or give away on the Play Store, you've got to take a look.  They've really made something special here.  I'm at the MIT App Inventor 2, and I feel pretty good about this.  I feel like I'm going to be able to write the very simple software I needed to be a timer for the radio show.  I want it to flash red when I'm running out of time and green when I have some time left and countdown so I can go to the bathroom and look,  oh, I've got a minute left.  I've needed this for some time.  I wrote something in AppleScript ages ago, but I'll put this on the Nexus 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The problem isn't you're going to be in the bathroom and it's going to say, stop shaking me.  Stop shaking me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stop, stop, stop shaking me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can change it.  I can actually change this to stop shaking me, Mike.  And look how fast it changes that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stop shaking me, Mike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Great. Throw me under the bus.  Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ladies and gentlemen, we are done with this week in Google.  Mike Elgin, always great to have you.  Always great to be on.  Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. Pacific, 1 p.m. Eastern Time, 1800 UTC for your daily dose of tech news.  You're going to Barcelona.  Barcelona, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Looking forward to it to cover Mobile World Congress.  And early next month?  Yes, very early.  Second through the fifth.  Second through the fifth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So live reports.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You and Jason, all you three, is Samsung going to redeem itself with the next phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like the Note 4.  I think the Note 4 is actually great.  Oh, you mean in its keynote presentation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, I think they might.  I'm rooting for the new Edge with the Edge on both sides.  The Edge on both sides.  Make it more mainstream and make it kind of work better.  Like you pointed out all the flaws on it.  But I'd love something like that and bring the price down a little bit.  But it's going to be something curved no matter what.  I guarantee something curved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mobile World Congress has become, I forget CES now.  I really think that the most interesting stuff is happening in Barcelona.  Jason, what do you think?  He wants to go. That's what he thinks.  He wishes he was going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's really a bummer that I can't be there.  Can't send all of you.  That's what Jason might be saying.  Yes, exactly. Not everybody's going.  I'll be curious to see what they do.  I mean, the invite clearly, for the event, clearly showed the contour of the Edge.  So I don't know if that means new Note Edge or the S6 now has Edge in it.  And that's just the new design of the S6.  What I'm really asking is do you think they'll redeem themselves?  I think so.  I think so. I think they're on the right track.  I think they're changing their approach on design.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the Note 4 is a great device.  I think the S5 was a little crufted up.  But the Note 4 is great.  I don't think Samsung needs to redeem itself.  It does in its presentations, if that's what you mean.  Here's the invitation. What's next? I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, everybody's kind of expecting a more metallic body, metallic design as opposed to the plastic.  I think they're going to do an haptic fork.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what I think.  It'll only work with the Samsung Galaxy S6 and nothing else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we will be covering a Mobile World Congress.  It was pretty cheap.  Mike will be there.  Now, because of the time difference, all the stuff that's happening is happening in the middle of the night, California time.  But you're still going to do it.  Yes.  Okay.  Yeah.  1 a.m. Pacific, 4 a.m. Eastern time.  Tune in because that's 9 a.m. in Barcelona or 10 a.m. in Barcelona.  We'll just be back for dinner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you don't have dinner in Spain until 11 p.m. or something.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, 11 p.m. What are you? 2 a.m. Come on.  You're an early eater. What do you have? 60 years old?  That's when the early bird specials are at Denny's Barcelona.
