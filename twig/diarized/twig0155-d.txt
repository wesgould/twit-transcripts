Let's say hello to Gina Trapani from SmarterWear.org,  founding editor at Lifehacker.  Hi, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And to my left, your right.  To my right, your left, Mr. Jeff Jarvis.  City University of New York journalism professor,  longtime journalist himself, blogger at Buzzandmachine.com,  and the author of a brand new book called Public Parts  Available Everywhere.  Hello, everybody.  There's a lot to talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A lot to talk about this week.  A lot to talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Should we start with Marissa Meyer?  Yeah.  Yes.  We've talked for a long time about Yahoo  and the struggles Yahoo was facing.  And the last we heard looked like Levenson,  Russ Levenson, was going to keep the interim CEO title  and be the CEO active forever because the guy at Hulu  said, I don't want that job no matter what.  And then out of the blue, out of the blue,  yesterday Marissa Meyer, number 20 employee at Google,  takes the job as CEO.  Here's People magazine's, I think, very lovely.  Very lovely coverage of Marissa Meyer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No one can let go of the glamour spread.  Note to self, never do glamour spread.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what?  In a way, and we were talking about engineers  because we had Jolie O'Dell, who is quite the fashion  plate, and Becky Worley on Twitter on Sunday.  And both of them, very attractive.  And I was talking a little bit.  It seemed to me that maybe we were in a post-feminist era  where you could be a feminist and still dress up  and be in a glamour and still be really accomplished  and be judged for your skills.  But this, I have to say, is not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Marissa has said sometime, I'm not a girl at Google.  I'm a geek at Google.  And I think that's really important.  Howard Kurtz from CNN said on Twitter,  well, is she getting all this attention just because she's  a woman and pretty?  And I said, well, no.  I think that's the sexist question right there.  No, she's getting all this attention  because she deserves all this attention  because she's got vision and she's a hell of a geek  and tough and this is a gutsy move to go to Yahoo.  And that's why she's getting all the attention.  But God damn.  Look at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And somebody sent me that people thing.  This people thing.  So here's, it's not merely the picture.  Here's a list of things, five things you need to know  about Yahoo's new leader.  She made history as the first female engineer at Google.  Okay, that's all well and good.  Number two, she's glamorous, Glamour Magazine.  So is her apartment.  This is, these are the five things you need to know  about Marissa Meyer.  Her cupcake, her cupcake recipe is better than yours.  And she's going to be a mom.  Wow.  But you're right.  I mean, there's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  That she changed our vision of web design.  But it is People Magazine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's People Magazine.  I liked, I really liked what Mike Arrington wrote  in Uncrunched.  He's of course, good friends with Marissa's,  interviewed her many times, not only for TechCrunch,  but on stage at LeWeb.  I've seen him three times, I think,  interview Marissa Meyer.  And I think this is kind of right on.  He says, isn't, it's not just another story  about another exec playing musical chairs  and switching jobs.  What the press has missed so far is  that this is a paradigm shift for Yahoo.  Meyer, I love this, is completely out of Yahoo's league.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She is.  This is what I loved is that the angle of the story  was that this was a huge coup for Yahoo.  No.  Not that this was like a big accomplishment for Meyer,  but that it was a huge coup for Yahoo.  It was.  That made me really happy because that gets it right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is right.  He says, so far out, so wharf, so far out,  I'm surprised they even had the courage to approach her,  although it's possible she approached them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That part makes sense because glass ceiling or no,  there was a ceiling of having young people  in charge of the company and they kind of passed her over  this last time when she didn't get the senior VP level.  Even if she gets it, how far is she gonna go?  And now she can head a company.  And now you have two executives, three executives  made by Google.  Cheryl at Facebook.  Tim Armstrong at AOL and now Marissa at Yahoo.  Each with tough jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Errington goes on to say,  overnight Yahoo's reputation will change.  At first it will just be in Silicon Valley,  but as of now, people won't be ashamed to say  they work at Yahoo anymore.  And for the last several years,  they certainly have been ashamed.  More key employees will stick around.  The company will be able to hire better people.  People will be proud to work at the company.  Morale will shift immediately.  There'll be lots more positive thinking.  All of this.  It may actually be a vision.  Yeah, all of this without her doing anything  but walking in the door.  And I agree.  I think Mike hit the nail on the head on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've, I've.  It's great for Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The biggest fan of Marissa, I think that, you know,  I've met her at a lot of conferences and talked with her  and interviewed her at CUNY and she has a vision.  You know, I've talked about the hyper personal news stream  about the new kinds of services that you can bring.  And I think that the people are thinking way too small  and just debating about whether, and she said this too,  debating whether Yahoo is a technology or a content company.  I'm sure she has wholly new things in mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I, hearing about this news, I was looking at it.  I mean, I think it's great for Yahoo.  And I think it's great for the industry, right?  Because I don't want to live in like a web industry  where the two biggest companies are Google and Facebook.  I'm excited about, you know, the possibility for Yahoo.  And she did just make Yahoo a cool place to be,  a place with opportunity and challenges ahead of it.  But I was looking at it from her perspective, okay?  So let's look at it from her perspective.  This woman is, she's six months pregnant.  She has zero financial incentive to take any job.  She doesn't need to work.  She doesn't need to work.  This is the toughest job out there.  That, I mean, it's left a string of failures in its way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Fifth CEO in a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like the most public, highly scrutinized, high pressure.  She looked at that opportunity and was like, yeah.  I'll do that.  I'll do that.  That's, I'm going to do that.  Man, that takes guts.  I am just so impressed with her.  I mean, I mean, there was never any doubt in my mind  that there was any lack of ambition or drive or vision  on her part.  And I think that she's going to do great.  I know she's going to do great, but I, just from a, like,  from an individual opportunity, life choice point of view,  I give her a lot of credit.  That takes guts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gutsy, gutsy move, you bet.  Gutsy indeed.  Unfortunately, the headline in the Christian Science Monitor  is, reignites debate over pregnant women in the workplace.  I just want to like, slug them.  Interesting article from Jolie O'Dell actually  in VentureBeat.  She says the reason Melissa Meyer left Google, she had to.  Now, I don't know if this is all speculation or.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, she was saying that she wasn't going anywhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  because she was a Google.  I think that that's probably true.  You know, I thought, nobody thought this,  but I thought when she didn't get selected  for the five people running Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you pointed that out, Leo.  I remembered that show.  You mentioned that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought that that was a slight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was, you know, it was a slight  and I kind of downplayed it and was kind of like,  no, it's fine because I just felt defensive of her  because I've been an admirer of hers for a long time.  But, you know, it's true.  Yeah.  She didn't, she didn't kind of make it up into these.  She's employee 20.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She did search.  She was responsible for search in Google's heyday and search.  They, instead of putting her in that executive suite  with the other four guys, Larry Page and the others,  they said, oh, here, you take location.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, she was the face of the company really early on,  but the last three Google IOs, she was never on stage.  I mean, she's been a lot, a lot less public face  of the company than she has been.  Yep.  It's interesting this, the people article aside,  there's a business insider article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I thought that was very interesting.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, it was very interesting.  Business insider article says that, you know,  the headline is the truth about Marissa Meyer.  She has two contrasting reputations and, you know,  it's this conspiracy that she, you know,  she wears dresses and likes cupcakes and fashion,  but she's also this like workaholic tyrant manager.  And I find this to be kind of sexist.  Because it's like, so you can't wear a dress  and be a tyrant.  There was never any doubt in my mind  that she was a tyrant to work for.  The woman is, she's like answering email  at 4.30 in the morning.  I mean, she's notorious for being a relentless workaholic  and extremely bright on top of that.  And I mean, she never made any bones about that.  I mean, sure, she did a glamour spread,  but she also obviously works really hard.  And so this business insider article interviewed people  at Google who said, oh, she, you know,  she would make people sit outside her office for, you know,  sign up for office hours and sit outside her office.  And it was, you know, very condescending.  She was inaccessible.  I mean, I remember Fast Company in different magazines  kind of profiling the way that she worked  and that open office hours.  I mean, every day her door was open to anyone  and anyone level at the company could approach her  and pitch her and talk over product with her.  And I always thought that that was a good thing.  So I just, this article bothered me a lot more  than the People Magazine.  People Magazine, I sort of expect fluff.  And honestly, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it might reflect, yes, I mean,  obviously they have quotes from a lot of Googlers  about how horrible Meyer was,  but it might reflect what we might see more of,  which is a campaign now, because frankly,  a weak Yahoo is good for Google, right?  A campaign now against Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think it was that notorious.  I see your point, Gina, and I agree with what you've said.  Kara Swisher called that same piece spot on.  And what this piece also said was that Marissa,  because what it said in the end was that Marissa  has grown and matured and that in her early days at Google,  she might've been more, I don't know what the word is.  Accommodating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apparently she humiliates her people  and who does that sound like, by the way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly, that's the other point.  It's like Steve Jobs.  Oh, okay, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I should just shut up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, by the way, let's find out  how many of her employees have antacid?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Apparently all of mine do.  Before the show, I asked for an antacid  and every single one of my team came up with antacids for me.  Like they all are sitting there chewing Tums all day  and you think Marissa Meyer's a tyrant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I've talked to Googlers too about Marissa  and I think that the part of it that was right  is there are kind of two views of her.  Some felt that she was really good public spokesperson.  Some thought that she was very un-Google  in how she was being public.  Some felt that she was tough and direct.  Some felt, and you're gonna find that with any boss.  That's the reality.  The real skill of the manager then is to do the job well  and as much as you can not care about the junk part of it  and listen to the important part.  What I got out of that article was that she,  but she changed some of her ways  in a way that made her more effective  and that means she learned.  She matured.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's a saying.  She's been at Google for 13 years.  She's 37, that put her in her early 20s  when she started there, 24.  You change a lot.  There's a lot of changes between 24 and 37  but when you're at a place where that long  and people remember you kind of that early,  it can kind of hamper your growth.  Sometimes you do need to go someplace else to.  Gina, you told me this is true or not too

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but you live in a world filled with boy geeks  and I'll bet at some point she in a position  of very high authority in the startup  with a whole bunch of difficult boy geeks working for her  had to decide to be tough, had to be demanding,  couldn't play into parts and had to establish herself  as a true authority in the company  and then once that's established,  then you can kind of change the rules a little bit  I would imagine, I'm very sympathetic to the idea  that she had to be no nonsense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Listen, I had one of my bloggers at Lifehacker  work for me for four years and we're good friends,  kind of offhandedly in a conversation was like,  oh, well, when you were being a tyrant,  I mean, I'm called a tyrant.  And to me being a tyrant is like getting stuff done.  Sometimes you need to set a high expectations  and you don't suffer fools and you just say  that this is what it is.  So in this Business Insider article,  this source, someone from inside Google,  described an executive who will work harder than anyone,  great, is smarter than 99% of the people, great,  but can't scale herself and doesn't understand managing  any other way than intimidation or humiliation.  I mean, anyone who's managed people,  even if it's a small, from a small team to a huge company,  knows that you grow as a manager  and you definitely go through the bullying stage.  I certainly apparently did.  And we'll probably, I mean, sometimes you gotta  put your foot down.  The thing is that that does not,  just because she likes cupcakes and fashion  and interviewed Lady Gaga doesn't mean  that she's not a tough manager.  And hey, she's gotta be tough.  She's got a tough job ahead of her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's the real question here is  what the F do you do with Yahoo?  Right, and that's where I wanna go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't wanna spend a whole lot of time  on the gossip side of this.  We did, and that's it, done.  It's BS, Yahoo scored.  They got perhaps the one person who could get people to go,  oh, Yahoo.  Fred Wilson said, hey, suddenly Yahoo's interesting again.  That's big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Others in my world said, hey, New York Times  looking for a CEO, beat that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, and she would have never taken a job  at New York Times.  I don't think so.  I like Farhad Manju's take in Slaty says,  Marissa Meyer is in over her head  and that's just how she likes it.  She has bitten off a huge challenge.  So what do you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that she's gonna see beyond what Yahoo was.  And when she sloughed off that question  about is it tech or content,  I think she sees beyond that.  She wants an extraordinary experience for people.  She sees being useful.  I think we're gonna kiss goodbye  to the overdone Yahoo structure  and the simplification of Yahoo.  And I think she's gonna invent some new services  that are useful to people in their lives  and see beyond search and beyond social and beyond content.  But I don't know what the hell that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The betting sheet on her is that she's data driven.  Of course, yeah, certainly Google is data driven, right?  Yeah, she's always said that.  So is there a data that you can use to decide?  Well, first of all, one of the first things  she probably has to do is kill stuff,  decide what to kill and what to keep, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And as a gift to all us geeks,  throw some nice rose petals on top of Flickr  and make it wonderful again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If anybody would do that, it would be.  Did you see dearmarissameyer.com?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, this is a website already, dearmarissameyer.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's what to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it just has one request.  One request.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Please make Flickr awesome again, the internet.  Love the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is great.  But it's not just Flickr.  There's a lot of properties at Yahoo that are great,  maybe underperforming.  Yahoo, by the way, nobody noticed this in the announcement  that they were hiring Marissa Meyer,  actually released their earnings at the same time.  Yeah.  And-  Totally made the challenge greater.  Right.  I mean, but they're not hemorrhaging.  They're just not growing.  They're not, you know, they're doing okay.  So kill stuff, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kill stuff, products and staff.  I mean, downsized staff and products.  Refocus.  There's a really great list of bits of advice  from a former Yahoo-  I love that article.  Yeah.  Suryam Krishnan, apologies for messing up the name,  but it's a list of 10 things.  This is my favorite one, I think.  Well, there's a few of my favorites.  Number four, make a huge sign with the phrase,  the premier digital media company.  Then make a video of you running a bulldozer over it,  crushing that sign.  No one knows what that phrase means.  Come up with a goal that people can actually visualize  and isn't meaningless corporate mumbo jumbo.  This is the best part.  Here's a suggestion, quote,  a Yahoo app on every home screen.  That's a good mission statement.  That's a Microsofty-  That's a good goal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Microsofty and mission statement.  He also says-  So what would you do with this?  Item number six, find out what it would take  to buy Kara Swisher's Silence Forever.  Well worth a shot.  We ship code, not slide decks.  And this is actually what gave me this idea.  Make a table with the columns, invest, maintenance mode,  kill, and fill it up with Yahoo's product portfolio.  Share it with the employees and press  so everyone finds out from you rather than Kara  as to what your priorities are.  And then favor the kill column whenever in doubt.  Say no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is a lesson I think that Larry's been teaching lately.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So yeah, I actually really enjoyed this article  because I thought it was an insider's point of view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I still want to hear from both of you.  Where do you, I think it's probably in personalized services  that make your life better.  Where do you think the opportunity is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I guess that's the question.  Is it a content company or a web service company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what she rejected.  She said it's neither.  It's a place that makes magnificent experiences.  No, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, okay.  That's the right thing for her to say on day one.  Right. Right.  But at some point, don't you, maybe you don't.  Don't you have to make the distinction?  Isn't that part of saying?  I hope it's not a content company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Content, I mean, Tim Armstrong bet his farm on content.  And he, you know, one thing about AOL  was that the brand of AOL turns out  to be fairly positively viewed, but empty.  No one knows what it is.  So you can make it anything.  Made it into a content company.  I would say Yahoo's the same to some degree.  Is that more negatively viewed I think right now,  but is similarly empty  because nobody knows what the hell it is,  neither did any of its CEOs.  So it can be something new.  I mean, I'm going,  apart from what I've heard her say personally  about the things like the hyper personal news stream,  that she has this vision of,  when I have this data on you, what can I give you?  What can I do for you?  Now to do that, to get the data on us,  the problem is she doesn't have any relationship with us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What is Yahoo's business?  Oh, it's ad sales.  It's all ads.  It's just the same as Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep. Well, no, no, no, no, no, no.  It's more like AOLs.  It's ad sales on top of content.  It doesn't have the kind of data  that Google has and Facebook has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But Yahoo mail is bigger than Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So dumb question.  Like where is this content?  Like, so my Yahoo used to be my homepage,  you know, forever ago.  I haven't looked at it,  but like when you say content, this is just like-  Go to omg.com.  Okay.  omg.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is one of the largest sites on the internet  that you've never heard of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay. So this is just a gossip.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A Yahoo finance is still gigantic.  Katie Cork is doing a show for Yahoo.  ABC News is kind of-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They do a lot of video.  Becky Worley does Yahoo.  Here's Yahoo Kids.  This is a portal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  So what they do now is they-  So tits.yahoo.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yahoo in the days of when they hired Terry Semble  from Warner Brothers,  they're gonna set up a Hollywood studio  and make it into that.  And that culture is still somewhat there.  It's an ad sales on top of content culture.  I've always said,  I've always said Yahoo is the last old media company.  And it still is just that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that too much of a sea change  to turn it into something like a web services company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think if you favor the kill column  and you bring in some talented technology people,  a few technology people can create some great things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is Flickr a web service?  I guess it is.  It's really not a content play.  No, it's a web service.  It's a web service, as is Delicious.  Delicious, well, they don't have that anymore.  They don't have Delicious anymore.  That's right, they don't have Delicious, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, apparently Flickr is gonna launch something,  a really great mobile app soon.  So-  Did you hear that last year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ready?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ready?  Ready?  Ready?  It's called InstaFlickr.  I have to say right now it's finance, sports.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It really is very much a content company right now.  So much so that it might be too late to change, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it might be,  but I think, well, let's put it this way, Lyle.  I think that it absolutely was too late to change.  I've written off Yahoo.  But, yeah, me too.  That's what changed it.  Right.  Marissa Meyer coming in changes that immensely.  And I believe, the thing that I have faith in  is that she has vision.  So here's a great-  And that she wasn't able to execute on that vision  at Google in the last two years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thanks to, thanks to Trip70 in the chat room  who's pointed me to the Wikipedia list  of Yahoo-owned sites and services page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, very helpful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Fire Eagle, I think that's gone now.  Flickr, Foxy Tunes, a browser extension.  Upcoming, the invite site.  Wretch, a Taiwanese social networking service.  Rivals.com's college recruiting site.  Oh, yeah.  Yahoo Answers.  Oh boy, that's-  How is Babi formed?  Yahoo Avatars, Yahoo Autos, Yahoo Axis, Yahoo Bookmarks,  Developer Network Directory, Finance, Games,  Yahoo Green, an environmentally conscious lifestyle site.  Yahoo Groups, Yahoo Kids, Yahoo Koprol,  an Indonesian social networking service.  Oh, Yahoo Local.  Yeah, well that-  Okay.  Remember they tried to buy Yelp and Yelp said,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  "'Screw you."  And this was also a big deal  that they had done with newspapers  and Yahoo got newspapers to sell ads on there  and it soured badly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yahoo Mail seems like an opportunity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it is, I agree.  I would love to see Yahoo Mail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How about Yahoo Maps?  Is it dead?  Is Bing and Avi and Google and Apple Maps?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I want to go back to mail.  I'm going to disagree.  I think that mail as a category is dead.  I hate to say it, no, not dead.  Is mortally screwed up.  Ooh, there's an opportunity.  I think there is.  I think that's why, we've talked about this  in the show before where Bob Weinman from Google  taught me about the problem with email  is it's sender controlled and that's why it got all messed up.  And that's why I think Google Plus is recipient controlled  but that's around an odd mission of Google  is to learn more about us.  I think you could reinvent mail  in some radical new ways  that really give the recipient control over it.  That's an opportunity.  That's a kind of magnificent service way  that I think she'd think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So not straight web mail.  No, that's done, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gmail and Hotmail, how are you going to do?  You can't compete with those at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I don't believe that the ad performance on Gmail is very good.  I think it tells them other things, but I can't imagine.  I've never clicked on a Gmail ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yahoo Messenger, a lot of people used to use that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I still log into that and my IAM client.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yahoo Movies.  Yahoo even has a music service.  Remember Launchcast?  Wow.  Well, remember how they made Mark Cuban rich.  Broadcast.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hotbroadcast.com, and how long did it last, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know, less than a year, right?  It wasn't very long.  What was that worth, like a billion and a half?  Yeah, they paid him so much money.  In fact, I was hoping to get some of that stupid money early on.  Yahoo Pipes is great.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if this, then that kind of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. If this, then that did it better and easier and cleaner.  They did.  And I have to think Yahoo has the engineers who maybe...  I mean, I would hope that there's engineers in Yahoo who go,  thank God I can go to Marissa and say,  look, this is Pipes.  We could make this something really great.  Yes.  And she would listen and she would get it.  Yahoo has shopping?  You know, Yahoo has a lot of like e-commerce,  small business sites, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and that's another...  When I started stuff at Conde Nast way back in the day,  we couldn't, you couldn't do shopping.  There was a fortune cover on the death of cash.  And back in the day, if you...  What it took even for a large company like that  to get a credit account, to accept money.  So when we first started selling stuff, we used Yahoo Store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sure, it was easy.  In fact, I'm looking at all this stuff.  They bought, remember they bought Dialpad,  they have a voice, they have a voice play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They have web analytics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a die.  They have all...  Yahoo voice and Yahoo voices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which is associated content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they bought associated content, right?  Which is the kind of better demand media.  Yep.  The less evil demand media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's really interesting when you put this all together,  it looks like Google's bizarro twin.  But it looks like everything Google's killing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  It looks like there's no focus whatsoever to it.  None.  Hasn't been for a decade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They had an auctions site, that's gone.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'd love to see also the list of things they bought  that they've messed up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They ran Babblefish.  They had the translation service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Remember Yahoo 360?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yahoo 360.  Let's not forget, they bought Bill Gross's ad structure.  What was it called?  Omnit, no, no, no.  Outcat, out.  Oh, but that was Google's ad model before Google had it.  Yahoo had it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they didn't know what to do with it.  So I could totally understand.  You hit the nail on the head, Gina,  when you said Marissa Maia doesn't need money.  She's set for life.  She wanted a challenge.  She wanted the biggest challenge in Silicon Valley.  And she took it.  And you know what?  She's either gonna make her reputation  and be the next Steve Jobs.  Yep.  Really great opportunity.  Cupcakes, be very happy.  Or she'll say, hey, it didn't work.  And she'll be the next Carol Bartz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But well, no, I don't think so.  I guess there's a chance that she could just come in  and surprise us all of this hype we're giving and say no.  But let's play with it.  Even if she fails, there are some jobs in the world  where even if you fail and you give it the college try  and you show some vision, but you took over something,  is it possible that she can not succeed but not fail?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not succeeding is failing though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  But not fail personally.  Oh, I see.  That not lose all respect that people have for her,  that they can admire what she's trying.  Well, look at Kevin Rose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, a good college try is definitely  part of the Silicon Valley culture.  Exactly.  And nobody's gonna look at it and say,  oh, you took a great company and ran into the ground.  It's like if you took over RIM,  that'd be the only company she could take over  that would have been worse.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, Marissa, buy RIM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She could get it tomorrow for not much,  get some patents with it.  It's a deal.  So what does she do?  What's her relationship with Google  and what's her relationship with Bing, you think?  What's her relationship with Search?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that this Business Insider story  tells you everything you need to know  about her relationship with Google.  The long knives are out.  She left.  And Google is, I think it's Google PR right there  in that Business Insider article.  They said, go get her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you see her Twitter though?  She took a picture of Google.  Her colleagues at Google gave her these big balloons,  like each balloon for 13 balloons a piece  and with a purple one at the top.  It was kind of sending her off to Yahoo.  I don't know.  I saw a lot of good, I don't know,  just from the people I follow on Twitter and Google+,  I saw a lot of goodwill from her colleagues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm not so sure, Leo.  I wonder whether, Tim Armstrong has a decent relationship  with Google from AOL.  They have a big business relationship.  Google's not foolish about this.  They're not gonna diss her for the sake of dissing her.  She surely is not gonna do anything in search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think, I said this yesterday.  I think what's gonna happen is Microsoft, Facebook, Yahoo,  it's a new Axis powers aligned against Google.  Interesting.  And maybe you throw Apple in there.  This is a real opportunity for Apple.  We were talking about Apple Break Weekly.  Apple should now, as it's done with Twitter and Facebook,  include Yahoo as part of its,  because they wanna push out Google, right?  Who is the Axis, the anti-Google Axis?  Facebook.  Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Microsoft and Yahoo can kinda hook onto that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Microsoft, maybe throw in Nokia, throw in Yahoo.  There's a few companies that might line up against Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, no one knows Google's strengths and weaknesses,  I think, as well as she does.  That's for sure.  And she has the relationships there.  Google would be smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Google would be smart to continue that  and cultivate that, I think.  And they're not dumb.  They're not emotional there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're data-driven.  They're data-driven.  And she's got these balloons, wow.  And the purple one at the top, that's cute.  From her Yahoo, from her Google colleagues.  And then she also put up a picture of,  you saw that, okay.  Yeah, from the Yahoo colleagues,  she got a Laiette set.  With a purple rubber duck.  That's actually very sweet.  So she started today, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yesterday.  So there was no transition.  It was like, whoom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and apparently no non-compete.  She phoned in on Monday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No non-compete, I guess, huh?  That's what happens when you employ 20.  Google didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, when you don't take anything to leave,  there's no non-compete, because there's no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Non-competes are illegal in California anyway, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, and they're mainly used  just when you quit and get severance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  Oh, I see.  Yeah, they could say, hey, okay,  we'll give you some money.  But. Yeah.  Right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, if you walk out,  they have absolutely no call on you.  Except, you know, unless she has corporate secrets  and that kind of stuff.  But she's gonna be smart about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, it's funny, two weeks before she took the job  at Yahoo, she announced she was gonna watch Breaking Bad  and catch up an episode a day.  Sorry, Marissa, I don't think you're ever gonna get  to season five.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you might wanna.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She'll have time when she's in her one-week return to E.  Later.  Her one-week return to E when she's working through it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, in between emails and nursing,  you can watch maybe 10 minutes at a time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So get granular search in Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do you do?  Well, does Yahoo not use Bing?  Isn't that what, Yahoo search has become Bing.  Isn't that right?  Yes. Yes.  So they don't have a search product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Search is so yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly. So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what do you do?  Social, right?  Social has replaced search, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Social and content, content and social.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does Yahoo have a good social play?  What if you went after Facebook?  I wouldn't go after Facebook.  I'd go for Twitter.  Oh, that's actually right.  Because remember they sued Facebook  and the part of the settlement was we're now intertwined.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would go after Twitter if I were her.  Yeah, or purchase Twitter.  She understands feeds of information and data around that.  And she's gotta try to get a relationship going with people  and data around that relationship.  Do you remember a little something called Yahoo meme?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  Meme?  Meme.  It was a Twitter clone.  They killed it two months ago.  Sheesh.  I guess they probably still have the code  in a drawer somewhere they could pull it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does she have any war chest to buy anything?  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh sure.  Let me just look at the Yahoo earnings.  I don't know how much cash they have, but let's just see.  Cause you know, this was a good way  to hide the earnings report.  Yeah.  By the way, oh, and by the way,  before we talk about how much money we lost,  I don't think they did.  I think they did all right.  Let me just see if I can find that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right on Yahoo terms.  Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't, I'm gonna find it.  I probably could get it on finance.yahoo.com.  Yahoo beats Q2 earnings with 27 cents a share.  Let's see what the cash position is though.  That's what you mean by a war chest, right?  Yes.  Yes.  They had 1 billion in revenue, earnings of 27 cents a share.  A search revenue, $461 million.  I mean, this is not a poor tiny company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you don't just throw that away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was down, but 1% year over year.  Display revenue up 2% to 535 million.  Chatroom, do you have their,  this is great.  We'll have the chatroom do the research.  What is Yahoo's cash position?  I don't see it here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Strangely just posted the chatroom says this afternoon  about Yahoo's relatively good financial standing.  I don't know if that's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hi, it's a, you know what?  You can see why an engineer would say,  would grasp this bull by the horns  and say, this is a challenge.  How do you take this company, this venerable company,  one of the old internet stalwarts,  how do you change it?  Not the market cap, the cash position.  How do you save it?  It's an opportunity, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're right.  It's a problem.  So how would she define the problem?  Both from a Yahoo perspective and a consumer perspective.  She's clearly thinking consumer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they don't have a lot of cash, 2.2 billion.  And they can't buy much.  They can't buy Twitter.  You can't buy Twitter for instance, yeah.  But so you're going to be building, not buying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep.  But she can attract the talent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right. She can attract the talent, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right.  And if you got, let me understand this.  If you came in as a new employee now and got options now,  you got to believe it's at its lowest ebb.  I take them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's kind of like a startup.  So there are going to be others like her who said,  let's take this challenge.  I think she builds a team of maybe some ex Googlers,  some hot shots who say, yeah,  and this is what I do if I'm Marissa Meyer.  Let's go. Let's take this challenge.  Look, I just took a big challenge, a big leap.  I believe in this company.  Will you join me and help build the next generation Yahoo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's it.  And she has to define what she thinks that is though.  First, I want to know what is your vision for next year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, she's smart because she's not doing that in public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, right. Right. Right.  I'm not sure she has to.  She said she wants to get rid of the distractions  and create a user experience,  a clean user experience that delights.  But what is the user experience?  Is the user experience omg.com?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's got to be value.  She understands delivering value.  And OMG is not value.  It's content to put an ad on top of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the truth is content is nowadays is a commodity.  Yes.  It's very hard to differentiate yourself.  In fact, we didn't even know OMG was a Yahoo property.  It says it, but who cares?  It's a commodity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I went Monday to Indianapolis, lucky me.  Just a joke, Indianapolis, who's yours?  Where I spoke about speaking to speakers  at the National Speakers Association.  Very meta.  And I had what I thought was not a terribly controversial  argument about trying to make things  into more of a conversation.  Then I leapt down into the room, which I loved doing,  played Oprah and ran around and had a conversation.  And some people in the room really objected  and said, well, no, no, we're content.  We create content, we create valuable content.  They sounded exactly like newspaper people to me.  And I wrote a post about this.  It really occurs to me that it's a trap.  That if you think, well, I make content  and content has value and that's the end of the story,  then you cut yourself off from all kinds of new opportunities.  A, B, you're in a commoditized business,  where C, you have no end of new competitors.  And I don't think that anybody wants to,  they should want to be in the content business.  But you're not in the content business, Leo.  You are really in the relationship business.  You create communities, the chat room, God bless them.  Nice backpedal, Jeff.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not you, Leo, that's okay.  I believe it, no, you're not in the content business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we are not commoditized content, you're right.  And the way you be not commoditized is B,  is relationship is unique.  Now, here's my thinking.  There's no way Marissa Meyer takes this job  without going home, sitting and thinking really hard.  And there's no way she takes this job without a plan.  She has in her mind what she believes  will save, a plan that will save Yahoo.  And it would be my guess it's gutsy, it's unexpected,  and she's sure as hell not gonna tell me or Kara Swisher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hope that involves her running a sign over  the bulldozer though, how awesome would that be?  Yeah, well, we'll see.  Preferably before she gives birth.  I want her pregnant on the bulldozer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pregnant lady on a bulldozer, that's what we want,  running over a sign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would be awesome.  She's a little more dignified than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you think she calls Jerry Yang?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And says.  I wouldn't, it's like if you're gonna remake the Munsters,  don't call the people who used to play them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, starting over, starting fresh, freshly.  Not call Jerry Yang, no.  I'm sure she has somewhere a piece of paper  with a line down the middle that says strengths, weaknesses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, she's got spreadsheets, no doubt.  Spreadsheets.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love it, I love it.  I think this is, well, for us,  it's a story you look for, these kinds of stories.  But also, I don't know if this has been clear all along.  I've been rooting for Yahoo all along.  This is legendary.  I mean, I remember Jerry and David,  and I remember acabono.stanford.edu,  the internet started at Yahoo for many years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but you know what, Leo?  I also remember the snotiest meetings I had  in Silicon Valley back in the day was Yahoo.  Well, see, here's where I'm at advantage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I never meet with anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They were just so far above it all.  And Jerry came in and said,  our job is to get people in and out of Yahoo  as quickly as possible,  and that turned out to be a lie pretty damn soon.  They were incompetent, they were snotty,  they thought they could push their firehose on everything.  They thought they were gonna destroy the content business  while going backwards into it.  No, I was never rooting for Yahoo.  I'm rooting for Marissa Mayer.  Yes, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then that is a Silicon Valley pitfall  that many companies go through as arrogance.  King of the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They were one of the original ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep, king of the world.  But I remember Atari,  I was talking to Nolan Bushnell last week on triangulation,  and I vividly remember that everybody who worked at Atari  in the late 70s in Silicon Valley,  king of the world.  There you know what did not stink.  They were very cocky.  And it happens every time you see it over and over again.  It's almost like it's an opera, it's operatic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's why it's gotta be kind of,  May Yahoo must have been a little attractive.  I prefer, I like the underdog.  I like the idea of having to come in someplace  where people have basically given up on.  And there's a, I should add this to the show notes.  There's a core question,  which got posted a couple of months ago,  but the question was, why would anyone ever work at Yahoo?  And one of the Yahoo engineers or managers  posted this really thoughtful, interesting, long answer  that was basically like,  just because the blogs and the media and whatever  have decided, have written a company off,  doesn't mean that there aren't  sort of really interesting challenges and opportunities  that maybe, just because your company  isn't a media darling doesn't mean  that there aren't good people there,  there aren't interesting challenges,  and that you get opportunities to move up  and move into positions maybe that you wouldn't have  a chance at companies that are very well established.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He thinks the geek does protest too much.  Okay.  I think that, I've heard that and I respect it,  but I think that's often, who the hell is left at Yahoo?  Not to denigrate anybody who's there,  but, oh, I'm gonna go in there and do wonderful things.  Without a leader, without a vision, I don't buy it.  Okay, all right.  People I would call, on your Leo list,  I would call Katerina Fake and Stuart Butterfield,  he and Fake and Menmo.  I would call Cameron Marlowe.  I would call, start naming those people,  the people who shouldn't have left Yahoo,  but had damn good reason to leave Yahoo,  had a vision for it, who were there for some reason,  and said, oh, screw it, and went on to better.  That's who I'd call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fair enough.  Listen, I read that answer and I thought, interesting,  but now that she's the CEO and be interested to see  what she puts out there, if she puts out there  anything at all, I bet that we're gonna see  some really interesting hires at Yahoo in the next few months.  You bet.  She needs to have a co-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, here's the question.  Leo, Leo, she comes to you and she says,  I'm gonna make a brand new world of TV.  I'm gonna change the world of video.  I'm gonna change everything.  I wanna buy Twit Network.  What do you say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If Terry Semmel had said that or Ross Levinson had said that,  I'd say, yeah.  If Marissa Meyer says something like that, you listen.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you have some faith in her ability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So-  Okay, Gina, Gina, she comes to you and she says,  I think that really giving people power over Twitter  and all this stuff is really wonderful.  I wanna buy ThinkUp.  What do you and Neil say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'd have to talk to a Neil,  but let's say that I would be-  Go with the things.  I would be, I would love to,  I would certainly consider working for her  at some point, for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I would too.  I mean, and that's the power  of having somebody like that in there.  And the faith that I have,  which may be completely misguided,  that Marissa sat down, made a plan,  it was exactly what she wants to do,  and now is gonna execute  and we're gonna all watch with great interest.  By the way, $75 million, Marissa,  that's my bottom line.  I was reading about Dig.  Yeah, you should get 100.  I was reading about Dig  and we'll talk about this in a bit.  And you know, Dig finally is completely dismantled  and the articles and at one point,  according to one of these articles,  I'll see if I can find which one it was,  Kevin Rose really wanted to sell Dig to Rupert Murdoch  who was offering, I think $60 million.  Rose would have gotten $36 million  and the board wouldn't let him.  How long ago?  A few years ago, a few years ago.  The board wouldn't let him.  And that happens, right?  And Kevin was apparently very,  I don't know this, but in this article,  it said Kevin was extremely frustrated by that  and that's when he started dialing out of Dig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I get that, but I also get  not wanting to sell the News Corp.  That, by the way, another business insider.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No great things have happened there.  But he would have been smart had he.  I mean, that was the peak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He would have been his cash out.  But if you're really an entrepreneur  who believes in the company,  do you sell it to the News Corp?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the reason I credit this story,  and I don't know Matt Lindley  or some of the people they quoted,  but the reason I credit that is  because it was shortly after that  that Kevin just basically started doing other stuff.  And I could see a founder saying,  hey, we can sell this.  I could make 36 million.  We could sell this to Murdoch.  This probably is before that MySpace thing.  This is, let's see, 2000.  Apparently Yahoo, early in Dig's life cycle,  a product person at Yahoo pulled Rose aside saying  he felt Dig could sell the Yahoo for $40 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I remember-  This is 2006.  What was that?  Oh God.  The screen saver app, very early on.  Flying Toasters.  No, no, no, no.  When your screen saver come up,  it gave you news and content and all this great stuff.  Oh, Pointcast.  Pointcast.  And they, as I remember, turned down,  I think it was 400 million from News Corp.  You gotta know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You gotta know.  When to hold them, when to hold them.  Because you hit the top and that's a good time to sell.  Just I'm saying.  As a real estate owner in California.  Let's take a break and come back.  We could talk a little bit about Dig,  the end of the line for Dig.  We also, there's lots to talk about.  And some of it actually having to do with Google  in just a little bit, including a kind of a sad story  about the guy who really, in many ways,  created the idea of wearable glasses  getting beat up by McDonald's for wearing glasses.  Anyway, we'll talk about that in a second.  But first, let's talk about stamps.com.  Wouldn't you like a way to print US Postage?  Just print it yourself.  Never, imagine.  Never again go to the post office to buy stamps  or the ATM or the grocery store.  In fact, you don't even have to bring packages in.  They would just come and take them.  If you're an eBay seller or an Amazon seller,  this is heaven, right?  You can do all your fulfillment right from your desk  quickly, easily.  International money order or international mail orders, easy.  Does it all.  This is stamps.com.  Anything you can do.  Anything you can do at the post office,  you can do from your desk with stamps.com.  You can buy and print official US Postage  or any letter or package with your computer  and your printer, no special ink or postage meter needed.  It's open 24 seven, of course,  because it is the internet.  You can get a digital scale  and make sure you never spend more  than you need to to mail something.  This is a really great solution.  You get discounts you don't get at the post office.  Post office loves this.  Post office would rather we just all did this.  So they encourage it with 21%, up to 21% off express mail,  up to 15% off priority mail.  Free pickups, you can schedule them at any time  from your mail carrier, prints from QuickBooks.  Now here's the deal.  Go to stamps.com and you can try this for free  with a no risk trial offer.  Click that radio microphone  and enter the offer code TWIG, T-W-I-G.  And the $80 bonus offer turns into a $110 bonus offer.  Here's what you get.  $55 worth of postage coupons you can use  over a period of time on stamps.com.  I think it's a few months.  You get the digital scale.  You pay shipping and handling for that.  That's why I can't technically say it's a free offer  because you pay five bucks shipping and handling.  But you get the free postage.  You get the digital scale.  You get a month trial of stamps.com  and I think you're gonna really see what a benefit.  I really wanna talk to those of you who do a lot of mailing.  Like the more you do, the less it costs.  Stamps.com and our promo code on this is TWIG.  Please use that so we get credit.

Transcript:  Shh.  What?  Shh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm shushing the cat.  I thought my mic was off.  Sorry.  Shh.  Leo, shh.  I would never say that to you, Leo.  I would never.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, Malik wrote a nice piece.  I thought a very nice piece.  Eulogizing a dig, saying even in failure,  and that's clearly a failure,  $45 million in venture capital.  They sold off, I think, a total of $16 million  worth of stuff to the Washington Post.  LinkedIn bought their IP, the patents, oddly enough.  And Beta Works, which is kind of a neat little news operation,  for half a million dollars, bought the dig assets.  And I think Ohm kind of made a good point  where he said, hey, it's not whether they returned money  to the investors, it's whether they reinvented  the news business.  Do you agree, Jeff Jarvis?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gutenberg failed, too.  Good point.  Ah.  So did the railroads.  It's exactly the same argument that sometimes  visionaries do things that may make them rich or may not,  but they definitely saw something that others didn't see.  You know, I think there's a big lesson in the difference  between dig and Reddit, and Reddit had the courage  to hand over more control to its public.  Reddit, however, to this day,  doesn't have much of a business model,  but it grew while dig pissed off its public  with a few moves and couldn't recover from that.  But I think Kevin absolutely changed the way we look  at the power of people.  And the fact that social is now challenging search  as a source of links in great measure  comes from Kevin Rose.  Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I would agree.  I mean, it's interesting that Reddit really kind of  capitalized on dig's failure.  What do I mean by dig's failure?  What was it, was that one redesign  that things went really apparently wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it was my idea, by the way, I told Kevin to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, Kevin's a brilliant product person.  He really is.  And it's interesting that it sort of coincided with him  becoming less engaged with the product.  But you know, it's funny, Anil, my co-founder Anil,  he's chatting at me right now,  and he says all of Web 2.0 failed,  but also had a huge impact.  So you can have a big impact and not necessarily cash out,  just like what Jeff said.  That's very Anil.  That's the best that Anil could sum.  He's prone to hyperbole,  but we love him anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's okay, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But yeah, no, I think dig was a really great idea,  and I think it had a huge effect on the web in general.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, and I have a funny position on this  because Kevin's a friend, and I've known him since before.  And you know, what the good news is,  he's now at Google Ventures doing what he really does well,  which is picking winners.  And I think that that's a good move for him.  I'm kind of sad to see dig go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I look forward to seeing him design product though, again.  I agree, he does beautiful stuff.  Less burned out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep.  And I use Betaworks news.me.  I think that's a kind of a neat thing.  I get an email every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  News.me is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and that's what they're going to,  apparently they're gonna fold dig into news.me.  So in this case-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm amused by that because news.me  is a combination of Betaworks and New York Times.  I wanted to know that.  Yeah, and so now New York Times owns a piece of-  Dig.  Yeah, an aggregator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I actually like, I get this email every day  and it's stuff that my Facebook and Twitter friends  have read or, you know, shared.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the phone safety net.  You know, it's like, oh, if I haven't looked at Twitter  or Facebook and I went on vacation  with my partner this weekend,  it's like, if I haven't looked at Twitter or Facebook,  I know I'm gonna get an email  with the links I should have seen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, and it's only five or something.  I mean, it's pretty quick.  And then they have-  Yeah, it's pretty quick.  They have an iPhone app, which I actually haven't downloaded.  I just do the email thing.  So would that be interesting to see?  I don't know what they get.  They don't get the patents.  They don't get the engineers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They still have some audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They get the audience, I guess, yeah.  Yeah, they get it to critical mass.  That's millions of people a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it was what, 500K?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not that much.  Well, 500K plus equity in this new venture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now here's an interesting coinkydink.  The guy who was approaching Dig to buy them  for $60 million for Rupert Murdoch was Ross Levinson.  It's Levinson.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a small world.  It's a very small world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Former interim CEO at Yahoo.  So here's a story that just grabbed me  and I don't really know what really happened  and it could be more complicated than that.  But we all know Steve Mann.  For years at MIT, he was a guy who created this thing  of walking around with a camera on you, right?  He still does, which I didn't realize.  Wrote on his blog that he was wearing his device.  Now he claims, and this is interesting,  he has a doctor's note for this  because it is more than just Google Glass style camera on him.  He's worn a computer vision system for 34 years  and he says it's necessary for my cognitive functions.  I need it.  It's more than just, you know.  So he carried around, he had carrying around with him  documentation, including a letter from his doctor  about what all of this was.  He toured Paris, went into a number of museums  and places where you're not allowed  to wear cameras or glasses.  Never was challenged, never asked for anything.  Goes into the Paris McDonald's on the Champs-Elysees  with his glasses on.  They say, what are you doing?  And he said, you know, he showed him the documentation.  Okay, they ordered, they got their food.  He was there with his kids, sat down,  and then all of a sudden he gets roughed up  by McDonald's employees.  The funny thing is that he says,  because I was wearing these glasses and they damaged them,  the pictures that were taken,  which would have otherwise not been saved, were saved.  So he has pictures of the McDonald's employees.  Now this is a no pictures McDonald's.  A couple of years ago, somebody got roughed up  for taking a picture of the menu.  People really got a wise up.  Not the customers, the companies.  Here's a picture of one of the McDonald's employees  tearing up his doctor's letter.  This is very Parisian.  I spit on your leather.  Tearing it up.  And then the guy's wearing McDonald's name tag.  Steve looks at it and he turns it over.  So you can't read it.  All of this captured on the camera.  Steve says, I don't want money,  but they broke the glasses when they tore them off my head.  And I just want them to fix the glasses.  McDonald's has not responded,  except to say we are investigating.  That's just, I just wanted to.  Geek bullying.  Geek bullying.  Now a couple of things we don't know the actual,  we know Steve's side of the story, who knows?  But if we're all going to be wearing Google Glass

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  in the next few years,  something's gotta happen here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is what we have to look forward to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is what you're going to look forward to.  Do not go into this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  France and Germany may be a little dicey for wearing them.  Yeah.  They all become a street view.  Do you think this is a private, I mean.  That's what people pinged me about and said,  what do you think?  You know, because we don't know enough to know what it is.  But it would certainly stand to reason.  That's what, what else are you objecting to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and why, what is it?  A military installation?  It's a McDonald's for crying out loud.  What is it you're worried about people finding out?  A casino, you know, I've,  well, I almost got beat up by a casino,  a big casino security guy,  because we were walking through the casino  with our cameras on the way to an event at CES last year.  And I had a great camera guy, Hilton,  who just played along and he pointed the camera  at the ground and we just kept walking.  They don't, I understand a casino doesn't want you  to take any pictures in a casino.  I understand that.  And it's private property.  They have the right to do that.  But they don't have the right to rip these things  off your head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I tried to take a picture at a KFC in China,  just because I was interested in Western restaurants  in Beijing and I was quickly,  several employees sort of quickly sat down  and said, no, no photos.  Why not?  I respected that.  I mean, there are government installed cameras everywhere,  of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've been stopped at Starbucks.  I understand their right to do that.  Is it to protect the privacy of other customers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think so.  I think it's more that they fear  that it's going to be a corporate espionage  or I don't know.  Get over it, because everyone on earth  is going to have a camera very soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and people like Thomas Hawk,  who documents this all the time,  I mean, even though it's technically legal  to shoot pictures in public,  gets harassed all the time by the police.  So I just don't, I don't know.  Really?  Oh yeah, gosh.  It's in fact, most people who have been photographers,  who are photographers who have been taking pictures  in public places have stories to tell.  It's post 9-11, people are very paranoid.  And you're right, there's cameras everywhere.  The government has plenty of cameras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, in China, I just was like, you know what?  I don't want to get carted off right now.  I'm going to talk this up to a cultural.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think the thing to do,  if you were asked in a private place,  the problem is these things are like almost welded  into his head.  They cannot be taken off his head without tools.  But what he should have done is grabbed his food  and said, okay, I'm sorry, and leave.  But never, because it is their right,  but they shouldn't be ripping them off your head  for crying out loud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Survey says, I don't know about surveys.  This is from search engine land,  Danny Sullivan quoting the annual  American customer satisfaction index.  Bing has practically matched Google  for customer satisfaction,  but just to show that this is meaningless,  ask.com is a close third.  82 points for Google, 81 points for Bing,  80 points for ask.com.  Who uses ask.com?  Some of the really old browser

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and a really old toolbar installed.  Yahoo got 78 points.  In fact, I'm going to throw this out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is crazy.  This is a hot Bing tip later on the show though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ooh, ooh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are you still using DuckDuckGaming?  Yeah.  Are you still using DuckDuckGo and Bing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am.  I'm still using DuckDuckGo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  I switched to Google sometimes.  There are times when DDG doesn't give me  what I'm looking for,  but yeah, I would say 90% of the time it's just fine.  Most of my searches are,  it's a very programmer friendly search engine.  Most of my searches are for code related error messages  or code documentation,  and it does very well with that.  It works for that, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Anybody still use cool or bleco?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is cool even alive?  Maybe cool's gone, I don't know.  I think it's gone, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The search engine you can't spell.  C-U-I-L, no.  C-U-I-L.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there's cool.com is not.  That's the greatest piece of Valley hubris ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's real hubris.  You don't know how to spell it,  but we're going to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not only that, but they were going to take over the world.  They were going to goop was toast.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Wikipedia page, current status down.  Down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You go to cool.com, you get nothing.  Not even so long and thanks for all the fish.  Google fiber launches next week.  They made a big deal, of course,  about the gigabit fiber that they were going to install.  Where is it?  Kansas City?  Kansas City.  Kansas City, Missouri, or Kansas City, Kansas?  Missouri, right?  K-C-M-O.  Pretty cool.  This is Google's way of saying,  hey, if you had lots of bandwidth,  this is what it would be like.  Just last week, Time Warner Cable in Kansas City  placed posters around its headquarters  asking employees to provide any information  they hear about Google fiber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, if you hear, I hear,  Google is, if you hear anything, let us know.  We don't know, but we want to know.  What's going on?  Sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they selected them in March  and they're about to, Google sent out invitations  to a special event on July 26th in Kansas City.  A special announcement about Google fiber  in the next chapter of the internet.  And everybody's just jealous as hell.  That's all I can say.  But they say they'll do it in other cities sometime.  Maybe Yahoo should do the getting the fiber business.  Google Plus Maker Camp,  targeting tech savvy teens.  They're doing this with Make Magazine.  This is so smart.  A six week online summer camp for 13 to 18 year olds.  They'll try to build 30 projects in 30 days.  Mark Fraunfelder will be there.  Steven Fritz of EP Bird.  Those are the Coke and Menos guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it in person or is it virtual?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no, it's, oh, wait a minute.  Beginning today, a Make Camp counselor  will post how-to instructions for a new project online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it at Google Plus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's Maker Camp on Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's like their hangouts and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  and go like tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Welcome campers, Maker, this is so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Follow Make on Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Follow Make on Google Plus, yep.  Okay, I'll add them to my.  Okay, now I'm following them.  You know, with brands, you don't have to circle them.  You just follow them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, so they do the Hangouts on Air and they're,  you know, Hangouts is great.  They do the Hangouts on Air so you can watch  Maker Camp Day Three with terrariums.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, fun.  So this is great.  A kid can stay home and not have to go to camp  but still do some stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bob, will you go out and buy me $300 worth of equipment  so I can make this thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I need some moss.  I need some dirt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mason jar terrariums, fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, terrariums are also a type of biosphere.  This is just kind of like a very wet.  So awesome.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're mobile biospheres.  But terrariums, when you think terrariums,  this is what you think of.  You don't necessarily think of like, you know,  a science experiment that you leave out in the sun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sorry, the show is over.  I wanna watch this and make a terrarium now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Terrariums?  Mm-hmm.  It's a moss.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You can have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The day before, they learned how to make,  what were they making?  They have, this is Weird Science Wednesday Today.  This is so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, they're doing animated GIFs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Animated GIFs.  That's good, everybody, or GIFs, I'm sorry.  Oh, that's good.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's a useful thing to know on Google+.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, not more of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But what it's teaching kids is animation, right?  Yeah.  That's really cool.  Tinkering Tuesday.  And they had Frog Designs Jared Ficklin doing the lesson.  This is neat.  So it's not too late.  You can just join, just follow, make, M-A-K-E on Google+.  And you can be a part of camp.  I wanna go to camp.  You'll have to, I don't know,  you'll have to provide your own dirt and tent  and softball games and make your own lanyards on your own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm envisioning Twit Camp.  Twit Camp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good idea.  Ooh.  Good idea.  All right, we're gonna take a break  and then Jeff and Gina and I will talk about our new toy.  Ooh.  Yeah.  Even MG Siegler liked this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even MG.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.  We'll talk about it in just a second.  But first a word from Ford.  You know, this is kind of interesting, this kind of thing.  But this would work very well in your new Ford.  It's got Bluetooth, A2DP and so forth.  You can tie it in with the Ford automobile.  See what Ford sees.  This was a very interesting challenge.  Here you are.  You're making a car which is gonna last years, right?  People are gonna own that for, I don't know,  my own my car for 10 years.  So 10 years from now,  what's technology gonna even look like?  So how do you design a car that could keep up to date?  And they're thinking about all sorts of stuff.  I asked them about upgradability.  Said, yeah, we're thinking about upgrade modules,  software upgrades.  But what they realized is if you make the car a platform,  you give it all the sensors and tools and stuff and an API,  then developers can develop stuff on portable devices  like tablets or phones.  And then when you get in the car,  you're bringing more smarts  that can interface with the car.  Brilliant.  And that's why if you go to ford.com slash technology,  you can take a look at some of the interesting things  they're doing with Ford, with AppLink.  And they even have a demo app called MyFordMobile.  It's a smartphone app for Android, iOS,  and for BlackBerry too.  If we go to the 2012 Ford Focus,  that's the first car it works with right now.  You can find out more.  There's a video here.  They talk about the charging station,  the super fast charging they do.  They talk about the regenerative braking.  They even have, I love this, they have Drivers Ed.  I just, this is not in the part of the ad,  but I'm gonna say it anyway, cause it's really cool.  Where you learn how to use things like regenerative braking.  They've got a brake coach in the car  that helps you maximize the range of your focus.  Because all of these instrument clusters are soft,  they're just screens,  so they can put stuff like a brake coach up there.  So anyway, back to the MyFordMobile app.  It lets you monitor your charge of your Focus Electric.  It lets you schedule your charging  so that you can do it at the most affordable times  according to your utility.  It provides you with a location of your vehicle,  the location of the nearest charging station,  the most efficient route to get there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it's so pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It even estimates the amount of CO2 emissions  and the money you've saved on your driving style  and helps you coach you to a more efficient driving style.  This is, I think, a proof of concept  as much as of anything else  to show that you can make apps that just talk to the car  or the car talks back.  Very cool stuff.  Now, how would you find out about this?  Well, you can go to ford.com slash technology  or look for an EV certified Ford dealer near you  and say, I wanna test drive the Focus Electric,  the 2012 Ford Focus Electric,  and bring your smartphone and you can put the app on there.  The app's free.  They even have a MyFordMobile website  and all sorts of stuff, leaderboards, that kind of stuff.  Ford.com slash technology.  So MG Siegler, who is, as we all know,  really nice guy, good friend, and kind of a Mac fanatic  and loves the iPad beyond all words.  And you know, I would include Andy Iannacco  as another guy who's said for a long time,  the iPad is the best.  There's nothing that can beat it.  Android's not close.  Even Andy Iannacco, I noticed,  is now carrying a Galaxy S3 Android phone  and likes it a lot.  And Andy and MG both are singing the praises of this.  This is the Galaxy Nexus 7, a tablet from Google.  And you, Gina, got yours at Google I.O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At Google I.O., yeah.  So the ones at Google I.O. have the white back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sorry, I said the word galaxy.  There's no galaxy.  There's no galaxy.  That's Samsung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just the Nexus 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just, the two words are bonded in my mind.  The Nexus 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is an awesome device.  I'm really happy that people who've been in the iOS world  for a long time, like MG, appreciate it.  You know, because I mean, I've kind of been embedded  in the Android world for a while,  and I couldn't tell if I'm just like relieved  because you know, Android hasn't been fantastic  up until now or if it truly is great.  And so it's nice to see people like MG  who have been very highly critical of Android,  that they like it.  It's a great device.  I love it.  I can't keep my hands off this thing.  I haven't touched my iPad.  I find myself reaching for it all the time.  It's just a great device.  And all of my iPad stuff works with it too.  My keyboard and stylus.  I don't know, what are you thinking, Leo?  You've had it for a few days now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I completely agree.  Andy Anaco says Google just released $199 computer.  That's, you know, the first thing you marvel at,  this is a quad core Tegra 3 processor, super fast.  It's a beautiful high def IPS screen  with great off angle viewing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not quite retina.  Not quite retina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I think it's over 200 DPI.  I mean, it's good, right?  Very snappy.  And this is what MG noted,  it really establishes that a seven inch tablet  is a good form factor.  You may not, it may be superior even  to the four by three 10 inch iPad.  I wish it would go landscape.  It does.  All you have to do is tap this button.  Oh, not on the home screen.  The home screen doesn't.  But if you're like, let's say we're in Google Plus.  This is just getting used to Jelly Bean.  You tap what?  There's, when you slide down the notifications,  there's a little rotator there that you can lock or unlock.  And the default by the way is locked.  And now if I slide it up again, it should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do need remedial help with these things always.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And by the way, I love the way Google Plus,  when you're in portrait mode, scrolls up.  And when you're in landscape mode,  That's cool.  You know, and it's beautiful.  Yeah, that looks really nice.  It's beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff, don't feel bad.  I accidentally locked the orientation  just by pulling down the notifications  and I didn't realize that I'd done it.  And I answered a question on Quora  about whether or not this thing could be a GPS.  And I said, oh, the maps is portrait only,  which was completely wrong.  I just locked it.  So don't feel bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The text is, I've been using it all day.  The text is a little small for my age of eyes  and I can't find where to increase that.  Yeah, you can change that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I hate to tell you.  I'll take that.  It can make a bigger.  Oh, Jesus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll give you a little in-service.  That is part of the insight though about it.  You know, a non-Apple iOS.  It's a little harder to find those things.  You gotta dig around a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, that rotation lock is very obscure.  It's a tiny little icon.  And then drop down of the notifications,  that's really where you put it.  And it is one of the complaints I had  about Ice Cream Sandwich,  which it holds up through Jelly Bean,  is things like that.  That's how you get to settings on this,  is you pull down notifications  and there's a tiny little settings icon.  That to me is not the best user interface, but that's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I really liked it all day.  What else about it?  I think what it motivates me to do finally,  is I have my iPhone still.  I'm still on Apple Calendar and Mail.  I'm finally gonna really make the switch  and go full Android, Google on all these functions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've got the Kindle app on here.  This is a perfect size for book reading.  You don't need the bigger size, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you can lay in bed.  It's light enough.  You can hold it with one hand and read,  which is really nice.  I gotta make a Skype call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can I make a Skype call to, let me, which?  What I wanna know is whether I can get on the show with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You might be able to, yeah.  Considering that I'm always in desperate straits  and the Tanzania trying to get on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You should be able to.  Now, it doesn't have a back camera.  It does have a front camera  and the front camera works for Hangouts.  Skype says, well, we don't know anything about this device.  We think it'll work.  But let me try it.  I haven't tried it.  Okay, let me see if I have line three here.  I'll go down to my contacts.  Don't show this yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff, if you go into settings, accessibility,  there is a large text checkbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the old guy's setting.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's in the old guy's setting.  All right, so I am now calling Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They make that accessible.  I mean, no offense to accessibility, but geez.  Can it just be one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, it's a blocked contact.  I can't call you, apparently.  Oh, yeah, this might be old.  You call me, I'm Chief Twit.  Got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ooh, it's awfully big, but all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What are the, oh, I love,  and I should, this is the biggest new thing  that you can only get in Jelly Bean, Google Now.  And that was the thing where I was talking  about the creepy factor, like Google Now  knows that you like the giants  because you've been searching for them.  So this is a Google Now.  You can see, now I'm going to show you Google Now,  but you can, oh, wait a minute.  Somebody's calling me.  Let's see.  I'll answer with video.  Now, will you see?  There's me.  There's me looking at me.  Now, can you go to a line three and show me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One second.  I'll turn down the audio.  And so this is the video we're getting from you.  So yeah, you can.  Now, if I flip it, will it, oh yeah, it does.  That's pretty good.  Pretty good.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're laughing because I'm making, I'm mugging.  But the fact that you can use Skype with this  means you can use this for phone calls.  That's huge.  If you're on wifi, right.  Right.  No 3G.  That's kind of a negative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it is.  That's for it to be an option,  but I think to make it simpler,  I went ahead and bought the larger version.  I bought the 16 gig.  Why not?  Version, why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, one of the things I've noted,  people say, well, Apple has 64 gigs.  So much of this is in the cloud  that you don't necessarily,  like for instance, Google Music,  you're playing from the cloud.  Yeah, you're on wifi anyway.  So the things that normally we would have loaded this up  with video, audio,  you just play off the internet on wifi.  Except for the airplane.  Yeah, for the airplane, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you can download from Play Store.  You can download.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I've got another remedial question for you.  So yes, I said yes, of course, to Google Now,  but I've got this,  I still have my perennial problem of two accounts.  So my account for this is my basic Gmail account,  but my Buzz Machine account,  I'd like to make that the one for Google Now,  and I can't figure out how to switch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can add an account.  Can you add more than one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You added the account in settings?  Oh, so you want Google Now to work with that other account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's where I'm gonna have my calendar  and all that stuff, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is Google Now just for people who wanna see.  So let me start over again.  You have the search box at the top.  If you tap it, if you tap the microphone,  you'll do an audio search.  But this is recent Google searches from any machine.  So these were searches I did on my laptop,  but it synchronized them over.  Cards show here when you need them.  So this is my next appointment,  triangulation coming up with Eben Upton of Raspberry Pi.  Seven minutes, normal traffic.  Do you care about traffic to this place?  Yes, I do.  This is work, so I'm gonna say work.  This is the first time it's asked me that, so that's good.  That's my workplace.  Here's the current weather report,  and I know it's gonna be 91 degrees on Saturday.  That's useful.  Here's some sample cards.  So this isn't really, I kind of like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like it too, but I'm not getting enough out of it,  and when I do try to switch to my apps account,  it just goes to a blank search page.  It gives me no cards at all.  If you just-  I don't know you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So in settings in Google Now,  you set the privacy accounts,  you did choose the other account.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it won't, it doesn't like me there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can by hand, I guess, put in a team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, so I just switched to my other account.  It says, are you in?  Yes, I'm in.  Tells me I'm in San Diego, what the weather is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just think this could get better and better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Web 9720 says you have to enable it  in your Google Apps settings, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you very much.  Enable Google Now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In your apps, apparently.  I don't know if he's making that up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did it prompt you and say, do you want to turn this on?  I had to tap like, yes, I'm in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  In fact, I tapped no by accident,  and then I had to search around  to find out how to turn it back on,  but it's in the settings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Leo, you saw that from the lock screen,  you get into now by kind of just like,  by dragging out the lock and the Google is right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's cool.  See, I have a pattern on that,  so I don't get to see a lot.  I wish they would allow you that kind of functionality  and the pattern.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Face recognition is in this.  Front facing camera enables that.  That's a gimmick, I don't recommend it necessarily.  Just nice, really nice.  And you can see why the rumors are  that Apple's gonna make a seven inch tablet,  or in their case, almost eight inches.  Theirs is gonna be square though.  I think this is exactly what you want.  You could put this in a pocket, a back pocket,  stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What strikes me is that there is no right size.  That we're dancing around.  There just plain is no right size.  And that's where I think we gotta get  to the next level of displays.  And that's where glass comes in.  That's where bendable displays will come in  and things like that.  Because in some ways, this feels cramped to me  for certain purposes.  In other ways, it feels just right to me.  The difference between this and a five inch  isn't that huge.  Different strokes, different needs, different folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Flipboard looks great on this.  This is no longer exclusive to the Galaxy S3.  Just really fantastic.  I couldn't be happier.  I spent a lot of time in bed with this last night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is a stat I saw by the way on Twitter yesterday.  I forget who had it.  That most, I think it was from the Fortune Conference.  Bill Gross tweeted this.  That most, the highest level of tablet activity  is 10, 15 at night.  Which I of course responded, born!  Not that I would do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've got chess games going on.  This is exactly the right size.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the computer you want in your hands  when there's dumb TV on  and you're half paying attention.  You wanna read and multitask.  And it's so light.  It feels very, it's a lot more casual to me than the iPad.  The iPad just feels heavier and colder.  It's got more weight to it.  This just feels more just like a book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And can I just say again, $200.  $200 bucks.  That's less than a netbook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And a rock solid Linux based operating system.  There's a lot to recommend this.  And Android is just really good.  Hundreds of thousands of apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, the apps are there now.  You really can't, the argument that the apps  that you want aren't on Android  just doesn't hold as much water anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It costs less than an iPod Classic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a very good analogy, Chad, Chad Johnson.  The iPod Classic is $249.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That says a lot.  This is amazing.  Battery life, I've got 15 hours and 15 minutes on battery.  60%, that can't be right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mine didn't charge last night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Much like a, I think that that's wrong.  I think I charged it in between there.  But I would say eight or nine hours for sure.  Not a problem.  Screen is what uses most of it.  Very, very medium battery life for the,  battery usage for everything else.  It's the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And man, Chrome, Chrome on Android is awesome.  And it's just not as good on iOS.  Like it's got the- No, this is so cool.  It's got that magnification when you tap,  when you tap in an area where the links are real close,  it magnifies and so you can tap,  so you don't ever tap to the wrong place.  That request desktop site, so great.  Isn't that great?  When you get redirected to this crappy mobile site,  you just say to request desktop site,  you get exactly what you get on your desktop.  And the syncing the tabs across computers.  Now, Android for, Chrome for Android,  you don't need the Nexus 7.  You can get it on, you can get on any version of Android,  I think, maybe as far back as Gingerbread.  But the fact that it's the default browser on Jelly Bean  and it's on this beautiful, bigger screen,  man, I've just been loving it.  So great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, I heavily customized mine.  I took off all the content consumption widgets.  But when you get it out of the box,  it shows magazines, it shows TV,  it shows movies, it shows books.  They're very- That was a little bit of-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That reminds me of the- It looked like the Fire.  It looked like the Fire.  Yeah, well, it reminded me of the days of getting  the crapware you got on computers all the time.  And there's some-  I wasn't crazy about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  This is a Play Store buying device.  I mean, this is, you know, this is,  let's just be clear about what this is.  They want you to buy stuff from the Play Store  and let's also be frank,  the Play Store's movies and TV selection is not great.  No.  Right.  But, you know, they're making, this is, you know,  Google making a bet, right, on the future  that you're gonna be buying this media.  I mean, I installed the Kindle app  and I'm reading my Kindle books.  Yep.  So, and I want it.  You get a credit.  Did you get a credit to the Play Store,  the $25 Play Store credit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or was that-  No, that was for you guys.  But I think we did get some free content.  I'm looking at Transformers Dark Side of the Moon.  Yeah, I got a credit too.  Did you?  I just didn't notice it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so they want you to set up your account  and have the purchasing experience  and get some media onto it.  I mean, on Google Music, I really wasn't using it before,  but now that it's on the seven, I am using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, because all your music, it's amazing.  You log in and all your music is available  on your thing already.  It's great.  All your music, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Someone in the chat room pointed out  that Chrome is 4.0, Android 4.0 and above.  Oh, that's right.  That's too bad.  It's ICS and up.  Yeah.  This is not the Android experience  that most people are having.  But this is, for people who've been curious about Android,  I mean, certainly not our listeners or viewers,  but people who've been curious about Android,  200 bucks, no contract.  And this is, I think we're gonna see a lot more developers  take the larger screen more seriously.  And this is no Zoom.  This is no tab.  This is a serious Android tablet.  And so I think we're gonna see a lot more apps  in the next few months come out just for this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think this is a breakthrough product.  And I don't think this is the last $200 computer  we're gonna see.  And it's thanks to the free and open Linux operating system  that this can even exist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Google, thanks to Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Apparently has a magnetic sensor.  You know, is that what this thing is  on the lower left-hand side, the four copper dots?  Is that a magnetic sensor?  Is that a charging?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think so.  That looks like a charging thing.  Not clear what that is.  You know, I watched the video that showed the magnet  and it would come home stream and go on and off.  I couldn't reproduce it with mine.  Were you able to reproduce it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we were able to do it with a smart cover,  ironically from an Apple iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I tried that.  It wasn't easy.  It wasn't easy.  I kinda had to flop it around.  And it's the lower left corner?  Supposedly, yeah.  Like down here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we were able to yesterday flop it around  and we got it to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm dying.  I got so addicted to my keyboard for the iPad.  I'm dying for a nice case for this with the keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This will work with any Bluetooth.  There's an HP netbook for $299  with a crappy Atom processor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I still don't understand why the Chromebook is so expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, this is what you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Chrome OS, I have never got Chrome OS.  I still don't.  This is what you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think for my students, there's an opportunity for Chrome OS  because I think when you use things like WeVideo,  which is an online video editing platform,  you use online photo editing and that kind of stuff,  I think our students could get a really inexpensive device  to do media online and that has some power to it.  That's why I mentioned the Chromebook.  But yeah, I don't know how long it is.  And for internet cafes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, go ahead, Jeff, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was just gonna say, finish.  It's now available in 100 Best Buy.  So if you wanna get your hands on one,  you can find a Best Buy and go touch it.  Go ahead, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I was gonna say just like internet cafes  and school libraries and just places  where there should be internet access,  student centers and that kind of thing  that makes complete sense.  But I admit I haven't opened my Chrome box yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And just in case you're curious,  this from the Risk Assessment blog on Ars Technica,  according to a quote, serial hacker,  Jelly Bean will make it much harder to exploit  because of security features written in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This was a Google engineer who said it would be pretty hard  or this was a-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Security researcher John Oberheide  published a analysis.  I don't think he's a Google guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, I was gonna say, if Google's saying that,  it's just inviting people to-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He works for Duo Security, exploit mitigations  in Android Jelly Bean 4.1, John Oberheide.  They're doing ASLR, address space randomization,  which actually desktop operating systems  have been doing for some time.  Makes it very difficult to write data,  write programming programs into the data stack  and then execute them, because it's all moved around.  That's good.  Yeah.  So pretty good, pretty impressive.  Position independent executables,  address space randomization, linker randomization,  ELF hardening, info leak prevention.  They're really doing some good stuff.  And you need to, right?  You don't wanna make this an easily exploited platform.  Chrome for iOS owns 1.5% of the iOS browser market.  Pretty amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Today, the import ban on Motorola Android products  takes effect.  So if you wanted to Zoom, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For all those people clamoring for a Zoom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, it's 18 products, including phones, of course.  Motorola says, we can't share specific details.  We have employed a range of proactive measures  to ensure there's no continuing infringement  under the ITC's interpretation  of this single Microsoft patent.  So that means the Atrix, the Backflip, the Bravo,  the Charm, the Click, the Defy, the Devour, the Droid,  the Flipout, the FlipSlide, the Spice and the Zoom  will all get patches of some kind  that will make it legal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yet in the UK, you'll see a link to down from there,  Apple is now ordered to eat crow in public  regarding the Samsung tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This judge, I like this judge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He is really, is this the same judge who said  Samsung is not cool enough to have stolen anything?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Was that the one?  Yeah, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  He says, okay, Apple was ordered by a judge  to publish a notice on its website in the UK  and in British newspapers saying,  Samsung did not copy designs for the iPad.  Holy cow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It should be posted on the homepage for six months  and published in several newspapers and magazines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's hardcore.  Wait, wait, wait, on the homepage of Apple.com,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  there's going to be a statement  that Samsung did not copy them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In England only, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In England only, okay, so apple.co.uk or whatever?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, that screenshot went everywhere.  Somebody put up, I thought I put it on the rundown,  but there was a cartoon of Simpsons at the blackboard.  Apple did not, Samsung did not steal from Apple.  Apple promised to stop being a dork.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now Apple, it won't happen tomorrow  because Apple is appealing.  So who knows, something could change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple's good at a lot of things,  but eating pro, not one of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That judge was clearly no Apple fan.  I mean, he's the guy who said, in his ruling,  he said, oh no, Samsung,  not only did Samsung not copy you, Apple,  they are not cool enough to have copied you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That guy, I don't know what he's smoking, but whew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Holy cow.  Office 2013, we haven't talked about it.  That really is a very interesting shift for Microsoft,  totally cloud-based.  In fact, the default, when you save a document  and word on the desktop is to save it to the cloud,  not to the desktop.  SkyDrive is the default for where stuff goes.  It will have Metro.  The rumor mill continues, but no word from Microsoft  whether there will be Android or iOS versions of Office 13,  but everybody thinks that's probably the case,  maybe after the Surface ships.  All right, we're gonna take a break when we come back.  Gina's tip, Jeff's number, and my tool.  But first, Ting.  You know, I made the mistake.  I gave my Lent, my Ting phone, to Jolie Odell,  and I still don't have it back.  Be careful who you lend your phones to.  Ting is really cool.  This is Elliot Noss and his gang at TwoCast  who have reinvented how domain name registration happens,  have done the same now,  or attempted to do the same with Self Service.  Their whole idea is to do a cell company  that has honest pricing.  No, I'm sorry, that can't possibly work.  The bills for megabytes, minutes,  and text messages separately,  and you only pay for what you use,  and you never pay a penalty for using more.  There are no premiums, no penalties.  You pay for exactly what you use.  They have all the best 4G Android phones.  They're on the Sprint network, so if you get Sprint,  if Sprint works where you are, it'll work great.  And we're gonna give you a deal,  $50 off your device purchase.  If you go to twingting.com slash twig.  But browse around before you decide to buy.  Take a look at the plants.  For instance, this is so cool.  These are, you choose how many phones you want  from one on up.  That's why this is great for families or businesses.  I think I'm gonna have two phones,  and I'm gonna buy a package of minutes,  say 2,000 minutes, 4,000 text messages,  three gigabytes of data.  That's a ton of everything.  $118 a month for both phones.  Now, here's the beauty part.  If I don't use all those minutes, they give me a refund.  If I don't use all those messages, they give me a refund.  If I use more, they just charge me prorated  at the rate that I would have paid if I'd chosen that plan.  And always included at no charge.  Voicemail, picture and video messaging,  three-way calling, caller ID, and I know you want this,  tethering and hotspotting.  Included, free.  Businesses and families can have unlimited devices  on an account and can manage and track each device.  They've got a great web interface.  It really is fantastic.  I want you to try Ting right now.  Visit ting.com slash twig when you do $50  off your phone purchase.  This is how a cell phone company should be.  And you know, if you've been using Ting, let me know.  I'd love to hear from some Ting users.  Really fantastic, it's so cool.  They have hotspots too, the dongles, the Mi-Fis.  Ting.com slash twig, we thank them for their support.  We thank them, more importantly,  for changing the cell business.  Maybe this will be a shot across the bow on the big guys.  Okay, Gina Trapani, your tip, I'm sure,  yeah, you got several tips here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I got two tips.  This one, the first one flew by in Google Plus  while we were talking.  We talked about this at Google I.O.  We talked about that Google was gonna enable offline access  to your docs and Google Docs.  And apparently that just became available.  Yay!  Yeah, you go to your docs, which is drive.google.com  and you click on the More link in the tool belt.  The tool belt is what they call the links  kind of down the side.  Click on the More link, click on offline docs.  You have to actually enable them.  And you only want to enable them on your own computer,  not a public computer.  So you click on enable offline docs  and then you install a Chrome web app to manage offline docs.  So if you're writing something and you go offline  or you're on a plane, you can continue to work on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now you have to be using Chrome for this to work  or can you use other browsers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have to install the drive Chrome web app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so it sounds like you need to be using Chrome, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it looks like you do need to be using Chrome,  add to Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's how mail works too.  I mean, I've been using the offline mail  for Gmail, both accounts.  And in some ways, the Chrome app is almost better  than the web app.  Really?  Yeah, it's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to have to try this.  But that wasn't your original tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My original tip was a Bing tip  because I know so many people here  who will just see the show are using Bing.  Well, you know, I've been kind of,  I've really been digging Foursquare lately.  Foursquare is so great.  I'm totally into it.  The new mobile app is great.  I've been noticing.  I've just been using lists and comments a lot more.  Anyway, Bing just announced that Foursquare tips  are now integrated in there,  what they call their social sidebar.  So if you search for a place,  let's see if it works for, for, for Twit.  You search for Twit and there's a public tip on Foursquare  about the Twit brick house.  You'll see it in the sidebar.  I'm going to try it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's Chad's tip.  Check out the hot tub in the basement, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It should say that.  Oh, that's interesting.  So it's funny.  So I searched for Twit and I see,  it tells you friends who might know something  about this place.  Leah Laporte has worked at Twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, you have.  Yes, I have.  Until Marissa Meyer bought it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You've been in possession for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I hadn't looked at this social sidebar  in a while.  There's a lot of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Apparently, I have a pirate working here.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you can see, yeah.  So you can see reviews and yeah,  Jessica J has left a tip about Star with Starbucks.  I just searched for Starbucks.  So if you're a fan of Foursquare, which I am,  and you're interested to see kind of, you know,  that content show up in other places,  I would love actually to see this in Google search results  or DuckDuckGo search results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's neat.  Yeah. That's interesting.  I like Foursquare.  I hope it, I do hope it continues on successfully.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are good people and they're doing some good things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there are good people.  They really care.  And they built something I never thought  I would ever, ever want the participants to know.  I know.  It's a really compelling user experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the pivot, the minor pivot they did  to being a useful directory of what's around you  has really made a difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dennis's vision has always been,  I interviewed him for public parts,  and Dennis's vision has always been  that it's a serendipity generator.  Right.  That you get to the airport,  gee, I didn't know that Gina was here  and I can go harass her.  Right.  I've been wanting to try this restaurant.  Oh, thank you for reminding me  that it really becomes that kind of helpful friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, when I see that a friend has left a tip  someplace that I've checked into  and I've never been to before, I get so excited.  Like, oh, this is, you know,  I have kind of inside information and someone I know.  Yeah, it's this common experience, you know,  that can be disconnected by a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff, your number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll do two, because I'm into social this week.  A study says that the click-through rates  for ads that are in, this is on Inside Facebook,  that are in the feed on Facebook beat those on Twitter,  because Facebook has more targeting data.  And now finally the value of Facebook  starts to become clear.  What's also interesting though,  is that the click-through on mobile Facebook  beats that on web Facebook.  So just to throw the numbers out,  it's 1.14 click-through rate for mobile Facebook,  0.588 click-through rate for web Facebook,  and 0.2664 for Twitter.  I believe that.
