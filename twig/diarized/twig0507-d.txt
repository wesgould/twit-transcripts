From the Newhart School.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Newhart? No, Bob Newhart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Newman!  From the Bob Newhart School of Journalism. It's not the name?  No. It's the Craig Newmark.  It's not Newmark. It's Newmark.  The Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.  And we love having you in studio. So it's nice to see you. You're color is so much better in real life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't realize it was Wednesday. It smelled like soy sauce day here at Twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well we don't always have Chinese. But we did today.  I hope you partook of our festive feast for all of our...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo was so good he just ate broccoli.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I had some beef with the broccoli.  Kevin Tuffles back too. He was here. It was so great to have you Kevin.  You weren't really filling in. You were joining me for the keynote yesterday of Google I.O.  And then you took off because Liverpool Barcelona was about to start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, yes, yes. And somehow, someway we needed four goals and got them.  So it's very happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Very happy. But you did something very, I thought, impressive at the same time as you're watching this most important football game.  You also watched the developer keynote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, I did. I had to mute the game and I was shouting and screaming and jumping around every time we scored.  But on the other screen I was listening to and watching the developer keynote for Promo S News because there wasn't any in the main keynote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kevin is of course the guy behind AboutChromebooks.com. So it is kind of a professional.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My beloved AboutChromebooks. His beloved. I love it.  Our beloved. We all love it.  Yes, we love it AboutChromebooks. And my Bible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Co-host with Stacey Higginbotham on the I Have to Say podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I saw Rick Ostrillo after yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He was on stage. Rick, people remember from the old Motorola days when Google bought Motorola, he came over, introduced the Moto X and now is in charge of all Google hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So after they said he was doing his Oprah moment, and we hoped that would be having a self-driving car under the seat, but we didn't get that.  But we did get phones. But I went up to him and I said, I have one thing to say. That's not a question. It's begging. I love my Chromebook.  Please.  And he said we're committed to Chromebooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good. So there may be a new Pixelbook.  And we have four teachers from Sacramento who are fist pumping right now. I guess you guys use Chromebooks in the schools. Yeah, nice. Nice.  Yeah, I love Chromebooks. Love them.  And they should be committed to Chromebooks. It's doing so well. It's causing Microsoft to kind of shift its direction with its hardware.  They're going to do a version of Windows Lite designed to be basically a Chromebook for schools.  I don't know if Apple's changed its direction, but I think it's an important product.  But let's start by talking about this because the Pixel 3A was the big announcement at Google I.O.  And I authorized Karsten to run out to the Verizon store. He's been still using like a really old phone.  So we thought we'd get him a new phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've still got the OG Pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The OG? That's a long time ago.  Oh, that is. Yeah. So you deserve a new one.  Jeff and I were both puzzled by... Can you get a close up of the back of this box?  Because we're both puzzled by the graphic on the back of the box.  There's the phone. There's a chair. There's a manila envelope.  There's a piece of concrete. I don't understand.  It's terrible. It's terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is that? Why there can't be anything else? It's concrete.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why would you put that on the box to show how tough it is?  But it's not. It's plastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not.  It's better than glass. True.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So let's open it up. Do you mind, Karsten, if I open your new phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do it at the same time? Double unboxing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Double unboxing. So a nice little plastic strip here that we were able to easily peel off.  Uh oh, there's two of them.  That's a lot better than trying to slit it with your thumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How long since we've done unboxing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Quite a while. It's kind of boring, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why did we ever think this was interesting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now it's a new thing on YouTube for kids.  Let's make a 20 minute video out of it.  So this really feels pretty nice, actually. It does.  Plastic's a fine material. It's not a...  They gave us cases, too.  That's good. Were they made out of concrete?  So the sacrifice you're making here, there are a few.  It doesn't have the depth sensing camera on the front, just the standard 8 megapixel front facing camera.  The back does, though, have the same 12.2 megapixel sensor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They emphasize that the software means this is as good as the Pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, but I'm wondering about that because it doesn't have the imaging DSP that the Pixel, the big brother Pixel has.  So it doesn't have the hardware support, but of course that just means probably it does the same things a little bit slower.  Dieter Bohn in his Verge Review said the camera was exactly, or almost exactly as good.  And that's really what people are buying these Pixels for, the same fingerprint reader on the back.  This is a six inch screen. This is the Pixel 3A XL.  They also have a smaller...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, fairly sizable bezel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but you know what you get with that bezel?  Two things. No notch.  Yay!  And a headphone jack.  Yay!  So to be honest, I think, where's the headphone jack?  Oh, that's a good question. There, on the top.  It's on the top.  Remember where they used to be there?  Wow, they used to be there. Now they are again.  It does make sense to me, not coming out of the bottom, but coming out of the top.  I'm really actually pleased.  I wonder, do you think, Kevin, this is kind of a retreat for Google saying, well, maybe that notch thing in the head, lack of the jack was a mistake?  You follow Apple into your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At your peril.  Kevin, you're muted.  Bill, your?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think they... I don't think it's a retreat.  I think it's an easy way for them to cut costs in terms of design and special parts.  I mean, this starts at $399. I think you guys have the XLs. That's $479.  I don't think it's a retreat at all.  I think they're just trying to get their stock Android devices in people's hands because they just aren't, you know, selling.  They only had one carrier for the last couple of years that we're selling in stores.  Now that we've got four or five carriers, and I don't think it's a retreat.  I think it's a smart expansion strategy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think, Kevin, you're right.  You go back, I remember when they introduced Android low many years ago.  The whole strategy was get them in as many hands as possible.  That's why we go open source. We get them everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is a little weird.  Remember, we were all a little bit upset that the Nexus phone program, which was a less expensive, pure Google experience,  got replaced by the Pixel phones, which is still a pure Google experience, but a feature phone price.  And I thought that maybe was kind of contrary to the whole spirit of the Nexus.  Maybe they're going back to that. Maybe they will continue to have a low cost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The thing that struck me most about the keynote yesterday and the day was shrinking the machine learning model from 100 gigs down to half a gig.  That was impressive, wasn't it?  It was extremely impressive.  And by making that local, what's possible in this device is awe inspiring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and that was in general, if I were going to pick one thing about the keynote yesterday,  it seemed to me that the main point Google was making is, well, yes, we collect a lot of information about you.  There's a benefit to that. Ben Thompson talks a little bit about it in his Stratecary column today.  Google fights back. There's a benefit for you.  And then I loved it that they also said, but we're going to do more and more on device.  We're going to give you incognito mode, not just in the browser, but in maps.  I think it's an acknowledgement that privacy is an important feature.  And I think that for Google to say, we think we can do a great job for you by knowing your information,  but we also want to give you the chance to protect yourself.  It's not so different from the way Google has always been with the and they pointed out,  they showed the day to liberation front and Google take out and all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of the it's an obligatory mom and apple pie thing you have to do in every keynote now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Privacy. You got to salute the privacy and ethics.  Ben says, to put it more succinctly, Pachaya effectively said, yes, we collect a lot of data,  but that data makes amazing things possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think there's a little more to it, though, even privacy was one of the main features  and factors of the keynote without a doubt.  I don't know that Google was technically capable to deliver what it wanted to deliver  and yet still offer more privacy until recently.  You know, that machine learning model that Jeff brought up is a great example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I see, Kevin, because they had to send the data up before.  Now that the machine learning is local, they don't have to send the data up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's correct. That's all based on device.  Now the models themselves will go back up in small bits and pieces without data.  And again, I don't know that they were ready to deliver that, say, two, three, four years ago.  So it's taken them a long time to get here.  But now it's kind of like, hmm, maybe we're over the hump of the mountain here with privacy.  And everything happens on devices.  And they just learn from those models that are generated on the devices, not the data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, Kevin, Kevin explains to me what you just said, because I missed it as it was going by in the keynote.  When there's a machine learning model is down on the phone, it learns and does things.  The lessons that it learns is what you're saying is that it's the conclusion that it comes to about a best method  that goes back up to improve the machine learning federated, but not your data that goes back up.  Is that what you're saying?  That's exactly. Yeah, they said that yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They showed a little graphic where they kind of flipped the model, Jeff,  instead of having all of the machine learning happening in the cloud, which is why your data had to go to the cloud.  Now the machine learning can happen on the phone.  Your data stays on the phone.  And what it's learned, the conclusion, as you said, from the modeling, goes back to the cloud and gets aggregated as a giant.  We'll call it a giant model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's the federal that's using the word federated in that sense, which means that that they have the ability of learning going on in all of these places.  It's so impressive.  I think that was I tweeted yesterday that we moved from an era of Intel inside to AI inside that that when all of that power is in your device, what it can do.  I mean, it was so impressive just with the speed of a conversation of multitasking and all that.  But it goes so far beyond that that it was really, really impressive.  I thought that was that was huge yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do wonder, though, and I'm not technical enough to know this, but it sounds as if if you we talked a little bit about this during the keynote.  You have public data and machine learning occurring on powerful processors, TPUs, perhaps in the cloud, perhaps on machine generating this data set, which you can then put on the phone in a much reduced size.  I think at that point, it's static.  I what do you think, Kevin?  I don't think you're going to be able to add to that data set.  You've now created a machine learning.  So, for instance, they showed it was really impressive.  An illiterate Indian woman who was using Google, basically Google Lens, I guess, to read signs to tell you to buy railroad tickets.  She says, this gives me such freedom.  I have to ask for somebody to read this for me has changed my life.  But the technology that lens technology on that phone, I don't think that could be updated.  I have a feeling it could be updated maybe as a big mass download, but it's not learning anymore.  Well, I don't know.  That's what they were kind of saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What Kevin just said is why I caught on this is that is that it does learn some things there and federates that back up to the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they showed that mechanism, but I'm not sure if that's the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What does it mean for machine learning to learn something?  Kevin, what do you think?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't say I'm technical enough to fully understand it either.  My thought process is that the models themselves could be updated.  I think about it.  They said that they shrunken down that one machine learning model from 100 gig to half a half a gig.  Half a gig is certainly downloadable and updates to something that's a half a gig are easily up, you know, downloadable.  So I don't know.  But it's not. Here's my point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not updateable with information it's gleaning from your phone at this time.  So unlike we often hear of assistants that are getting smarter because they're learning your patterns.  Right.  If you have a canned data set, that's not going to be a changed in any way.  That's a static data set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, but right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you have you can have generic stuff uploaded to the cloud.  That data set can get better generically, but it's not learning from you at that point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Understood. But it can send response data from you.  Yeah, but I think that's entirely separate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, because they want to they want to decouple it from your identity.  So I think that's an entirely separate function.  So what I think we're saying this.  Yeah, but what we're saying is true in both cases, which is that that can data set is is now immutable.  It's the way it is.  You could download a new one every not going to be learning from you, particularly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kevin's point is still still, I think, very valid.  Is it is the shrinkage is what enabled them to do the privacy that they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. Yeah, no, the shrinkage is huge because also these data sets normally are gigantic.  And so you couldn't put them on a phone.  You couldn't reasonably download them and you couldn't put them on a phone and they wouldn't be useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I'm not sure what they're doing with that word anymore, though, because I keep thinking of the Seinfeld episode when you guys say shrinkage.  Sorry, it just keeps coming to mind.  It was a little cold yesterday at I.O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was it? Yeah. They ever hand out that sunscreen?  I don't think no. No, we we we journalists didn't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You see, I got it. Oh, you did get a burn.  I got a burn. And so I think we've all learned something here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Even the stripe of the of the lanyard, even during overcast weather, you still get a sunburn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to go back to Ben Thompson's things. I think it's important.  I tweeted yesterday there were two great goose bumps moments, one you just mentioned, which is the illiterate incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And he leads with that as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then the other one was gathering data for those who have trouble with their language.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wasn't that amazing?  Wasn't that amazing? Dimitri, who was, I think, both a Russian native Russian speaker and had a speech impediment of some kind, who was you could kind of understand, very difficult.  But they kind of glossed over this a little bit.  But he had to provide fifteen thousand individual speech samples for this.  So it's not well, he's a researcher at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I think he did it to get going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So and the effect this is the euphonium project they solicited.  They said if anybody has difficulty communicating with our assistance, G.C.O. slash euphonium, we'd love to get more volunteers.  But it points up kind of a problem with this, which is it can't be generalized.  It's at least specific to that speaker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, but you could say people who have who stutter or people who have MS.  It may make it better at nonstandard speech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of course, the worst, of course, which is people from Scotland.  I don't think we'll ever do it.  Are you going to do it?  No, I already insulted Scotland enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Ben Ben's point here is when I was thinking of yesterday, too, is it's not just Google fights back.  It's the Internet fights back.  The technologists fight back.  Yesterday was all was filled, not all about, but it's filled with moments of look at the good things we can do because we have this technology.  Google has always done that.  Apple's always done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They did it more than ever yesterday.  And they certainly had heartwarming moments.  I mean, those both those videos were like, wow.  Now, on the other hand, not once did they use the word advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The core business model thing that fire corporation tire and didn't get in there at all.  And and I found that kind of interesting.  But that aside, it was technology saying technology is still OK.  It's not evil.  It's not ruining the world.  It's all right, folks.  And I was glad to see you like that.  Yeah, I like that.  Yes, I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff, do you think this is the start of a shift because they can't just they've been looking to expand beyond advertising for years.  Other bets is all about that, obviously.  When they start getting machine learning models on the device, think about it.  And maybe this is a stretch.  But what they showed in the videos is because Gmail knows so much about you, that's why it can help you get a car on your next trip, because it's got emails that show you're going somewhere, et cetera.  That's all happening through the cloud as well.  What if that all moves down to the lowest level of the device?  And advertising, in a sense, starts to not be Google's number one priority anymore.  It's so much of their revenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know what the latest number is, and it's hard to imagine them shrinking that much.  Here's what Ben writes about this, which I think is right on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There should be, to be sure, concerns about Google believing their own hype.  Many of the problems with YouTube, for example, stem from the Pollyanna-ish assumption that treats technology as an adhering good.  Instead of an amoral force that makes everything, both positive outcomes and negative ones, easier and more efficient to achieve.  At the same time, from a purely strategic perspective, the positive message makes sense.  Presuming that everything about technology is bad is just as mistaken as the opposite.  And the fact of the matter is lots of people like Google products and reminding them of the fact is Google's long-term benefit.  Moreover, and this is the paragraph that's really, I think, seminal.  Moreover, a world of assistance in machine learning based products is very much to Google's advantage.  The argument to not simply tolerate Google's collection of data, but to actually give them more, is less about some lame case about better targeted ads, but about making actually useful products better.  The better targeted ads are a strategy credit, which is what Ben Thompson, is this a phrase?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The whole thing yesterday was that we wanted a, what was the word, a useful home? No, a helpful home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google's your help. Google's well aware that all of this aids its bottom line, but they're smart to focus on the fact that it's also helpful to you.  And this is a trade-off you and I have talked about a lot. This is a trade-off I and you and I suspect Kevin are willing to make.  We get a lot of benefit. It started with Google Now cards.  Remember that it would know when you got to the airport that you had a flight and it would pop up that card?  That required looking at your email, knowing your travel plans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and now the fact that you can say make a car reservation and it pulls that data in and prefills it, it goes way beyond the Now card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's really interesting though that Google deprecated Now, which perhaps crossed the creepy line in a way that this doesn't, which does the same thing.  This is transactional.  It does the same exact thing, but it's less creepy because you're asking it.  Yes.  Well, it just happens to know. I also liked that Google showed how, in the restaurant recommendations, or I guess it was the recipe recommendations where you said what should I make for dinner?  It showed a meal to make, but it showed you below it why Google thought that, where it got that information based on searches you've made or other recipes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which Amazon used to do. They stopped doing it, but they used to do it too.  I think that helps with the creepy factor too.  Yeah, so I mentioned, so next week my friend David Weinberger's book comes out, Everyday Chaos, and I think that part of the problem we have here is that machine learning is going to be less and less explicable.  We're not going to know why it comes to the conclusions it does about us or about the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. And in fact, it's reductionist to say under that beef bourbon recipe, oh, this is based on your searches.  It's based on a hell of a lot more than that, but it makes us feel a little better.  Right.  So, you know, maybe that's just a little benign white lie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. It could be people who don't care about the climate like you eat a lot of beef.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The truth is we know you have heart disease, buddy, and there's only one possible way. It's from eating a lot of beef bourbon, so have some more.  We'll be passing this along to Allstate later.  You know, it's so hard with these kinds of events because companies, besides Microsoft, which somehow just completely fumbled its keynote on Monday, but companies now know how to tug the right heartstrings, how to position their message in a positive way.  Apple led the way with this. Apple showed how a keynote can be used to create an incredible halo effect.  Sometimes people call that the reality distortion field that Steve Jobs created.  And so there is definitely around modern keynotes this sense as you come out of this of this glow of, man, that Google, they're doing great stuff, aren't they?  That sometimes takes a while to wear off. Last year was Google Duplex, and it took a day or two before people said, wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Duplex was back this time on a heartwarming use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they've learned. They've got a good machine learning model.  So maybe we haven't, it hasn't quite worn off yet, but let's attempt to look beyond the reality distortion field and the glow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's also nice, refreshing, once in a while to look beyond the dystopia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. I know. I mean, I'm very happily living in the Google universe. And go ahead and try not to.  So in a way I'm I think I'm embracing as most of us do the inevitable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kevin, did you hear much yesterday at all? And anything about Chrome OS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So in the developer keynote, they did talk about developing Android apps.  And I wrote up a story afterwards because I installed the new Android Studio on my Pixel Slate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's pretty cool that you can run Android Studio on a Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I have been doing that.  You have Linux.  Yeah. As soon as Christina came out and they said all new Chromebooks coming out this year will have Linux out of the box.  And so because that's a big feature right now.  So I've been running lots of different coding development environments on Christina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is this new way that they're talking about different from what you've been doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They created a like a one click install for it, which is just fine.  You know, I mean, I've got a screenshot of it. It's just it downloads a Debian package, which using the files app in Chrome OS, you can just say install with Linux.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's OK. You don't have to have Linux set up already. You don't have to.  Christina set up already or do you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It has to be enabled. It does have to be enabled or that's not going to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the difference is that you don't have to go into these days. You don't go into developer mode to do that.  You don't have to downgrade your security or any of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they're really I mean, they made it slightly easier.  And quite honestly, if you're developing Android apps, they certainly wasn't hard.  You should know how to do it. Yeah, you should know how to do that and a little more.  But here's what kind of irks me.  In fact, I'm going to share something a little personal here because this afternoon I was quite upset and thinking about selling my Pixel slate.  Because with this new Android Studio preview specifically for Chrome OS, they list recommended Chromebooks and the Pixelbook and the Pixel slate are not on there.  And that's because of the CPUs inside.  It's a Y series CPU.  They're the Y series CPUs.  And that's that's really disheartening for me, even though I'm not an Android developer.  I'm thinking ahead here.  I'm taking, you know, programming classes and I assume I'm going to move on to Android development at some point.  So I'm a little distraught about this.  A couple Chrome boxes are recommended and two Chromebooks right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does the older Pixelbook like the one Jeff's staring at, does that support it?  Is that a U processor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a Y series as well.  That's a seventh gen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So your thousand dollar plus Pixelbook cannot be used.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not that it can't be used.  It's not recommended.  Oh, OK.  So is it too slow?  I got it.  That's the thing so far.  And I don't know if it's just because it's a preview version of Android Studio or it's because I'm using a Y series processor in my Chromebook.  But it was pretty laggy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the minimum they require, eight gigs of RAM, four gigs of space on the disk, 1280 by 800 screen resolution.  The real key here is the i5 U series or higher.  And right now there's only five Chromebooks they recommend.  The Yoga 630, the Acer Spin 13, the HP X30 and G2 and the Acer Chromebox CX-I3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So those are two boxes, not even Chromebooks.  So well, it is a development environment, honestly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, how many people are doing it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think I think why why I'm slightly upset was when they said back in November that Android Studio would be officially supported on Chromebooks.  You know, of course, they were showing it on the Pixelbook.  So I think many people took away like, yeah, it's the flagship device.  It's going to support this.  Lots of Android Google people have these Pixelbooks, but it's not on there for an understandable reason.  But, um, yeah, I'm thinking if you sell it, what would you get?  Not what I paid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no.  I mean, what would you buy in its place?  I understand.  I don't care, Kevin.  It's not what I paid for it.  That's for sure.  Well, that's true.  I know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I looked at some of the recommended ones and I'm well aware of those devices.  You know, I write about them and all and, you know, they're going to cost me.  It's going to cost me anywhere from six to eight hundred, maybe nine hundred to replace this.  And that's that's fine.  It's not like.  Would you get the spin?  The spin is one.  It still makes one, but they only have an I3.  Lenovo is a little too big for my.  That's pretty high specs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Eight gigs of RAM and an I5U processor.  They should have at least.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's surprising how many don't go above four gigs.  Yeah.  And eight gigs is nice to have.  Even eight gigs can get a sluggish of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  You can you can spec up quite a few of them at eight gigs.  But I mean, you know, it's not going to be it's not going to it's going to have a cellar on in it, you know, or a Pentium.  Those are capped out, you know, tapped out at four.  The M3s occasionally come with with eight gig, but mostly it's a core I5 core I3 core I7.  Those are the eight gig or more capable.  Yeah, I don't I don't know.  I think it's just speeders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is there an issue with maybe emulation or hypervisor kind of I mean, what are they?  Are they still doing just a charute with with crustini?  So it's it's running on the it's running bare to the metal, right?  It's not an emulator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, it's it's actually a VM and a container inside a VM.  And for that reason, this is another downer for real Android developers.  I am not one, of course.  There's no Android virtual devices, no device emulation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's a that is a lot of drive back because you'd like to be able to try it in an emulator before you.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, you can certainly connect your Android device USB to the Chromebook and push your app or run your app on that phone or device.  But unless you've got every device, you know, that's out there, you certainly want a virtual emulated device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this is why I love Geeks so much.  Kevin said, I think I'm going to get personal here.  I think, oh, you know, his dog has the flu.  Norm has the flu.  No, no, it's not.  It's I've got a Y processor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, man, you got a Y processor.  I'm so sorry.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Condolences, man.  Are there are there are there Hallmark cards for that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, but you know what?  That might be a good startup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I'm going to guess it has something to do with a virtual machine and support for the virtual machine, the Y processor, the U processors missing in the Y.  But I don't know. But I wonder, might it might be something that I don't think so.  Do you think it's just speed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's just power, essentially, because, you know, those those Y processors can handle up to about five to seven and a half watts of heat.  And then the other ones are 15.  So they can run longer under load.  And when you're developing, you need horsepower.  So I get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Just go get a computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have a review of the spin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, now get a Chromebooks computer computer and put Linux on it.  Don't you know, I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's a computer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I see this all the time, especially with iPad users where they're just struggling and Chromebook users.  Hey, hey.  Where they're just struggling.  And I just get a get a freaking computer.  Leo's using his PDP8.  I have an 11 in the studio.  Excuse me, please.  And put Linux on it and and all will be well.  And it probably won't cost you as much and you'll get more horsepower and all of that stuff.  I mean, I think you could be a little dogmatic in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And if you're a developer, you probably have to have a Chromebook because you want to see if your Android app will run well on a Chromebook.  It'll look good on that screen and all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wish more companies would test against Chrome OS.  Yeah, it's obvious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you actually you don't need a Chromebook if you're one of those developers because there is a Chrome OS emulator in Android Studio.  See.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So yeah.  And that'll run on Linux and Windows and Mac OS.  Right.  Correct.  So as I still want you to get a computer.  They did rebrand all of the Google Home stuff.  It's all now Nest under Rick Osterloh.  Right.  Did you ask Rick about that?  Is that a little bit for him?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  No, he's happy with it.  They're not going to they're not going to throw out boxes that are out there.  Now it's going to be a gradual rebrand.  But as as they do do things, they'll go to Nest.  I think it's this whole notion of helpful.  Google is your helpful assistant now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's your helpful assistant and the helpful little plastic pal who's there to see you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's yours.  You know, if you go back, how many years ago did we all talk about how you're all going to have your own agents?  Yeah.  Now you do.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have these things that no, I have to say, you know, we have I have a ring video doorbell.  I have outdoor camps from Nest.  I have a variety of devices in the house.  And I'm now in it.  Maybe it's psychological because the Nest brand or because they all work together.  But I'm thinking of replacing it with the Nest doorbell.  Oh, right.  Because I know I want to get the the home.  What do they call Nest Hub Pax?  Max Hub.  Max Hub.  Next Maxi Hub.  Whatever they call it.  Because that sounds great.  And by the way, this is sneaky as heck because remember the original Google Home Hub didn't have a camera.  Right.  This one has a camera.  So they said right at the beginning, for your living room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I was standing next to Rick when he was talking about this.  And so he said, no, this is probably for the kitchen or maybe the living room.  And I said, yeah, not the bedroom for this one.  He said, well, he said, I would.  But that's me.  Yeah, I'm eager for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What it does, though, is it gives you all the benefits of the Nest in cameras, which is it can it'll notify you if it doesn't recognize people.  So in effect, you're getting a Nest Cam Plus, Zach Green, plus a good speaker.  I think it looks for $299 like a very nice $250.  I think, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the two biggest, I think, hands at the Keto yesterday, when I was in the audience,  were being able to stop the music with your hand.  That, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you have to talk to the hand.  Now, it was a little unclear in the keynote.  Do you have to train it to do that?  No, no, no, no.  I did it.  I did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it has to recognize you're looking at it because it doesn't want to just take any old hand and suddenly stop.  So it recognizes that someone does it to be you.  Someone is looking at it and does that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The other advantage with the cameras, you can have duo integration.  So now you can make it like a Facebook portal.  So it's like a Facebook portal.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the other ooo from the audience was alarm going off, stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was, everybody loved that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That works now, which is wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It does.  Oh.  You tried it this morning.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is funny how, of all the things I announced, that probably was the number one most tweeted and common.  Yeah, everybody loved that.  So when your alarm is going off, instead of having to say, hey, Google, cancel or stop, you can just stop.  I'm waiting for the stories that will come out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Having to say, hey, Google, made you wake up enough you'd actually get up.  Now you can just stop and fall back asleep and you'll blame Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or worse, wave your hand.  So this video messages, they touched on that.  Is that a feature in Duo?  I don't remember the video.  Can you leave a video message in Duo?  I think so.  You can't.  You can.  So I think much more useful though to have this on the living room screen where you come in and you see there's messages for you.  And you could by voice command say play them back and it's on a screen.  It's right there.  You'd have to pull out your phone.  I think that's kind of interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know why this feels like a little bit of a leap, but it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It doesn't seem like something new.  Video message from Arthur.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We have the smaller version of this.  You have the Lenovo or the?  Well, no, no, no.  I have two of the what they used to call the Google Home Hub, the seven inch, which is now the next.  I love mine, but it doesn't have a camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Correct.  Which is why we have one in the bedroom and we have one right here.  It's my alarm clock.  It's right next to my bed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's great.  It gets dark when you turn out the lights.  I love the slideshow because it's all my Google Photos.  So it's stuff I, oh, I forgot.  I haven't seen that in years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's the right size for a night table.  Just the right size.  The bigger one is kind of ridiculous.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The bigger one we have, which is a Lenovo 10 inch smart display.  That is in our kitchen right on the kitchen island.  So every morning we have coffee, my wife and I together and watch the local news on YouTube TV right on the display.  On your Lenovo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  That's been there since day one.  And that's big enough for you to watch TV with that.  Did you also have a TV set, as we used to call them, in your kitchen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  TV set.  No, no, no.  I'm the former TV guy critic.  This is how we talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Former TV set critic.  Does it have a, does it come with little rabbit ears?  Is that part of the set?  And matching hairbrush?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but what they added, which I love, well I haven't seen it live yet, is a YouTube TV guide on this.  So it actually really is more like a little TV set now.  Oh.  We just say, hey, I won't say the G word, but watch and be...  We call them Guiermo here.  Guiermo.  Yeah.  We just tell it to watch NBC in the morning and watch our local news, and it just fires up YouTube TV to the right channel.  But if you don't know what's on, you don't know what channel to tune to, so in the middle of the day it's like, what do I watch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I presume your agent's going to recommend things, the assistant's going to recommend things to you as well based on your...  It already does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And YouTube TV has recommendations based on that.  I don't know about the assistant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's more terrorist video for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're not radicalized enough.  Perhaps you'd like to watch more.  One of the things that happens at these keynotes, this reality distortion field, is Google shows a lot of stuff that isn't yet a product.  And I don't think they did a very good job yesterday of distinguishing...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Last year was worse, I think.  Yeah.  I don't think they've showed that many new things yesterday in a way.  Okay.  What was not real?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you feel like everything there was something you'll be able to do...  I mean, obviously you can't get the Nest Home Max until summer.  That's hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's easy.  That's hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, was there...  Here's the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What I don't know is the 100 gig to half a gig ML...  Is that real?  Is that real now?  No.  Is that multitasking ability...  What did they show you?  They showed you could multitask, do complex tasks, and...  Oh, that thing, the contextual...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The contextual.  They've been slowly building up towards that with assistant all along.  Right.  How real is that?  That's not on your phone yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think that is yet, but I'm just checking their blog post because they talk about shrinking  the model down.  It's coming...  This is all part of the next generation assistant.  That's this fall in the new phones, basically.  In the new Pixel phones this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So roughly October, this will presumably be a live product for Pixel phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They've said that before and not delivered, I want to point out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  Correct.  Okay.  So, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and then what was it, two years ago we got Aloe.  Right, and we got those things that they did deliver and nobody gave a crap about them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He started off, it's funny, with what looked like inbox because he started talking about  Smart Replies.  And I thought, too soon, Sendai, too soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I've...  Yeah, exactly.  I've recognized myself with Smart Replies.  I guess I'm too much of an editor.  Would it suggest something to me?  I'll be like, damn, I'm not using that.  I'm going to pick up something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You blew pencil?  Well, okay, put this here.  And that would be a nice feature, by the way, if you could blue pencil your Smart Replies.  Yeah, there is on the Keyword Blog, Aparna Chenapurgada, who gave the speech on this,  about search in the demo, has a long piece that basically is your entire talk.  So that's nice that they did that so you can read all of these features.  Here's the menu translation.  So that's going to be this fall?  I think so.  The new lens?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's really sweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, so many years ago, when I wrote What Would Google Do?, which led me to being here.  You called it.  I argued that there was going to be a smart menu that was going to use the data of the  restaurant to tell you what the most popular dishes were and what people had with what  and so on and so forth.  And finally, it's real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Google-y menu is here.  They missed a bet, though.  It would be nice to have an augmented reality version of the meal.  They said it would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They will?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, no, they're going to pop up pictures, but I want to see it on the table.  On the table.  Yeah.  There is, I think it's on a cruise ship.  There's a restaurant that projects the meal on your table.  Oh, Jesus.  And then the waiters come and put it there.  Yeah, I think it's on a Royal Caribbean cruise ship.  No, Leo, no.  No, it's a bad idea.  I like the translate.  I thought what they showed.  But we've seen this.  This is not new, the ability to translate.  No, I've used it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It gets better and better and better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So even though they announced some new features in Lens, if it's coming in the next generation  phone, that's fine.  Maybe it does require the new hardware in the Pixel 4 or whatever they call it to do  exactly what you were talking about, but those smaller models and all of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The thing that I think was most BS yesterday, because I've lived through this, is the AR  magazine page.  Just point your phone at this magazine page and the magazine page will come alive.  Come alive.  You'll be happy you have magazines again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the QCAT all over again.  All you need is a special piece of hardware.  You can scan the magazine QR code and a giant tiger will appear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I actually mentioned in the magazine and AR with Lens in the blog post, if you see a dish  you'd like to cook in an upcoming issue of Bon Appetit, you'll be able to point your  camera at a recipe and have the page come to life and show you exactly how to make it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not AR though.  They just have a video basically of the preparation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well no, it's not.  It's not pointing at the table.  I think you were pointing at the print.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not that it matters.  I mean we're talking gimmicks here.  The thing I think is interesting is when they showed the shark and having the shark on the  stage and walking around, it made me think of this is what they wanted to do with glass.  This is what a heads up display eventually would be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And give credit to Zuckerberg, he promoted the notion of the value of your camera on  your phone for AR long before Google did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we have the hardware.  I mean Apple is doing this, Google is doing this.  You can have Iron Man or what's his name, Danny Glover Jr.  Childish Gambu, you know now in the room with you, or a shark.  So it does exist.  I was hoping for some VC jokes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a VC on the stage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look at those teeth.  It reminds me of our investors.  All right, let's take a little break.  Kevin Toefel is here from aboutchromebooks.com and Stacy's IOT podcast.  Well, it's his and Stacy's.  Always a pleasure to have you.  Norm doesn't, I just want to be clear, does not have the flu.  No.  You have a Y processor, but Norm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was trying to think of something that wouldn't happen.  Dogs don't get the flu.  So I couldn't, I didn't want to have the animal running away or something.  So I actually spent four minutes thinking of what undoable catastrophe could befall him.  Norm having a flu.  It would be equal to a normal person to having a Y processor.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Norm has a U processor.  I have a Y processor.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Norm is running on full.  And also, of course, from the, I like it, the New Art School of Journalism.  I'm going to call it that from now on.  I know I am.  From the Newmark Graduate School of Journalism.  It is Mr. Jeff Jarvis in studio, which we really are thrilled to have you here.  Thank you for making the trip up.  Show today brought to you by Casper.  If you want to take a little nap on our Casper after the show, be my guest.  We've got a, we've got the, I can't, I'm not supposed to talk about it yet,  but I knew Casper in the box ready to open.  For years, we've had the original Casper mattress, not many, many years,  couple of years now, and we love it.  It's a, combines multiple supportive memory foams for a sleep surface that gives you  something kind of almost paradoxical, just the right sink and just the right bounce.  It's both firm and soft.  So your hips don't, you know, dig into a firm mattress, but your back is fully  supported and it's breathable.  So you never get hot.  You regulate your temperature throughout the night.  And we know that that helps sleep.  Casper is an online retailer of premium mattresses and the brilliant insight that  the guys at Casper came up with when they founded the company was there is a huge  markup when you buy a mattress in a mattress store, as much as double the price  of that, the actual price of that mattress.  Sometimes even more.  They said, well, what if we eliminated the mattress store?  We sent it directly to the customer, cutting the costs of showrooms, resellers,  and pass that savings onto you.  Brilliant.  Right?  There was one problem.  People said, well, I want to lie on it before I buy it.  Well, as you probably know, I know this because I've bought mattresses  that just did not work out.  I lay them on, I lay on them in the, in the mattress showroom, but 10 minutes  in bright light during the day with a salesperson looking at you.  That's no good.  That's no, you can't even spoon with your wife.  You can't do anything.  You can't really test it.  So Casper gives you the chance to test it, but in your house for a hundred nights,  do whatever you want on it and free shipping.  But also if you don't like it, free returns and a 10 year limited warranty.  These mattresses last a long time.  And if for any reason in those first hundred nights, you say, that's not the  right masters for me, they'll come, they'll take it, give you every penny back.  So it's easy to buy online and it's completely risk-free.  And frankly, it's a better way to try a mattress.  Let's get it, get it in its environment.  And they come in a really compact box.  It's, it's actually kind of fun when you open it up.  It includes everything you need to open up the box.  It goes, it expands smells great from day one.  I've had mattresses that you've had to air out for days before you can sleep on them.  Casper's awesome.  Get a Casper mattress today.  And we have a special deal.  I want to emphasize this.  This is new.  Was $50 is now a hundred dollars off towards select mattresses at casper.com slash twig.  But that is a limited time offer.  They told me you can't keep talking about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Buying a mattress used to be the next worst thing from buying a car.  These five mattresses were exactly the same, but there were always different brands and different names on them.  So you can never compare them.  You wanted a coating on that mattress? What about RustGuard?  You can't comparison shop mattresses.  Now you can know what you're getting.  That's really a good thing.  The internet does good things.  See what it makes possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How did I get to this story?  I have no idea.  How we search for Bow-Wows and Meowfs.  How did you get here?  It's...  Are we on the James Bond or what?  What is...  This is a Google blog.  Why do cats like boxes?  Why do dogs lick, eat grass?  Howl.  Global pet preferences worldwide.  Google...  Any information at all?  Google wants to know.  I don't know how I got here.  What did you get to this?  We'll go use your back button.  I typed keyword blog and that's what I found.  Oh.  Let's go back.  Is there anything else from I.O.?  Now, I.O.'s not over.  Okay.  They've updated Android Auto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kevin, you want to talk about that?  Which was that, Jeff?  Android Auto changes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ah.  So Android Auto, in fact,  this is something that's coming by the end of this month.  The new...  I think it's called Drive Mode for Android.  If you're using your phone  in your car and you're connected to...  Well, actually, if you're using your phone in your car,  this is not specific to Android Auto.  It's the...  It's the Auto app on Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah.  Right.  So what they're doing...  Which they very confusingly call Android Auto.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  So what they're doing is when you're using navigation  and you get maybe a phone call that comes in  or a song changes from one song to the next.  And let's say you want to see the title.  That information is just down below at the bottom.  It does not supersede the navigation maps  that you can see all the time,  which is wonderful, because I like to see the maps.  I don't want to switch between apps  and not see the app or the map for a little while  while I'm driving, even though the directions still work.  I like to see the map for some reason.  I'm just weird.  So there's that aspect, and that's coming by the end of this month.  And then Android Automotive,  which is what they're basically building into some cars, I think.  And I could be wrong.  The Polestar, what is that?  Yeah, Polestar is a perfect example.  And then there are other vehicle manufacturers  that either are using it or plan to use it.  That's kind of like the whole infotainment system.  Everything just runs on Android Automotive.  Now, I did hear and I was curious about this.  Does that preclude you from using, say, CarPlay?  If you're an iOS user, maybe you got iOS and Android in the car.  And apparently it does not.  I'm not sure how that's going to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Almost everybody gets both, right?  There's very few cars that just.  Yeah, but I don't know with Volvo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  With Volvo, now that in the Polestar from Volvo,  Android is the OS of all of the UI in the car.  That's a different matter.  That's not Android Auto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the OS for the car.  That's how you get your entertainment.  Automotive. OK. Right.  So now we have Android Auto for your phone, Android Auto for your car,  Android Automotive for your car.  If that weren't confusing enough. OK.  There is a new UI for the Android Auto on the screen in your car.  Right. Which is nicer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Kevin made the point that you use this.  I'm going to tell you a story in a second. OK.  But the other point is that if you do go to a full app,  then the directions come at the bottom of the screen.  So you never you're always multitasking.  Oh, that's nice. On your phone.  They redid the the UI is very pretty, except that.  Have I mentioned this before?  I hate night mode.  I hate it. I just don't like it.  And they're making it basically the default now on Q on next Android Auto,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  not just Android Auto, but it's going to also be a feature in Q.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, feature OK, because if I can turn it off, I hate it as default.  So here's the thing.  So because because I live la vida.  Why do you hate the dark mode?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. It really is. You're so white.  Seriously, everybody in the world wants dark mode.  I don't. He's getting pink.  You're dressed in dark.  Yeah, it just wardrobe is dark mode.  You are dark mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like contrast. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I actually it's funny because everybody was all excited about dark mode  on Mac OS with Mojave.  Everybody I turn it on and I don't like it either.  I turned it off. I went back.  I don't feel like it on the car.  It's better as they pointed out yesterday.  It's better on an OLED screen to be in dark mode.  You use less battery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fine, fine. But it's in the car. It's plugged in.  Yeah, yeah, you don't care about the shrieking.  So so here's the thing, because I am on this show,  because I thus live la vida Google.  Yes, I do everything Google is that I can do. Yes.  So I bought my Mazda CX-5.  Yes, did not come with Android Auto.  Then the retrofit was possible. Oh, good.  Not it was the the Mazda retrofit.  Right. So they put it in there.  Six hundred bucks later. Yeah. I'm pissed.  Why? It doesn't work well.  It crashes all the time.  It'll reboot.  It'll it'll just go off four times in a drive.  And then the weird thing is the UI is specific to your Mazda.  Maybe this one. I don't know what it is.  I'm going to go back in, but it's going to it's going to just irritates me.  But then the other weird thing is the UI is not well-thought through at all.  So I'm listening to Sirius. Yeah.  And then I plug in the phone.  And and so then it goes to audible.  Yeah. So I was playing my book.  No, I don't want audible now.  But I before it doesn't, I have to go to the map  to to to ways, turn that on.  Then I go back to Sirius.  Then it will go back to the audio book.  But now this time, when I do it a second time,  I can get Sirius and Waze. It's a work in progress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it? And I don't know if that's Mazda specific.  I think that is a little bit is it?  Auto. Yeah. The crash.  I don't have a lot of it.  Yeah, I don't have a lot of experience with Android Auto.  We had it when we were in Hawaii on vacation.  And I did find it a little annoying.  I thought CarPlay actually was easier.  But Kevin, you said you like Android Auto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do. I use both Android Auto and CarPlay.  I don't really have too many problems with it.  But then again, you know, we're all doing different tasks.  So I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kevin is basically always listening to the Beatles.  So it's pretty obvious that when you get the car, just keep playing the Beatles.  There's not a lot of channel 18 on Sirius XM.  Pop up Channel 18 and you're done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that movie about the only guy on Earth?  Yesterday. Did you see it yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, today I did not.  I was exhausted from yesterday with I.O.  So I did not see it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Danny Boyle's new movie.  I can't wait.  A universe in which the actually it's not till June.  So the universe in which the Beatles never existed,  except some guy for some reason remembers them.  And since he's the only one that does, suddenly he is,  they think, creating the Beatles songs in real time.  And brilliant. Brilliant.  It's a great idea for a movie.  It's fun. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kevin, that's Kevin's dream is to be that guy, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know all the Beatles over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you know all the songs, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I don't. I would say I I'm pretty familiar with those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So start reciting Eleanor Rigby.  Oh, that's easy.  No, that's easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are obscure Beatles songs, though.  Oh, yes. Yeah.  Yeah. Eleanor Rigby's not one of them.  The most obscure Beatles song.  Well, so obscure, I don't remember it.  OK.  What would you say, Kevin?  I have a friend who's like you, a Beatle maniac.  He's actually he calls himself a Beatleologist.  He's even written a book about the Beatles.  Wow. He has a Beatle collection of like lunch boxes and paper,  bow ties and hats and all sorts of stuff they sold over the years.  But he when challenged, well, he says, well, I bet you don't know everybody.  And he somehow comes up with a song I never heard of.  So there are a few.  Anyway, yeah, there's a few. There's a few.  Google Assistant was much faster on stage.  Do you think that's an example of something that maybe  won't be as fast in real life?  They say it's going to be 10 times faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But this is the point of having the model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's that's the model on the phone.  This is the model on the phone. So we'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the processes are only going to get faster and faster.  So it started by showing me what it could be like.  I mean, I don't I don't talk a lot to things devices yet.  I think you both do more.  Yeah, but it's funny because both Microsoft and Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  will show these contextual conversations that go on and on.  We'll move him to Friday.  Now, what do I have on Thursday?  And I don't ever want to operate in a world like that.  That is not how I work.  Maybe maybe we're just not busy executives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I use I use voice for interaction with my devices.  I mean, it's even built in the assistance built into Chromebooks.  You can have it always listening on your Chromebook.  In fact, I use it every day, multiple times a day, but not.  You know, that that that that that where I'm doing six different things,  you know, I do it for one thing and I go.  That was a little manic, to be honest.  Yeah, it was it was to prove a point and show an example.  When you get rid of the latency of a right of a, you know, a connection  and then the cloud and all the other things that has to do off device.  I'm not surprised it's 10x faster.  I mean, if it's all happening there and I and speaking to Jeff's point  about hardware getting faster, you know, Google already has custom chips  in these things for, you know, for the photography for security with the Titan.  And it would not surprise me if they come up with a TensorFlow light chip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was wondering if you had TensorFlow in the phone would be funny.  I would be interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because we said this yesterday, you can already install TensorFlow on a Raspberry Pi.  It's not like you need a hunger power hungry chip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and there are almost all the modern phones,  including Apple's come with dedicated processing for machine learning.  So I think that we are actually already starting to enter that era.  But boy, there is nobody.  Google seems to have an insurmountable lead in this, having done this for so long.  They say Google Assistant is now on one billion devices, by the way,  Android and two and a half billion active devices.  That's double what Apple touted a couple of weeks ago.  And what was it? Android Auto is on one hundred billion. Yeah.  But having assistant on a billion devices means you're collecting data.  And it's only in devices all the time.  It's OK. No, no, it's good.  It's good. That's how the models get better, faster.  Yeah. And I do think Google does a lot to anonymize that data.  Not recording just as they're really taking a page from Apple's playbook.  Apple doesn't record the beginning and ends of trips,  just middle parts that are less identifiable.  Things like that to anonymize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we what I call on Twitter, we now have the Google Maps Ashley Madison feature,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  which is incognito and maps only you thought of that right away, didn't you?  OK.  An interesting use of incognito and maps.  You're right. Why else would you want to hide where you're going?  Because I'm this is the one they always give, which is such BS.  I'm going to buy a gift for my wife and I don't want her to know  that I'm headed to Tiffin. Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, you're going to find you're going to hear very soon.  The CIA, if you if you turn on incognito on the maps, that's when they want you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that we are.  People always said that if you use PGP to encrypt your email, that's a sign.  You're guaranteed to be in the in the PRISM database.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When the Guardian went through the whole Snowden story, they thought, OK,  we're going to get burner phones.  They said, no, if you're using burner phones, that's a giveaway.  Dead giveaway. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's not like they can't spy on you with a burner phone. Right.  All right. So what else should we said?  I just want to make sure that we don't miss any any big things.  Did they talk you?  Android Q. Yeah, we should talk about Android Q.  Oh, yeah. Oh, that dark mode.  Finally here.  Jeff Jarvis has been begging for this.  I did you I haven't yet put Q on my Pixel three.  It was I mean, I have the beta, but I just haven't downloaded it yet.  Has anybody tried it? Played with it.  Beta three is I do have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it was actually after I saw that video that you had on the screen  a second ago from from the Verge.  Maybe it was it was that the review or was that the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it's their their first look. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Once I saw that, I got the Q3 beta going.  It took a little while to download.  I'm sure a lot of people were hitting the servers last night.  You know, so far, I yeah, I like it.  It's actually very iOS like.  And I actually am a iOS iPhone user primarily, to be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's because the gestures, the swiping and all of that.  Exactly. Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I'm a dark mode, all the things kind of person myself,  unlike Jeff, and I turn that on and it doesn't work for every single app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's that's where I really and I agree with Jeff on that.  When an app is not in dark mode, it blinds you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But but there is a and I saw this on nine to five Google today.  You can go into the developer options of your phone, which I have enabled,  and you can force dark mode even on apps that don't use it.  And now I have total dark mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nice. I do like dark mode in the settings panel.  I think that that just matches your mood these days.  Yeah, it does. Doesn't the Internet.  We're in a dark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The other thing that back to your your phantom where point before  last year, they announced this this year, they announced it again.  And they still don't have it, which is the Google Maps walking.  Follow the era. They showed it, didn't they?  Showed it again. They said, you know, they said you could use it at I.O.  Did you know? No, I see.  That's what I thought. And it was no.  All they did at I.O. was a simple A.R.  You had to go and you had to scan a map show the show you.  That's where the snacks are.  Oh, right. They didn't walk you around and walk you around.  And I'm dying for that because I feel like I look like an absolute idiot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you live in Manhattan, so that means you walk a lot.  So walking directions are important for you.  You got to do that.  But well, a lot of us don't live in areas where you're going to walk to anything.  And so that's less important.  I know when I'm visiting a city, I love walking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's just drives you nuts because you're trying to get oriented.  And I'll go a block out of the way. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, absolutely. I do that every time in New York.  I go downtown instead of uptown.  And then finally I realize, oh, I'm walking the wrong way.  I have to turn around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course, I was going to try it out yesterday on my O.G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pixel and it works. It works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's in maps now. Oh, it is now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, in maps now. Really?  Yeah. I walked.  I walked to Burger King with a little little thing.  Did you have to admit that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not a very far walk.  Yeah, so it is now on Pixel smartphones.  They say it's launched launched yesterday  on Google Pixel smartphones.  We try this. So how do you get into it?  Is there an obvious button that you press?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just just do walking directions. OK.  So I was going to Burger King or Elroy's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Elroy's is better.  It's a longer walk. That's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So directions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're going to lose Jeff for about two hours now.  While he walks to the burrito truck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Start AR. Oh, I missed it. I missed it. Oh, shoot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there is a button that says start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it even shows you.  Yeah, don't sue us when you walk into a sewer.  Yeah, OK. Be safe.  Leo, so I can show it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Put it over here.  Allow, allow.  This is good.  So in order to get to Elroy's right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, first, you have to scan the buildings across from you.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, Jesus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It doesn't work.  It's got to orient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll go outside for a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's got to orient.  That's so weird.  Well, go ahead. Go outside.  Jeff will be right back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the weird thing is it has to orient on on a building.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's interesting.  Well, that's what you're trying to do, right?  When you're trying to figure out, do I go uptown or downtown?  Do I turn left or right?  So the problem is you don't have any information about what those buildings  are are supposed to be or which is left and which is right.  So now is does it recognize your insides?  Kevin, no. Yeah, you know, it's like looking for buildings.  Yeah. So Jeff has gone out to the front of the studio  and he's going to scan the buildings.  I wonder how helpful that's going to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I think it's I think it's helpful, but I don't know that a phone is  the best thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, this is this is what you get when you've been doing Street View  for 10 years and you have the front of every building in America.  It's kind of remarkable, really, that they can do this.  Did it work?  Did you scan the buildings?  So it's done. It does.  It worked.  It now knows that I should go out the door and turn right.  It's pointing the direction I should go.  Look at that. That's pretty cool.  Very nice.  So it goes into map mode when I'm not pointed at the real world.  And then if I tip it up and point at the real world, it goes into augmented  reality world.  So turn left at the teachers, it looks like.  Yeah, there they are.  Oh, that's really neat.  That is neat. Yay.  OK. Thank you, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Carsten, good work. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of course, Carsten.  Thank God he loves his whoppers.  That's all I can say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The title of his autobiography will be from Harvard to Burger King.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just want them to have that that impossible whopper.  Oh, yeah. Do they have it yet?  They don't have it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you been asking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I checked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Doesn't Carl's Junior have it already?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's like the John Hine of Twitter.  John Hine did Jump the Shark.  He's on the Howard Stern show now producer there, and he wrote a junk food book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. There's the you know, that's a guaranteed bestseller.  Honestly, Elroy's is 10 times better than Taco Bell.  And I love it that our local taco truck parks across the street  from Taco Bell in Petaluma, hoping that people go.  I could go to Taco Bell or I could go to Elroy's.  Oh, there's one more from yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One more thing is I think they've kind of said this before, but bringing  two factor to your phone as the device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought that was great.  Your phone is actually the the unlock device.  I'm not sure how that's different from the approved deny thing that we have now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to hit one button.  And I'm not exactly sure either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's just a little easier.  You don't have to tap the screen to approve it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, nice.  Proximity like trying to push to factor as much as they can.  You know, the email server that we advertise, the Helm email server,  does authentication through Bluetooth, le proximity.  So somebody you can't create a password for an account  unless you have the Helm application on your phone  and you are within Bluetooth le proximity of the Helm server,  which I think is a brilliant way to authenticate,  because if you're not standing next to the server, you can't authenticate.  I think that's really smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, we earlier said that the home hub Maxi, whatever, was $249.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  $229. Yeah, it's actually a pretty good price.  It is.  They did mention folding phones, which we couldn't take.  Kevin and I couldn't help but  chortle a little  since the only folding phones we know about are kind of well,  at least the galaxy is not doing so well.  I think is the title. Yeah.  Orked. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think we've done I.O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We did I.O.  There were a couple of things, though, I was going to I was wondering  if Google would talk about, and now I've they've slipped my slipped my mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A.D.A. was one I was hoping for, but with the three gaming conference next month,  I can see why they haven't talked about one word about stadia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wasn't that interesting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They had they had a demonstration hub in the press room.  So you could play it. You play with it. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How about progressive web apps and probably have a track on that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was. Yeah.  They mentioned it a couple of times in the demos about how they bring up the PWA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, I went to some.  I'm excited by that because it means it's a kind of a cross platform development.  It'll be very good for Chromebooks as well as mobile devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there was a protest plane over.  Did you see it? Yeah.  And its message made no sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not unusual. Let's see.  Here's a picture of the banner.  Google control is not privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Privacy. Save local news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What? What?  Google control is not privacy.  Save local news makes no sense.  I don't know what privacy has to do with local news at all. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's some unemployed journalists with a flying license.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there's an article about in TechCrunch, but they nobody seems to figure  out wouldn't be so hard to figure out who it is and why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's just assumed they timed it well, just assumed our began. Really?  There was a plane. Huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a head scratcher, folks.  It's definitely not going to galvanize local action.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the other thing about this.  So this year they decided that this was going to be the carless  I.O. So you had to like literally drive to San Jose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, they didn't want you to do it.  And there's plenty of parking outside Shoreline.  It's designed for concerts of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I will confess, when I got this press pass,  we were allowed to park.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I did as as as it should be, because the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They use the parking lots there for the sandboxes and demos and things like.  Oh, so they did use them. Oh, interesting.  Well, when when I was last there, they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no, but they have plenty of parking before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We should also mention Project Mainline.  This was a quick mention, but this is the idea that you can update older  Android devices, not by pushing it through the manufacturer or the carrier,  but actually making it part of Google Play.  This has been an ongoing project of Google with with treble  to make Android devices more secure.  The problem, of course, in the past has been you counted on the manufacturers  and the carriers to push that stuff.  Now you could just push it down to the Google Store and people will,  in many cases, get that update.  That's really a big deal.  And it looked like they were getting more and more system components into.  Much better for security. Mainline. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, we haven't talked about Android being.  Forked and bifurcated and at a long time, that used to be a big thing on the show  that because I think this is part of the problem is you couldn't get security  updates and not because you had an old version of Android.  Does this kind of solve that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there's still forks, there's still Amazons, for instance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I don't mean the force. It was wrong word.  But I just mean that the fact that some phones don't get updated

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  with the latest version. Well, that's the theory here is Google  realized they've lost because Android is open source, they've lost control  of the vast majority of Android phones because the developers,  the manufacturers, the carriers had no tie to Google and Google  couldn't force them to accept an update.  And there's reason for it because it costs them money.  That cost them bandwidth, not Google, but the but the carriers bandwidth  to push those out.  The phone manufacturers themselves have to vet these updates to make sure  they don't break any customizations that manufacturers make.  Google said that they did get a lot of  contributions from device manufacturers.  They said partners contributed, quote, many changes and collaborated  with us to ensure they ran well on their devices.  So there is still that issue of, you know, whatever Google patch,  Google's going to push out over the Play Store, better not break the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I saw it was pretty cool.  I went to one of the developer sessions where, of course, I have no idea  what's going on. But  simple one line to say that you could force  with a change, force an update on the app.  But then there's a step back, which is you can offer the option of an update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is this for the end user or the this for the end user?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And use. Yeah. So it's very, very slick. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was impressive. I actually watched that one as well.  And it was it was a one liner to just make a call to if there's a newer version  of this app, you know, just put a note at the bottom  and tell the user, you know, hope the user says update  or you can make it very nonobtrusive.  So you had some controls as a developer to make it,  you know, a better user experience, but still get the update to the user  before they have to go to the Play Store.  In fact, they don't have to go to the Play Store at all for this. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They also as part of this.  So this is treble.  Mainline is a new feature that is empowered by treble.  And there is a new file format.  Some of these will be APKs, the traditional Android package format.  But there is also going to be APEX, Apex Android Pony Express files.  And the reason is sometimes these operating system patches  have to be performed before a reboot.  You can't just do it as if it's an app updating.  So Apex will actually load earlier in the booting process.  So Android updates can be installed on a reboot.  And that's also a fairly critical change.  It does, however, according to Venture,  be introduced security risks,  which is why Google is building in new failsafe mechanisms  and enhanced test processes to make sure those updates are safe.  We've seen man in the middle attacks through updates now many times,  I suspect, but at least most recently, two times one with C cleaner,  where the update of C cleaner was modified by a bad guy.  And so people who downloaded their update and it also happened.  Was it Asus?  Was Asus, sir, was Asus, wasn't it?  So the the Asus update files had been corrupted.  They were still signed by Asus.  They were still downloaded by the official Asus updater.  But it was an effectively supply chain attack.  And so that's something you really have to start paying attention to,  because if you could make a malicious Apex file  that gets stuck in the stream somehow, you could be updating these phones  in exactly the wrong direction.  You could be introducing problems.  So Google's very good, though, about security.  So there are a lot of questions, VentureBeat says.  How often will these modules be updated?  What about devices that can't get Google Play updates?  For instance, if you have a Chinese Android device,  it doesn't get Google Play updates. What happens there?  It does require Android to queue from the start.  So if you've upgraded the phone to queue, in other words,  all of our existing Android pie phones won't support this,  which means it also leaves out the vast majority of  unupdateable Android 4 phones.  So it's not a panacea, but at least it's I think it's one direction  that makes a lot of sense.  I think we've done it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Before I forget, your board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no, I just think it was a good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Before I forget, there actually was some big news that was very hush hush.  And my old gig on colleague, Yonko Rutgers,  found out through an interview with Google that the works  with Nest program is going away.  And come June, that means a lot of the third  party integrations with Nest products will not work.  And the big one, including if this than that.  Oh, no. If this than that, that is correct.  Yep. Oh, that's big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's big. Yeah. Now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In Yonko's headline, he says also tightens smart home privacy rules.  Is that why they're doing this? Is it a security thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I could see why Google is saying that it is because Stacey  and I on the on the IOT show always say, you know, once you've given your data  over, you have no control over what happens to it.  So Google is trying to tighten up who has access to what smart home data.  Because, again, once a third party has it, it's out there  and they can do whatever they want.  So I would say, yes, that's accurate.  They are trying to tighten up the privacy a little bit with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yonko interviewed Google Vice President Rishi Chandra.  And one of the things Chandra told him is that while it does break,  if this than that, they're hoping to put much of that functionality  into the Google Assistant.  So, yes, you'd have routines.  You couldn't go to a third party to do the routines.  You'd have to go through the Google Assistant to do it.  You know, there's this double sided.  This is ecosystem lock in. Right.  And interoperating with third party services.  Yeah, maybe that's a security flaw, but it's also, I think, a real benefit.  All right.  The commitment to hardware hasn't changed at all, says Chandra.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stacey just she must be listening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hi, Stacey. Hi, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She's out on the West Coast.  She said, you know, that if this Google thing  means that you have to buy a Google Home device that's in your house  all the time, if you want the level of control that. Right.  Yeah, it's a system lock in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But ecosystem lock in.  But that's what that new, by the way, that new Nest Home Hub Max will will be.  Is it can be the hub?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For Bluetooth and Wi-Fi devices.  Yes. I sports thread, they said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that enough to do everything?  Oh, I don't.  You still need Zigbee and Z-Wave and all of the protocols?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Need might be too strong of a word, but, you know, I would like to see that happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you wanted to interoperate within your house in all the different devices,  as opposed just the ones you got from Nest and locally as well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  as opposed to go into the cloud all the time, which again, on device,  natural language processing, we don't have that in Google Homes today.  So that's why they have to be cloud connected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did they talk about YouTube at all?  Do they talk about any other Google?  Do they mention Google Plus? Did they?  Oh, we have a user.  I love it. I'm sad. I was sad to see it go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I don't think it was. Was there even a session on YouTube?  I don't think there was. Not yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  YouTube's still part of a Google, right?  It's not an alphabet company. It's still part of Google. So.  I'm just looking at other stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm trying to find the schedule.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And most of it is now other companies.  I think we can we can wrap it up because I don't think we need to mention  the F word or the or the T word or the S word. I think we can.  Google's adding time lapse mode. Let's do a change log.  We do have a couple of change logs. Yeah, let's do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Time lapse mode comes to every pixel camera.  It's debuting on your brand new phone, Jeff Jarvis,  the Pixel 3A.  See, I use a Samsung phone and I've had time lapse and super slow mo  for a long time and hyper lapse, they call it.  But the time lapse option will be coming to the camera on all pixel  smartphones is, of course, now available if you have a new brand new one,  a 3A, 3A XL. But it'll go on the as Jeff calls it,  OG Pixel, the Pixel 2 and the Pixel 3 following an update.  You'll find it under the three dots where the more option is night sight  and slow motion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I actually have it already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so does our studio.  In fact, right now, I'm  the only in slow motion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Looks like they just started rolling out. Nice. Yay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Time lapse.  Yeah, OK.  It's in the change log. It's something new.  We mentioned the ground up redesign for Android Auto.  That's coming this summer.  There's a new video series.  From the Webmaster team, the old Matt Cutts Webmaster team,  SEO myth busting, I wish it were  Matt, but it's somebody new Martin Split from the Webmaster trends team.  Common misconceptions on search engine optimization.  That's actually something Matt always was very good at without labeling it such.  But if you subscribe to the Google Webmaster channel on YouTube,  you'll be able to you'll get a notification when the new  the new episodes come out. SEO Myth Busters.  There is a there is a new AI project from Google.  Google AI that turns your face into a poem portrait.  Oi, you want to try it?  Let's do it here.  It's a it's a arts experiments with dot with Google dot com.  S Devlin. It's at the boundaries of AI and human collaboration.  OK, so here's pirated with the morning wind  slated with light of days, harmonious and strange  with the first fair beam biased and frayed.  And now they are the flash.  I'm going to enter a donate a word refulgent.  Always a good word in poetry.  Refulgent. And now a poem featuring the word.  And a train, an algorithm training over 20 million words  of 19th century poetry is generating your unique poem portrait.  I'm doing burrito.  Oh, first it has to access my camera.  OK, wait a minute. Wait a minute.  It's going to take a picture.  Take a picture of me.  Take a picture.  Apparently, it doesn't understand Windows at all.  Hello.  Three, two, one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The camera wasn't authorized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the picture it got.  OK, refulgent as the light of the wind,  my freedom shall return with delight.  That's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A burrito is green and some should set the eye  that butte the shore of the sky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That sucks.  You got Rob, my friend.  I got it. All right.  That's the brand new Google AI Art.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can they give back your 20 percent time, please?  It is Thank a Teacher Week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank a teacher.  If you can read this, thank a teacher.  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  More teachers there.  That's my favorite bumper sticker.  That and the one wouldn't it be cool if the  if the schools got all the funding they wanted  and the military had a hold of bake sale?  That's my other favorite bumper sticker.  So this is Teacher Appreciation Week.  And here's an article about it by the National  Teacher of the Year, Rodney Robinson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's the what's that wonderful company that  you can put up your quest to the public to crowdfund

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to get more more pencils and stuff?  Donors Choose.  Donors Choose is great.  If you want to thank a teacher, go to Donors Choose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. You guys don't Donors Choose.  Oh, nice. What kinds of things have you have?  You have you podcasting equipment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Should come to me first thing.  A lot of old stuff. Yeah.  Yeah. Donors Choose.org.  There are lots of classroom projects available if you go there.  Support a classroom, build the future.  Teachers and students all over the US.  It's a shame, really, that we have to do this.  It is ridiculous.  It's a wonderful journey.  I would warrant nothing more important than education.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I see Chromebook requests out there all the time.  Yeah. You know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's good. If you have a old Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think Kevin soon will.  Yeah. And he casts off his.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Getting rid of your slate. Yeah.  Finally, get ready.  Here they come.  Fifty three brand new  non-binary emoji on Pixel devices.  If your gender is they, them, whatever.  If you're this is is Taylor here.  Gender fluid, non-binary or gender ambiguous.  So this is not necessarily part of the Unicode emoji spec.  But if you have a human in an emoji, it makes sense  if you're going to do an emoji library to include a variety of gender choices.  You watch billions. I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's amazing how the characters have all become absolutely fluid in saying they.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They they have no problem saying they have no problem saying they.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's all it's all entered in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a great example.  Even when they're saying how much they hate Taylor, they still call her they.  Yeah. Or him they they they.  Oh, they still call them they. Yes.  It's hard to get used to.  Even her father, like that was a big source of tension.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Their father, their father.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think we got to come up with a better pronoun.  It's hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Germans did something wacky where they they like insert parenthesis around  because the words are gender.  The whole language is gender.  Yeah. Don't know what you can do about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You just use neuter in German.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, well, because no, because then it's not the actual word.  Oh, OK. Yeah.  If German got rid of genders, it would be a very happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the hardest part of many languages is knowing what gender is this box.  I don't know. Google Duo group calling now rolling out in the US,  Canada and India.  Are you excited?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I was the other thing I was thinking the  Google Hub Max thing. Yeah.  Isn't that would that be a great office device? Yes.  For for for Skyping and video calling. Yeah.  You use it that way, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I use it with my son that way, not in my office, but down in the kitchen.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it'd be great to have in the office and just and just say,  you know, call me there.  I can still have my computer. I can still do they have to use Duo, though.  That's the problem. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do I mean, do you know?  Yeah, it's iOS and Android.  It's not like you can.  Google Express is a rebranding.  To Google shopping.  The EU doesn't hear about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wasn't shopping before. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then the EU got mad at them for favoring Google shopping.  And Google said, well, we don't it's not it's a non-existent product.  But now now Express.  But Express isn't the same as Google shopping because I don't know.  See, the problem you have with the Nest devices.  I use my Amazon Echoes to buy stuff all the time.  You buy them from Amazon. Google has this shopping experience.  I think a lot of this is all about making that giving them  parity on the on the assistant with Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you can buy speaking of Amazon shopping, the  laborless Amazon store has just come to New York.  Have you ever bought anything in one of those?  No. The Amazon Go.  Yeah, the Amazon Go is in New York.  Have you tried it? No, I just announced yesterday.  I can't wait to go downtown.  I've been trying to steal stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do they take cash now?  I thought I read that they were going to take cash there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, they have to have a person.  I guess not machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not necessarily. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The idea was you just use your phone to register as you.  And then when you walk in and walk out, that's it.  Give me a sandwich. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. But a lot of they don't want to preclude people  who may not have the technology and so on and so forth.  And I know in Philly, they just passed laws and Amazon said,  OK, we'll take cash at these stores as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Because there's all kinds of places in New York  where there are that are cashless and they're going to get in trouble now.  Oh, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hmm. Yeah.  That, my friends, is the Google change log.  Couple of quick hits and then we will get your picks of the week.  Well, it's because you're here and because we're going to dinner and  because there's I don't know.  We spent all day yesterday.  Brunch. Yeah.  It's been all day yesterday talking about Google.  I don't know. No, no, that's true.  All right. I'll throw in a few non-Google stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I miss it.  Verizon. I'm having such a good time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Verizon buys Yahoo.  Verizon kills porn on Tumblr.  Tumblr's for Tumblr's user engagement numbers.  Verizon says we're going to sell Tumblr.  Pornhub says we're going to buy Tumblr and bring the porn back.  End of story.  It hasn't happened yet, but wouldn't that be funny?  Wouldn't it be ironic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Remember, it was started by one of the...  It was one of the... David Karp.  David Karp, who was 17 years old when he started it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you know what?  I think it's really sad because Tumblr was a great thing, was the easiest way to blog.  It was kind of like the young person's version of Google's blogger.  Yep. Yep.  But much prettier and nicer and simpler.  I had a Tumblr for a long time. Social.  Social was great.  They did. I mean, what do you do?  It did have that problem where it wasn't completely consumed by adult content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, and it wasn't necessarily awful porn.  There's plenty of places for that.  Right.  It was just artsy or efforts at expression with skin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anyway, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was a place for people to to express their gender fluidity.  That's true. They loved it.  It works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, they loved them.  Let's see. That just sounds so unromantical.  Microsoft's Solitaire, Windows Solitaire, has been inducted into the Video Game Hall of Fame.  I have many hours on that.  Yeah, should be. Absolutely should be.  Did you know that Maisie Williams?  Arya Stark to her fans.  Has an app.  It's called. Maisie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't wait till this ends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Daisy, Daisy, an app community designed to help artists grow in their careers is launching worldwide.  It was created by Maisie Williams and film producer Dom Santry.  This was her tease this morning on.  Twitter, she said, soon coming today everywhere, everywhere for everyone.  Daisy. You know, I like people use their fame for a lot of things.  That's kind of a nice way to use your fame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm avoiding saying anything spoiling at all here, which means I just have to close my mouth.  Weird announcements at Microsoft Build.  Here's the weirdest one.  Windows 10 will be getting a Linux kernel.  It's not the main kernel, but it's another kernel, an actual Linux kernel.  For a while, Microsoft's offered something called the Windows Subsystem for Linux,  which lets you run or has let you run Linux apps in emulation on Windows 10.  But people complained. I complained because it's so slow because of the emulation.  So Microsoft said, all right, here's what we're going to do.  We're going to include a specially crafted Linux kernel.  And it's going to run 20 times faster,  making people wonder how long before they get rid of the Microsoft kernel.  Honestly, I wouldn't mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why do you think they did that?  Not just for the performance, obviously, but why are they pushing for Linux here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's a really, I mean, really, that's a fascinating story,  which we talk about every week on Windows Weekly.  This is the new Microsoft.  And by the way, it's been hugely successful, right?  It's a briefly a trillion dollar company.  Satya Nadella is on the cover of Bloomberg Business Week this week in the clouds with a halo.  And what he's really done is take a company that made all its money on Windows and Office  and moved it to the cloud.  And honestly, the thing that's most sacrilegious is deprecate Windows.  It's for a long time, Nadella would say at these build events,  we want to be everywhere our customers are, i.e. iOS, Android,  but the best experience will be on Windows.  He has dropped that second clause.  It's now we just want to be wherever our customers are.  They bought GitHub, so they have a large community of open source developers  who are looking at them trying to figure out  is it the old Microsoft or is this some sort of new Microsoft?  They've announced that they are going to abandon the engine in their edge browser  and make it based on Chromium.  They've already committed back to the Chromium open source project,  many commits including accessibility and language commits.  So they're a good partner in a big open source project  despite the fact that it's kind of a Google-y project.  This is not your grandfather's Microsoft.  This is a very different Microsoft.  And they have a problem because if you're a developer, and you know this Kevin,  you probably don't want to use Windows unless you're developing for .NET.  If you're doing Visual Basic or F sharp or C sharp or something like that,  if you're developing in a business, doing line of business applications, okay.  But most developers want to either use a Mac or Linux  because they want the tool chain.  And Microsoft has a very good IDE, Visual Studio,  but I think they were losing Mindshare.  And so they put this WSL in as a way to, as kind of a SOP saying,  look, you can use Windows and still use your Linux tools,  but I'll have to tell you, Crostini is much better.  Crostini at least gives you the full speed Linux because Chrome OS is Linux.  So you already have a Linux kernel and Chrome OS.  Microsoft was through this translation layer emulating Linux calls using the Windows kernel,  and it was really, really slow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I missed it.  What went so wrong with the demo at Microsoft?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that was a very sad thing.  We could talk a little bit about that.  This year is the 50th anniversary of the moon landing.  So at the beginning of the Microsoft Build Conference,  they had planned to do to demonstrate the HoloLens 2 virtual reality headset.  John Knoll, who is creative director at Industrial Light and Magic,  and by the way, the guy who with his brother Thomas wrote Photoshop,  was joined by Andrew Chaikin, who wrote the book, Man and the Moon.  He's a Apollo historian.  Do we have the rehearsal video?  Can we show that?  So in rehearsal, they had done this moon landing in augmented reality.  It was really cool.  Turns out since 1999, John Knoll has been collecting data about the Apollo landing.  He's an Apollo fanatic.  He was seven years old when it happened.  He'll never forget it.  And he'd been collecting data.  He found in 1999 a trove of telemetry from NASA that gave extremely detailed.  Here's the lunar module.  They're going to show it landing on the moon.  That telemetry showed exactly every second by second,  everything the lunar module did as Neil Armstrong by hand piloted onto the moon.  So he'd been collecting that telemetry and over a period of time,  in between Star Wars and Star Trek movies where he was doing the special effects,  would create renderings of this.  So he was really excited to be able to put it into HoloLens.  So they used the Unreal Engine to generate it from Epic.  That's a story in itself, by the way.  I'll get to that in a second.  And they created this very detailed, very accurate recreation of the Apollo launch and landing.  They, as you can see here, because we're watching the video, worked fine in rehearsal.  But right about when the keynote was about to begin at 830 in the morning, it crashed.  It failed.  They delayed the keynote for 20 minutes trying to get it back.  Finally, they could delay no longer.  They opened the keynote.  Knoll and Chaikin walked on the stage.  They introduced it and then they kind of hung their heads and said,  I guess it's not going to work and walked off.  Oh, no.  It was very, it was a tragic moment.  And what they were going to do was really cool.  And really the culmination of poor John Knoll, this is 20 years of work.  So if you get a chance, go see, it was Yanko actually, Yanko Records,  who had interviewed Knoll about this and had a great story for variety about it,  was all ready to put it out when they did the demo.  And then this is Neil Armstrong stepping onto the moon and in augmented reality,  exactly as it happened timing-wise and everything.  It was really a cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So henceforth, any bad demo is what Apollo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe.  It reminded me of Michael Bay's horrific experience at the Samsung  launch when the teleprompter stopped working.  He didn't know what to say.  So he just again, hung his head and left.  The side story that kind of ties back to this Linux thing is that Epic,  Tim Sweeney in Epic Games, of course, the creators of the Unreal Engine and Fortnite,  very, very wealthy.  Tim was an outspoken critic of Microsoft.  He was really pissed off at the Microsoft store.  And he had the feeling, as many did, that Microsoft was going to start to move all  application development into its store, require you to ship through the store.  And he saw that as a real detriment.  Windows gaming is a big, big part of what Epic does.  And it was very critical.  Somehow, and I think Rutgers talks about this as well in his piece,  somehow Nadella convinced him that it's a new Microsoft,  that they are not going to do this, that they welcome,  they embrace not only open source, but third-party gaming.  And suddenly Sweeney is at Microsoft events talking about,  he was at the HoloLens 2 announcement.  And highly profiled in this demo had it come off  because they used the Epic Unreal Engine to do it.  So that is kind of an example of how Microsoft shift to a more different Microsoft,  more open Microsoft has really changed the world.  All right, let's take a break.  I think if there's anything else you want to get in here,  I'm glad you mentioned that because I felt so bad and I really wanted to show that video.  If you get a chance, go to variety.com.  Janko Rutgers, he's doing a great job there, your former colleague at Giga Home.  I really like Janko.  Yeah, he's fantastic.  Yeah, he is.  So Variety is Hollywood's trade paper.  And he has become the kind of the gateway to the digital world  for all of these Hollywood types, which, and he couldn't pick a better person to do it.  I think he's just really fantastic.  Okay, yeah, I think we pretty much covered.  I'm not going to say anything about Facebook.  Did you go to F8?  No, I didn't.  You didn't?  I didn't.  Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In the last two, three years, they had a lot about media and this year they didn't have any.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's kind of what happened to Facebook, right?  They turned their back on media and it's all local and all.  Or it's too scary a topic.  Yeah, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I watched the keynote.  Benedict Evans thinks he still believes that this was a major change.  Yeah, it's real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Michael Zuckerberg is not blowing smoke when he says privacy is going to be our number one watchword.  Yep.  What was the line that was behind him on the stage?  Privacy is the future.  Is the future.  It's kind of hard, you know, for companies like Google and Facebook that are built on tracking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's the thing that finally occurred to me is the problem is, well, two things I'll say.  One is the problem is that Facebook is the first company that built its company around  the behaviors of people.  Right.  Google didn't.  Apple didn't.  Amazon didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, every company does in a sense because you're trying to acquire customers.  Facebook is purely human behavior.  In fact, all of Facebook's content comes from its users.  They generate no content of their own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The second thing is that I think that we in the technology covering world and media  are doing it wrong.  At this point, it shifted and we should be covering not the technology but people's  behavior on the technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you're right.  I would agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a radically different story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've been observing that shift and I expected that shift all along.  I always liken it to this.  Remember all the stereo magazines in the 50s where all they talked about was how much  power you'd get without distortion, your total RMS.  It wasn't at all about the music.  Then Rolling Stone comes along and suddenly nobody's talking about the hardware.  It's all about the content.  I think that's another shift.  Now, it's not about anything but about people and how they use it.  It's not about speeds and feeds, processors, memory, none of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The bad and the good both is from human behavior on technology rather than the technology  itself but we still think it's a technology story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's killing me because I couldn't care less about people.  I'm much more interested in hardware.  It's killing me.  Honestly, this whole network was built-  The laughter of your staff was great.  Well, it's true though.  This whole network was built on which computer should you buy and what happens when it crashes.  Look at this show as a perfect example because this show, more than any show we've ever done  on Twitter, was about behavior, humans.  We hardly ever talk about speeds and feeds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Last piece of this is that I hear all the time that the internet is a medium and just  another medium and I believe pretty firmly that it's not.  I've made that clear on the show oftentimes but then it finally occurred to me that the  world's turned around, that media is now a subset of the internet.  Along with other sectors.  Media is now 80% on the internet.  Communications is 100% on the internet.  Finance is, pick a number, 20% on the internet.  Crime is 10% on the internet.  Every sector of society, every industry, is being brought into the internet so it becomes  synonymous with the net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It just changes how we cover the net because it's no longer how the net is changing us.  The net is us.  The net is society.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  That's a very different way to think about and cover this as a result.  But media and technology is still treated as a technology, a widget, a gadget.  It's a sector.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  It's not a sector.  It's everything.  We're a sector of it.  Yes.  Not in a sector of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I, for one, welcome the new board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I knew this was going to happen because I've had a front row seat at that transformation.  Yes.  Really the way this podcast network has shifted.  We still do a show on computer hardware but increasingly Twit and Twig and all the  shows are not about computer hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I remember the early days of, how long has this show been going on now?  12 years, something like that.  No, no, this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This show, we're episode 507 so 10 years.  I can't do the math, okay.  Almost, a little less than 10 years.  Wow, Jesus, man.  I know.  It'll be.  Woo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know.  But I remember, as we used to come on after Twit and there'd be times in Twit where you'd  be talking about the refresh rate of a new Samsung screen.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you were in heaven.  I kind of am sad about it.  But this is what happens with age.  You'll understand this in about 20 years, Kevin.  This is one of the things that happens with age is the world passes you by a little bit,  right?  And I still embrace and that's why I keep saying, why don't you just put Linux on it?  Just put Linux on it and everything would be better if you just put Linux on it.  Because I still belong to that world and nobody cares about what operates.  And that's kind of what Microsoft's saying.  Nobody cares what your operating system is.  It's irrelevant.  It's not an operating system.  The network is the operating system.  The network is the cloud.  And you know, Sun used to say this for years.  They'd say the network is a computer that was the Sun Microsystem slogan.  And I always thought that doesn't make any sense at all.  It makes sense now, doesn't it?  Now it does.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They were right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is why I really don't miss doing phone reviews like I used to at GigOwn.  Oh, I don't miss it either.  Except I have to do it.  Okay, what are the specs?  You know, compare, give me a speed test.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It feels, to be honest, a little consumer-y, consumer, promoting consumerism.  I don't know what the word would be.  It seems a little bit talking about the shiny new thing and ignoring the impact,  what it means in society and how we have opportunities.  What can you do with that?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you look at Google's keynote, come back around before we go into the last commercial,  and what were they emphasizing?  Humanity.  Yep.  Right?  They were emphasizing the woman in India.  They're emphasizing the speech stuff.  That's a really good point.  Right?  And they were trying to say, we're helping.  We're helping.  We're Google.  We're here to help.  Helping.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But no, that's a very good point.  It's not about the bits and the bytes.  It's about what you do with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a developer's conference, right?  If any place was going to get into the nitty gritty of the code,  of course they did more in the developer's keynote.  Do all the big tech companies realize this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When Google now clearly does, I guess Microsoft sort of does.  That's really been their pivot.  Does Apple?  I think they're still tied.  They say we're moving to services, but I think they're still tied in the notion of selling a product.  They are.  Facebook?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, Facebook, that was the problem for Facebook.  They were the first in and didn't realize how complex this is.  Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think they do.  I think they do, no.  Because their number one profit center is Amazon Web Services, not what they sell.  And I think the selling is really just an adjunct to what they really are.  And I think they know it.  I think Bezos is very smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's Soylent Green.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's made of people.  Good insight.  That's nice.  Yeah, and I completely agree.  And I think changing that context helps a lot in understanding what's going on and what we  can do and should do about it.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And whom we should blame, which is not always technology companies,  we have met the enemy and it's us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And for somebody like me to watch Intel just kind of fade into the sunset,  such a shock to the system.  And frankly, I think that's what's happening to Apple too, to be honest with you.  I think Apple's fading into the sunset because what they've realized is we offer nothing  except brand and fashion.  We don't actually offer any tangible benefit.  And Google to say, oh, what we really have to offer is a better life for you.  That's huge.  Apple's pretending that if you buy that new thing, your life will be better.  Google's saying use this and your life will be better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. And Facebook was trying to say if you all connect with each other, life will be better.  Oops. Well, you're not so good at that.  Turns out not.  Right. So Google's coming in and saying, well, we'll do a better job of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a challenge, though, because what Google's offering is  something essentially non-human as an intermediary, which is AI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which in a time when humans are messing up the world, not a bad thing.  Maybe. Yeah, that worries me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do think that that's going to be one of the pitches of the future is let the machines do it.  We talked about this a few months ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the point of David Weinberger's book, which, by the way, if you'd like to come,  I'll be interviewing David Weinberger next Wednesday in New York at Book Culture on the  Upper West Side. You can go on and get tickets there. You should just search for me and him in  New York and you'll find it.  He wrote the brilliant Clutrain Manifesto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He was co-author of Clutrain. He wrote Small Pieces, Loosely Joined.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He wrote Too Big to Know. He's absolutely brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And his new book is called?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everyday Chaos about AI, about just what you just said.  The machines are going to do it better than we can.  Should we let them?  Little choice. They're going to predict better than we can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Rethinking knowledge now that the facts aren't the facts.  Oh, this is Too Big to Know.  Now it's called Everyday Chaos.  Oh, okay. The new one is Everyday Chaos. Wow.  Carson, let's get him on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Please give me his info.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I will do that.  We should have triangulation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I promised to give you Craig Newmark.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You've made so many promises.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know what's going on with you and Carson, but I think you guys should just go  get a room and hash it out. That is so funny.  Everydaychaosbook.com.  Interesting. Yeah. I like it that you're in touch with big thinkers.  You really...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Notice he said that I'm not one. I'm in touch with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kind of know them. Can introduce them to us.  No, you're a big...  I know. No, I'm not. No, I'm not.  You're a big thinker too.  I hang out with them. Carson, however.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're a big thinker at least by osmosis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By association. He's a BTBA.  Let's take a break. If you guys have a pick or anything you want to show the world,  we can do that in a second. Our show today brought to you by ExpressVPN.  I am glad sometimes we still talk about technology and how to use technology to protect  your privacy, to protect your hardware, to protect yourself against cybercrime, stolen data.  A VPN is the best way to do it. If you're on an open Wi-Fi network,  you're on the same network as anybody else in that area, including the guy in the hoodie in  the corner there. If you are on even your home network, all your traffic is being watched by  your internet service provider. We know ISPs routinely sell that data on. Protect yourself.  Protect your privacy by encrypting your internet connection with a virtual private network.  The number one VPN, according to TechRadar, is ExpressVPN. They do it all right. No logging.  They keep track of nothing. You are private. You are encrypted from wherever you are all the way  out to the ExpressVPN server. They have servers all over the world. That means you can emerge on  the public internet in the country of your choosing. All those servers means there's lots  of bandwidth. ExpressVPN is great that way too. It's fast. You won't know you're on a VPN. It's  easy to use. They have ExpressVPN apps for Windows, for Mac, for every phone, iOS and Android,  every tablet. Those apps, one click and you're protected. Surf safely on public Wi-Fi. Stop  being snooped on or having your data attacked. It's less than $7 a month. ExpressVPN. Protect  your online activity today and get three extra months free with a one-year package. Just go to  expressvpn.com. Expresvpn.com. For three extra months free when you buy that one-year package.  We thank ExpressVPN for keeping us safe, keeping us private and for  keeping Twitter flowing. Thank you ExpressVPN and we thank you for using that URL and letting  them know you heard it here. Expressvpn.com slash twig. Kevin Toffle, Python guru.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know that's putting it, that's overstating it quite a bit. I've only taken two classes in  mostly Java, but yeah, for our final project. And this is my pick, which kind of goes into the theme  of making technology more helpful to people. For our final project, a group of myself and three  other students took some open source software from OpenAPS and we quote unquote hacked diabetes.  Basically made a pancreas in the cloud using Python. We started with Java, but quickly switched  over to Python. I love this. Pancreas is a service. Yeah. Yeah, basically. It's rather, it's,  I learned an awful lot about diabetes for one thing and just also obviously about programming  in general. So what you're seeing there is a real time chart from one of the actual students,  Glucometer, which we read the data from, put it up in the cloud on a MongoDB and then suck it back  down into Google Sheets using APIs with Python and also into Data Studio. So you can track blood  sugars and insulin levels in a graph, which you can even share that with your practitioner,  your health practitioner. But additionally, OpenAPS software, it runs on a Raspberry Pi.  That's part of this loop and it literally adjusts your insulin levels in quote unquote real time.  It's every five minutes as opposed to what the student was doing before. And that was  manually hitting buttons to add insulin throughout the day. So it was a really fascinating project  from, you know, from a human standpoint, as well as a technical standpoint. I learned a ton.  I also made a total goofball out of myself in the video overview of the project.  I wanted to, I want these students are going for jobs and internships and I am not. So I wanted to  let them discuss the technical part. So I basically played a goofy news announcer in our video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, this is so cute, Kevin. That is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I even put little CNN breaking news.  But yeah, I'm pretty much a goofball there. And I just interviewed these guys about the project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. Thanks. We want to go back to school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where did you do this course, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I'm at my local community college, Montgomery County College.  Yeah, that's really ambitious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is the second comp sci class that you take there. And the second half of this class,  you literally do a project full time. There is no more class. It's literally doing a  massive project and then everybody presents their project in the atrium of the main building on the  last day of school to the president of the university and other teachers and companies  come in as well. And it was such a great experience. And my hope is that I've been  talking to them about being an adjunct instructor for the intro to programming class.  You should be great at that. Yeah.  I would love to do it because this is why I went back to school, not just to learn. I could have  done that online, but to mentor and share real world experience and what it was like to work  at Google. I hope I gave back more than I got from this class to the students and the college

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  as a whole. I loved it. You know, it reminds me, we watched before the Microsoft event on Monday,  we watched the Imagine Cup, which is three teams in the finals. There are three college collegiate  teams with an invention. And in this case, the winner of the Imagine Cup, Brian Chang, who's a  freshman, he's 18 years old, there he is standing next to such an Adele. He won $150,000 as a  freshman at UCLA. He has something he's patented patent pending called easy glucose. It's the first  I've ever seen real non-invasive glucose monitoring. It puts a lens on a smartphone,  has a machine learning database, takes a picture of your eye and is able to with some serious

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  accuracy, measure blood sugar. Wasn't that what Google was going to do with the lens?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They wanted to do with that lens. But the thing here is kind of what you were doing is using  machine learning to take a lot of readings. And then the machine learns, oh, this is what glucose  looks that glucose level looks like. I don't think the $150,000 he got from Microsoft is going to be  much compared to how much he's going to get from some big company. If he perfects this, this is  what's going on. These are young people doing amazing things. My mother was a brutal diabetic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so when I was when I was young, it's amazing the instinct you have when I was when I was a kid,  you could tell I could recognize before anybody in the family when she was ready to go into a  reaction. Yeah, it's like those dogs that know you're almost defensive. You need to know. Yeah. Oh,  yeah, absolutely. Absolutely the case. And so and so that's where machine learning does come in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sure. It's the opportunity to add some instinct, some intuition. But what if you had couldn't  explain it many, many more data points and you could say, oh, yeah, this is what the eye looks

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  like when the glucose levels 100 or 200. So David Weinberg, this is a case that's David  Weinberg was the only one who did it in his book. He talks about the case of the chicken sexers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we Petaluma actually I interviewed the last chicken sexer of Petaluma because when  this was many years ago, it's a nice old guy. This is when I was at my peak at KNBR.  When a chick is born, they need to determine if it's a male or female and it's not obvious,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  apparently. Right. And so you even the chicken sexers don't really know how they know, but they

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  know. So it's like I did I tried to how do you know? He said, Well, you just know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that machine learning is the new chicken sexer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And there's your show title. I keep trying. What's your number,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mr. Jarvis? All right. Well, Matthew Ingram, our friend, tweeted that out of the New York  Times financial statement, the paper's crossword is the fifth largest digital subscription product  of any kind offered by a US news provider. I'm not surprised. I pay for it. You do? Oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  yeah. Oh, love it. I love it. I start on Monday and I work my way up to Sunday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So when the Times talks about his digital subscriptions, it's including food and and

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  crosswords in there. So it's not just the fifth largest product of the Times. It's of any kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  any kind of news. And I don't know if this is fair. Maybe Stacey would show up next week,  but she just tweeted what her camera caught of her dog going to the door. And it's so sad and sweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, because they're moving. Well, no, this is the husband's living. Oh, the husband's leaving.  My wife system has picked up the door just shut behind my husband. He's left the house.  His dogs. Oh, look at the tail. It just goes. Oh, he keeps going away. That's hysterical.  So a good friend of our show and a great guy in general, Mike Elgin's son, Kevin, is a whiz  with technology. And he has launched a Kickstarter for something that is super,  super cool. This is called chatterbox just launched a couple of days ago. So there's still 58 days  ago, but don't delay. You want these. They've already exceeded their goal. It's a smart speaker  that kids build and program. So they're not relying on Amazon's echo. Go ahead. You can play the audio.  Let's give them a nice show my video. There's too many screens with too many distractions,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  not enough creativity and learning and definitely not enough privacy.  Meet chatterbox the world's first building yourself program yourself smart speaker for kids.  Think of it like an Amazon Alexa, but one focus on privacy that kids can build and teach to bring  their creativity to life. They teach it. Our simple step by step instructions make problem  solving fun and hands on. Building chatterbox is as easy as building a paper airplane.  The visual skill builder helps kids learn about artificial intelligence while easily programming  voice skills. Kids can set up magic words to control lights, Kevin worked at Tinker for a  while, which did something similar on an iPad. Anything is possible. Chatterbox is a fun, personal  and private way for kids to develop important communication, critical thinking. He did Piper,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  which was a build it yourself computer, right? Our team's collective experience has built

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  educational software and harder products by millions of kids all over the world where parents,  educators, designers and developers. So meet chatterbox and if you pledge $99, you'll get the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  super early bird. There's 12 left to those. Chatterbox smart speaker, build it yourself  and program it yourself smart speaker. If you pledge $119, that's going to be the second tier.  And I think that's just, you know, as they've sold out the first tier, $238 for two of them.  Right. And it goes on up. And so if you want to sponsor a school and get eight of them,  so teachers, yeah, we can go to hint hint. You could sponsor a school and, and that would be a  really fun school project, I think more than just building and programming. It really teaches kids  how these things work, that they're not just a wizard in a box, you know, and that's really the  problem. I think as we move to this world where we go beyond what, you know, hardware understanding,  suddenly it just becomes magical things, magical items. And I think it's important for,  especially for kids to contextualize it by understanding, oh, that's just a machine.  Right. That's not, but it's a person in there that I'm in control of. And I control it. Yeah. And  this is how it's programmed by a human somewhere. I think really an important thing to understand  and learn. So good for you, Kevin. It's on Kickstarter. Go to Kickstarter and search for  chatterbox smart speaker, the kids build and program. And I'm glad he's already reached his  goal, but there's still lots more to go. Well done, Kevin. Good for you, Mike Elgin son, Kevin Elgin.  What age is it targeted at? I don't know. That's a good question. They show these kids are pretty

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  younger. Kindergarten teacher now, IT guy in the room. I, I've been for my nephew who's going to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  six kids. It says kids as young as seven years old. So, uh, you know, you know your kid and whether  your kid could adjust to this. I mean, it, you know, it's, it, the programming is all dragging.  It's all that, you know, kind of modular programming or something. Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of the cute things that IO, they had a session, which was pretty full, uh, for make your first,  uh, assistant script, right? And basically all you have to do is do a spreadsheet. Yeah. It's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Um, this is going to be more than just a simple smart speaker though, because they're incorporating,  uh, Wolfram Alpha. It has a Raspberry Pi. It's powered by my Croft AI. So it is a sophisticated,  uh, uh, uh, uh, voice assistant that you'll probably end up using, which is also very  cool. It comes with a Raspberry Pi 3d plus, plus the special chatter voice hat.  Uh, we are done for this week in Google. Thank you everybody for being here. We had a great time.  I want to thank our teachers. Remember it's teacher appreciation week, Jared, Ryan, Brian and Roland.  Is the Sacramento unified school district? Is that all over, all over Sacramento?  Notice they're here in shorts because it's hot up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. They were probably freezing their buns off here. Yeah. It's always my favorite part of going

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  on the Golden Gate bridge is watching all the tourists in shorts saying, but I thought it was  summer. Uh, anyway, thanks guys for what you do. Teaching is absolutely the most important thing.  Anybody does. Um, it beats podcasting. I can tell you that we do this show, uh,  every Wednesday around one 30 Pacific, four 30 Eastern, 20, 30 UTC. If you want to come by and,  and watch you can we stream audio and video live at twit.tv slash live.

You can get on demand episodes of this and every show we do at our  website, twit.tv for twig. It's twit.tv slash twig. That's easy to remember. And as I mentioned,  we are now at 507 shows, so we're getting close in about 13 weeks. We will be at our 10th anniversary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you believe that? I can't believe you've let me do this for this long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ah, I can't believe that we were young men when we started,  but we weren't. So there, that's why I can't believe it. Uh, you can download episodes at twig,  twit.tv slash twig or subscribe. That's actually the best thing to do. Find your  favorite podcast application, subscribe in that way. It'll be on your phone.
