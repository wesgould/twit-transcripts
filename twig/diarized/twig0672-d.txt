Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you try to get rid of you bad penny man bad penny

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We thought we should bring in some legal counsel on this day of all days  Actually, there's not a day goes by that twig couldn't use legal counsel Kathy Gallus is here  CG counsel comm in beautiful, New Jersey. Hello Kathy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thanks for having me someday. I hope to have a card

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That can be arranged that can be arranged I'll know I've arrived

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When I when my credentials can be laminated, I know I'm really it's the real deal man

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the real deal Kathy's also a contributor at tech dirt and  Read the entire  241 page  filing from  Twitter's attorneys  At the Chancery of the state of Delaware  Did you read it all next only 62 pages? It's not that's you could you could do that in the morning

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did some preparation for today. I have not read every word, but I read the  most of the  Filing most of I think I read all of there's a motion to expedite that came out today  And then I was going back to the original agreement and I looked over a couple of the terms of the agreement  Oh, you did your own work. I did  I know well, this is so annoying. Well last time I complained that you made me remember corporate law  so I even went and looked for my corporate law, which I could not find but  I'm for  Sensible things to say on the subject because somehow I thought you might ask me a few things. So not too many

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're not gonna make it. So what do you think Kathy? What do you think? All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, let me actually let me give you a less open-ended question because that's that could be a lot of things  maybe start at the at the  30,000-foot level Twitter is  suing Musk  Saying you said you're gonna give us 44 billion and by God we want the 44 billion  They're suing in Delaware because that's where Twitter is incorporated. It's in the Chancery Court  Which I've been told in court some of the actions like this moves quickly  What is what is the time frame you think for this kind of a lawsuit? I don't know but the motion for exped to expedite was

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's supposed to be a drop-dead date built into the merger agreement itself, which was like October 24th of this year  so the idea with the motion to expedite is that  There'll be about two months of pretrial  So whatever discovery would happen enough time for a trial and enough time for an appeal for there to be a final resolution  That would happen before October 24th. So  That sort of thing is apparently not unprecedented according to the motion to expedite it  It's fast on by general terms even without the expert

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I heard people say oh, it's gonna be ten years before this is resolved. It's not a decade-long action

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I went through this with Time Warner and and Paramount because there was a fight over that just as we were starting entertainment weekly  And it was a couple weeks

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Delaware is very corporate friendly too. That's why you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not really a regular court I don't think the Chancery Court is  Every so often you hit things that sort of have courts with unusual jurisdiction and the terms of that jurisdiction  Tend to be net very narrow but by being very narrow they can be very efficient  So we're not talking a normal federal civil litigation trial which has its own timeline for how long it would take  This is something that speaks to Delaware law specifically corporate law specifically  And the Chancery Courts being the courts of jurisdiction to to work this out  and so they've seen this before Delaware has laws built in order to  companies like going there because it can be so efficient from the corporate law front and so they got systems but this is kind of people have  reflexes from general standard federal civil  litigation and those instincts don't really apply here both in terms of the process and also I think in terms of the substance where even  This is a breach of contract claim and you see those in federal court  This is an unusual and very specific type of contract claim. Yeah, and and it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Features for instance a variety of tweets and emojis are involved

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The one thing that will be interesting is well the one thing that was probably a lot that's interesting about this but it also has a  Some characteristics that are unusual for the Chancery Court to be dealing with so I don't know if they've ever  Adjudicated a poop emoji before but now they will be the first

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Appropriate since world emoji day is Friday  I  Guess there are  I'm not sure what Twitter wants to gain from this  It's because the money isn't coming out of Elon Musk's ample pockets, but as involves a number of other investors  I don't know if they really intend to get all 44 billion they may but they want more than one day  They want more than the 1 billion breakup fee the bit deserve it important  paragraph I think in paragraph 4 of the  of the nature of the action  That price presented by must on a take it or leave it basis in an unsolicited public offer  Represented a 38% premium over Twitter's unaffected share price  Unaffected at the moment soon soon to be affected the other terms Musk offered and agreed to were he touted seller-friendly  There is no financing contingency and no diligence condition  The deal is backed by airtight debt and equity commitments  Musk has personally committed thirty three point five billion. I think that thirty three point five billion is an important number. I suspect that's  Maybe the number they think they can get out of out of Musk, although he wouldn't then own the company  He would I don't know what that I it's very complicated because in order to buy the company  He has to get fifth has to have a proxy vote with the shareholders gets  51% of the proxy vote and then all the shareholders have to get  $54.20 per share which is a total he's already said he doesn't want it and he said he doesn't want it and  Presumably the sovereign wealth front of Saudi Arabia and Larry Ellison and the others who've put up money Larry put up a billion himself  They are they gonna be actually that's a question for you Kathy. Are they bound by what the Chancery quarter Chancery says?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, I don't know the answer to that. I'm not sure they'd be bound specifically because I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're their contracts with right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Contracts are with Musk and chances are he might be in breach of their contracts to them where they could basically pull their money  Like he he might end up. I don't think I'm speaking out of school on this  But I could be wrong like all of this is a I'm not a corporate lawyer and B  Law is not very stable these days and see this is really pushing the edges of it  but one outcome is he could potentially be on the hook for  If he even can't do the purchase but some form of damages that comes close to the purchase price and not really have a way  To finance it and one question is then what?  You know, he may have a judgment against him  It may be and what does he do if he's got this judge?  What happens to Twitter if Twitter wins the money has an award against him. What money can they actually extract from him?  This is gonna be I mean the problem with the last  Five six years in law is that we've been stress testing every single aspect of constitutional law corporate law contract law tort law  Everything has been going against the outer boundaries of how this law is supposed to function and  When you go to that and you push the edges you find out to what extent it actually can function  Well at the edges this isn't supposed to happen  This isn't supposed to be a kind of thing that's supposed to happen and Twitter's complaint really kind of puts together  Why it's not supposed to happen  You're not supposed to have a purchaser walk in make an offer and then essentially  Vandalize the company and then walk away from the deal

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so they say mucks exit strategy is a model of hypocrisy a model of bad faith  The claims are pretext and lack any merit  This is what I've said this before we're in a situation we have been for five years  of everything everything in this country the rule of law is kind of  Assuming a certain amount of normal behavior and when people are willing to go beyond the norms

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We often don't know the question is do we enforce  The law in this case and the norms though. You're right. Those are two different things  But but there is precedent here. There are things to call upon. I put up a really good thread from Morgan Ricks  About the remedies involved a Vanderbilt law professor and  And I'll just read to them. It's very daunting to order specific performance in a situation like this  There's external financing that has to be made to perform which is what you just talked about and if Musk flouts your what if what?  Musk flouts your order it turns into a showdown over the court's jurisdiction and power which is what you're saying  Leo is that when you don't follow all the rules. Yeah, if you just walk away, what is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What are the chance are he's gonna come after you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, there's chance where there's also don't forget SEC right cuz he's  by the way up to now been kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Lenient with mr. Musk's let's shall we say

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think he's in trouble with the SEC is gonna happen to him  I mean if they enforce it that's irrespective of what happens with this case exactly  but the issue is like that's part of normally specific performance over a human being as a  Remedy for contracts is disfavored because there's a 13th amendment problem with forcing another human being to do something. They don't want to do  this is a little unusual because he's sort of a human being and sort of in corporate form and  It's not quite clear can you you can sometimes get specific performance out of like an enterprise yes  Commend to close your deal. You have no choice. You can't walk away  It's been happened and they're so exciting at Tyson Foods merger from  Sometime in this Millennium as an example of one where it would happen  But it's tricky under the best of circumstances and this is really sort of the outer edge of this is not normal  This is a human being who happened to have a billion dollars to throw around so it's very strange

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Rick's thinks that that that they're owed a billion for their rake-up fee  Which I certainly would agree with and a billion in monetary damages now  Where did he come with a billion for that?  But I think you're talking that everybody's talking about that Twitter is so bad off Twitter could get rid of  Musk and I think we'll get a few more billion cash in the bank  Now if they have a different board and different management is a different question what do they do with it?  But I think Twitter could end up in the long run  Hurt for now, but if they can get rid of Musk and get some money

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's that that's the point of that's what I have said of these lawsuits and everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's weird because I've also said Twitter should just walk away and say fine  And what a number of people complained about F who's the founder of Twitter?  Ebs tweet was that ignores the damage that Elon has done to shareholders  there is  Beyond the hurt to do sherry duty to shareholders here. There is a I mean look at the current stock price for Twitter  I mean there this was damaging this looks  You know like almost like a pump-and-dump scheme that went wrong  We're horribly wrong and who gets damaged in a pump-and-dump scheme is the everyday investors  So there so it's easy for ev, you know billionaire to billionaire to say I'll let Elon off the hook  But there are a lot of Twitter investors who are left holding the bag

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then this is like a court cares about right hands. It's all about shareholder protection  I mean possibly at the expense of other things would be good for a lot of care about but that's what  Delaware corporate law optimizes for protection of shareholders particularly of minority shareholders  And so that's what its adjudication in this forum is going to be keyed towards and yeah  There's been damage. I mean I use the word vandalized Twitter didn't use that word  But they basically make the same point of you came you offered you kind of made it that we couldn't say no  And then we said yes to let you go ahead and close this deal and you immediately disparaged us like and here's your poop emoji

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Violation of their agreement they had

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, you were saying that he did Twitter deserves more than the one billion dollar clause  That was there is it only because of his poor behavior or if he hadn't done any of these stupid tweets and poop emoji things  And decided you know what? I I don't I don't want to do this. Are you saying okay now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They only deserve the one billion dollars that happens all the time people back out of agreements all the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  so I this is this is the answer that I prepared in advance because I  Yes, although all the caveats not a corporate lawyer, this is weird  Outside the jurisdiction, but one basic point to point out is  Dad I think normal Americans viewed  Damages you win in a lawsuit as sort of like almost a prize of like  Oh, we got a million dollars of the settlement or something like that  And that's not how damages are supposed to work the idea of damages is that it's supposed in most cases  It's supposed to make you whole particularly in a contract case that the idea of damages is that the parties  Had thought they were okay  They thought they were gonna have this deal and the deal fell apart  So the point of the damages is to make them as okay as they would have been if the deal had closed  So the idea with the billion dollar debt of fee that they wrote in is that okay?  If this deal falls apart  And I think the one billion dollars that clause maybe could have been better written  But I think the point of is is the deal fails for a couple of reasons we can't anticipate  Will be hurt, but we think that the hurt can be measured by a billion dollars  And you pay it will be whole and then go about your lives  The issue is that Musk did more and the reason is getting breached is not necessarily one of those terms that in it was anticipated  But other terms beyond that and also he caused additional harm  So I think what that's happening with this complaint is that's being queued up to try to get something more to recognize  the huge hurt to Twitter  some people and I don't think that billion dollars will  Necessarily function as a cap because I think it was based on if you walk away from a number of these circumstances  We can anticipate this is the measure of damages  But that Twitter is now arguing this is something that nobody would have ever anticipated  Because we would have anticipated that you'd act in good faith and because you acted in this way instead  Nobody couldn't for that you're acting in good faith  And we you know we can't clean up the mess that you've made for us just because you've walked away now  So I think they're trying to do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So if you look at the market cap right now, sorry you go ahead and sorry I

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Don't claim to know the law like anybody else would that's not a lawyer, but does defamation come in here is anything  Around that part of this consideration for for his bad acting is it just

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My so I think the thing is that the jurisdiction and the claims may be limited  But I'm speaking a little bit outside my zone here, but this is not a blank slate for  Other types of claims that they might have against Elon Musk including under California law like unfair business practices

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They could make that too  Not you know where no not chance re but they could whatever they went in chance re they could still go to answer question  Could they go to another court on another action? I?  Don't know the settlement here would be here's your money that ends it. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean basically one of the things that like you're trained up in law school is you play the hand you're dealt  But sometimes there's certain ways that things are set up where it's like no  That's much more of a Hail Mary than you thought and I don't know the answer to the question of how many bites at the apple  And how many courts they could get but if they found that they needed more bites  They would certainly try to get some  But I don't know if they can and right now you've got a live  Contract where there's been a breach and the and right now the chance record is the one to adjudicate the breach and when you  Call it when they look at what broke and the hurt that happened  They're looking for a measure of damages now  I think one of the reasons they're asking for specific  Performance is that share price is a way of starting to come up with a number so if it's not going to be  Forcing him to purchase at that number then it might out translate into some other form of money  And that's going to turn into multiples of billions. I believe it's the current  Market cash

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So Kathy to answer that the current market cap is 28 billion the offer was 44 billion. So right there is  16 billion as a starting point now  I'm probably not going to end up there you could argue that the 44 billion was not the high end  It was what the stock was at the time, but that's still a lot more than 28 billion  So the Leo's point the damage to the shareholders is considerable and measurable and then go to Ant's point  There's also damage to  Computation they've lost management. There's people there all kinds of other things too

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Speculation of him being the new ownership. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  so I wouldn't frame it as defamation partly because  It's defamation is very narrow in the United States and corporate defamation is even more narrow than that  but there is definitely an issue of  Disparagement which they bring up in the complaint because  He was obligated not to disparage the company and he did and in theory the deal could still close even though he did  But then he walked away he disparaged and then walked away. So now they're like, you know  these are the things of the true measure of damage is no not necessarily the billion they had pre-negotiated because  They knew how much harm he could potentially cause if they walked away  But they hadn't anticipated how much harm he could cause if he also breached the non-disparagement cause  So somehow they would probably want to collect the money that would count that damage and remediate it  I don't know if this is the vehicle for it  But they're swinging for the fences as far as this vehicle is concerned to try to get a number that's high enough and realistically if they  Got a number that's high enough that you had

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's do a pool if  Let's presume that Twitter wins and Musk gets away Musk has to pay them out  It may come out of Chancery make him out of a settlement. What number do you think might be each of you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I should I should point out and you brought this up Kathy the precedent for this  Is that earlier Tyson foods case where they tried to back out of a purchase of the Iowa?  pork producers IBP  This is in 2003 and the Chancery Court said no, you can't back out. You've got to buy them and  It's not exactly analogous. I hope that doesn't happen here. Well, it's not exactly analogous, but it's  Similar and by the way Tyson did a lot of damage in the process  You know chasing off other bidders like Smithfield who also wanted them  So IBP had a pretty good cause in this case to say hey, you know  You you really damaged us and they were Tyson was forced to buy him  So that is I think that's what Twitter is saying is this is like Tyson there there isn't a material adverse effect  Elon remember Elon publicly has said the problem is the five that the Twitter's figure of five percent spam bots is way low  That's not what he what his lawyers scat and Arps said in their complaint against Twitter in there and their request to back out of the deal  They said that Twitter was non cooperative  And Twitter saying what do you mean non cooperative a word and B?  We didn't have to be we were more cooperative than we even had to be because this was a no-due diligence deal

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, so they gave him a whole bunch of didn't they give him the fire hose  And

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Elon claimed it was rate limited and that was a problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There were claims and they raised the late the rate I think to something that was like completely unprecedented

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm gonna quote Andrew Torres from the opening arguments pockets. They did three whole episodes on this  Quite good and quite interesting going back to the origin of it. But  Andrew who and this is kind of in his in his bailiwick  He  He did talk about the Tyson case, that's how I know about it  He pointed out that  Problem that the court may decide and should probably decide  That because Twitter did not have to give Elon anything  It's re was reasonable not to give him anything because the fear would be that Elon would then use that information  against Twitter or tweet it  That it was in effect if this is the analogy they used if you bought a house as is and  Then a day before closing said to the seller. Oh and I want to inspect the roof  The seller would be within their rights to say no  Yeah, because you said a you were gonna buy it as is you wave that right?  But furthermore that gives you ammunition if you go inspect the roof and you find something or you damage the roof  It's only to the sellers disadvantage to give you that information  So the fact that Twitter cooperated at all, I think their lawyers are gonna make the case  We went above and beyond our requirements. We were not required to give them anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Butters behavior at this point reads like okay either it reads that they were really really really desperate to close it  that's what it looks like right because it also reads as  They were they knew this day would come and they wanted to make sure that when this lawsuit got filed they were in the best  position possible  Yeah, it would be there within the rights to say no  But then you have to litigate it and the fact that they gave him everything they went above and beyond to give him stuff  His ability to say no, I didn't know enough is you know, they're pulling the air out of that. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's all negotiation. Yeah, but I have to say

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We really come to a point in this country where  These trollish billionaires seem like they can get away with anything and do anything they want and it really maybe is time to say  No, no, you have legal obligations. You have to fulfill. I don't I think every Williams is completely wrong  You know his tweet was  I'm you know, if I were on the board, I'd be asking if we could just let this whole ugly episode blow over  No, you can't he's really injured the company

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Very interesting and I I'm trying not to be conspiracy minded here, but both evan Jack

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  both were very pro Elon here and  I feel like this somebody said it's maybe it's the case that that explains why Jack left abruptly put in Agrawal  Arguably not a great choice for CEO at Twitter because he anticipated this and he wanted this to happen  He wanted Twitter to be sold to Elon  And that's why he was pushing this all along  Here's the only real question to me. It's pretty apparent to me  That Elon's in the wrong Twitter's got a very strong case here. They should win  But Kathy what happens if they do win the court says no Elon you have to buy it and he says yeah, but all of this is  Contingent on loans from a bunch of other third parties. Can he be forced to somehow fulfill that?  I don't know. I think the play here is to and to possibly everyone's satisfaction

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The question is what the dollar amount is is that it in lieu of the specific performance?  What would be the damage that would be calculated? Some of that should go to the shareholders, right?  potentially

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Into the

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Company I mean, yeah, and this is so annoying because it's pressing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's it's a lot of legal pieces in motion to which the company is going to be able to do that  A lot of legal pieces in motion to which there's answers but a lot of us who don't practice this every day don't know  There was an answer over here and an answer over here. So there's a lot of threads of what happens  What if they do get a money judgment from him in some way?  How do you enforce it against what do you enforce it?  Like this is a very geeky moment in time  but it's also really annoying to show up as a legal expert on a show and not have all the answers because  There's a lot of interesting questions out there. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We love your humility

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Times like this, it's so glad I went to law school but um

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's times like this I'm so glad I didn't yeah, I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wish it gave me more x-ray vision and it's kind of you know, it's exciting to see it play out except  I'm upset about this. This is not a company. I don't care about this is not people. I don't care about yes  I really like what Jeff said and I'm inclined to agree. I think the best outcome for Twitter is  Get this get this out of the way extract as much cash as you can  Which I think really should be more than at least a single billion  But I don't know how many other billions it should be for a just result  somehow inject them into the company get rid of its current board and  Get good people who believe in the company back on board who can retain the talent and go forth and be a really innovative  And civically minded company that it's been I mean  Twitter has been a really good neighbor in the areas of law that I care about and free speech  They stand up for their users. They push back against abusive subpoenas. They're pushing back against  Sensorial behavior in India like this company has been a really good neighbor and I want them to succeed and I think we're all kind  Of screwed if they don't so this there's a certain bit where there's like some interesting shade and for let's get the popcorn  Except I care too much about this company and what happens and this really interesting medium that they've developed  So I want the result and I'm rooting for the result and it's contorting my legal analysis to get the result  But as a lawyer, I'm also an advocate. So what do I need to push on to get that?  I don't think it's beyond the realm of possibility that Twitter can win Twitter can win with money  Twitter can win with an award of money that somehow they can enforce and then they can go on with their lives  However, that's a real that's a bunch of really small eyes of needles that they need to thread an awful lot through and the only  Thing that makes the popcorn eating a little bit more palatable is this will start to happen more quickly than a normal simple trial would  If the ex if the motion to expedite is granted  Cut off the presses a colleague said they recently turned down one motion to expedite  But that may have been because it was at the beginning of the pandemic  So can't quite read the tea leaves there the motion  Different case and this one, you know reading their motion was compelling now also all of this analysis needs to put a giant asterisk of  We have not seen what Musk would like to defend himself with and he gets to and scattin-arps is not a bunch of stupid lawyers  like they know how to write a pleading so something will come and  We can see what defense they he he he provides  Which you know and then we can go analyze this again  but people are wondering because so much of this has happened in public like what could he possibly say to defend his you know what he's  done here and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The only bad thing about all this is we're gonna hear a lot more Elon Musk Twitter  Yeah news over the last next year unfortunately, I was hoping  Let's move on from that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know it's not a democracy. Can I ask question first?  Oh  It looks so sad. I'm gonna ask a question  I would I would like to hear is Kathy started on this path  I'd like to hear if you if you're the new chairman of the board and the new board member of Twitter new CEO Twitter  What do you do now? Do you look for a purchaser? That's question one question two is  Whoever does a deal with Elon Musk again in life. What happens to him in business?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, I don't think Twitter would have talked to him

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They knew exactly what was coming up because he'd already gotten in trouble with the SEC for pretending that he was gonna take  Tesla private Twitter knew exactly who they were dealing with. I don't think they wanted to do this, but what choice did they have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's tricky. I mean a key term that I've not used yet, but it's really important for all this analysis  The idea of fiduciary duties and who has them and to whom do they have them and that there's fiduciary duties to the companies to the shareholders  Elon Musk arguably had some fiduciary duties during the pendency of this duty and of this  Transaction and one of the arguments that that they made in the pleading is that he basically breached it because he wasn't giving consent  So they could do the things that it would take to retain the talent  And  That's a big thing that you have to follow with  You know did the people currently in power do what they should have been doing as to protect them the company to protect the other  Shareholders and the answer is they may have been between a rock and a hard place and they did what you know a reasonable thing  But you might want other people initially they adopted a poison pill

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They said they were gonna adopt a poison pill  They yeah, they tried to and then they just finally for some reason just threw up their hands and said well  No one else is gonna buy us. Maybe he's not completely full of you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah  Well if somebody's offering you a lot of money more than you know somebody offers to buy your house for more than it's worth  How do you it's a tricky thing to then say no to that and there's a question of whether you're actually  Within your fiduciary duties to say no to that  That's tricky because the problem is is you will free money  You know that you should say yes except it was free money with this huge anchor around it where  Free money unless you lose the entire company in the process of pursuing it in which case and maybe there was enough writing on  The wall that they really should have said this is not free  This is like too good to be true and we cannot possibly say yes to it because it's gonna break the company if we if we  Try to do this, but I don't know you know hindsight 2020 etc, but I don't know  You know the problem is is the company is capitalized in a not particularly strong position  And getting it to a position where it is strong and can't just be swallowed up by somebody else  Who has the cash in hand it doesn't really care about the company?  That's a thing that could happen  Although that's what I'm going to ask here is let's say let's say you've got

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Three billion more dollars you're rid of Musk  What's the strategy for Twitter going forward?  Imagine we're past chance right now. We're past all this I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think some of it is what is its business plan and what is its path to profitability and what is its monetary?  realization plan and how do you take what's what works best about Twitter and expand it and expand it in a complete in a  Increasingly hostile regulatory environment. This is a tough company to drive  But it's also incredibly exciting about what it can do and if it's not the runway to succeed  This is tricky. It's a public company. So it's got different things holding it back and different duties and obligations  It's regulated in different ways. But on the other hand some of that regulation should have protected Twitter much better than it has so far

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I say I don't know this is a sweet. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't necessarily have a problem with  You know as an engineer being CEO  I kind of like that the problem is is the moment in time was it really needed somebody who might have had more of  the corporate savvy to navigate this but in terms of rebuilding Twitter  He might actually be the guy. Let's face it. It's the board is the issue here

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The board by the way does not have a lot of dog in this hunt  They're not big shareholders as Musk has pointed out. So their fiduciary responsibility is to the shareholders  That's an Evan Jack are off the board. Yeah, it's interesting that Evan Jack both have big opinions about this  I think I would I would say  The issue really was it's do or die for Twitter that this is this guy  ultimately is the white knight they needed because  No one else would buy it. That's been on for sale for a long time. Nobody else is gonna buy it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He was a wolf and sweet and she right. Oh, they wasn't ideal. They knew that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh and the sheep's clothing was threadbare. Yeah, they knew it and they and I think that they said this is our last shot guys  that's clearly what Jack Dorsey thought and  this is we you know, take it or leave it and  I don't know what Elon was thinking whether he ever really wanted it  It's my I don't think I don't think he understood what was valuable about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean he rails at things that are actually good about it  And he he doesn't seem to understand a lot of the issues including the things he doesn't like about it  Like he really doesn't have a lot of understanding about what the business was  He was trying to buy his way into well

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there's a cost of Twitter because it's I mean they've lost staff  In fact, I have a story here somewhere that the Twitter's Twitter is to completely demoralized by this

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, they also fired to with what I don't understand is is cave on  I'm bringing his last name was the head of product is  Brilliant and they fired him and I'm not sure why they fired two top executives  I don't get that and that's one of bus argument by the way was oh you're tearing the company apart before I buy it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've you've you've fired key employees this point. He's just throwing everything against the worst. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Little bit more traction than most of the things he wants to say. I don't think the bot thing has traction  I don't think they're not giving him information as traction that I think is a defensible thing  you know managing the human resources, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Materially adverse that's by the way, that's the the term that you know, they've got to demonstrate  That's what happened in Tyson versus IBP versus Tyson  It has the court decided that the things that had gone on at IBP were not materially adverse and  As a result the merger agreement had to go through Tyson said oh no. No, there's their prices gone down  There's all sorts of terrible things happening in the court said no, it's not enough

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is not tend to think that along could have negotiated for more  like if he wanted to lock things down in place, he probably could have asked for more and  Instead he sort of negotiated agreement that gave the company latitude to continue to run itself and it did continue to run itself  And it's not clear that the personnel changes are out of line with a company running itself  Which typically like you kind of have some discretion to run yourself  Where shareholders can't come after you for you ran your you ran the company this way and I object  so I you know, it's  It holds water that he could complain about that  But I don't necessarily know if it's gonna win the day and a lot of this stuff is like it's not like it's never happened  before a lot of these terms were  Standard and the Chancery Court has seen them before and knows how to adjudicate them and there's some precedent that they can they can turn to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What happens to Twitter now?  That's my question, yeah, that's that's really what we care about right unless you're a shareholder right? Right? I  Know value has nothing to do with any of this. It's the people who post. Yeah, it's us  Will we continue to post to Twitter? Why wouldn't we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, I didn't like the idea of posting to Twitter if if Ilan owned it that felt like a different  Proposition than what I bargained for but

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did leave most people just said well, let's see what happens right people leave all the time  Yeah, Mike Isaac, I think quit and came back and yeah  but  so  Honestly, the value of Twitter has nothing to do with as long as they can keep the servers running, right?  It has nothing to do with the company has everything to do with who's on it and who toasts to it  Assuming that nothing that happens in all of this  Brings the servers to their knees

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If it becomes a protocol  If you go to the blue sky, I mean you're gonna still tweet Jeff  I know you are I'm gonna tweet and and I think that if it does become a protocol and you can build things on  Top of it WordPress like it could be the conversational WordPress  It could it could grow much much bigger if it goes back to even better than an API  The protocol ability to build things on top of it businesses on top of it, I think there's ways to make that happen  it's not easy it's not it's not clear and obvious how to do that, but I do think there is a  Different strategy to be had

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Are you basically saying they need to reinvent themselves because at the core that's not what Twitter was all about  I don't think they have to change the thing. They have to keep the servers running  Just keep the servers up so we can have those really quick bursts of communication with people we care about or Twitter is what we say

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Twitter is what we say it is aside from features like Twitter blue or the edit button none of which really  Oh, which is de minimis Twitter is what is what it's is is made of people like silent green  And if the people still tweet and the people still go there to read it as long as they can keep the servers going  Mm-hmm. I mean that may be a question because I don't know how they more than that though

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because then you also get into content moderation and things like that. So one of the things is whether  Twitter is multiple things at once all rolled into a company like all the social media companies are both  Infrastructure and application at the same time and one of the things that I think makes sense and Twitter is probably further ahead  And thinking about this than any of the other  companies because of the blue sky is that Twitter functioning as essentially almost platform infrastructure for other people to  then deploy for their own communities and their own content and their own distribution of like  240 character tweets or whatever whatever they end up called where you divorce a little bit the  Hardware and saw, you know  The really embedded infrastructure parts of what Twitter is from the content that sits on top of it that may be inevitable anyway  just because of the regulatory I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Think that there are to be honest, we're gonna take a break a second and unfreeze Kathy  But I think there would we have to take a break anyway, but I think there are to be honest  Maybe ways to handle this issue of server and moderation all the expenses of Twitter in maybe a better way than a monolithic Twitter  Mastodon handles easily handles moderation issues. Maybe there is a way for Twitter to self moderate

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know or choice moderate that I get my Twitter you get your Twitter, right?  Different Twitter's and I hire I hire and my Twitter and pay him for that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, are you just unfollowing block people that you don't like and then your Twitter is just what you want it to be  I think it's completely doable. So I don't think this might be actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Salutary for Twitter in the long run. That's my argument. I think this is it was a bad that they got schmutz by him at all  well, but if they can get rid of him and get some money and  And

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he gives him because I'm pretty he's got 21 billion that he's at a pocket  He gives him 21 billion, which I could see the court saying well  We can't force your lenders to give you anything, but you your 21 billion is good still give him 21 billion  That's enough. That's enough to run Twitter for a long time. Oh, yeah  Five billion ten billion anything quite good

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That you buy the argument that Yahoo made that he that he he did all of this so he could cash out more Tesla stock

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was a very that wasn't actually did not come from Yahoo. Yahoo had the story the story. Yeah, but  Was it Matt Levine I can't remember but somebody clever said Elon had was at a  Point in time where he had to sell stock or lose it and he needed a way to do this  That had a cover  so I  Thought that was kind of clever. This is  One 20 Henry Blodgett said this it was Henry said that  Blodgett said this so this is a tweet from Henry Blodgett  He said that Musk's 10-year Tesla options were about to expire so he had to sell them the Twitter bid  allowed him to do that without facing questions about why he was selling and  Incidentally, he sold at an excellent price now Henry Blodgett is pretty sharp  Hmm. He definitely is and he knows the market and he knows the ways of  marketeers, so  Maybe maybe that's what happened

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He could have done a better job and just walked away with a billion cost for doing that and not with right and 20 billion

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want him to be slapped silly personally. I but that's completely an emotional. That's not a legal judge Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just an emotional file a friend of the court brief

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well, my legal analysis is is being tinted by the same sentiment. So which is a danger  I want to put up all the asterisk for  You know, I it does not feel like justice is getting served if he could just hit and run like this and run away  I want to I want to feel as a citizen of this planet that law can prevent this sort of thing  And I know that law is built to prevent this sort of thing  So I'd like to see it actually flex its muscle and do its job and down with this sort of thing and that there's actually  Remedy that law can deliver to somebody who got hurt by this sort of behavior  well

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and there's there's a real argument that we need that to be because if this is what the SEC's job by the way is to  preserve faith in the markets and and the number one job of the SEC is to  Make sure that any investor feels like they have all the information  That any other investor has so that they can make an intelligent decision to buying a stock  Investors will abandon the stock market if they feel like it's it's rigged and there's an inside, you know  Group of people that knows what's going on  That's the SEC's entire point of its existence because otherwise the markets don't work. You have to feel like it's a fair market  This is the kind of thing that makes people say that's it. I'm not I'm not buying stock anymore  so it's really important that this this be solved and that people be made whole and  That this kind of behavior is sanctioned in such a way that it doesn't keep happening  You don't want somebody else to do this

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Twitter being made hold is whole is one thing but the SEC stepping up and doing what they should do is a whole other things  They're punishment. Yes. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One to punch. We'll see if that happens. It's it's also part affected Tesla too. Yeah, like that theory is correct  And stuff, you know, he's got a lot of equity in a lot of positions and he was mushing them around so  And possibly not in the way in the transparent way that it's supposed to happen

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's in a way the point of any court to is to preserve our faith in the rule of law  You know  If you if you go to a country I use Egypt as an example because I have some direct experience there where  You can you can do something because you know somebody in the government or you pay the right bribes  It undermines everybody's faith in the fairness the essential fairness in the rule of law and as soon as that starts to crumble it all comes  Tumbling down. That's why Trump needs to be  Taken to task it's why Elon needs to be taken a task if we want this country to continue to operate if we want our social  Contract to continue it requires that the institutions act in such a way that our trust is preserved  That's what the courts do. That's what the SEC does. That's what government does  So it's that's really the stakes of this if you ask me it's not yeah  I hate stupid billionaires and they're jerky jerk jerks, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would like to amend that please. Yes plus one amen  Exactly and and all the forms that that you've just described like we need to see that law actually works  Yes, and that it works for bad actors because otherwise  Where are we? What defense do we have? What are we proud of?  How do we understand our society to function and what do we believe in so that you know  We don't just feel like it's you know, pure power pure violence. That is how our society is structured  We think we're better than that and I'd like to but you know now the rivers hits the road  We need law to show us that we are better than that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  yeah, and I can and there's example after example of countries where that has failed and  They become failing countries. It's not a good look  Let's take a little break Kathy. Yes, so glad to have you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You might be interested to know that according to NASA the  the  the asteroid Bennu be NNU is  Its surface is close to a plastic ball pit. You might be interested in know that this is interesting  And they were puzzled because back in 2020 the OSIRIS  Spacecraft was supposed to land on Bennu. You may remember this an asteroid 200 million miles from the earth  collect a small sample and come back  But when the spacecraft started to go down I realized it would have sunk into Bennu had it not  Fired its thrusters to back away immediately after it grabbed the dust and rock  It was starting to sink into the it turns out the particles making up Bennu's exterior are so loosely packed and lightly bound to each other  That if a person were to step out on the Bennu they would feel very little resistance as if  Stepping into a pit of plastic balls that are popular play areas for kids  Thanks for the explanation. Yeah, the ball pit. No, that's it. That's how deep

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How deep well they didn't say that like how it's like if it only goes up to your knees  Okay, fine. If it's a little bit higher than that you can have a quick say. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I  Mean atmosphere may also be a problem. So you may have other issues, but that sounds like an issue unto itself

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, yeah, I mean they don't I wish they would say you know, how deep would you sink how deep is your ball pit?  Deep is your ball pit. I really want to know

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Plus when it took off, did it need the resistance of taking off from the asteroid?  Imagine the flying ball pit balls from the ball pit  Did it just scatter the whole damn thing? It ruined the asteroid?  I don't know they made a mess on Bennu  You've ruined that asteroid

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It will run into Elon's Tesla in space

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Alright back to work you guys  Unlike unlike the Twitter employees who apparently have completely lost all  their mojo  Twitter's according to Wired magazine as Elon walks Twitter employees say no one's in charge  They're fed up  About being kept in the dark one Twitter employees said Twitter is a poop show internally  I can confirm that for you right now without a doubt talking of word  There's no strong leadership at the moment says a second Twitter staffer also speaking anonymously the entire company's running on autopilot  What do you expect them to do right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've been at companies during a transition like this and oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What is the exact date on that because I wonder if it's a  Predates the the I wonder what's yesterday the effect of morale yesterday  So does that incorporate the aftermath of the litigation being filed like a bunch of  I think that there's gonna be like an uptick and like okay. There's a meaning. There's a purpose something although it's shooting for  Purchase which may not actually enthuse most of the Twitter employees, but it's it's Twitter fighting back  So they knew in fact it had according to Wired we we've been told nothing about Twitter employees

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've been told nothing by senior management internal communications about the latest developments have been limited to a message pointing users to a tweet  By a company chair Brett Taylor who said we're gonna sue this was so it was prior to them filing the suit  But they did say we plan to pursue legal action in the Chancery court  Employees have been asked not to add their own comments to that post  One employee says every time I find out something about Twitter. I found out on Twitter. I  Find out about the musk news via friends not through my own company, which has been a consistent issue from the beginning  liner

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The tricky thing is that's actually you know from the lawyer perspective  That's good like you kind of want that information  Discipline because you don't want and this is kind of musk has used this before we're wayward Twitter people have said things have vented  And he's wanted to use it against the whole company  Which kind of puts the employees in this really impossible bind because kind of to do your job you need to be able to talk  Around the water cooler  But the problem is is the water cooler is discoverable and it can mess up the litigation position of the of the company  It shouldn't matter but it ends up mattering because it creates optics and things like that  So this is tough and it isn't just Twitter that has this problem like any company  with employees  Especially a lot of employees some of whom may not be having a good day and and they say things and if those things are ever  Found and sometimes they might have to be found it can create problems  But not letting employees know stuff or talk about stuff also creates problems  So I don't know what the path through is  This is a really unfortunate bind that companies can actually be in today a famous short seller

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  aptly named Hindenburg research I  Bet your blimp is gonna crash I think so  But they didn't buy they didn't short Twitter they they went long on Twitter  Which has actually boosted Twitter shorty Neelon. They said exactly that  We've accumulated significant long position and shares of Twitter Twitter's complaint poses a credible threat to Musk's Empire  Where did they say that the whole empire on Twitter?  Twitter on Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That I don't think that's beyond the this is rose-covered glasses for how I want justice to play out  But if they are able to somehow extract leverage for money from Musk, where does he get the money from?  And that I think puts his empire at risk  Because he's not he has you know huge amount in terms of assets and capitalization as overall net worth  But it's not all liquid and so what tons of debt against it already

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm dead instead and here's an important number  Bloomberg I think estimated that if Tesla shares went down below 725  You know he borrowed on margin that he the margin would be called and the Tesla is now at 711

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If he has to liquidate then he's gonna flood the market which is also gonna drop money further  So he's also in in a position of losing whatever control he has over his other companies as he divests

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well and that just shows you that Elon is not the genius  Some seem to think he is this has really been not just bad for Twitter but bad for Elon and all of his holdings, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean he tried to buy a business. He didn't really understand  That's not a good move under the best of certain and then lost his you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  confidence and

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you tend to be a little more positive on the one that we do

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I stay I still say that he was potentially  Buying Twitter to put other folks in place to help it be a more successful business not necessarily him  Doing all of the stuff that's going to change it  but putting the other people in place similar to how it is with SpaceX and so forth because  Those those rockets doing whatever they're doing and then to do with his brain my penis is the team  It's all of the other scientists that he helped put in place  Clearly he's done a good job stuff done of that and I figured that's what he would have done with Twitter  But most people don't really care for that opinion

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, so it's an interesting opinion, but I wonder I don't think he understands the business enough to know who is qualified to run it  So I think I think that might almost be easier with SpaceX cuz like did you did you build a rocket and did it go up?  In space. Okay, you might be qualified  But it might be easier to vet expertise for something where the science is a little bit more straightforward  Whereas Twitter is messy  this is humanity and human beings are messy and  Even the people who are expert at it are sort of you know  Trying to figure out everything that's going on and I and just his attitude in terms of his  Misapprehensions about how things work how the law respected more Twitter works. It's just yeah  Okay, so he would put in a qualified team that sounds great  But I'm not sure he'd be able to come up with one because I don't think he knows what one looks like and is able  To evaluate the qualifications. So under even if he meant well his ability to pull this off. I think is dubious

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of I mean that's actually  Part of the problem with Twitter is nobody's ever done this before there is no you can't even look at Facebook and say oh  Yeah, we'll just copy their string. No Twitter is absolutely a unique business. It's not anything we've ever seen before

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But there's some acuity that you can still demonstrate  And you know also there have been people who've been building it for a while and you know, there's there is some expertise  That's built and certain ways of so it's all at Twitter ironically  Yeah, so they they really need to not lose the the knowledge base so much  although there have been generations of leadership that I think have made missteps but  Twitter is an interesting company with an interesting corporate soul  And I think the thing that makes me root for them is hoping that they can keep that the bit that really sort of understood  How they were idealizing free speech as an as a normative value  And I know they get criticized for like well you kick somebody off. How can how can that be pro free speech?  But ultimately I think they are in a number of ways including as I said like the way they back up their user speech raids  Protect anonymous users, you know how they even deployed their legal team which was under the guidance of a Mac originally  I think like there's some really good stuff some Twitter's got an excellent legacy  And so if they can value that and build up around that that core that soul  That's kind of been the running theme throughout its entire history  I think they stand a chance, but I don't think that's what I don't think he even recognizes that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The closest company  Leo I think is WordPress  well

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ev Williams who founded Twitter left and blogger before that before that odio a first blogger then odio  Which was a podcast platform kind of I know about it because we were on it  It was too early and it maybe wasn't quite the right idea  He very famously gave all the investors money back which is unheard of in Silicon Valley  founded  after that found a Twitter  Left over co-founded with with Jack and another guy whose name never gets me Ringo. Yeah  This came later there was another guy who says I invented it on the swing  Jason or something anyway, come on chat room. See that's that room this guy, you know  No, it's like ass. No. Yeah, no glass was a dog last no glass and he even came up with the name Twitter  Yeah, no, he's the Twitter is that odio? Anyway, I  Know because I was there. I remember I was in the park. They were swinging  No, I know because they stole my name is how I know yeah  He said he said it was great we asked him on our show about inside the net we're interviewing and he said well  He said yeah, I knew about to it, but I didn't think either of us were going anywhere. So what the hell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Anyway, I did find it interesting in the complaint. They capitalized the word tweet and  From a lawyer perspective that was fascinating. They're not using they're not risking generic side of their own  Corporate names that tweet was capitalized in every instance that they used it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just thought that was an interesting at one point and I kind of Google consider this an admission of if not guilt  guilty conscience they  Decided to get everybody to call it a tweet not a twit  there was for a while people were calling him twits and  They they they trademark tweet and they said please call it a tweet  So even if it had nothing to do with me I I took it maybe you could have gotten some money out of them

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Anyway as Jammer be laughs in the background

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, I have who then left Twitter and founded medium  After five years running Twitter  medium a publishing platform in 2012  That was and I didn't remember this the name comes from the fact partly comes the fact that it's in between a  Full-length blog post and a tweet. It's a medium-length  post  Has now stepped down on Tuesday a month short of ten years  Williams is giving up. He is going to move upstairs become chairman. He will be replaced which is interesting  Effective July 20th just a few days from now  By the chief executive of the online coaching company coach dot me  Tony stubblebine they have a history together

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The name is double by familiar. I feel like it's in the story the time story he

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's been he's been around Casey Newton and platformer  Writing also about this I  You know  basically, I think the the conclusion that Casey makes and a lot of makes a lot of people make is that  Medium could have been sub stack  But but somehow missed the boat and of course it went through several famous pivots  And and a former employee noted this is Casey writing that for all the pivots over the years Williams always seemed a step behind  Quote I'd say you could describe the Ev era of medium as a series of digital publishing experiments that often felt of the zeitgeist  Without ever defining it a lot of the work medium did over the years  Genuinely had an impact. I know you publish on medium Jeff  But it often felt for whatever reason like Ev made it a point not to lean into this work  He meandered and never said I think that's a bit unfair. I think that the two things I think that that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Medium had an impact on so many other publishing platforms. It set a standard for typography ease of use  was he wig beauty and so on  He had a vision for the god  I'm gonna say the word platisher to be a publisher in a platform at the same time and figure that out which he which he didn't  And the problem always was trying to figure out the business model for content now in a world where everyone can speak see Twitter discussion  If speech itself has become the commodity, you know, it's no longer a special thing to write  It's no longer a special thing to be able to publish everybody can do it. That's the beauty of the internet  How do you then make something on top of that? And I think that he was the one hand wanted to be  Judgmental but not to judge metal. He wanted to be a platform anybody can publish here, but then will will elevate the good stuff  I think that's exactly what the web needs  He just unfortunately figured out that he was a good person  Exactly what the web needs he just unfortunately didn't figure it out yet. It didn't figure out he went from having  Native advertising to advertising to no advertising to the membership plan and he never hit on the business  Ball that was gonna make successful by the way stumble mine was lead engineer a VP of engineering at Odeo

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's where I know the name. I remember Tony. He also  wrote the  for O'Reilly  wrote the the pearl handbook  Of course, I'm sorry the regular expression handbook. So the guy's a geek. He's a total total geek  He the regular expression pocket reference  And he's a pearl programmer. So that's an interesting choice. It almost feels like evs like saying, okay fine you do this

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've lost my mojo here and I was gonna start a laboratory and I you know  Change the world a couple bloggers bloggers before there was WordPress  Yeah, really set the tone. It really been really made it popular made it possible Twitter  We've been talking about for an hour and a half now. It's changed the world medium  Not as much as the first two but still had impact  I don't know anyone who has had much impact so you serially as a Williams and yet I you know the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's fair the plane that you're absolutely fair  Is that he never could figure out a way to make medium work five bucks a month didn't do it  He just couldn't quite and that's by the way, those are hard things to do  So that's and again given his success as you point out with blogger and Twitter  And you know to some degree medium inspired a lot of people

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He deserves some credit. So I agree with you. He turned and I have this conversation with him. He turned  Rather adamantly against advertising he first wanted to reform advertising  He thought he had a way to fix advertising make it more relevant make it less less  Intrusive make it decent and and he couldn't make that happen probably because he didn't have the scale to do it  An advertiser is just stupid and all they want is scale even though that's that's passé  So that he gave up on it and tried to come up with a way to get the money from the people and all God's children  Have paywalls now, so that's not the work. Yeah, I think there's a there's a future  This is my blue sky rant, but I think there's a future in a curatorial layer as a premium layer  And I don't know where that goes. I don't know exactly what that means  But I think there's we're we're at the very beginning. It's only  1480 and Gutenberg years

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I have an update for you on one of your favorite topics  Ancillary copyright  Copyright

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's the and we should do a segment it's the ancillary copyright time no no no

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think we should make it a segment because the news actually on this unusually sit down, you know  Fasten your seatbelt. The news is kind of good  Which is that the Copyright Office was considering whether ancillary copyright was an appropriate remedy for  Fixing whatever ails the news and they decided no, this is not a job for a copyright law  And so and they I haven't fully digested the the report that they issued which I think came out last week  But some commentators found that it was so persuasive that hopefully it takes the wind out of the sails of anything that Congress was  Trying to think of doing that. This was just an extra layer  Not appropriately tailored for all the competing interests and just not a good idea and they're like this is not the place for copyright  And so they recommended that the copyright law does not get dragged into doing this  So hopefully maybe at least in American law they let's not make this a feature because maybe this is something that we can never speak

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of again, I am gonna regret asking this

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Set the clock now, let's see how long we should I can go what is what are we talking? What is ancillary?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Copyright right for those who didn't tune in for the other show where we spent half the show talking about it  Although you were there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm asking for a friend understand

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ancillary copyright was essentially we're talking link taxes and the question is how were you  Could you sort of enforce that if a social media platform allowed users to link to other or search engines?  I or yeah a platform of some form  Linked to a source of news somewhere else that could that source that you ended up at  Somehow charge you for the right of having a link on your site to their site  And what's the leverage that you would use to do that?  And let's think about whether copyright is the lever ancillary copy was is  Copyright law the leverage to force a payment of some form and so the Copyright Office said no  Copyright law should not be the thing that that causes that to happen  Whether somebody tries another mechanism, but I'm not quite sure whether there are mechanisms and an American law would be available to them  But other nations in the world think this is a perfectly good idea  Even though it isn't and are still trying to have their own link tax proposals where if a platform  Allows a user to link to a new site somehow the platform has to pay for the privilege even though this gives the platforms  Audiences and they need audience they're not making any money if they have audiences

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is the this is the cue the reggae beat laced with Shuttrack it was the Spanish link tax it is the new  Legislation articles 15 and 17 in the EU  And it kind of informed the Australian thing too  But the other part of this is it's not just about this idea that you took my you took my headline and linked to me  You stole from me. You gave me nothing which is a ridiculous economic argument that publishers try to make because they're so desperate  Because they've done nothing the other part of this it was an effort  It is an S an effort to resurrect the hot what so-called hot news doctrine  Which was an effort at the beginning of radio and then again more recently to say oh if it's my story if I got the story  You can't report it over a certain amount of time well that's contrary to everything about copyright copyright says you cannot own the information  You can own only the treatment of it, so if you know that  Hindenburg is selling long buying long on Twitter  That's a fact now if I explain it particularly brilliantly you take my explanation yes  I can go to you for copyright, but the fact you can't  However the Associated Press was trying to say no no no no no if that's our story we get to keep it for so many hours  They tried to prevent radio from even talking about news for 12 to 24 hours  Say the newspapers and the wire services owned that first and it was an unfair  Acquisition of their value and then a P and company tried to resurrect this again recently  Without success and this copyright effort on the effort of publishers was a similar effort to do that and I'm I like Kathy  I applaud the Copyright Office

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it was a good ruling and it quoted me well in the report  For whoever's putting together my laminated card we can throw that on

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, that's a good one  cited by the past

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's always I got cited in a congressional research service report  You know it's always nice of like you win by showing up  And it's always kind of nice like if all this work that I've been doing like speaking to the record actually like you know  Makes a difference and it may be like there even reports that nobody else will ever read ever ever again  But my name is now etched in history so capital documents. It's God's work, and we thank you  Thank you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  moving on from ancillary copyright to Google oh  Yeah, this show  Week in ancillary copyright although

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's a walker in Leicester

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sundar Pichai sent out a memo to employees  That boy you know it's hard to imagine Google in hard times, right?  The uncertain he wrote global economic outlook has been top of mind like all companies were not immune to economic  headwinds  So he says I want you  To work harder  We we are going to slow down our hiring process slowing the pace still higher for the rest of the year yeah  But we'll focus on engineering technical and other critical roles and make sure the great talent  We do hire is aligned with our long-term priorities. You mean you weren't doing that before okay fine, but moving forward  Googlers we need to be more  Entrepreneurial working with greater urgency  Sharper focus and more hunger than we've shown on sunnier days  Say how do you be entrepreneurial in a company that size?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm just glad to hear him say focus because I tell you that's been his problem from day one Google is  D and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Focus is all they need it's all they need well, but the focus you're looking for is a greater company focus  Yes, all this is gonna. Do is make everybody focus harder on the thing the one thing they're doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hey, it's a star. He's planting the seed. That's that's all I'm asking he's planting

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think he just wants the work grants to work a little bit harder

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's the shame for like again what was good about Google at the outset like they were encouraging  What was it the 20% of your work week was like doing something that wasn't your job  I mean it's partly why the Google was doing so many things because it was producing a whole lot of cool stuff  So like gmail yeah  Exactly so like you kind of would want that back, but you kind of you don't get that by cracking the whip

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But but put yourself in the in the position of an everyday Googler receiving that memo  What is the takeaway? What are you what's your action item now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean the way to me is like is like yeah, some of the snacks are going away  Yeah, like there's a whole lot of language in that like be hungry. Well, we're taking away your snacks

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know that nine-hour workday, how about 20?  We didn't mention we should have mentioned Twitter played a big part in yesterday's January 6th  hearing  They had a Twitter Twitter whistleblower with a deep voice  Obscured personality talking about  Particularly about Trump getting special treatment at Twitter  The employee whose identity was kept secrets was a certain the content moderation team in 2020 and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He said if former president Donald Trump or any other user on Twitter  He would have been permanently suspended a very long time ago

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hmm that's a very good rendition I can I can

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wear my face, but I can I  Can I can do that  Apparently people at Twitter were alarmed  by the response to Trump's call for the proud boys at the debate to stand back and  Standby  When the Twitter employees said my concern was that the former president for seemingly the first time was speaking directly to extremist organizations and giving them  directives  On the social network users responded as if it were a call to arms  It felt as if a mob was being organized and they were gathering together their weaponry and their logic and their reasoning  Behind why they were prepared to fight?  So they're seeing all these tweets in response to what the president said at the debate and then of course be there be wild  Which was December 2020?  According to the Twitter inside of the responses in the social network alone  Were enough to suggest there was a potential for violence  But what let's think back

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's at the debate the campaign is on if Twitter had come out and and shut down Donald Trump's account  No way there's no way so what it what it what about will be wild how about December 19th?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's already been even that you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  January 6 was when it became safe to do it up and before that I think it was nigh unto impossible

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The the employee said the night before the insurrection  The place said they could barely sleep featuring imminent violence  I was on pins and needles because again for months  I had been begging and anticipating attempting to raise the reality that if we made no intervention  Into what I saw occurring people were going to die  On January 5th, I realized no intervention was coming

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is there another person on the Twitter staff that could  Say the same thing that this this person was saying about the incident. This is you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was just someone offered grapes. This is offered in testimony and in the January 6th

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why was it anonymous if it's a former employee? I don't understand why it had to be anonymous

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I mean the the the amount of what would fall on this person's head if they were known like I could see  This doesn't strike me as sour grapes where even if there's not unanimity  I think there was probably widespread concern because I think the talking through of  Okay, you're right. This is bad. But what can we do about it? That won't also possibly precipitate a bad move  Like this was a really tough situation  I don't think it's clear that Twitter could have acted in any particular way other than just sort of  choosing the path of least resistance because it was actually wasn't really a default position but as opposed to like you kind of  You were you'd already sort of made the decision longer and you're just kind of continuing it a little bit  but you know, it's  It's a deliberate action even if it wasn't ideal, but it's not clear what deliberate action could have been better

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's the I guess the damning sentence  Quote I believe the Twitter relished in the knowledge that they were also the favorite and most used service of the former president and enjoyed  Having that sort of power within the social media ecosystem

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Clout reads a little bit more like the sour grapes a little bit

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I mean, I think if you're you know, you're at the plot

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's always what you need is right at the platform because you're an important platform. What you need is the smoking gun the email from

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Twitter  Management to him saying do not suspend the president  Yeah, it's too valuable to us or right but there's they didn't offer that at all  It's just it's all it's pretty much hearsay, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He doesn't know so Joe Scarborough was screaming this morning about blaming everything on Twitter and Facebook again  Because it just gives an excuse to it next thing. He'll go after section 230 and Mike bestics head will explode  I know but I'm just Mike's a little more public in his  Living near the edge he's like the guy the guy who fell into Vesuvius  No, I would like to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Masnick has more self-awareness than that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google has offered consensions to  attempt to head off a possible US antitrust lawsuit  And its ad tech businesses according to the Wall Street Journal  Speaking to people familiar with the matter  Speaking to people familiar with the batter  As part of one offer Google has proposed splitting parts of its business that auctions and places still  Under alphabet and apps into separate company under the alphabet umbrella  The entity could be potentially valued to tens of billions of dollars. That's what's so beautiful about these  Divisions, you know, it just increases the overall value  It's not clear the journal says whether any offer  Short of actual asset sales would satisfy the Department of Justice  Where antitrust officials have signaled a preference for deep structural changes to Google's ad tech business if I mean it feels to me  Just looking at on the surface that Google does kind of self-deal in their ad auction where they are the buyer and the seller  You know both broker and even if they didn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You have to ask and you have to wonder and it looks like they've got to yeah. Yeah exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I think ultimately the DOJ's I think they're gonna say yeah, you can't be both pick one and then sell  Do you think they could keep it under alphabet or they'll be forced to sell? No, no, they're gonna eat. That's ridiculous  Alf alphabet does try nice try boys. Yeah, nice try alphabet doesn't report this separately as  Separate companies the alphabet results are the alphabet results  Yeah, I don't I don't think that that would work  Anyway, we'll see so this is this is the negotiation has begun I guess  Any moves the journal says by Google to restructure part of its ad tech business could shake the digital advertising industry  Yes, that seems fair  Advertisers slated to spend more than six hundred billion dollars on digital ads worldwide this year according to eMarketer  Last year Google's business of brokering the sale of ads on other websites and apps  Accounted for thirty one point seven billion dollars of revenue twelve percent of the total  So it's a big part of their ad business

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The question too is how much do they take at each end of the transaction?  It's a double dip to yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do we care about the nothing phone I think they covered that thoroughly  Yesterday and all about Android instance. It will not be available in the US who cares  Who cares we don't care it's nothing to us if it's it's it's not America  Who cares?  Although it's weird these LEDs on the back. It's just it's just weird  That is 299  The nothing phone one. I'm sorry 399 pounds pounds which is 475 USD  Just on sale July 21st. Oh you were talking about money. I thought you were talking about money

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're talking about money. I thought you were talking about the weight of the phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's for 8 gigs of ram and 120 gigs of storage I know phones are getting big these days, but that's heavy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Heavy why is the pound not not equal to the dollar the euro is come on England you're getting it's coming down  Fallen back coming down. Yeah falling behind  Yeah, I don't think we care about the nothing  Phone yeah, do we care about this is in the New York Post?  So I know we don't but it was a great picture of skateboarders  swarming Google's Waymo vehicle  And trashing it on set in San Francisco Saturday night San Francisco is out of control  Yeah, uh-huh  Vehicle was not autonomous according to motherboard at the time of the incident so that means there was somebody inside driving driver managed to get

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Out to safety yeah before the full life feel like this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The beginning of what we're gonna see a lot of don't you think it's my friend Doug Rushkoff's book times throwing rocks at the Google bus  Yeah, I mean as somebody drives an electric vehicle very frequently. There's passive aggressive hostility against electric vehicles people  Park their big trucks in the charging spots they deface and break the chargers. Why do they hate you because it's woke driving  Yeah, you nailed it woke driving and  There's just this thing you know I don't get it either wheel I don't get it actually according to Bloomberg  Electric vehicles have passed the tipping point in the US  five percent of current of new car sales now are  EVs and in other countries where  Adoption has hit five percent. It's be it's it's it's the bottom of the hockey stick  It's when it starts to take off probably the price of gasoline doesn't hurt that either by the way, mr. Musk

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're gonna have lots more competitive competition

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, in fact Tesla's not even the number one manufacturer of electric vehicles anymore. It's China's BYD  So Bloomberg Saturday said  Once five percent of new car sales go fully electric everything changes and 19 other countries that this has happened in  You see this kind of hockey stick effect if the US follows the trend a quarter of new cars  Will be fully electric in 2025 in just three years can't wait. Yeah, I think that's good. Look at that  I didn't realize Norway is almost 90%

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did your dear wife's mini ever get? Yeah, it's all good. It's working fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So now we have fine with all of this push, but we better fix infrastructure over here in California with all  brownouts

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep, well, there's some good news there. Oh  You're not talking about chargers. You're talking about just electricity electricity in general

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, you know it's AC turns on for most of the people in their homes and then their power is out, right? Just  Really? Well, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, so that's interesting because whose problem is that is that because there's so many electric vehicles  No, it's because we have a for-profit entity  He's running our electrical grid in our area specific gas say their name  And PG&E's business is not  providing  You know electricity at a low cost. It's bit. It's building power plants. So for instance when you get solar panels PG&E will not let you  Put solar panels in an excess of the amount you use  They don't want you generating in competition with them but from the point of view of EV owners and  society in general  Hell everybody should have you know as much as as many solar panels as their roof can hold  If you want to do that, you should be allowed to do that should be allowed to at least your choice

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait you could could could you you can install more?  You just can't send the no electricity back up the line. No, you can't even install them. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How is that regulated it's connected to the grid. Oh  Yeah, you're right. If we were not if we were off grid, we could do whatever off-grid you do everyone  Okay, right, but but we are still on grid because right you have to be on grid because if the if you know  The Sun doesn't shine you still need a little trickle  If you have I mean we have big batteries we have Tesla power walls and the idea is we don't want we'd love not to be  On grid at all  But no everybody's on grid because and so if you're on the grid then PG&E gets to say  What's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What a delightful company how though that this is still a better than Texas where yes  it I mean, it's actually interesting because I think the Ford f-150 has an electric version of itself that  Apparently can power a house power  I wonder if I wonder if that will actually drive adoption because if you live in Texas, you might need your truck  You got a truck you like a Ford  And

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could actually California's doing that here recently technically do that with any any vehicle if you had an inverter you could take the DC  power from the battery and I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Think it was a question of capacity that the capacity was such that it had enough to power the house  Whereas I think another more a smaller car might not be able to do quite that much  But you could probably drain something off of it because you could at least plug into your your lighter suppose. I suppose or something

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, let me see the f-150  Battery is 145 kilowatt hours  My battery on my Ford Mustang is 88 kilowatt hours. It's it's not quite it's more more than half that it's enough to power the house  For a little while maybe not all not for weeks

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's your home charger is it still still your old Tesla home charger? Yeah, we just have a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Adapter yeah, it's the same plug. It's a NEMA 1450 the same kind of plug that  Your dryer has or your RV 40, right? And it's 240. It's on a ours is on a  50 amp circuit, I think  But it only delivers 32 amps to the vehicle. So yeah, you just have to have the right, you know adapter to plug it into the car  We have two of those we have two NEMA 1450s on each side of the garage  So we because we have three electric vehicles  There's actually a competition for the charger but because we have 60  Solar panels and we generate a huge amount of electricity we're not  Taxing the California grid to power to charge our cars up

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We generally when you lose power as happens in California. How long can you run the house on the battery?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have two of the big Tesla power walls  So obviously we'd want to shut down things. We wouldn't be charging our cars at that point  So it really depends on how how much you know, you've got turned on but we could go in theory  The whole of my whole idea is and I think if we got one more power wall  We could for sure do this is to just get through the night until the Sun comes out  Then we charge up some more because we always we can run off the Sun plus charge the batteries  Don't tell TPG and he that we  We kind of did a loophole thing we got a certain amount the amount they would let us then they say well if after six  Months you're using more than that than we were because we suddenly had all these electric vehicles  You can apply to get more so we put another 30 panels on so we've slowly kind of increased

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We are pretty much the whole roof is covered plus you could connect some panels to your power wall only in theory

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although yeah, we don't it doesn't do that  I don't know might be out might be beyond me. I don't know  I  Let's see I'm going through let's do one more break and then we do have a change log  Kathy has some good articles. I want to talk about the copia Institute  vulnerable people  We did that light song G so good you  And played the reggae yeah and play the reggae the inform act probably should go after that one I  Want to talk about the jewel cigarette ban  Oh cuz it kind of bugs me be honest with you. I  Understand libertarians coming out  The FDA wants to ban something bans tobacco  There we go. Why are they banning?  e-cigs and not tobacco  I'll tell you why profit no they're not allowed profits. No, they're not allowed to ban tobacco  They're not allowed because big tobacco got a law passed that said oh  You can't ban tobacco. Thank you, RJ Reynolds  But so meanwhile  The FDA can regulate tobacco industry, but with certain limitations for instance nicotine and cigarette products cannot be banned  flavorings  Like mint and fruit can so at first the FDA banned fruit flavored jewels  And I think that's appropriate because the issue is I you know  I think e-cigarettes are a better choice for smokers if you're smoking if you're burning  Tobacco to get your nick fix if you need the nicotine you should be using an e-cigarette  All the evidence is is that's much better for you than burning the tobacco  The problem is with these fruit flavors you get kids for the first time smoking using e-cigarettes  So that is and I understand that's why they banned it  But it pisses me off that it's completely legal to sell Marlboro's but not jewels is just  Mind-boggling and by the way, there's another loophole. The only reason you can't sell jewels is because they're refillable  You can sell disposable e-cigs. They're not banned

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What do you think about FDA proposing to ban menthol cigarettes  That's fine. I you know if that is that is it because it attracts kids  Well, it's because it's flavored, but it's also an issue that that menthol ranks higher with black  It's in the black community  Yep, yep, yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why is it more popular in the black community is it actively sold to black consumers?  I know there's you know ads for cool billboards outside of you know  I couldn't tell you why but I know that's all that's ever smoked. Yeah in the communities. I've been in this, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Populated by black people's menthols. It was never the Marlboro's if you can't buy the menthols if you can't buy your cools

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're gonna stop smoking hell no, no  Probably not. Oh, you're just gonna get lucky strike means fine tobacco  You're just gonna change to a non. You're not gonna get new ports. You're gonna get  Marlboro's or whatever you're I love my favorites your spirits because they're natural

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah  Honestly jewel which is not owned by big tobacco is probably

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Getting punished because they are not owned by big tobacco. Whereas many of these other e-cigs are owned  By RJ Reynolds and others. Well, if jewel goes to the big tobacco

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  J Reynolds and others well if jewel goes away, does the e-cig go away or just jewel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  any  refillable goes away, I say I  guess  views Vuse and puff  bar are  disposable flavored disposable products which are are actually more popular than jewel with kids  You might wonder well golly who makes views I  Believe that's our J Reynolds. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good. So we've also got extra waste in addition to the smoke. Yeah, let's throw them away, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I mean it's more complicated. I understand you don't want to get kids who are nonsmokers smoking. I understand that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a bad thing about jewel before I understood what jewel was I'd go by I saw it more in Europe  I think in Mexico I'd go by a mall and see the stories. Wow. What's that product that looks so cool? Yeah  It's jewel

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sleep marketing I'm just wondering how many kids pick up smoking because of the culinary experience involved with it  Like I'm not entirely sure this is the driving factor

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They liked smelling like mango

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And the look of the the puff of snow that they blow out all of that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's that's extra things like there's other ancillary things  You think you're getting if you're smoking and I mean, I suppose if it doesn't taste disgusting to you  You're more likely to to continue but yeah, but then again people were continuing even when it did taste disgusting  So I don't know it's I don't think it's a driving force to pick it up  It just might be a slightly sticking force once you have picked it up  But I don't think they're doing it because oh it tastes like this because we already had gum  So like if you just wanted the flavor experience, there were a lot less like poisonous ways to ingest it. So true

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But look at these delicious flavors of puff bar  By the way, this is from the esteemed journal tobacco reporter com  the puff bar  Which is owned by Patrick Beltran and Nick minus they're not owned by a big tobacco unlike views  Is legal because it's disposable comes in flavors like lush ice strawberry  leachy blue raspberry peach  Tangerine I figure if I'm gonna get a nicotine delivery system and it tastes like tangerine  Yeah get more get more  Is nicotine I that's this is another question I don't know the answer is obviously smoking a cigarette causes cancer heart disease  It'll kill you  We know this  And perhaps, you know vaping is  Bad for you. Although I that's not immediately clear. Oh the the connections with COVID were not good

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You were more vulnerable to worse symptoms, especially in the in the first one's lungs more. Yeah. Yeah. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is an impressive operation to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here huh, I'm gonna bring some stuff in  Anyway, I you know, I just I I understand why you ban them  I really do you don't want to get kids smoking etc, etc  But I feel like if you really wanted to do some good you should ban  Cigarettes, but if can they do that? No, no  They should be able to no I was yeah, I was how do we vote for to make that not happen?  And and I feel bad for this company jewel, which actually you know really did some you know, they did it all right  They made a beautiful product they  I think that's the criticism of them. They market it. They were successful kind of like yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they were kind of if they were sort of this and they might have made some bad decisions  But they were just kind of in the shadows of like  It's not smoking or something like that. Is that an alternative?  I don't know. I think they just were too popular and it blew up in them jewel  By the way was eventually bought by Altria, which is the cleverly disguised name of Philip Morris

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you know if I made tobacco cigarettes, I absolutely would say well, what's next, you know, let's  They invested twelve point eight billion dollars in jewel. Yeah, all the tobacco comes from kaki-laki done that nor of kaki-laki in Virginia  One of my favorite  Episodes of madmen. I think it's like the second episode. They're they're trying to save the tobacco company  There which is their big client is an ad agency in madmen and  Don who's just the best ad guy ever talks to the executive  What is it? How do you make your how do you make your cigarettes?  And he says well, you know  We picked the tobacco and we toast then we cook it and then we put it in the oven and then we put it in the oven  We toast then we cook it and then we put it up and he says so it's toasted  Well, yeah, it's we cook it in the oven. It's toasted  That's it. That's our slogan  Yeah, but every cigarette is toasted no no only whatever Winston it's toasted  It's a great episode to watch because the problem these cigarette companies have is that that now people know it's killing you  Like this is it that the period in the early 60s when it's starting to come out these cause cancer and and the cigarette companies can no longer  You know without it with a straight face say four out of five doctors recommend  Yeah, you smoke Winston's so they need some other you know benefit and they're desperate because they got nothing  They're all the same. It's a commodity product. Obviously, it's toasted  All right now let's take a look down to our sponsor Joel Joel  I will be glad to know that I've refused e-cigarette advertising all along. We never allowed that  Even though we were offered it many times  Not because I mean, I'm not I'm not against these cigarettes my daughter who smoked  Cigarette cigarettes. I really pushed hard to go to vaping which she did and then she quit  So it's a it was a success story for her and she hasn't smoked in a year  So it was really a yeah on the back. It's a very big success story  You know what finally did it was she found out that her great-grandfather my dad's dad died of lung cancer at 53  And that was kind of the end of the story and she said never smoking again. They're young. Yeah  She does eat at least a hot dog a day though. So I'm still worried  We're not we're not gonna

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's loaded with salt, which means that 20 ounce soda is a deal is required required  But for some reason the hot dog and soda combo is gonna stay a buck fifty  Might have something to do with the cost of a hot dog

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or the economy it's it's a generous act because there's a Costco. Yeah hot dog index  It's always at that 100 and if it goes up then watch out when caught this is from mental flaws when Costco president W

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Craig Jelinek once complained to Costco co-founder and former CEO Jim Senegal that their monolithic warehouse business was losing money on  Their famously cheap dollar 50 hot dog and soda package  Senegal listened nodded and then it did his best to make his take on the situation perfectly clear if you raise the price of the  Effing hot dog. I will kill you  Senegal said figure it out  So as a result style that's a man is the style the price has never been raised since 1984  quarter pounds all beef tube  Inflation adjuster

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So 1984 was a buck fifty that includes the soda 20 ounces

You now have options to create a new meeting and schedule a Google Calendar, that's the meat side  Why why

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I think I said that before but like and I was thinking about this in the earlier conversation about  Twitter and stuff where one of the things that it did really well is it followed its users?  Like the whole way that the the apps and up hyperlinks because that was behavior that users were doing so they built the tool around it  Being responsive to your users and understanding what your users need and how they interact with your product seems like it really should be at  The top of the list of what you're building for and I'm not sure it is and I think that's coming back to haunt everybody  Because you get more consumer dissatisfaction, which then turns into more regulatory pressure  Which turns into bad laws that end up impinging on innovation that would actually make better products  So like not doing it terribly from the outset and paying attention to who your audience is and what you're building and who you're building  That really needs to be a bigger priority than I think it is we would they took away the slim Jim's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It maybe that's the trick I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good I well spoken Kathy Ellis I agree. I love that. Yeah well spoke preach all said  There's nothing you could you which one is shake them shake them and say come on get together

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've given that lecture before like in lawyer  CLEs like talking to product council like don't piss off your users because if they get upset and they don't have market pressure to get  Something better from you. They're gonna go to their regulators and the regulators eventually will respond and it's probably not going to be good  So like the fact that you can legally build crappy products right now  Shouldn't be what you give yourself permission to do  You should really try much harder not to and I'm not sure the design steps are in place to be responsive enough to your audience  Understand it where they're gonna be able to architect things that are actually more successful products that irritate their users

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Much less than they currently do but you don't think anybody gets up in the morning says well  I'm gonna make a crappy product today. No, I think they get myopic

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean before I became a lawyer I was a webmaster and I mean webmasters

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good yeah, okay see the card doesn't lie um so the point with the webmaster is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like there were a lot of bad websites and to build a good website  It wasn't that you there was one right way to do it, but you had to ask questions like who's your audience?  What do they need to know what are they gonna like look for and and it wasn't that there's right answers  But you have to ask the questions because that'll  organize your decisions so you can produce something that is like hopefully going to do the job because you've put some thought into what the job is  so the problem is is myopia tends to set in for  People with the power to cook up really cool things because you get very insulated in what you're thinking about and what you want to see  And you build for that, but that isn't your your market necessarily  And unless you've got the discipline to think harder about your market could respond to it in proper ways  There's a lot of like superficial ways that people respond to markets  But to really respond to it in a meaningful way and understand it  You know it takes effort and resources to do it  But it's absolutely effort and resources that are well spent you have better products happier customers longer better product  Market entrenchment and you don't piss off regulators who can come back to slap your hand  Although if your competitors piss them off then they may still come by but at least if you put other products in the market  You'll also succeed in the market much better than if you just ram poorly designed ones down people's throats  Because you can word

I mean you have to disclose and all that stuff and  Then the funniest thing is then another company which apparently was already on this list  Sent out an email to the entire listing  Hey, just so you should know that you know, if you are a creator you should be getting more money than this and we can  I was gonna say it sounds like lowballing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I hate the last three sentences that have just come past like this makes no sense  Like how does one orient themselves in a world where it's TV? It's online  It's online TV, but not this brand TV not this brand online TV  Even though they're all owned by the same company like this is ridiculous and it causes confusion and I don't think the confusion is  Is it it's it's not negligible and it causes problems like cybersecurity problems  Like everyone's confused about what products they're using and why and how to control their logins and their six and their subscriptions  Like I think this is causes  Consumer confusion even amongst sophisticated consumers. This is not good. I think I don't know  You saying it needs some focus is that what you're saying coherence something

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I agree with you Kathy Gellis Esquire I  Think you're exactly right  It's a very I get well, you know why cuz on the radio show I get calls from people all the time are utterly confused  baffled bewildered  frustrated by this and I do all I say to them is like in a lot of you know, whenever you have  An  Incumbent business being completely disrupted by the internet  It's a mess as everybody readjusts their business models and you know companies get aggregated they go out of business  It's just a mess and the TV business is very much in that middle of that right now  Although if you look at the Emmy Awards  the nominations streaming  really  big success  Yeah, so  you know  Streaming is here. I mean very very clearly right to further confuse Kathy

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  YouTube TV  Has five million plus users more than the biggest lose live TV service the biggest biggest. Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If I was thinking of moving because I saw on reddit somebody posted  Bandwidth usage by the different streaming TV services and Hulu was by far higher bandwidth usage  Usually goes along with higher quality image and and YouTube TV wasn't very good  But then I saw a tweet from somebody who said I couldn't watch the Formula One race on my Hulu TV

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And that's what I said. I'm staying with you. No, no, no, no, no. Hold on. Let me let me correct it  I couldn't watch it on my Hulu TV because I killed the live TV subscription  That's why I turned it off  Not watching any live TV anymore and I was only watching the f1 stuff that was  We're trying to watch it live I was trying to watch it live when I could wake up like six in the morning  So yeah, it's really early, but I'm usually

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is bad. This is why killing off low-cast was a problem because you've got all these spectrum is public  You've got a whole bunch of stations that need to use the public airwaves to get to audience if they're gonna make any money  Via advertising from having it watch and I know they're like all competing for like the carry fees  But that's not enough because people are turning it off  so if live TV is still gonna be a meaningful medium for people we need a way to access it and  Copyright law has killed off all the rent and antenna services  So unless you want to cough up the money and like aunt is deciding it's just not worth the money and he's not alone to  Decide well, I just don't watch it enough then people won't watch it at all  And I just don't see why the over-the-air stations sued out of oblivion  The the necessary tools that people needed to watch them at all like this was just so  Suicidal on the behalf of these stations  Yeah, and terrible for copyright law and the public interest in public

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's crazy because I've been practicing this quote unquote practicing this for for several years now, I will cut  Cable until football season and my family got used to me doing that  We didn't have any television until football season come around because none of us watched anything live  It was a total waste of money  And then when I totally cut cable out and started latching on to these streaming services that added live capabilities  I saw I'm still not watching it much. So let me just save these extra fifty to sixty dollars a month

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you like Hulu TV just have a cure I've been a YouTube TV subscriber

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I would like it's I really like it other than their interface still stinks  Because I did try YouTube TV as well  after I had originally started with Hulu live TV and  YouTube just I didn't care for it. It started screwing up my regular YouTube viewing  habits because I guess it was feeding my live TV information from my  YouTube account to my  Desktop watching stuff and I didn't necessarily want that algorithm mixed up. Oh, I agree. Yeah, you know, so I'm happy with YouTube TV

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like the DVR and that's what I do  I told it once I liked F1 and now it records all the F1 races and it's you know  I can always watch them and it's nice  So it doesn't it's not it's good commercials on  On YouTube TV. I don't know Hulu has a skin can't yeah TV is no  So what I found out though, this is good if you watch YouTube TV  And I bet it would work with Hulu TV on an Apple TV. You can tell Siri to skip a certain amount of time  So what you do is you figure out how long the breaks are and you can say hey Siri skip two minutes  Nice act sir. Yeah, and you what you pretty quickly quickly learn what the various network break lengths are  And so we do appreciate our advertisers here at Oh never do that on a podcast  That would

Transcript:  The situation in fact the national situation  This was stuff that I had looked into that now  Whatever streaming service I was using things I wanted to learn more about it wasn't necessarily wrong  But I did not want anybody else in the universe to know that it was something I cared about and it's now dangerous to me if  Somebody else in the universe knows that I was interested in pursuing more information about some of these things  This is a big problem that we're really gonna have to pay a lot more attention to  And I say that as somebody who has very  dubious opinions about  Regulation and how it can strangle I think we got to be really really careful  But I don't think nothing is an option because this was the data sharing is a huge problem

Transcript:  The information has decided  To put money where its mouth is they're launching a social network for rich people. I mean subscribers  Since the subscribers paying as I am  $400 a year. I guess it's fair to say it's a social network  I'm thrilled Jessica lesson has been on the show before we're big fans of the information  Mm-hmm announced that the new system which rolls out this week will have three core features user profiles  Subscribers will be able to opt in to share fuller information about themselves their interests  You can also opt in to send and receive direct messages. There'll be a directory of profiles  It sounds a little bit like LinkedIn and there will be a forum

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, let me not be cynical about this. I love this news  And it's very similar to because I write all these amicus briefs for Tector  The copia Institute which is the Tector it is the news publication arm of the same enterprise  And I make the point in these things that one of the ways that Tector this news site interacts with its audience is  Thanks to 230 section 230. It has forum for comments. It has other forums for subscribers to talk to its each other  It's also a platform to do monetization. So we're solving the how do we fund news business type thing?  It's great to actually see other people do it because it becomes part of my advocacy and saving section 230 because when you save section 230  This is what you save to this interaction of people who are reading and consuming discourse and help feed the discourse  This is fantastic  I'd like to see more of this happen and I want to roll it into an amicus brief or something like that to point out  To people who want to step on section 230 that this is the type of  That this an enterprise like this couldn't do it if we didn't have this a lot of protected. Yeah, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mean we have to it has a number of ways we can interact with our audience. There's an IRC  That's open at all times. There's a  Discord server for our club twit members. There's a discourse forum  Twitter community there's a mastodon instance and yeah, if it weren't for the minute section 230 falls  I have to close them all because we can't afford to  be sued  You know for what people say on our various

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, everyone thinks section 230 is Google Facebook and Twitter and that's like you should be able to have the entire  Conversation about section 230 and never mention these names at all that this is really about  This week this is about twit tech dirt the information all these and other enterprises where you're having discourse  You're prevent presenting information to an audience the audience is  Continuing to discuss it and providing information back to its community and to the the media outlet  Like this is a really synergistic thing and this discourse is enabled by section 230 which backs up the First Amendment values that  Help the discourse exist like it hurts public discourse entirely if we do not have this law and  That's what I try to write my briefs about to like point that and do advocacy to sort of say  Resist the temptation that just because the internet has some bad stuff  You do not want to take this away because you will take away everything that is good including the ability of having independent media out there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you filed an amicus brief?  With who and for what?  I'm looking at this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Several things but sent to you and the rundown is two things in particular  One was a section 230 brief at the 11th circuit  Where again it was a defensive section 230 to point out that vulnerable people defend. Oh wait

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the other one that you pulled up. Oh, we can pull up the other one you want copy protections for the oh, there's so many of these  Copyright law destroy free expression a rare right we ostensibly have left is that it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the I can talk about that one  But the one I launched into was the one that talked about vulnerable people line 64 line 64 vulnerable people

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because vulnerable people need section 230 what you were just saying and as a vulnerable person I agree  So this is for the 11th

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is the 11th. This is following  And each versus Omegle  Yeah, as of these all these cases involved absolutely terrible things that happen and let's not gloss over that an absolutely terrible thing happened to  MH which MH may be the guardian and not the child  But basically the child was induced to do second something  Sexually inappropriate. This was a problem  But what the plaintiffs want to do is not they're not looking for the remedy in this case to go after  The person who actually caused the harm they want to go after the platform because since the platform existed and this  terrible thing could happen that somehow they want the platform to be at fault for it and  That sounds very tempting in this particular situation  But that does not scale to any usable way where that would basically they basically want section  230 not to work in any sort of insulating capacity that makes it useful  for anybody who needs it in order to provide any sort of form for any sort of  communication among users and user expressive content if you take it away or you make section 230 not  Applicable here. It will essentially not be applicable anywhere  And then forums can't exist including the forums that vulnerable people need to a you need the forums because you need the forums to  Be able to call for help organize push back if you know  The politics are going really badly and you're gonna hurt vulnerable people like you need the ability to speak out and section 230 means that  Platforms can exist to help you speak out if you don't have section 230  Then the forums either can't exist or they're gonna have to screen out so much content that even if they're available  You're not gonna get to use it. And the second thing that section 230 does is try to actually make these  conducive communities within which you can speak and obviously they can't and don't do it perfectly but they could give it as best  Try as they can because they have the legal protection that section 230  Provides to back up their ability to make moderation decisions  And if you take section 230 away then whatever communities remain will be particularly toxic  So again vulnerable people are not going to be able to successfully speak online  So it's like you if you have to kind of expand the view and that's what we were telling the court that you have  To look at it more broadly and I know the temptation is to give this  Particular victim a remedy and the deep pocket to try to pull from is the platform  But that would mean that you basically turn section 230 into a nullity it can no longer function as an insulating law  And if it doesn't function as an insulating law then nobody benefits from it and all the activity that it protects  Stops being protected and goes away. Oh Magel's an interesting plaintiff

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  be or respondent, I guess because  They are a chat that allows you to talk to strangers  They claim to be moderated. Although I noticed there's a button that also has an unmoderated  Section they also say you have to be 18 plus or 13 plus with parental permission  Which might let them off the hook because after all isn't the parent responsible for the child?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That came up in the case. It doesn't I don't know how salient it is to the section 230  Issue, I mean basically section 230 doesn't require section 230 itself does not require them to limit it or in any way like that  Same way section 230 doesn't require you to moderate your forms in any right either way  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're trying to say that well, you know, the circuit just throw this out because isn't that what normally would happen with section 230?  They just say no this no

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, no, because this is this is the appeal so they tried to sue  Omegle and they they lost because a couple of the claims were outright dismissed and then section 230 held where section 230  Prevented the other claims they wanted to go forward. So they lost it section 230 did its job  They are now appealing where they want the 11th circuit to say the district court got it got it wrong  Section 230 shouldn't have precluded the claims  Here's why and then we joined as an amicus to sort of push back and say bigger picture  If these claims could go forward then section 230 no longer functions in the way that Congress wrote it to do and intended for it  To do and all of a sudden speech is not protected including for other vulnerable people  I mean also non-vulnerable people, but we wanted to really make it that the optics are  You know your temptation is to help a person who really needs help  But other people are also going to need help and those people are best helped by having section 230  preclude some of these sorts of claims because in the bigger picture more vulnerable people are going to be helped in more significant ways

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  how is the 11th on these kinds of things there Georgia, Florida and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Alabama, I don't know but this is the case that  Took one of the Florida theme park  Statutes were Florida's trying to regulate the internet  so it's partly why I wanted to make sure and they actually came out with a decision that was  Relatively friendly on the First Amendment front where they could recognize the speech issues and had some inclination to vindicate them  it wasn't perfect, but it but it was much better than it could have been and  But they never really reached the section 230 issues on that case and they may in the future  I think it was sort of important to use this opportunity to start educating the 11th circuit because these issues are not going to go away  They're going to come back  But there is persuasive  Precedent and other circuits that they can certainly draw from I think the legal argument is very strong on a megley side  But whether the 11th circuit just will really want to like undo things just to try to provide support to this plaintiff  I hope not but and that's why we were there to try to avoid that temptation. Yeah and good on the copia

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Institute for  Supporting that kind of work. That's great

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's tricky because like you don't want to like, you know, it's a sympathetic plaintiff  But we run into these situations because the principle of the thing and how it applies more broadly is really more people will benefit  By pushing back on some of these more individualized claims. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's why we need legal thinkers like you to be thinking about this and raising those issues reminding people that the immediate  Emotional response is often not

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The long yeah, because nobody wants small children to be you know kids to be  No, of course not and a public forum

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But but they're more likely like if you lose section 230 then the forums lose the ability to try to moderate them at all  So like that's not gonna work out well for them and protect anybody. So yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we do moderate of course, we actually pretty actively moderate IRC  We don't have to moderate the discourse so much because those people paid to be there and for some reason people pay don't seem  to be so  troublesome  I just hold up the ant card and they go  Now with lamination  Do we come up with a game for mr. Jarvis?  I somebody suggested the untitled goose game which would fit his personality that in that game  You play a goose taunting terrifying and annoying  gardeners and other people as you wander around oh  I think you'd like goat simulator to actually what kind of game what what kind of we gotta get some some more information about  You Jeff, what do you think you would enjoy?

Transcript:  There were some there were some really good indie games that had stories and you really felt like you started to identify with the character  I think that's what you want. You want something to be that you can like  Man I don't know this could be a hard one. It's gonna be on the Mac. That's the that's the hardest thing  Somebody said Oregon Trail not only that you

I think going forward is the  The game maker as a tour and the game player as collaborator in the process of mutual collaboration  Creation that's what interests me that makes any sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like it needs to be there. Yeah, it makes a big difference without the sailboat. That's not nearly as interesting  So true. Yep. So true. Yep. Very nice Kathy. Thank you so much for being here. You're really valued  Especially when we have these interesting court situations

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jeff a number an item. Oh, right. Oh, right. I got to do something here. Let's see  This you just say and then you move on office occupancy is stuck at 50% which I think is an important moment  That's a number but I found this interesting  We might have talked about this before BMW is going to start selling heated seat subscriptions for $18 a month  Not in the US market  But in other markets and you already have everything you need for heated seats. They just block it in software

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's very kind of learning from Elon. Yeah terrible. Hmm. It's terrible

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then the other thing that was interesting  And then the other thing that was interesting that struck me at the same time is boohoo, which is a e-commerce player  I think mainly in the UK is gonna start charging shoppers of pound 99  to return items  Wait where that goes next  No, no boohoo  Yeah, I mean, I don't know people will buy online because they're safe because they can return things if they don't like them and they can find  No, no, no, no, no, it's like when banks brought in ATMs and  Wanted you to use the ATM so they could fire tellers and then eventually tried to charge you for using the ATM  So they can save money firing the tellers

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What was I saying about following your users and paying attention to your market and what your market wants?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this will be a good experiment. We will see  We will see, you know, does it cost them customers?  I know I wouldn't buy clothes if I didn't have online if I didn't have easy return and be yeah, absolutely not right, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Lisa I'm sympathetic with the companies sure getting the returns is hard  It adds a lot of expense I get that but they wouldn't sell anything and they otherwise they'd have to have brick-and-mortar stores all over  The country they're better off in the long run if they manage it, right and if they describe their products correctly, right so on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly Lisa will and she knows she can do this  So that's why she'll do it instead of going to a store and trying on clothes  She'll order all the clothes that look good in a catalog keep the ones that fit nicely and work well for her and send the rest  Back that's you know, kind of the deal. I understand the stores don't like it, but that's that's how it works. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Understand that you don't know how tall I am. So let me just tell you I'm like five foot eight  But I'm really not so when I go to the stores, they don't have the clothes that fit they're sending me to the catalog  So what am I gonna do? Isn't that ironic? Yeah

Transcript:  They say sorry. Yeah, our son has feet about this big  Like flippers and  You know good luck trying to find so they always say yeah  Well, you can go to Zappos and that's where we end up getting all those shoes  But if you had to pay to return shoes, no, that's not oh especially shoes.

What this is is a is a nebula and stars being born coming out of the gas cloud  That's the hubble  That's web and you can see why there's they're kind of making that tweet because that's unbelievable  It's a dramatic

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Transcript:  Because of Prime Day I've been sort of looking around for some stuff for people in the photography and video side of things and  this one is the follow focus from  Small rig and I bought one of these a while back  But of course, it's now on sale and I really enjoy this thing if you're into  Shooting video and you want to have a better control of your focus by doing manual focus. This wheel works really really well  It has a B  Stops on it. So if you want to lock off where you want to put your focus  You can just pull that little notch down right there and it'll stop where you need it to stop. I use it all the time  I think it was off for like 20 or 30 percent on Prime Day highly recommend it  Quite that gum useful small rig. This is what they use movies and they do a rack focus

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They'll set it up right that they they know exactly what the start is and where the end is  And they could do it without jostling the camera and all that that's right
