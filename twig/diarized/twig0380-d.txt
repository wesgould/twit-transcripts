We've been playing with it. It's pretty cool a  Little better than cardboard because you get this the little  Remote control. Yeah the controller  But I I'm still unconvinced of the of the long-term value of oh you though you got it out

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You like that fiber the material feels like it. I said want to make underwear out of this. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What it well actually it's exactly what it is  Is it Jersey Jersey? No, it's not cotton. It's a nylon sport fabric  So it's used for you know, like under armor kind of stuff wicking wicking it wicks  it has a removable face plate so you can wash that which is nice because  It might get kind of sweaty and make up II make up II  It also works not just with the pixel but they Motorola's now and asked it's gonna work with some of their phones  Which is good and eventually you have to take okay. Don't tell him  He's like many the mini pearl of VR headsets. You got to take the paper thing out there. Yeah

Transcript:  Just very it pops up. What's it goes? Well, you know, I'm a phone in it yet  Do you was that it? Okay  Give me something new and I'll complain about it. Okay. How do I do this? Put your pixel in there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It should sense it by the way, we what we learned  To the new screensavers is that you can chrome cast from your pixel before you put it in it's worse  No, it won't stay up. It's well, you may have to adjust the headband. It doesn't have an over-the-top  Headband, it's just around the back which and in fact Jason was complaining about the same thing that the headband's a little  Yeah, it just it flops up. Yeah, I'm sure you can adjust it. Yeah. No, you're still wearing your glasses. That's good, right?  Yeah, you can wear glasses with it  Which is good because it doesn't have any adjustment for focus  Which some of the others do so that you can for instance I wear glasses and if I'm not wearing my tie contacts  I don't want to wear the glasses underneath the visor  So I take them off and adjust the focus and that usually is adequate, but you can't do that with this one  So you're gonna either have to wear your glasses or wear contacts, but yeah, it seems to fit over glasses pretty well  It's okay, don't worry about it better lenses than cardboard cardboard has very cheap lenses obviously it has to it's a cheap device  this is $79 and I think maybe there'll be a dark dark Friday a Black Friday  Maybe we should call it dark Friday a dark

Transcript:  Yeah, that's not good. Maybe maybe I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's no press your face against your desk

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, did you read the review Stacey of the June oven I think it was fast company had it yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh my gosh, he had the worst time. He hated it. He hated it. Although  Okay  One he had a very different experience. He had some errors but two  It felt like he just did not I mean like it felt like he left it in the oven and he didn't understand how to review  Things because he was complaining about like too many notifications  But like when I set mine up I turned a lot of the notifications off  so I was like kind of like that fair, I don't know and then he also was upset because  It didn't look done and  He cooked it longer and then he forgot about it or something. I like I felt like he put the salmon steak in there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and it said it's gonna be done in you know, 15 minutes or 10 minutes  And then it turned out taking 40 minutes and at one point it says gonna take four hours

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was all over the place. I feel like he had a glitchy oven, but I don't know. I mean it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'm a little worried myself because I did order one and you had a very good experience with it and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Reviewed it in PC magazine. I think fairly positively, right? Yeah, I did say so at one point in time. I  Had a problem connecting my app to the art my device to the oven  But I just rebooted it and it connected then  And then I had one time when the oven  Before I had done anything to it didn't turn on and then so I just rebooted it and that that didn't feel like anything  I didn't have any of the issues this guy described

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean he had all kind and we should mention that I'm sure all of these are  Pre-production because I ordered it like a normal person. I haven't received it yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So these are yeah, they this is not their beta  It is sorry. It is their beta. They had like 50 alpha  Early early ovens out there, but this was not one of those

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Trying to find this review was it fast company or was it somewhere else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There was one of fast company and then USA Today didn't really love it either  And I knew time thought it was neat but too expensive

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and everybody says that I mean it's  $1,500 for a yes, it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My ovens cost $1,500, but they are full-sized self-cleaning

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stainless steel ovens. So right but very different. Yeah, I mean, that's a lot of I mean ridiculous amount of money to pay it also  Is it designed by a team that includes the guy who did the camera hardware for the iPhone?  And in fact has a camera in it  It has carbon fiber heating elements and it works with your smartphone  it has cameras because it identifies the food and  part of the promise of it isn't really realized until  Down the road it's gonna learn right? So right it will recognize food better and better over time. I  Can't find this review was so funny. Oh the fast co review was in fast co. I can't it was in fast co

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there were some great like one-liners in there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah  It was in sometimes, you know you read a review like that and you think the guy's more interested in getting off  Bo Mo than he is and really, you know, whether it's a good product or not  But I but it gave me pause. I almost canceled my order. I still I guess I have time to do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They just called it June intelligent oven

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, oh wait, no, is that that's seen it oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  well, I  Would like to I would like to find this review, but I can't anyway. So here it is. Oh wait  Sorry, I should have prepared this one better. I  Just thought of it. That's it. No, that's everything that's wrong with Silicon Valley design  If you just search for that  a very funny review and  He I mean everything that's wrong, let me let me get the quotes here  Because I think that the the quotes are hysterical  It's fast company design  That's is that the same as fast company fast company design?  Or is it something it's maybe it's a design because I would understand Mark Wilson writing here  He he has images of his salmon cooking will finish in one minute cooking complete  notification ETA pessimistic that's apparently a error message notification ETA optimistic another error message  notification ETA pessimistic  Please flip your food  This the salmon had become more distracting to babysit than I have a judge if I just cooked it on my own it became a metaphor  for  Silicon Valley itself automated yet distracting boastful yet mediocre confident yet wrong  Most of all the June is a product built less for you the user and more for its own  Ever impending perfection as a platform when you cook salmon wrong you learn about cooking it, right?  When the June cooks salmon wrong its findings are uploaded aggregated and averaged to a June database that you hope will be the best  That you hope will allow all June ovens to get it right the next time good thing firmware updates are installed automatically  Even if he's even if you don't quite agree with him, it's a pretty funny  Review, but you disagree you think you think it's a it's useful and you didn't have the same problems

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did not have his problems and it says that he apparently missed some stuff like I will say and I I'm pretty sure I  Said this it does adjust the cooking time  So like when I was making a pork tenderloin, I was like la la la I have 40 minutes and then I looked over it  It was like oh just kidding. You have much less time than you thought  Well, so what I think what happened in that case is it's got the weight sensors in the bottom and  it thought that  That blows me away to you the vegetables were with the pork  So I think it thought it was all pork and then as it cooked it realized  Oh this pork is cooking way faster than I thought it would based on its weight  So then it adjusted

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He also gives you I kind of like this but at this time lapse of your food cooking  He says like one of those Pillsbury cookie commercials  Unfortunately, the playback looks something more like my roasted cauliflower sex tape the unappetizing green glow that made me wonder  Why would anybody bother to film this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was awesome

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The coup de grace of all the info overload absurdity is a line graph  Which compares oven temperature to item temperature in case you weren't sure why your salmon took 45 minutes. Here you go  It's science and here's a picture of the of the cauliflower  And which does really disgusting looking and there's the line graph  You know what I'm still gonna get one and I'm because I trust you Stacy I think you'll like it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did you fix it Jeff it looks like you fixed it I think so adjust the headset until the image is clear  Yeah, I can't do that because it won't stay on. Oh just you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll save the Jeff's complaint again. No, I can't be our is highly over VR. My opinion is highly overrated  How do you feel about a are I'm very excited I think that's the future the real future now now I can't it's a solid steady-state

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Image, I can't won't move. I should send June the June of in the gym  When my wife was pregnant and on bed rest I never cooked I almost killed her with with

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  raw chicken toxic fumes I can only imagine when they finally tie the  Daydream to the June oven and you'll get  360 degree realistic views of your food while it cooks as if you're in the oven with it. That's the future  Okay, that's that's enough Jeff  Just wear it like that that's very fetching

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's got on this forehead now. I'll stop. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You'll play with it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Those people who wear their glasses on their forehead I can never do that right, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now you can very bro thing to do I think the worst no the more bro thing is to and I know I really don't  Understand this word backwards so that the glasses are behind your head and that like that. Have you seen people do that?  Only works with really cool sunglasses. I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do not like that do not like so I started watching  Was it called I love bill from Amazon haven't seen that no, oh  Kevin bacon no runs

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it I said I love oh, I love dick. Yeah, no, I love bill dick dick for bill  You gotta be careful saying what I love dick  I did see this show. I did see this and I wasn't sure if I would like it. It's apparently adapted from the  lauded feminist novel of the same name it takes place in Marfa, Texas

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's good, huh? I  Watched the first episode in the plane is very good. Is there a real Marfa, Texas?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There is a real Marfa test. Oh, it's it's famous. They do all these writing workshops  What universities in Marfa there is no university it's just to it's pretending it's a college town  No, it's it's very small. It's at the base of the Guadalupe Mountains  It's in the middle of nowhere. It's hard to get to but it's very famous among the literati

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Artistic set. So why is it that at least two now?  highly praised TV shows one from HBO one from Amazon are about divorce and  Failing marriages is this is this something we're gonna see more of is this the new why we need a cultural revolution, sir

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe back the American family maybe

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Weren't there others that comes about people I mean like isn't modern family aren't they divorced no

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they are but it's it's about but it's not about the divorce it's a I mean it's post way post divorce each is remarried  No, is that right? No, that's your father. No, no that modern family. Her father is remarried to the cha-cha  Yeah, not evil. Agoria. Who's you know, I'm talking about. Oh, what about who's the boss?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was back in the 80s and she was she was a single mom. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But she wasn't divorced what these shows are about no no these shows are about the actual process as  Horrible as it is of getting of like falling apart as a couple. I  Mean, of course, we've had divorced and single parents before but what they have never focused on is the painful process of a dissolution of a marriage  Actually, Woody Allen scenes from a marriage or is that Ingmar Bergman? I can never remember

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe it's pretty that's Ingmar Bergman. It's Bergman

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Woody Allen did interiors which was his version of Ingmar Bergman. Yes. Yes scenes from a marriage  That's the only other example I could think of so fear of a gara wore the roses. Okay, you're right. Where are the roses?  Never mind. I have I've spotted a cultural trend  well, that's true who wasn't and  And there was that Dustin Hoffman movie  Anyway, where they're fighting over the kid

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's my blue Valentine, but that was a movie

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Those are all movies movies. You have a divorce for years and years and years TV shows

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know slow mo said when he was a kid he used to watch Divorce Court. I remember that  That was like Judge Judy with divorce  Man this show has not started well, let's start this over again. Can't kill you. There's there's something

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What was I going to talk about here? Well besides the Facebook stuff, which we got lots on you and a guy from beta works wrote a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Piece for medium that has been picked up widely very widely Borthwick

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  John Borth from bid works. So yeah, we John reached out to me  I mean I've been writing about the fake news stuff and reached out to me and said let's let's be practical  So we went and sat for two hours and gave with 15 suggestions of what to do about it and put it out

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Similar to what we had talked about last

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's why I was asking because we were always middle of writing it last week  So I got a written right by the next morning  And then Zuck after kind of changing his mind  Did write a post as we all saw with about six of the 15 suggestions that we had in parallel, which is good  And I put on a comment on Zucks post saying, you know, well you're doing this and by the way  Here's what both of us and I wrote and suck like the comments nice. So what did you what did you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Propose basically what you had talked about on this show, which was not censoring  Fake news but giving people more information some signals as they read it so that they could go deeper

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly as I remember you poo-pooed half of the last week, but that was the kind of the mood you were in

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I'm still in that mood. You're I think blaming Facebook for this is  Reductionist oh I agree. I absolutely agree but

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Can we improve the quality of discourse on the social platforms?  Yes, is there some large proportion of people who would prefer not to pass on lies  That's a question. That's a question

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to I have to believe that's well and giving them the opportunity to more information and I agreed with you at the end  Of the conversation. Yeah, that's all yeah that giving them more information giving everybody more information about the post  They're about to share is not a bad thing. Yeah, so there's 15 suggestions. You're taking all the fun out of it though  Cuz I think I have this I really think a lot of this stuff is shared not for its veracity  but but more because it's  Emotionally true and it feels true and this is how I feel right now  And I'd like to share this and it strikes me that that's really what social media is for is for you to share your feelings  And I think it's intrusive to ask a social media  network to  You know somehow say well your feelings are not okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't I don't agree with your feelings when no but when those feelings are presented as fact rather than just feelings  Then I think it's perfectly legitimate to say well, are you sure you know is that is that fact here's here's the facts as a journalist  I can't help but say that surely facts should enter into  Conversations and that fact-based conversation will be in the long run

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  More civil well and can product one argument in your favor comes from the Wall Street Journal today most students  Don't know when news is fake according to a Stanford study  82 percent of middle schoolers couldn't distinguish between ad labeled sponsored content and a real news story on a website  That's not a fake news problem. That's a business. That's the native content problem. I've always I've always thought that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  CUNY we have a study coming out  Shortly about the similar thing not with just students with people and here's the interesting thing Leo  More people knew what was a sponsored story on Facebook than in news sites  Another  More people on his face is better labeled Facebook has sponsored stuff is better labeled than news sites

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And we've always said native content  Whatever people say is designed to trick the reader into thinking they're reading something that is not an advertisement  So that was part of the study in two out of three middle schoolers couldn't see any valid reason to mistrust a post written by a bank  executive  Arguing that young adults need more financial planning help  But here's the other side of it four in ten high school students believed based on the headline that a photo of  Deformed daisies on a photo sharing site provided strong evidence of toxic conditions  The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in Japan, even though no source or location was given for the photo  So four out of ten high school kids 82 percent of middle school kids  That's a legitimate audience for what you're saying, you know young people but I do think that much of the you know  so-called fake news posted  During the election was posted by people who knew it wasn't read the Pope didn't really endorse  Donald Trump, but but that's how they felt. That's what they what they were saying something by posting that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or they thought it would bolster their cause to the point

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, it would bolster their cause right  By the way, I love this post. This is from ten Zen monkeys  Mark Zuckerberg is a hypocrite right next to so so this is Luke a brawn writing right next to  Mark Zuckerberg's post on November 18th. A lot of you asked what we're doing about misinformation  I wanted to give you an update. We take it seriously blah blah blah right next to it on on lose  Feed maybe not yours were two ads  Hugh Hefner ends his life  Hollywood life comm he will be missed and sad day and PGA ESPN comm we've lost tiger forever both were of course  Completely fake and they were advertisements this one pointed to a site that's labeled Fox News  With shocking news the headline crystal Hefner reveals the miracle pill  that cured hugh's ed permanently or Jesus and  Sad day for PGA fans that points to a site that does look like ESPN except it's not  It's ESPN comm-magazine dot online. And of course it ends up being a diet pill  So the point that Lou is making is if you can't mark Zuckerberg can't keep this crap off his own posts  He's obviously got a problem here. We don't take misinformation

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Worse yet, he's taking money for those he's made money on those. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That I'm more I have to say I'm more that's more appalling to me and  Not because I think anybody believes it but just it's really annoying  It's it's just the worst kind of link bait  I  Also kind of don't like the fake news conversation because I feel like  It's  It's a little whiny it's like people complaining about the results of the election and looking for a scapegoat I  Wish it were I wish we had this conversation

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Before the election exactly exactly or or six months afterwards that it was in a different context  It's not just about the election because it really does feel like it's whiny

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but I mean, that's how change happens and that's how we decide something's important is  You know, I could I complained about data caps for freaking ever but only you know  Only when a certain pain point had been reached like when people are trying to download updates for video games or whatever  Did it suddenly become big issue, right?  So this is some people have been complaining about fake news, right?  But no one cared until after it possibly cost someone an election

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess that's that's that's legitimate. And by the way, speaking of caps. Hello. This is a courtesy  Let you know you've reached a hundred percent of your terabyte monthly data plan for your Xfinity internet service  And actually this is not the last one I got the next one that day later said 110%  Yeah, I'm looking to a terabyte already easy. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For broadcasting the show. No, not in the office at home

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Huh easy and I have two internet connections, by the way  And I have two internet connections by the way I split it and I still did it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What are you doing  I'm watching TV  But I noticed television 4k 4k baby

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  okay, and  the thing is  It doesn't take that much if you stream Pandora and you I mean we stream everything  Even if I'm gonna watch an HBO show half I hate the  Comcast on demand so much that I'll end up watching it on HBO go which is streamed instead  So, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That still feels like a lot. I mean we watch it you must know you'll get there. Oh, you'll get there  Okay. No, I'm just I'm trying to think I'm a canary in the mine, baby  We get 250 is probably how many it just 250 gigabytes. So that's your cat  No, that's that's how much we see

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To use. Oh, so well, this is the first time I've ever gone through that cap. So maybe something is going on  I don't know but I mean if you're downloading  4k or  video, it's 15  What is it 15 gigs an hour?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So isn't it that high? I thought it was down to eight  15 megabytes 15 megabits and no what I'm saying gigabytes because HD is 2 gigabytes 15 megabits

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry 15 megabits. So I have to do the math. Yeah, it's a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a lot it's a lot. It's a lot. All right. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do think a terabyte which sounds like a lot is not and and it's really Comcast  You know doing what they think people will ignore until such time. It's exactly what you said, Stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm like I have I have preached to this choir. Yeah any a time

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no, you nailed it and and as somebody who's now experiencing it, I will agree with you

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well this pixel pixel

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry, no, I was gonna segue from fake news to Intel's wearable stuff  But we should stick with Google for a while before we go totally off track. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's do our pixel phone thing. So a couple of things going on  Initially we were getting reports the Guardian reported that people who were buying the pixel phone and then selling it on we're getting  Not only blocked from their pixel cap, but do their entire Google account  Now Google has unlocked those has relented according to engadget  The digital death penalty has been lifted

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  As someone who was often  Defended Google this time I'm gonna be the exact opposite. This is an abuse of power straight and simple  For this is this is exactly what people fear about Google tying accounts together  And it can use its power in one realm to enforce its view in the other realm and  I think it was a huge mistake for Google to kill these accounts

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google does say in the terms of service you may not resell devices purchased from that doesn't mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But we're gonna cut you off from the entirety of all of the rest of Google which controls half the world that Facebook doesn't control  That's true. And that's what's wrong, you know, we're no no Google Maps for you. No ways for you. No Gmail for you  No Docs for you. No search for you because well we didn't like so  Where's the limit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google says is unlocking the accounts because customers weren't aware of the rule  But they also say many of the accounts were created for the sole purpose of this scheme  In other words, we created an account to buy a pixel

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm just saying Google better be careful because because you know, I just come back from Europe and it's the same view  Yeah ever and and I and this is a case where I'll agree with the critics to say watch out Google if you overuse this tremendous  Power you have  Then the Chris the critics are gonna get you  That'd be right I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mean, I kind of see their point and I'm gonna say I'm gonna say hey, I mean  giving it back to them because they didn't know the rule is good because no one reads all of the terms and service terms of service, but  I mean you're abusing their accounts. There are alternatives out there even if you don't like them just  It sucks for you, but you did it wouldn't matter if it were your flicker account

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Jeff this is kind of don't I won't put words in your mouth  But because Google is so much more important than just you know an account

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's your it's your email. It's your browsing history. It's a lot. I mean, it's everything now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How would you how would you do without a Google account? I guess you could get a different one new one, right?  But you could lose all of your email. I load everything. I mean I save

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My contacts not just to Google but to my phone I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're one of the few I think most people do not especially gmail how many people back up their gmail

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you I do it's my brain. Yeah, you're smart and I would recommend company go bust so I was like, oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right. When you when giga ohm went under you had no warning, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I had an hour's warning, but they actually gave us our accounts for a little bit longer  So we had time to do a backup, but we didn't know we were gonna have time to do a backup

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So yeah, I mean that's a significant  deal there are  programs that will back up your entire gmail account and  Maybe this would be a good thing to to consider  You can do it from gmail directly. There's Google takeout. There are programs that you can download  Or you could actually use the company talk about this in the past

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There should be companies that just do this for you. Yeah, I kept all your stuff for you. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm surprised to be I was it back up a fi back up a fi but there was also like spanning cloud  But I think Google bought them

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is a Google's gonna buy you there's a Mac app I had that did this for you and it did it continually  in the background downloaded locally back up a fi was a  Cloud backup, which is kind of cool. Anyway, there's a lot it'd be easy for anybody to find this  But I would bet 99% of Google mail users don't do that  That's a really unusual thing so back up a fi is still around  Yeah, they used to when they first started they had free backup services and I think now it's all paid

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Someone's saying mail store mail  Sorter or sorter. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I used back up a fi for a long time  I think I was grand initially grandfathered in on a free account, but they got they got purchased in  2014 I think that they're not quite the service they were Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mail store the standard and email archiving nice. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait, there's one that's  Mailstore with an E and then there's mail store without an E

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's two have you seen and if you haven't get ready the new Google Duo ad with Blake and Deandre  I thought he said he had practice. This is by the way. That's a bottle of soda talking. No, it's mustard mustard

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ketchup no, and now they're calling

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and the mustard  Deandre's mustard is now doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's up?  Duncan with over there  What no, I was just what I thought we were a team no, like we are no, no, that's cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You do you musters doing is talking

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you done I don't know you still coming to the party on Sunday I have plans there's gonna be pigs in a blanket

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is vaguely obscene  For duos who can't stay mad at each other  I'll just meet you there. Perfect. I'll pick you up. Uh, who are Blake and Deandre am I missing something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're NBA basketball players. Yeah, I think so  That's all I mean, are they sports? It's out of my chat room. Yeah, we don't we're not sport ballers here, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Charm do you know who that is?  I  Know it knows who that is a real real  American around they probably they didn't want to spend the money on actual NBA players. So they got I don't know  Does it make you want to use does it even give you any understanding of what duo does?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, it does. So it does it's a it's quirky. I think it appeals maybe to younger people maybe

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, those two guys play for the LA Clippers Steve Ballmer's team. Oh, there you go. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh and they're advertising Google products  I mean you can see that they the guys like oh crap  I know who's calling because I could see them on the screen  Hold up and he's even knows that the guy at the mustard or ketchup is mad at him because he's got the frowny face. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mean, it's silly and by the way, they knew that Deandre could act  Because he apparently has one of the most famous reaction gifs on Twitter  So that's how they knew  You know, it's easy to become a star these days just just get on the Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hell would anybody can become president that way did you yeah, he's still tweeting. Oh, yeah, I'm thrilled. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Think we were gonna have the best  unmediated

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  View of the presidency we've ever had I don't think it's gonna be the type of presidency though that his historically existed

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't well, I'll tell you why whole new realm. We don't know what he's gonna do. So we really need the Twitter to keep track  Because apparently talking to the New York Times he changed everything. It's like well, yeah, I like the Clintons  I don't want to hurt them and it's not really a wall  And I mean so the Twitter is gonna be very valuable in parsing all of this

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Account is actually valuable. I mean, it's not gonna help us parse anything  It's just like is it speaking to us in 140 characters?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I love it  But the point is that that Michael Wolfe just said in an interview that you know  The reporter's job is to be a stenographer. It is to listen to what they say  We don't need that anymore. No because he can reach directly and whatever he wants to say

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look at that. He made a YouTube video saying here's what here's my policy. I don't need I don't need the press  Here's my policy. Yeah, I mean that's that's the equivalent of FDR's fireside chats  that's going right to the public and  bypassing all the gatekeepers  Very interesting article I was at Bloomberg Businessweek about Jared Kushner who apparently  That's of course a president-elect Trump's son-in-law. She's married to Ivanka  He is apparently the architect of this social media strategy is quite  interesting  Let me see if I can find this article because I thought I thought this was really  This you know, we often talk about how president Nixon there it is  President Nixon was the first a  President to use an ad agency in his election bid in 68 and  How Obama is in many ways the first social media?  president  But what current Kushner figured out?  and did so well  Was how to not spend money traditionally on advertising as Forbes that did the interview?  Not spend money on in traditional advertising but instead very cleverly use  Facebook and it starts with a company called Cambridge Analytica and  I just found this endlessly fascinating. Do you do you guys follow this whole story Cambridge Analytica?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They've been doing these polls on Facebook's at the one yeah, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cambridge Analytica has been around for a while they specialize in  I don't know. How would you characterize it? Let's go to their website  Character polls the better audience character better audience targeting powered by smarter data modeling  So what they've been doing what they were doing is doing quizzes on Facebook. You've probably seen these  We've all taken them personality quizzes and they just seem like a lot of fun  Yeah, but you know everybody does it. Let's do one here. Let's get to know your real personality  This is actually on the Cambridge Analytica site. I have a strong. I have a vivid imagination. Yeah, I definitely do  I believe in the importance of art strongly agree. I seldom feel blue. Yeah. No, I feel blue. I have a sharp tongue  Oh god. Yes. I'm not interested in abstract ideas. No, I don't I like abstract. I find it difficult to get down to work  I'm doing this fast. I do not panic easily. I tend to vote for liberal. Oh, this is interesting  Liberal political candidates. Yes, I'm not easily bothered by only two Republican candidates  Yeah, so what they'll do is these quizzes and if they don't all look like this, you know  It's often which member of the Doughton Abbey family are you right? We've all done these  But what they were doing behind the scenes is gathering information very very elaborate databases on  Facebook users which the then used to target what they're called in dark advertising and I found this  very interesting and  It was shortly after Trump won the Republican nomination that Kushner went to Cambridge Analytica and hired them and they started spending money  He calls it he says this is like moneyball  Remember money ball was that wonderful book about how the Boston Red Sox became?  World champ or no, I'm sorry Oakland A's became world champions the Red Sox use it later  Using analytics findings finding players that were undervalued  Nobody wanted because they didn't really fully understand their value but modern data analytics let them know which players were worth  You know getting even though they were cheap because nobody knew is that valuable they were in it  Of course, they created a winning Oakland A's team and then later a winning Boston Red Sox team and this season a winning Chicago Cubs team  the same exact  Technique Kush Kushner used to  Targeting its advertising very effectively for instance. Here's this is from the Forbes  Article first Kushner dabbled engaging in what amounted to a beta test using Trump merchandise  He says I got I called somebody I knew and I got a tutorial on how to use Facebook micro targeting

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Synced with Trump's blunt simple messaging the Trump campaign went from selling eight thousand dollars worth of hats a day to  generating revenue expanding the number of human billboards, but most importantly  Proving a concept then he spent  $160,000 for a series of low-tech policy videos of Trump talking straight into the camera got 74 million views  They actually had an organization in San Antonio with a hundred person data hub  Collecting information, but the best thing he did was he hired Cambridge Analytica to buy dark ads specifically targeting  People because it knew a lot about your Facebook interests and habits not nearly about your bet  But for instance if your worldview was grim they would show you  Ads that were kind of the world sucks and we're gonna make it better if you were an optimist  they'd show you a different kind of ad they micro targeted to your emotional tenor your personality and

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Very you want to feel like a violation of privacy of your own head. It's not Facebook that knows that it's a company that made you  Do these stupid quizzes that can then type you and and knows the true psychographics of where you are

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ineffective ads were killed in minutes successful one scaled the campaign was sending more than a hundred thousand uniquely tweaked ads to targeted voters  each day

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So  imagine this  Now right now this is  Pretty unsophisticated. I know it sounds super sophisticated but  imagining even more targeted more individualized and  happening faster because you have access to AI that can write parse people's emotions and do the savvy testing  Even faster and I mean that's the world we're gonna live in. That's the advertising world. We're gonna live in so I mean, maybe it's just  It'll be more of the same I mean you can't stop this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, and you know what? It'll be the next time the Democrats will use it because this is now known  And it's very effective and so I but I think what's important is that we understand what's going on here because this is  I think this is gonna be widely used and this is why I brought in the context of Nixon was the first people person to bring in ad  Executives and that was a revolution believe it or not 1968  To have ad execs creating your advertising it was very effective and  And Obama was very effective in fundraising in  2008 bringing in a whole data team people like Harper Reed and  And and very cleverly use this but this is this has been taken to the next level  Absolutely, so it really goes to a larger question not just in campaigns

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it really goes to a larger question not just in campaigns but about advertising ethically all around and what's known about well is this  unethical I  well, I mean  Yeah, it's creepy. It's creepy. I think that it's  I'll give you a scenario for for a lack of ethics in a second  But I think it goes back to also the Vance Packard and the hidden persuaders for that's right 50s  That's right. This idea that we were being  Sold things in ways we didn't know there was a lack of transparency about it was subliminal advertising  Well, this this this calls all those same  creep reflexes the way it could be but I told the story on the show before the guy on Facebook who  Talked with his family about symptoms. He was feeling and then suddenly an ad for multiple sclerosis came up  I mean, that's how he died. That's how he got the diagnosis. That's so weird  Now that case I would argue that's very helpful in that case  He didn't know what he had it found the signals and it was and it was and nobody was making money on that  Really the ad was there but you know, it was kind of another here to there  Whereas in this case, it's manipulative to the extreme  The real question just as when you go back to the hidden persuaders is how much are we being?  manipulated in ways  We don't know the lack of transparency if you know  It's it's a native advertising too  If you know it's an ad and you choose to pay attention to it or not, that's your that's your privilege  But to have things that are masquerading not as ads  But it's fun quizzes that are then used to to change your view of the world and elect a president  At some point there's nothing now Stacy's absolutely right even if you have a community that has an ethical statement around this  others will say damn me damn the ethics full speed ahead and use these techniques and  You know, I don't know what to do about it, but it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It bothers me. This is almost one of the reasons why I don't think fake news  This is much the the issue because if fake news locked on Facebook, you'd still be getting oh wouldn't have wouldn't have made it  Materials to be coming through Cambridge Analytica  Is a spin-off of a British consulting company and sometime defense contractor?  This is from McKenzie funks op-ed by the way, this is an op-ed piece in the New York Times  I don't I don't know if that has different standards for fact-checking Jeff or but it's on the opinion pages a  Spin, I don't know what that means. It's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  New York Times does work over these things with authors and I don't think they'd publish something they knew was false

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, so sometimes defense contracts are known for get this it's counterterrorism Psy Ops work in Afghanistan  They claim that they have psychological profiles of 230 million adult Americans 230  Million I should point out only about a hundred thirty million voted  So they have more only about 310 million. Yeah, they have they have more  Profiles than people voted they worked for the brexit campaign worked for crews in the primaries Trump hired them for the general  And Steve Bannon is a board member  So they have they claim as many as three to five thousand data points on each of us voting histories  demographics age income debt hobbies  Criminal histories purchase histories religious leanings health concerns gun ownerships. So here's a question Leo

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Here's a way to look at it if you have a right to get to your credit history  Because it can have an impact on your life  Should you have a right to get to this data?  Should it be transferred your data about you be transparent as an ethical standard or as a law?  And and you know how people use it what's done with it do you have the opportunity to correct it  This precedent is there when it comes to credit because there's a there's a there's a one-on-one  Affiliation is whether or not you're gonna get a mortgage  Well employers could use this data political campaigns can use this data  Creditors could use this data to look at your credit worthiness. There are companies out there that do that right now  Once should there be laws demanding transparency of this stuff it was also used according to this piece to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Suppress voting so not only can it be used to influence your vote  but according to Bloomberg the Trump campaign Senate as reminding certain selected black voters of  Hillary Clinton's infamous super predator line  It targeted Miami's little Haiti neighborhood with the messages about the Clinton Foundation's trouble in Haiti after the earthquake  So it can be used for voter suppression as well  I mean you get your I mean just like any ad you're trying to get somebody to do something  Sometimes it's to vote for your guy. Sometimes it's not to vote at all  But what's interesting is how effective it was the campaign spent much less than the than the Clinton campaign  And I would argue got a hell of a lot more

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For their money. Well, it also shows I mean if I were a TV  Network reading this I mean, I'm already stressed but now I'm even more stressed because it's  paying for your buck micro targeting looks better for getting something done, so  It's worse news for the media industry and those guys trying to scale  I would say I

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Would caution though before we freak out too much and I agree that transparency would be good  But we don't actually know how accurate this data is and I know that I go through and I click on things  Just to mess with algorithms because it's fun to see what happens  You know, it's fun to like do these little experiments and be like, oh, hey, let's try this  Oh now I'm getting served, you know this type of advertisement. So  It's possible that this panopticon  Has really blurry vision for lack of a better word

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I think you're being optimistic I  Think you're I think your stray signals don't overwhelm a much larger  Group of signals that you are unwittingly sending out all the time and I think if somebody is is  Determined to get your stuff and what is by the way unethical is the quiz thing, you know getting that information

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's putting up a quiz and saying hey  This is it for entertainment purposes and then using it to create a psychographic profile

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So so I I agree. I think you're smart to try to game the system a little bit Stacy, but you're gonna have to work harder  Right you're sending out you're sending out so much data smog  That  You know, I think you could you could try to mess with it all day long and it wouldn't make that much

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well in certain signals are going to I mean they're gonna figure out which signals correlate more highly and if you think about like your  Your camera, you know when you're reading something it can tell if you're getting emotional about it by looking at you know  The flush in your face and all of that then you're like, holy cow. Even if I click on something completely unrelated

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It'll know one one defense against this is knowing it's happening so that when you start seeing ads of a certain kind for instance  Times article the author posits well, you know if you're if they know you're a gun owner who is  Paranoid and concerned about the world. They're gonna send you a negative ad where you know  I mean they're gonna really target you based on emotional analysis as much as factual analysis. That's why and by the way  Facebook makes a lot of money on this. This is why Facebook had such a good quarter  You know why mobiles working so well for them is because all this time that's really what they've been doing in fact  I don't see it changing. They've been gathering information about you to be used in this  extraordinarily targeted way and the reason they call them dark posts and the reason most of us probably aren't even aware of this is  Because it's only seen by those highly targeted individuals. The rest of us will never see it  So I didn't see a lot of fake news in my Facebook feed and I certainly didn't see any of these posts  Probably because Cambridge Analytica knew full. Well, there was no point in wasting money on me. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Think this is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a brave new world and it doesn't just have to do with presidential elections. Obviously. No, no, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, right and I think as we go ahead

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I was gonna I was gonna say hey Jeff your idea about seeing this data and having access to it, but  every company is trying to gather these sorts of  Profiles on people and there might be using slightly different signals  But I don't it in the government has shown no interest so far in regulating or even looking at this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now if you're and if you got elected president using it I can pretty much guarantee you  That's a good system by the way on Monday we already did the interview but we're gonna air it on Monday on triangulation  We interviewed a mathematician Kathy O'Neill who wrote a book called weapons of math

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Destruction how big be my pick of the day really? Yeah good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'll let you talk about it that if you after you do your pick if people want to watch that interview that'll be on Monday's  Triangulation she was great. Do you know her?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know her but I read about the book from it popped up in my Twitter feed at some point  I was like this sounds amazing for a quant person who was like she was a de Shaw and she got yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She she got her eyes opened and joined the Occupy Wall Street movement like went completely opposite  Because she's a mathematician and she understands how math is being used  In some ways that are less than

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Highly detrimental to the people. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Silubrious, let's take a break come back with more this good good discussion find some let's find some  What did you want to talk about? Stacey? You had some stuff. It was a Facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was gonna talk about Intel, but I also went out Google's a AI paper because that's actually really interesting lip-reading kids

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But first  Let's talk to the geeks among us that's all of you I presume about rocket mortgage  There are people in your family people you may even be having Thanksgiving with tomorrow who like the way things used to be  and they they want to go through their papers and bring a stack of papers in a folder or maybe even like one of  Those big bankers boxes to the mortgage loan officer and he'll go through it all and he'll look at the pay  He'll have all the papers and he goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you were weren't you out here for an Intel thing, Stacy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you know I was yeah, I was out here for well IDF a while back the developers forum. That's what it was

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yes. So what is Intel up to this isn't stuff you learned at IDF. This is more recent

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, oh well, who knows what Intel's up to there  There are two stories here one was they did the roadmap for AI chips  Yeah, it was really important and we've talked about a lot of that before like when they bought Nirvana  Systems there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to say Intel is right now in a kind of a desperate situation where they were the chip maker to the world  the PC revolution happened thanks to Intel and  Now we're in a rapidly moving to a post PC era where Intel chips have no role armed  it's all arm chips made by companies like Qualcomm and and  Apple  and Samsung  So they need to reinvent themselves

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They do and they're also stuck  as things, you know AI is happening. They've got to figure out how to  Make their chip work for that basically in a nutshell Intel sold itself as a general-purpose computing powerhouse  but because of  battery power on one side and  a massive scale and putting like single monolithic apps in the cloud at massive scale  Special purpose computing is actually the win right now  So they're like a general purpose computing vendor in a special purpose computer and that includes IOT, of course  It does I mean it includes pretty much everything  Going forward. So I mean you look at like Google and its tensorflow processors as an example of this Facebook  Building a lot of their AI stuff on GPUs. So Intel  So that's the big macro thing so the next big hurdle for Intel after it flood mobile it was like holy cow  We've got to do something about AI and what they've done is actually they've embraced  heterogeneous compute, so they've got  They bought Nirvana systems, which  Actually is building out a cloud in a special processor that looks more like a graphics processor  Their original stuff is based on Nvidia's GPUs actually and they just modded the firmware  So  That's part of it and then they bought a company called Movidius for  Their computer vision at the edge and their AI kind of stuff at the edge  So they talked about that in a special they released some software and they kind of gave their roadmap for AI and it's built all on that  So that that was the one thing that Intel was doing and then the other thing that I don't I don't know if this is fake news  Or what but you know, there was a story in TechCrunch that Intel was laying off its wearables division  Yeah, I saw that I don't think that's fake news

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I was like, is it real Intel doesn't they're like denying it, but they're not really addressing it. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you wouldn't be fake news, but TechCrunch might have got it wrong

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Sorry fake news is not

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is not large enough to be you read that article about the two guys in the Newport Beach or wherever in Southern

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  California who used to work in a Mexican restaurant, but they couldn't make it up to the news  But they couldn't make any money doing that so they created one of the most popular fake news sites on the net and they're not  Political they just want to sell ads. They just they're making good money. They didn't want to in the New York Times article  They didn't talk about how much money they were making because they were afraid people would hit them up

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's ridiculous, it's good money that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think TechCrunch is in that business. I hope no no, it's it's unclear how accurate

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not a hundred percent sure how accurate this is but

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wearables is not the story. I don't think I think if if if go it's too early to know what wearable is gonna win  Whether it's a snapchat  goggle or virtual reality or augmented reality  Headset or a ring or a ear hat earpiece or that's not even important  What's important is the art is the I think the machine learning and AI behind it, right?  So they're smart to go in that direction. They are well and again wearables

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Depending on your wearable you really do need a specialized processor for each one because the battery life and because the form factor so small  so again

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But if you could do AI hardware people have always said this this is what Jeff Hawkins  went to work on he was the founder of  graffiti and created in palm and  He took all his money and he's sunk it into a company called new Menta, which is trying to make  Memory chips and eventually processor chips that work like the human brain does not as a not like a von Neumann device does but as a massively parallel  brain like processor and I think that that probably makes sense problem is silicon is so  You know fixed and immutable

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's why Intel bought into FPGAs with right you can reprogram them, right? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And eventually I guess they could program themselves

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Feels some next level is that what you want though? You would want a machine that gets smarter and as it gets smarter can improve its hardware  Continuously that's what you'd want

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or is that to sci-fi I feel like I'm picturing the Terminator like we position like  I'm like, oh my god, that's scary as all get out. It's not a brand new idea the original

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Artificial intelligence language created by John McCarthy of Lisp  Was designed to be a language for building artificial intelligence and one of its chief abilities  It's a kind of a meta language as it can cook it can create you can create new languages with Lisp and  You can use Lisp to write

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  New in effect new languages and it's about linguistics itself. Yeah, right. Yeah, but yeah, absolutely

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like I was a linguist, but I think the idea is  In software in fact, they even try to make Lisp machines  They made Lisp machines for a while makes sense to have that same kind of capability in hardware

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  well, so what Microsoft is built with their FPGAs and for Azure cloud is not quite it doesn't program itself  But you can actually they've created basically a networking stack or it  It's virtualized networking basically that will run any protocol you want  So you just basically tell it and it reconfigures itself as needed which is really powerful  and so it's not crazy to think I  Guess it's not crazy to think that you could redesign your silicon as needed in an FPGA but that field programmable

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gate array gate array field programmable implies to me that it's something that could be reprogrammed

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is it is reprogrammed so you you can reprieve I'm just thinking it's like a you know, it's a chip design effort  So it's not it's a soft chip  It's a soft chip, but it's still  It's a pretty esoteric set of skills  Which might make it great for computers. I don't know. I  Don't I'm not enough. I'm not enough of a computer programmer or not a computer chip designer to know if like how this works at that level

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you if Intel says well, we still want to be in the hardware business we still want to you know, I mean Intel's  Big asset right now is all those chip fabs those buildings, you know billion dollar to ten billion dollar factories designed to make chips  Which is something you just can't ever 3d print, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're already selling. I mean they have a foundry deal with a couple companies and they will make arm chips now  So they have that I think they're they also have a huge I mean they have huge software assets  In code base for you know, all of their x86 and the x86 license is nothing to scoff at they own that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's kind of like IBM owning its patents. It's like that's fine  It's kind of an annuity, but it doesn't build a long-term  No, I mean growth

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, but it's it's enough for  It's enough to give them a runway to play with and figure this out and they they're really like for a while there  I was really worried that they weren't gonna see this and accept it but

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  God this point somebody that chat room said Intel's turning into Yahoo, and I can't say I disagree with them. That's  That's what happens. That's what happens. Come on. This is where it's is the business cycle  You know nothing can especially in technology with the innovators dilemma and all that it's very difficult

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For a company the innovators dilemma was originally an Intel thing  I mean if you remember Intel used to make their own chip manufacturing machines, and then they were like  Oh, that is a loser business for us. We got it like they have adapted  I refuse to bet against Intel just yet because I do think Brian  Krasinich has recognized where they they are and is seeking ways to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To fix that of course and you know looks anybody who's smart  Knows and sees you know things changing. It's a little harder right now  At least it is for me to think of where the future lies for many for decades  We kind of knew wealth computers are getting smaller  You know, we're gonna have the they're gonna be always on always connected. They're gonna become portable ultimate  I mean we kind of knew where we were headed. I think that there is a pretty big question mark at this point about  I mean we know  We know machine learning and artificial intelligence will be applied as a thin veneer to existing technology  So I guess a new company could look at or an old company could look at a growth path that involves that  But it's often easier to do that for a new company that is for an older company

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is well an Intel's challenge is also that the ASPs on its chips  So the average selling price of its chips is incredibly high, right?  And  when you talk about chips for things that are you know selling for 50 or 200 dollars, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's look at the Raspberry Pi a $35 computer. Was it having it an arm chip has a Broadcom chip. Yep  Based on our we were talking in just a minutes ago on Windows weekly about Windows moving Microsoft moving to arm and Windows on

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, VMware goes there then it all is lost. There's a lot. Yeah, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a  Virtualization arm and there's a lot of conversation about Apple  abandoning  Intel and I think this is obviously Intel sees this coming  And turning to arm and it's eventually it is ultimately the death of the PC platform is that we're looking at

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  End of general-purpose computing, right?  So, yeah, sorry. I'm just gonna hammer that point home because I feel like a lot of people talk about it without

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Seeing the big picture, right? Well, you know why and I'll tell you why it's kind of the innovators dilemma for journalists  I I grew up with general-purpose desktop computers and I kind of like them  And a lot creating content. Yeah. Well a lot of us  Well, no, but I think we're wrong, but a lot of us kind of go they can't get rid of the Mac  They can't get rid of the PC. We can't we got a who's gonna write the software who's gonna design  To the to the Chromebook, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How can I not run my own apps? How can I not make my I freely admit that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Time is not on our side  I'm just being nostalgic at this point. Yeah Gramps  Yep  Grumpy Gramps. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like you're close to retirement it's all shut up I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Want to go another 30 years?  Well, what I'm hoping is that somebody who I think I still have a nimble enough mind to kind of embrace the new  Hotness and what I do bring to the table you young people is  enough  History and background to be a little cynical sometimes about the things like VR that everybody's jumping up and down  Over and say well, I'm I think that Emperor's not wearing any clothes  And by the way IOT is inevitable. I mean that's obvious  We've been saying for decades. I've been saying for decades what you're gonna see. I mean, this was another trend it was  Plainly obvious is the distribution of computing power. That's what the personal computer did in effect  It took the it took the mainframe computer and put it on your desk and then it's in your pocket  And then soon it's gonna be everywhere  it's gonna be your TV and your microwave and your toaster and your mouse and and and and  Of course the next step to that is  To is the is to have improved communication between them, which we're not very good at right now  and and unfortunately market forces  argue against because everybody wants their stuff siloed and that's why we've never had a good standard that everybody had  adopted and because everybody wanted to own their own thing and that's keeping that from going where it should go which is a  mesh of  interconnected  Self-aware intelligent  Items once you get that that's pretty powerful

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is I I'm kind of curious  so I feel like we're getting closer though actually with a  Usability standard for the Internet of Things and that would be voice and you see it with the evolution of the different voice platforms  Because I feel like at some level  All these fights over protocols can be  Aviated by running it through like an echo or a home or some other device that you talk to and  This kind of popped up in my head because I was like I was in my car which I can talk to and I was like  Dang it. I really want to talk to you know the echo in my car

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to know everybody wants to put a dot in their car or tap in their car

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I was I was thinking about that and I'm like, okay  So what we're gonna end up with isn't maybe a standard that everyone works with  It's gonna be some sort of hub for now that's controlled by one of the three vendors and  You know, we've we've kind of on this bet that it's gonna be the best AI and that'll be Google  but maybe it's the best ecosystem and that'll be Amazon and  I don't know what happens with Apple because they drop the ball in this whole ecosystem idea of things

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe it's the company that can buy the best Facebook targeted advertising  I  Mean  But that's what I'm saying is that the thing that really holds us back at this point. It's not security  It's not user adoption. It's none of the things that have in the past held us back. It's the the  Sad to say the intense desire of companies to silo everything and to keep everything in their own  Ecosystem and the reason you don't have an echo in the car  It's because no auto manufacturer will allow you to do that because Ford wants you to use its technology and or Android Auto  Well, it's same thing with Android Auto, right?  That's it's that seems to me a no-brainer that's what everybody wants  It doesn't matter what consumers want the company's Mercedes is over my dead body

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. It's not gonna be an actually Mercedes is adding Android Auto. Yeah, but watch how they add it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Seriously adding Alexa. Sorry. They are just adding the echo. Yeah, are they they announced it at CES last year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really? Yeah, where is that right last year, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't have a really running along moving along on that one. All right, I  Think I think people are scared of Amazon  They're scared of Jeff Bezos and I think a lot of companies that thought echo was a great platform now are going yeah  But all we're gonna do is give Jeff Bezos all our data and then he's just gonna take over the world

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know Apple's trying to do that with their home platform for the Internet of Things and that's and look how slowly that's evolving  Well, that's evolving because that's evolving slowly for a number of reasons  Not all of them are about a lot of them were technical at the first iteration

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would submit that ultimately the reason that it doesn't evolve is because everybody's scared of Apple

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know they don't know everybody wants to be with Apple but Apple's setting these weird rules and it's not clear how everything's gonna work  And Apple wants things to be more clear, but it's not clear because there's no standards and Apple

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's what it is and I'll tell you right now  It's the same reason Apple hasn't been able to get the TV companies to go along with its plans for Apple TV  Apple wants to own the data

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Apple's insistent on owning the data and they how much can Apple really and you know Apple can Apple get a broad swath of data  This is what I'm talking for everybody has slices of data based on certain behaviors you have  Who has the broad swath Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Amazon Facebook Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and Apple Apple uses as an excuse to that they want to own the data they want to protect their users privacy  So they don't trust anybody else to have the data  You know, maybe that's true or maybe they just want to have the data because that's where all the money is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's also it's also an easier customer relationship. So that's a big hitching point with home is  The companies who are building products that work with home kit Apple wants  You as the end user to be able to use that app for everything instead of having to deal with all these like a  Door lock app by a garage door app, but whatever doorbell app  It wants to show you everything in the home app. So your life is easier as a user  But if you're one of those partner companies, you're like no no  I want them in my app because I want to own that relationship with the customer. So it's not just it's not just about getting data  It's also because Apple does think about the user and if they're experienced to a crazy amount

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So here's an October article from fortune. Thank you chat room that said final testing is underway for  echo integration into Ford Motors by the end of this year the focus electric fusing energy and CMAX energy  All of these are electric cars will be able to communicate  See, this is not as interesting with smart home devices using Alexa  By pressing a voice recognition button on the steering wheel. I want to talk to the car  I don't want to I don't want to talk to my thermostat  So it's not so you can't say it doesn't sound like  It says vehicle owners will be able to send simple commands via echo to smart home appliances and systems  It doesn't sound like I'll be able to say manage your car echo. I want to listen to the top 100  records right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like streaming Spotify into your car. Yeah, I don't know and you know Amazon just this month like just this week  I think made it very easy. They released a like an SDK  For speakers, so if you were a lot of me sure you could actually put that in and create like an echo speaker

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well as consumers, we would all love it if everybody would adopt echo. I mean that would be a start anyway somebody

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But we learned that with trusting Apple remember with music and everything else  Like that kind of skip the industry is skittish and then Amazon and books. Good Lord  Good Lord good Lord Kindle and publishing right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah because as so there's a direct correlation between  The success of a company and a company's platform and its desire to take over the world  And and and and of course the soon as that as soon as that becomes apparent everybody says wait  Maybe we won't work with you after all that's that's why we how long we've been trying to connect all this stuff together forever  That's why we can't have nice things

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm a fan of open platforms that way no one company controls it everything everything works with everything else  That doesn't seem to be the future in any of this stuff open platforms

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do not guarantee interoperability and people are always like I'm a fan of open platforms, but I don't say it like that  Sorry  I do I do too. I think they're just the bomb but  It doesn't guarantee interoperability and that's actually what most people care about. No what? Yeah, of course

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We want one ring to rule them all  Right and no one actually nobody wants to give more door all that power

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade will be live-streamed on YouTube tomorrow in  360 degree video get your daydreams out your Google cardboard your galaxy gear VR's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can you can look my cardboard at home. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can probably make one with a newspaper and some glasses

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you don't have any VR capability there at all no, I don't think so

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can watch it love that well you can watch it from your browser, but you just don't get the surround  You have to move it around like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Verizon's doing this  With NBC Universal and Verizon's gonna place cameras in five locations along the parade route so you can follow your favorite balloon  Will there be a there should be a Trump balloon I  Think that'd be interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a joke about hot air here

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In the run-up to the actual event which is of course tomorrow 9 a.m. Eastern Macy's is also posting 360 degrees  Videos of behind-the-scenes studio tours wait a minute. Let's see  It's time for the parade this is the best PR welcome to Macy's studio

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now this is in a weird. This is where all of the magic begins  For he's looking he's looking over here you want to come see how it works  Let's go all around the ceiling for our models of balloons  Snoopy has actually had seven different designs Mickey Mouse's had five different designs of  Balls for the parade they all start out a lot of work into this we start with when your daughter loved this one of Spider-Man  Yes, and that shows us what is that shark doing in the corner when he's cut that's left shark. He finally got a job

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Finally yeah treasure chest

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that means doing a skull so we sculpt there's a cloud

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is not I was hoping this would be one where you could watch it in 2d and move around inside  But it doesn't look like it's done that way  4k 2 by the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There goes another gigabyte yeah now you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  why I've gone over the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, someone said it you can only watch like 88 hours of 4k TV. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can watch a lot more

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do have I have  Comcast consumer and that's the one that's gone past the limit because I also have Comcast business  Which has no limit and so what I'm trying now to do is move all my 4k stuff over to the Comcast business

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good plans

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is probably would not what yours forget. I said that I'm who me you're in it. No it is business for you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's business class. You're fine  So that's what they always say they're like if you consume too much you should be on a business line

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I pay for it. It's it's a lot of money. It's like 20. Yeah, what is it? I don't know. It's a ton  I think it's a hundred some between 100 and 200 a month

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's actually really I mean for naked and it's just for internet for naked internet  naked broadband

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm happy. It's a hundred megabit  I'm happy. I put servers on it. This is the main reason I have it is I have all my servers on it  So yeah, I don't have Sonic at home. They don't have fiber to my house. I'm sad. So Google is now reading lips and  It's doing so better  Than humans do is it Google is doing the lip reading. This is is this the same thing as their  Multilingual neural machine translation system called zero shot translation. I  Don't know. I saw the lip reading somewhere to mind. This is their mind. This is the neural network  Oh, this is the one words more  Sentency stuff, right? It allowed them to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do pairs that they ever did before and it teaches itself to some extent, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  so remember the scary scene and  2001 Space Odyssey  Where how 9000 reads Dave's lips  We're getting there Google DeepMind AI destroys human expert in lip reading competition  The the accuracy is real competition well  Or just a test. This is just a test the professional  Lip-reader. No, I don't think there's a lip reading competition  lip reading Olympics

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The victory the agony of the lips

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the professional human lip reader whom the researchers compared the results against had roughly ten years of experience in the field and  It deciphered videos for the royal wedding and in court for trials as well  The reader was given a sample of 200 videos from the set used to train WLS and the videos played for ten times longer  Than what they in other words they gave the human a huge advantage ten times longer than for the AI system  The human was able to decipher less than one quarter of the words in the sample  The Google mind could do half  For the human expert deciphered 12  This is a report from new scientist human expert just deciphered 12.4 percent of their words. The AI system got  46.8 percent

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now this got the words, but it didn't get the understanding you know, of course not through a new neural network  I'm just telling people who are like freaking out right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  right  So how how could know what you say, but not what it meant, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So actually that's really interesting because you could do translations  Like it could actually deliver words in other languages and then feed those words to somebody right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So look look this is the this is an example of the video. Can you understand what she's saying?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can't read those you can do the bad lip dub with this  I love that and here's the clip with subtitles provided by the AI  We have to look at whether it works for the UK or not. We have to look at whether  She's got an accent

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We have to do this with the bad the bad lip or what it doesn't matter if it has an accent

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  well, I guess it does I can tell what I'm looking at her that she's speaking in an accent because in that  Plum you or not. It's still not is the giveaway or not or not  hmm  AI shows the way says new scientist

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  mean it wasn't you know, it's not just random video they had to  you know get some special videos, etc, etc, but  the this the Google  Engineer thinks lip reading AI's are most likely to be using consumer devices to help them figure out what we're trying to say. Oh  Isn't that interesting to assist them  We believe machine lip readers have enormous practical potential with applications and improving hearing aids  Silent dictation in public spaces so you don't have to talk to Siri. You don't have to make a fool of yourself

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You could just lip it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Siri

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I feel like hold on  And a noisy don't actually hold on I'm gonna look something up because I feel like I saw an app that actually  Ava Ava can read your lips  Ava it was on product hunt. It is a  No, it's for hard of hearing people and I'm trying to think it does provides captions

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here, let's watch the video. This is the the promotional video for

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For Ava, I am NOT very different from anyone else

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm a pretty normal girl. I think I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Could be one of the neighbors. He's got a cochlear implant. Maybe we've run into each other

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So these are obviously like guessing what people say to each other when they are floating. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like when people make efforts to communicate with me  It really makes my husband say he did the wrong I am deaf

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But in distinct chatter she can't understand it can you pass me the gravy now she can  So I this is a long video so  Yeah, but  So Ava shows you what people say unless then a second easy communication, but does it read lips

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that that I was like wait, did I bring this up? Um, I  Don't think it read lips. I think it helps understands the sound and does speech recognition, huh? I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can't tell

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's see  My aunt and uncle are deaf. So I'm always interested in these really  I'm sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, so it does life captioning Oh  Live captioning. Okay. Well, it says life here, but yeah, I think that's the idea so it does captions  So it's it's obviously some sort of speech recognition  Okay, so not as exciting but imagine that for well, like right and and and that would get better and especially in a noisy environment  It would get better because it could also like  You can also do that. Well, that's very cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you could think about it this way ready?  Imagine it's on like it's part of your like doorbell cam, for example, and then you have  For someone to see the UPS guys swearing at you  Exactly, or you know, whatever some Girl Scout trying to sell you cookies  But just like when you start thinking about where you can put once it's in software you can put it anywhere  So, I don't know I get excited I  Just have my toe unfamiliar desk Oh Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Teela tequila was suspended for from Twitter for pro-nazi posts. So I got this question a lot in Europe

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just go back to Berlin. So is Teela tequila. I even  Know  What do you do about the requirements to get rid of hate speech for Facebook here I am

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Germany's done that very effectively have they not yeah. Yeah, but the but it's hot again because the whole fake news thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, didn't France do this whole thing?  Like you couldn't sell Nazi Mille de Béliot on eBay and that was a pain for a while. That was a very like, yeah  Jeremy to it goes beyond that now

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, yes, by the way  Museum where they told you you could take pictures of everything but not legally of Nazi memorabilia of Nazi symbols somebody said

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That it's unlikely that  the brexit  Trump kind of moved towards authoritarian populism. It would happen in Germany because  They've been through it already and they're kind of hypersensitive

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I gave a I gave a talk at the hub conference which is a  2000-person big tech conference that's in Berlin and it's just went up online by the way and  I  In it I argued that I said listen, we're gonna be busy for the next four years here. Stop defining yourself against America  We need your leadership  We need Europe and particularly Germany to be a leader not only in politically but also technologically  That's a controversial thing to say because it makes them uncomfortable makes a little hotter than they call  Because we've been leaders before oh they're really that sensitive to  And so it's a sensitive thing to say interesting. Um, there was a tweet. Oh, we're gonna find this. I gotta find this  So a guy named air  Nathaniel  tables  Staples tables said quote. Oh, I get it in World War three  Germany gets to save the rest of the world from fascists. That's a pretty solid third act

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was very good so Merkel is up for a re-election soon

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So she just announced that she was gonna do it again  Pull it out and I talked I talked to journalists and liberals who said I've never voted for the CDU before but I'm going to now  Because she running against a nationalist candidate. Well, there's the something called the alternative for Deutschland AFD  That's out there and they could get summer scared that she would lose summer scare that it's gonna turn into  America UK France and such  So it's kind of the last  stable sane  leadership  Western world damn near what's going on, you know, Australia. I mean Austria  Hungary France is  Go from Rila Penn we think there's royal Eans around as there are now and so yeah  It's a big topic discussion there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No worries me is after this I think Kanye might actually win in 2020. Yeah, I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In the White House in the White House, that's about I mean really it's about where we're headed. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The other thing in Germany just mention in Germany  was  Renewed talk, I don't think it'll go that far but renewed talk of trying to give Snowden  asylum he was called to testify before the  legislature and  They kind of demanded to be there  Well, the only way could be there is if they gave him some conditions as those talk again, the greens are going again  but it's it's it's  There's there's at least talk in some circles about trying to figure out what to do about Snowden and his vulnerability in Russia

Transcript:  Obama was talking with her spiegel when he was in  Was he was in Germany der spiegel asked if he was gonna pardon Snowden  President Obama said I can't pardon him. He hasn't gone before a court and presented himself. That's actually not true  Remember that Nixon was pardoned by President Ford  And had not been in front of a court  He goes on to say it's not something I would comment on at this point now Obama by the way  It was a former law professor. He knows perfectly well what he can and cannot do. So that's dodging the question  I think mr. Snowden raised some legitimate concerns how he did it was something that did not follow the community follow the procedures and practices of our  Intelligence community if everybody took the approach I make my I don't want to read this just makes me angry

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the acknowledgement that he raised important issues is that does that happen before from Obama? No, it's I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's come a little bit in the right direction on this  It's a trial blue  At this at the point at which mr  Snowden wants to present himself before the legal authorities and make his arguments or have his lawyers make his arguments  I think those issues come into play until that time  What I've tried to suggest both the American people but also to the world is that we have to balance this issue of privacy and security  Yeah, he's dodging the question basically yes is and and if Snowden what about  The way Obama has already  Pardoned three Iranian Americans who haven't stood trial. So this is this is just clearly like I'm not gonna answer that question, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

It  Requires backdoors it eliminates encryption in many cases. It's it would be it's a very bad model for what could happen here  And Madison Square Garden says hackers have spent a year harvesting  Visitor credit card data. I like how patient hackers have become  They they for I think was for five different events  Malware has been capturing payment card data from a system that processes payments. I'm sorry for five different properties not five different events  unauthorized access to the Madison Square Garden payment processing system and  Installation of a program that looked for pay payment card data as it was being routed through the system for authorization  So just a little snooper  Cards used to buy merchandise and food and drinks at these properties from November 9th of last year through October  24th of this year may have been affected  Did you buy a hot dog at Madison?

I have Solar City panels and a Tesla

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now is this do you have a zero electricity bill now? No because we did

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You did the least thing least purchase option or whatever power purchase  option which is they own the pay we didn't pay any money for the installation of the panels or the panels themselves and  And we agree to buy back electricity from from Solar City as opposed to from our power company at a guaranteed fixed rate over  20 years of 18 cents per kilowatt hour, which is  Considerably less than the top rate in California  And we were in tier 4 a lot of the time if we use more power than the panels produce  Then we'd go back to the utility but we start at tier 1 so it should still save us money  It's saved us. I think a considerable amount of money  And the idea being with nothing upfront  The savings is immediate  Right, right, and it makes me feel good. That's the main thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And if you drive a Tesla, it's nice because you're powering. Yeah, the Pete the local power company PG&E in California

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Will not let you put panels in that produce more electricity than you're currently consuming  So you can't do it like a profit deal  There's no there's no like solar mining which they should right if somebody wants to generate electricity let them

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They don't have they don't have the proper back and forth yet on the grids though to manage that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it has more to do with the fact that the business of PG&E is building power plants, right? Okay that too

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's always an issue with the with these guys. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They just say they have to go kicking and screaming and you know, they're kicking and screaming. That's all  Did you see that okay, so Samsung is the number one smartphone maker  But did you see that Apple gets 91% of all the smartphone profit worldwide?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's probably lower now than it used to I used to be like 95% so it's down

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think so. I'm gonna right now do something.

Well, I didn't choose that  Okay, so now has 94% of global smartphone profits back in November 2015, ah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's that's the one but see it takes a while to get all that information collated in

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  July of 2015  In July of 2015 it had 92% it's going up

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, no that would be so no 94 was a year ago at this time, okay  So then it went down so it's going down

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's still a pretty high number if 90 cents of every dollar in profit it's still pretty good

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's interesting is that Samsung despite the flop that was the first one to go down

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Despite the flop that was the note 7 is still the number one smartphone  maker  worldwide

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But didn't didn't Samsung like disable charging or something or so the newest thing is there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that happened to them already?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what she told me now. I don't know how accurate that is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  by the way, I  What I just said was me echoing what they're probably thinking but in fact that is not true  That the fact that it hasn't blown up yet means it won't  Because what we think on the battery what we think is the battery is too much battery for the space and you get  electroplating of the lithium over time and then at some point it it joins the layers together  Electrically and shorts so it is in fact a process that could happen over time  So in other words just because it hasn't caught on fire doesn't mean it won't I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

We did some Black Friday deals and  Like don't pay more than $40 for an Amazon Echo dot. I got the dot

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I paid 50 for the dot but I was happy with 50. That's what this is for Black Friday

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't pay more than $200 for like a nest thermostat. Don't pay more than I think it's 150 for the nest cam  The ring doorbell, which is a sponsor the show  Is I think $50 off nice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There is oh and if you like the Arlo's 350 for a pack of four is a Best Buy door buster. What is our lows?  Oh, you haven't seen them. They're cute. They're these little outdoor wireless cameras  With motion sensing and it's the neck here. It's the neck your camera. Uh-huh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hello, are they good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah  Yes, so I was really excited about all these battery powered cameras  Until the batteries ran out and I realized that I stuck like one of them I have a tree  Yeah, so you got to climb back up and get so that's what I like about the ring because it has a  Solar solar pan. Yeah, so I tried that in  It's all right. What's wrong? Does it not I did not want to stay connected to the Wi-Fi network very well

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, you can't put it out on the tree. I mean you can't put it too  You know what?  You need the Eero so that you can reach the Wi-Fi can reach out to the Arlo can reach out to the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, stick up. Yes, that was that was a challenge

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I have ordered the Google Wi-Fi hub and my I guess I I got mine

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Someone just did a test and said it was great. Yeah, you know who did the test?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somebody commissioned by Google. Oh, well, yeah. Oh, well, yeah  So, yeah, we think it's faster. I'm gonna do the test when I get it  And I'm gonna put in the same environment that Eero is  Because as I mentioned I have two networks and I could put them side by side and I will give you a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Test not paid for by Google. So I've got some really exciting gadgets coming  In the Wi-Fi world, so stay tuned. I can't wait  I've  Written about them before it's a different type of Wi-Fi. It's from plume  Plume yeah, yeah, and they're doing Wi-Fi as a service. So there's these tiny little hexagons you plug I ordered those as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are yours coming? Mm-hmm. I ordered the luma and the plume  And still no word, but I but I have the euro and I will be testing the Google December 9th. Mine Google's come  So this is you know, I think really this these are all of a category and probably will end up all being roughly the same

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't imagine that much of a difference. Oh and we didn't talk about Apple getting out of the router business

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In a timely fashion Oh  Throwing up its hands saying okay, that's it. Apple's getting out of every business except the iPhone ultimately, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I guess if it's losing the profit share, I mean it's sucking 3% fewer profits out of the industry

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's you know, it really feels like it's backing down on the Mac. They've they're really moving backwards on the Mac  it makes sense that they should get rid of their monitor business in their airport business because those accessories, you know are  Duplicated at a lower price by other companies  The Apple would have to do a mesh thing. They'd have to spend some energy doing that  so I think that they're really I think really what's happening is Apple's just narrowing its focus to the products that make it a  lot of money and then I  Presume investing heavily in something that's going to be the next big thing in my my opinion is it's augmented reality  Apple's settled Tim Cook sent a lot of signals. That's what this where he thinks the next big thing is  Not cars not TV not watches

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right Microsoft Microsoft was showing that off at hub  There's two things I saw at hub one was Microsoft showing off, you know an elevator repair man going and with my are which makes a lot  Of sense. That's it. That makes sense  The other the other thing by the way was HP was there showing their 3d printing  technology and a  They're gonna get to the point that 90% of the parts for a 3d printer will be made by the 3d printer  Wow, so you just to make the first one and the 90 seconds  That's really cool. Is that it's bootstrapping the printer. I like it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know HP it's interesting HP split into two this past year and HP Enterprise  Did not do great for the year, although Meg Whitman said they did it was pretty clear. The numbers weren't were rocking it  however  The HP ink which is the PC printer division did very well considering  So I thought that was interesting now. It's time for your picks of the week. Why don't you start Stacy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay. Well you you you mentioned mine. It's and I don't have the physical book because I'm not at home and it's on my Kindle

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll just be honest. So you really don't have the physical book. So show us your phone and say see it's on here  Here's the book I  Have the book I'll show the book just there it is  We interviewed Kathy O'Neill on Monday for airing next Monday

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tell us about the book weapons of math destruction and this is a book. So I have been obsessed with  How algorithms will shape people's lives in the future and for a time actually I thought about leaving like years ago  I thought about leaving Giga home and actually starting a project on my own doing this with a podcast  And I didn't because I was lazy. I was intimidating whatever but  Everything I was trying to do she actually did and she's a math. She's a former quant  Person at a hedge fund who was looking at how math was influencing people how algorithms were influencing how people were you know?  given merit pay and served in their community and  Even like dictating, you know police presence in their neighborhoods  And she realized that all of these things, you know  They had such influence and no one knew about it  It's kind of like how your credit score can be used in so many different ways that you might be unaware of right?  back in the day or these crazy micro targeted ads, so  The book is basically just her journey and talking about that and it's  Really eye-opening if you don't think about this already  So I really recommend it to anyone who wants to know more about this and lots of really good examples

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and her real complaint is that  We trust these opaque algorithms because it's math and we're often thought, you know  Well, if you don't trust the math, you must be a Luddite when in fact she's saying the math is wrong  The algorithms are opaque and so not auditable and we are basing a lot of policy on these  algorithms and  It's actually a real eye-opener. You highly recommend the book and our interview is Monday on triangulation with Kathy O'Neill  She's she was very impressive. We did not have enough time. I want to have her back and talk more  She's also started a data data journalism program at Columbia  And I wanted to spend more time talking about data journalism. I know that's something you talk a lot about  No, no, but it's but that's what this is all about and data journalism is gonna end up being about I think  Exposing some of these algorithms as much as I can't find it to right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There was a story that came by a study yesterday that that showed how often journalists misuse data. Yep  Oh, it has numbers in it. So we think it's okay and we miss right we're not good at numeracy and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think we're misusing it badly. Do you do you make your students read a mathematician reads the newspaper? I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Think one of the classes actually doesn't the business the business guy does that I think it's interesting. It's a good book

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, it's it's it's tough, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kathy Kathy worked on the I'm sure you'll know this program the lead  Program on data journalism. It's a joint effort of Columbia's School of Journalism and Department of Computer Science  And it's it's to give journalists the computational savvy to do this stuff, which is really

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I wish someone would do that in  UT

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You should you're a great journalist Stacey and you really have that that and enterprise spirit of digging into a story and I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Think we just don't know math. My stats is terrible. Yeah, I failed. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She started the lead program at Columbia. So this is definitely a book to read your number of the week

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mr. Charles, well, I guess I'll give you two of them  one of them is a  3d printer a minute ago my friend Bill Gross's 3d printer company, which is  The what is it called? What is it called new matter?  They have a Black Friday sale on I just saw this on my email come across. I got it for 299 because I crowdfunded  Normally 399, but it's going back to 299 on Black Friday. So you get the mod T, which is a really cool black printer  And then the other thing was have you gotten a $15 check from Facebook? No, I'm my getting one  Well, you might as part of the settlement that Facebook don't have to give them my actual address  Ill-fated  Advertising campaign. So I wonder who you remember that horrible ad  Structure that was called. Oh, I forget the name of it is in there  Where oh I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Endorsed stuff. I was I complained because they were using my image to do ads to my well

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You should be getting 15 bucks guys if you if you if you were used in those ads then you're supposed to get a 15-buck  settlement

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very good $15 Wow, yes, that might give me a sandwich down the road  I think hey, how much is the book? Hold on. Wait a minute. No, it's more than 15. No, it's 1585. There you go  Oh there  Use Facebook's filthy lucre to learn something about big data and how Facebook's abuse the Kindle version is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  1399 so you to keep a buck you go

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My pick of the week is a  Long-standing and I've mentioned it before to do program called any do a lot of people use it on iOS and Android  But the reason I'm very interested all of a sudden is it suddenly is integrated with Amazon's echo. I've always  Yes, I've always wanted to be able to manage my to-do list from the echo and you could but it was only the Alexa to-do  List and the Alexa shopping list. Well now that's integrated into any do it's not even an  Alexa task. It's just any do will support it  And so you can now use any of your any do lists  With your Amazon echo and remind yourself to do things and frankly that's to me the easiest way to do it because it's just I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right there and I can say it and do it you could also actually using if this and that send your echo  List to the Evernote. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could in the days when you can do stuff with if this than that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So did I need to correct that actually because I found out you it's still there you can actually make your

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can actually make your recipes you can you can even though they turned them all into applets

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're they're called applets now, but you actually can go back. I thought I did that. I'm sorry  So yes, you can still make your own recipes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that would be nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So because actually Kevin and I were playing with using the Google Home  To control more stuff through if this and that because there's a person a Google personal assistant channel on if this and that  So you can actually connect it to things that aren't actually connected. Okay to the home  Good, but there is like a one-second latency good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, if you don't want to create an if this than that script this just use any do it's free  There is a premium version, but the free version works perfectly well with the Amazon echo and I do like being able to say  you know add add forks to my shopping list or  Remind me to buy a Christmas present for a lease it in my you know, my reminders and to-do's and that's very useful. That's very useful  Ladies and gentlemen, the end of the show is nigh  But we thank you all for being here. Thanks to Stacey Higginbotham.
